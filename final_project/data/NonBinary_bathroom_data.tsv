Gender neutral bathroom drip ??		"Farmers tan gives me gender euphoria
I mean, regardless of the gender (or lack there of) of the bathroom, if it has a drip you should call a plumber

They’re vintage carhartts I found on depop!
thanks for your concern but I’m all good lol! Those are from years ago :-)
thanks, you got style
Glad to hear that =)! It just remembered me of the scars from my older sister. She wouldn't let me be there for her and constantly pushed me away... I wish I could have helped her more during that time but I wasn't the person who could help her. 

I also know how off putting it can be when people point out that you have scars but I also know they can be a sign of strength and past troubles you've conquered. So I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable. 

I do like the color combination of your cloth and they first you pretty well especially  with your blond short hair ^-^"	qtsqx8	NonBinary	2013	1.0	2021-11-14 15:58:34
Unisex European-style public bathrooms... maybe it could help stop bathroom-related transphobic harassment in America/Britain?		"Can I just say it is so awkward and simultaneously scary having gaps everywhere on us bathroom stalls. Especially the vertical space between the hinges.
It would probably help. But almost no American company is going to spend the pittance on extra material to fully close them in unless literally forced. The government probably wouldn't either. Because people only exist as vehicles for profit in this late-stage capitalist hellscape of a country.
I wondered why it never became popular as a potential solution!! It would even help other groups, such as physically disabled people who face bathroom harassment like I have in the past. I feel like a lot of people feel uneasy or downright unsafe due to the gaps, and when you're trans that's doubly so... I have seen that discomfort weaponized by cis women, on top of how unsafe male bathrooms can feel, and I think this could really help. It wouldn't solve ALL the transphobia of course but it would give people some peace of mind.
I do think you people should get those, just because it seems wild to me that the stalls on the left may be the norm anywhere. That said, UK toilets are like the ones on the right. The harassment has nothing to do with the fact that anyone may actually see you pee or any other actual material reason.
In 2019 I discovered that one of the libraries at UC Berkeley had remodeled all of its sex-segregated bathrooms into big integrated bathrooms with these European-style doors.  So there are some rare cases here!
It wouldn't matter simply because it's never been about that. Bathrooms could be just a long hallway of completely closed off luxury private estates, and they would stil pretend we're just lurking on the other side waiting to assault the first woman we see. As if no queer person has ever had to feer for their own life in a public restroom.
I would personally love this as an option, but I know it'll never happen because it requires sacrificing a small amount of money.

But, remember that Europe (specifically the UK) is having it's own resurgence in transphobia, so it wouldn't really help.  The bigots would still complain about us being in the bathroom in the first place.
The picture on the left is giving me anxiety. I'm so sorry you all live with that
The harassers aren't interested in fixing problems, they're interested in harassing trans people trying to pee for the heinous offense of existing.
Maybe it could stop it in Europe too. Britain has European stalls as well, and just as many unisex bathrooms as any continental country, which is unfortunately almost none.
When I visited Stockholm, most of the toilets were fully enclosed cubicles with a sink inside. As in like the picture on the right, except each toilet was its own fully walled-in room. The outside area was fully unisex. It seemed like the most rational use of space to me- you only have to have one room for toilets, and everyone gets a spacious private room to use. No need for a handicapped stall or baby changing facility- every room is accessible to everyone.
So this is something that has horrified torests in America for years, unrelated to any of this. I don't suspect it's going anywhere there because the US has various excuses for them like claiming if someone gets hurt or passes out they can get to them. This reasoning is related to the likely real reason they look like this: to make people afraid to do drugs in public stalls. When I saw this brought up last I asked about diabetics who have to be out all day needing a private space to take inseline or do blood measurements. I got the response that they wouldn't need to hide in a bathroom stall like a druggie. I didn't respond then but I think that's unfair. I'm pretty sure my mom has had to before as she definitely isn't comfortable just doing that in the open in front of people and I think most people wouldn't be super comfortable seeing it either.
What the hell is that picture on the left? I'm shooketh
This is what they had at the Slider Inn in Memphis (where they had the ""this, that, and the other..."" sign)
Here in Denver, they're called ""Red Rocks"" bathrooms, because theres a really nice one in the music venue park. Floor to ceiling stalls and real doors surrounding a central unisex sink area. No one really thinks about it.
What even is the point of having a door if i can see you up to your knees lol
In the UK, most places are more like the right-hand picture - sometimes a small gap at the bottom (which makes it easier to clean), but definitely no gaps at the sides.
I'm shocked how bathrooms look in US... There is no privacy at all. 

Is there reason bathrooms in US look like this?
Here in the US we gotta air out the stalls from all the McDonald’s and Taco Bell.
Bro it’s too often that I feel like people can see just below my knees in the restrooms
I mean I love me some privacy on the toilet, but I really don’t know where you got that that is European style. Like 80% of public bathrooms I use here have gaps large enough for a medium sized adult to wriggle through.
You expect America to take any advice from Europe after we declared independence, and after getting Europe out of two world wars?!? USA USA USA!!!

I meant the above very sarcastically, and I feel like bathrooms similar to the one on the right would be better for people in general. I just feel that there would be too many cases of people using unisex bathrooms as an excuse to hurt others since most Americans have a very, ""I get what I want"" mentality. Of course when I say this I mean the people who are okay banning book readings by cross dressers, and allowing grade school kids to have their genitals ""inspected"".
This is the first time I've seen the gaps actually visualised and I realise I've been imagining them all wrong. WHY ARE THE DOORS NOT FULL? I'm SHORT and even I could see over those doors!

Glad I live in a country where we have proper doors on our loos! Not so glad to have TERFs and neo nazis protesting in my country about something that doesn't damn well *matter* (in that everything they're saying is a lie and we're not using toilets to be predators).
So there’s more to the potential extra cost than just the material, sadly. My work recently moved to a brand new office renovated from the ground up and we converted one of the bathrooms into a multi-stall gender neutral washroom (the other bathroom is a huge accessible washroom). The original design had each bathroom stall being its own tiny room, but we ended up having to change that because of problems with the fire code. With floor to ceiling walls, each stall would have needed to its own sprinkler and a bunch of other really expensive plumbing and electrical considerations. 

Work needs to be done from codes up to make this a norm, and we need to start doing it.
Yeah it would definitely help but regardless that's how it should be in my opinion. I hate public restrooms. Weather it's just not wanting other people around or that time someones kid was crawling on the floor and came into my stall.
But how will we know what genitals you have if I can’t look at you while you’re shitting????? You’re clearly trying to groom children


/s
Plenty of bathroom related transphobic harassment on our side of the pond going on, that's independent from the height of the doors.
Unfortunately Britain is leading in transphobic hate. Good bathrooms aren’t a good barrier against fascism. But dear lord I would appreciate better bathrooms in the us
I'm honestly not sure if it would help much... Bigotry is rarely rational... Transphobes just hate the idea of trans people existing. They'll still harass anyone they think is trans even if there's full privacy in bathrooms. All the reasons they give about not wanting to see trans bodies in the bathroom are really just excuses. I've seen transphobes get angry about single person bathrooms being gender neutral because they just hate that we're allowed to exist. Maybe this would make it a bit easier for full stealth trans people to hide, but I can't imagine it helping the bigger issue...
We have plenty of the US style public bathrooms in Iceland, and somehow most of us still dont check what kinda genitals someone in a closed stall has.
To be fair, some bathrooms in EU are also like that, but I don't think there's a lot of them.
Can't there be split bathrooms and mixed bathrooms? I know some people aren't comfortable with mixed not because they are transphobic, but some people can be creeps
Japan had stalls like those pictured on the Europe side too. It was so much more comfortable there.
The whole thing is the US stalls were in part made to be able to see in. They made them that way too be able to see if someone was doing drugs
Don't even need to spend the money doing that. Just. Gender neutralize all restrooms
I think about this all the time when it comes to this issue: if we had actual stalls I truly think it would have made a difference at the start
Yes! Look up American Restroom Association. They’re doing great work with this. 
[https://americanrestroom.org/](https://americanrestroom.org/)
We have these in our uni and they work great, idk why noone makes these
I am starting to see places in the US switch to the doors on the right, fwiw. One of Houston's airports recently redid all its bathrooms that way, and it's not the only example I've seen.
Those stall gaps are the worst when you're working in the restaurant.  


Why? Because some little brat inevitably gets the brilliant idea to lock the door and crawl out the bottom resulting in the busser to crawl on her back and unlock the damn door for the irate customers.   


Also I bet those european stalls offer way better privacy.
it wouldn't really, because even if you had the most private possible stalls transphobes would still harrass you
it’s like this (the one on the right) in canada as well!
I mean, it would make me more comfortable to use the bathroom in complete solitude. Idk why we have such janky bathrooms in the US.
Check out the Kansas City International Airport virtual tour. It's one place but it's a step forward.
I would love it if our bathrooms were more like the European ones, but I don’t think suggesting changes like this will solve the issue. The problem is that it’s not actually about bathrooms. Cis-men can and do go into women’s restrooms to harass women without doing anything to change/disguise their gender. The bathroom thing is just an excuse to be transphobic. If it wasn’t this, they would find something else. There are tons of transphobes in Europe
Yes x1,000,000! In my mind this is the solution.
I'm in the uk and our stalls are also very much the same as the picture on the right. Since coming over to Canada to study i was shocked at how open the stalls are
Bruh once I used a bathroom at a race track and the gap was literally almost up to my knees 😭
UK public toilets are largely the same as in other western European countries. The problem is not the toilets, it's transphobes hating trans people and kicking up a fuss. More gender neutral toilets would be helpful, though.
The way that the example of a bathroom in the US is actually a pretty nice one by usual US standards 😂 Usually there’s a bigger vertical gap.
Oh, so that's what their bathrooms look like. No I would have thought those were storage closets if you had not told me.
As a disabled Brit I have never felt more exposed than when I encountered a 'handicapped' stall in the US. The fact that they are larger just means more panels with gaps in between them. In my experience Americans don't like them either but the powers that be aren't going to change them because privacy invites all sort of undesirable behaviour.
i don't think it'd stop the harassment, transphobes will always find a way, though it'd certainly make me feel better about having to go into men's bathrooms when i have no other option!
We have both in Australia. The one on the left is most common as a public bathroom. The ones on the right are often seen at privately owned venues, bars clubs etc.

I'm yet to see anyone peer over the top at me but then maybe I don't live in a degenerate town.

Worst I had was a three year old who peeked underneath it at me and the embarrassed mother chasing after 😂
I'm good with unisex bathrooms but since I'm used to the more open stalls we have in the U.S. those more closed stalls make me afraid someone might try to trap me inside if there was trouble. Maybe that sounds like an irrational fear but in childhood I did once have some people try to hold the door to the bathroom itself shut so I couldn't get out. ( I did get out very easily, don't worry. They failed lol)
I read a comment on Mastodon: „it‘s not about bathrooms. It wasn‘t about water fountains“
Seriously, spend a little more and make the doors full-length and ungendered. There’s an Italian restaurant near me that does this (in NY) and it was the best public bathroom experience I’ve had. There’s already “occupied” locks on planes/ trains/ buses, so no need to peek down at someone’s ankles to see if it’s free. As a trans guy/ genderflux person I am either afraid my stp will fall on the floor and be seen or peeing sitting down in the men’s and making a noise.
My university (England) has unisex bathrooms where each stall is like a separate mini room, no gaps or anything like that. Safe to say my little enby self was so pleased when I found this out 🥰
We also have the ones in the left at schools in the Netherlands
what exactly is the purpose? do they save money by not building whole doors, or something like that?
they're like that here in australia too and i've also always hated them! those european stalls look amazing and the thought of walking into a public restroom that looks like that actually makes me really excited - how sad is that 😅
Yes, of course capitalism would obviously get in the way. But it got in the way of disabled accessibility as well, and more and more as a wheelchair person I can access places thanks to activists who fought for it for years and years. I think we could fight for this as well. Trans people's peace of mind is more than worth it.
That's not actually the primary issue. The main issue is twofold: one, most designers are just unaware and stick to tradition because bathrooms are just incredibly basic (and thus their design is generally pretty unimaginative), and two, most state and municipal building codes are designed to require X many male and female stalls, so it's difficult to put in gender-neutral ones without taking up way too much floor space in ""extra"" restrooms.

Fix the building codes and educate the architects about the need for and existence of this kind of bathroom, and life will get much better for everyone.
As someone in the UK with these stalls… they do nothing. If people wanna peep they’ll climb (most of these don’t go all the way to the cieling) and peek or just wait outside your stall and harass you anyways
Same with a library at my university! (canada)
Jealous, cause I was only ever aware of a single unisex bathroom at my college and it was only in the newest building
Right.  It's not like any of this is about logic.  It's all pure bigoted horseshit.
Yeah.   
These are 2 seperate issues.   
I live in the EU, and luckily have public bathrooms with actual doors.   
The whole bathroom discussion is just a go-to tranphobe trope to make people feel unsafe about trans women being in the womens bathroom waving their massive dicks around and raping everyone.  Witch is ofcourse a thousand percent unfounded bullshit.  
Just let people use the bathroom please. Everyone needs to pee.
> Europe (specifically the UK)

Not anymore, technically :P
Wah in Estonia I always only use gender neutral bathrooms, they're not particularly hard to find in the places I go to - mostly just school and cafés/restaurants. Not for any progressive reason, they just take up less space. So sadly larger establishments still have them separate.
I suspect it's some Orwellian crap about being able to see the feet of the occupant and smell any smoke or whatever. Either that, or plain old stinginess.
Come visit us in Germany (: the stalls mostly aren't clean but yes, you can feel pretty safe. Only negative aspect I found so far: you shouldn't fall unconcious while locked in there. Most stalls have like 5-10cm spaces from the bottom tho, so that people would at least be able to see you're in distress.
Not everywhere in Europe. Here in Germany I mostly only see those American things
I 100% agree that people's peace of mind is worth it. I just... don't have a lot of hope if it actually happening considering the fact that not only have things stopped moving forward in a positive direction, but begun to actively regress.

I dunno. Sorry. It's been a rough week and maybe I'm just letting it get to me and make me needlessly negative. But when we're actively losing rights and progress in so many places, it feels foolish to hope that people are going to make any kind of positive concessions.
Trans and nonbinary people definitely, but other folks too.  


As someone who cleaned bathrooms as part of their college job, I found it nonsensical that changing tables were exclusively a women's room thing. All the single dads (or those fellows wanting to give their wife a break) had to change their toddler's diapers atop a toilet seat... creating an awful mess to clean up afterwards.  


We could also toss out those insipid urinals while we're at it.
As someone from the UK who lives in the USA, I had never made accidental eye contact in the mirror with someone washing their hands WHILE I WAS POOPING, until I moved to the land of half inch gaps down the sides of stall doors. 

These doors allow for privacy within the bounds of normal usage. USA stalls do not. 

Another fun fact, USA stall doors usually offer no way of indicating if the stall is occupied, so the usual method is just to press on the door and see if it opens. Lots of fun when the locks are almost universally shit
Europe =/= EU
Those are common in that form almost everywhere, even in America as far as I experienced it (several East Coast states). That's because it's just down to size and nothing else really.

I wish they'd come to the conclusion that making a unisex stalled bathroom saves you even more money than building two separate ones.
Ooh okay
So how *does* maintenance open one up if somebody falls unconscious or dies in there? Or does it just become a permanently ""Out of Order"" tomb?
In Japan they have the same stalls AND each toilet has a panic button that will bring a worker immediately to your stall. It's helpful if an old person falls down, though sometimes foreigners press them by mistake lol
💚 i feel this
God, I completelyyyy get that, it's okay to let yourself be upset. I'm in Canada but I know it's much, much worse in other places lately, including the US. 

Nobody in the 70s ever thought we would make it this far, and that wasn't that long ago. Bigots WANT us to be pessimistic and complacent. But statistics are also on our side -- in many countries, there are more openly LGBT-identifying people (especially Gen Z) than there have ever been. To the point where even dumb companies try their best to seem LGBT-friendly and get money out of us and even include us in ads/media... which can be cringy for sure and I absolutely despise capitalism, but it means *we are literally good press.* That's genuinely mind-boggling considering our past!! Not to mention how many cishet people casually have LGBT friends, relatives, acquaintances etc these days. The bigots are increasingly becoming an annoyingly loud minority. They are only targeting our youth because they are under the legal care of their bigoted parents and shouting about protecting kids can get you almost anything, but even then LOTS of cishet people are fighting back on our behalf. And of course we are too. Also, well... many of the bigots in power are old, and they won't live forever... they're falling off like flies as we speak.

Idk if reading this made things better or worse for you, and I'm kinda delirious from pain meds, but I'm sending lots of love your way <3
I feel this.

Maybe stupid, but I felt so wholeheartedly defeated at how few people were willing to abstain a certain videogame, and hos many got angry at the mere suggestion asking if they please could, and how many 'turned'. Made me feel like anything would be too much to ask.
I know, I was just trying to be funny. Guess I didn't succeed 🤷
My grandfather fought his final battle in the third stall. Every year we make a shrine in his honor out of candles and lemon pledge.
Lol, guess that depends on the location.. 😅
I think they do have some kind of tool to open up these stalls (most of them have a kinda lock from the outside as well for exactly those cases)
Lol, in German train toilets there's an emergency button as well. Have seen multiple people who thought they were flushing the toilet but accidentally pressed that emergency call.. 😅 🙈
“We are literally good press” — that’s a really powerful thought. 

I’ve dealt with a lot of transphobia this past week and have needed a perspective shift. That’s a fantastic way to look at the world that feels somewhat hopeless right now.
oh sorry! misinterpreted yr tone haha

New bathrooms at work		"At this point they could just say ""restroom""
I am no longer Non-Binary. You may now only refer to me as ""THE ALL GENDER""
People with no gender: “I’m shitting on the floor”
Generalized pooping station!
~ALL GENDER~ All one gender. The supreme gender. This is the way.
I think the word “restroom” is needed

Yay!\~ And... are they multi-person too? :o
At my work we only have about 13 people at our location so we don't have gendered restrooms. Too few people to make it ""worth it"" but nice.
We have vegan restaurant my boyfriend and I go to that has a genderless bathroom. Even before I came out it made me feel seen and happy. And before i even knew what non binary was, i was thrilled when i visited France that most the bathrooms i went to were shared bathrooms.
It’s nice and all 😅but how do you know it’s a bathroom
My work also has 'gender neutral' bathrooms now in their new office. But basically it's an alcove with about 8 private bathrooms (about 16-24 per floor). I finally feel comfortable going to a public bathroom because there's a) no gender on the door, and b) it's a private room. Love it
Oh this is just lovely. The last time I had to use the bathroom in public I almost had a breakdown because I didn’t know which one to use and felt uncomfortable taking the family bathroom from someone who may have needed it (luckily no one did tho)
What they mean is ""pangender only""
At my high school, we have “inclusive restrooms” which i think i prefer because some people don’t have a gender, and its easily accessible to disabled people :)
*agender people *
Luv it. Most restroom should just be all gender at this point.
Bathroom that just says ""please, use the bathroom, just go, who cares?  You don't have gendered bathrooms at home, so why do you need one here?""
😭
This is nice.
Pee room
Hell yeah
I think it’s good to specify “all gender” because otherwise you have confused, grumpy cishets going to the front desk like “excuse me where’s the *women’s* room?” Or “sorry, is that the *men’s* or the *women’s*?” And it’s like ma’am just go pee, wash your hands, and leave lmao
Watch cis people freak the fuck out trying to figure out if they're allowed in.

OTOH that's the trans experience I guess
I like the ones with like the man, the woman, and then like an alien or mermaid or something and it says ""whatever, just wash your hands""
*squirms uncomfortably*

Got dang it, I just have to pee...
Because there are sinks and toilets inside??
That's a good point.
But then there would be people like ""But that's different it's family. My husband sharing a bathroom is different from some random dude.""
meh i always feel like those ones are dehumanizing, like if you don’t fit into the gender binary then you must be an alien/myth
I really don’t like those unless they’re in a DND shop, because they come off pretty dehumanizing otherwise in my opinion. 

In a DND shop it makes sense, not in a normal building though.
Thats the most important part anyway
I hate those ones
Not every pee pee time is a poo poo time but every poo poo time is a pee pee time. 

I think you're good!
Lol stink is a good point, but I don’t think you’ll be able to see the toilets from outside the door 🤷🏻‍♀️
As someone who's transition goals is not far from ursula, I find it perfect!

But your perspective is certainly much closer to the actual intent :(
Yeah, it’s one of those “well… you tried?” Kinda ally moments tbh. Where they try to make it fun and quirky and it’s like please just stop trying to draw special attention to our existence and accommodating it, and just give us a place to pee. I honestly want non-binary accommodations that are as simple, mundane, and effective as the men/women signs on restrooms
Lol, sometimes I do feel like an alien."	v4183o	NonBinary	1694	1.0	2022-06-03 14:57:29
bathroom sign at my local coffee shop	this made me so happy, so i thought y’all would appreciate it	"Honestly just give us a sign that says 'shit here'
This doesn't feel supportive, but makes me feel like the butt of a joke. What's so hard about just a ""gender neutral"" restroom sign.
I get that maybe I'm being too cynical, but I can't see this without remembering countless transphobic jokes.  

 'I self identify as an apache helicopter."" ""I'm a ghost wolf turtle hybrid, respect my pronouns."" ""I'm assigned human at birth, but..."" 

I can't imagine being around whoever hung this up without them snarkily asking if they can transition into a Chinese person or saying ""I could care less how you want to dress, but I happen to think biology is real.""

This was hung on a single user bathroom with the intent for cis people to laugh at.
This is actually just a trap meant to obtain proof of Bigfoot's existence....
I'm my apartment blocks local cryptid,  i like this.
I also really don’t appreciate how awkward the shoulders look on the third figure. Dresses don’t make my shoulders look like that. My anxiety does.
Not great, but there were good intentions and its appreciated
personally hate these
bigfoot might be one of my favoritg genders

I hate these type of signs. well intentioned, but deeply cringey and unhelpful
It truly horrifies me how many people don't wash their hands...
i hate these signs lol it equates enbys to mythical creatures
This feels very passive agressive.
Ehhhh. I'm not fond of NBs being compared to mythical creatures like some sort of ""ooky kooky craaaaazy gender creatures!""
Very ""attack helicopter"" vibes and some people miss the point completely and go ""yeah but what if someone DOES identify as an attack helicopter? See, it's allyship!""

I'm not one to get easily offended at all, but I don't think the creator of this sign had actual love for nonbinary people in mind.
I feel like a message like “all welcome” or something would have felt better tone-wise. At the same time, I love my monsters and mythical beings (voidpunk is my thing) so I’m not necessarily opposed to the images haha
I think there's some controversy over how this could compare the validity of trans identities to cryptids, something that's not real and that can in turn be really invalidating. Some transphobes I've encountered do this, like comparing different genders to ""astrology"" or whatever. I know they meant this to be inclusive but I understand why people are getting bothered by it.
To me it feels a bit offensive. It sort of describes the behaviour of a lot of people that invalidate the non binary spectrum - at first it looks fine, almost like 'I don't understand, but I don't need to understand to be respectful', but then it feels like my identity is a joke to them. For sure you'd give a pair of bollocks if a bloody alien walked in through the door...
These signs always feel dehumanizing and othering to me
I can't say I'm a fan of the sign but I'm glad it made you happy
I've always found these signs cringe, and thats coming from someone with a bumper sticker that says I ❤️ BIGFOOT lol why can't they just use a sign that says ""Bathroom"" or ""Toilet""
Thank you. I hate it.
Sigh
I hate these
In some places it could work if there’s already a cryptid theme or something. Otherwise it just feels kinda weird and a little insulting. Would it be so hard for them to just put a sign that says “restroom” without any weird jokes?
Is it not that hard to get a sign that just says “restroom” without all that unnecessary stuff
I highly id as a goblin and I fucking hate these signs. If you really didn't care and weren't just virtue signaling you'd just mark them as restrooms or say which one has urinals if they're different.

No one gets to call me a cryptid but me
I hate these. Putting us next to sasquatch and a martian basically says we don't exist.
missingthepoint.gif
tbh this is not as inclusive as they think it is. This equates us non-binary people with cryptids and aliens.
Squatches and aliens welcome? Finally a bathroom that accurately matches my gender LOL
personally i love this! but i can see how it can come off as dehumanizing :(
Can't wait for Tucker Carlson to blow this out of proportion.
I don’t know about you, but I find it really fun and goofy. It’s also a nice change in pace from the usual gendered single stalls
Honestly I like the other creatures being there. To me it puts pressure off of it being a designated space for certain people, it seems more a designated space for just passing waste. Which is something all animals (including humans) need to do. I can also see these signs being popular at events where people cosplay.
Today I learned that Bigfoot is a nonbinary icon
Ye we had a similar sign at our school
The bathrooms were still gendered regardless
Personally i don't like my actual gender that exists being compared to things like bigfoot
It's a little bit silly, including the Sasquatch and the alien, but I suppose their hearts are in the right place.

I'd like it to be completely unremarkable that I'm enby. Someday maybe it will be.
this sign would be perfect if they just removed bigfoot and the alien
I love it. We can nitpick all we want about ""perfect representation"" but in the end, this is just a cute sign that makes it clear we're welcome in the restroom. 

Or are jokes not allowed anymore?
Its ok..could have been worse
Breaking news, my gender is bigfoot

I remember transphobe helicopter era jokes and I understand some people are really sensitive on this type joke. And It’s totally valid. 

BUT I fucking LOVE those silly sign , It nice to see a funny sign in a coffee shop. It’s not a school or an hospital. Toilette sign are usually jokes in bar and restaurant why the gender neutral bathroom should not have a silly, funny sign ?
this definitely seems like it’s meant to be offensive but jokes on them i am literally a cryptid. A Creature. a little Critter if you will.
I saw you can buy this sign on Amazon. It's called 'funny bathroom sign'. I almost bought one myself!
I Don't Like How The Three People On The Left Are Heavily Stylised, But Then The Bigfoot And The Alien Are Fairly Detailed, Just Kinda Looks Off Tbh.

god i hate neoliberals
cute but snarky
An up vote just for including big foot 😂
Cool sighn I won’t judge
I love this!!!
Just to let y’all know, this sign fits the vibes of the coffee shop completely. When you first enter, there is a werewolf halloween decoration that is Always on display just right there. They have an alien arcade machine smack in the middle of the coffee shop. They have a bunch of vintage board games, and they are always playing some show with some geeky/retro vibes or something in the back of the common area. I’m not 100% sure, but I think the coffee shop is also run by queer people. It’s a vibe, I love it.
This is the only bathroom I want to use-
These are always funny to me
i approve this (im the wall)
[removed]
yay :D
[removed]
That's outrageous! Deal.
I would prefer if the sign just said “Restroom”
  I can every so often drink a 4 cups of Robusta throughout the day
...right outside the bathroom, just like Gran used to do
The real LPT is always in the comments.
You’d definitely get some people trying to shit on the sign
Yeah I actually hate these signs tbh. Feels super condescending and misses the point.
Same

Ah yes i am the same as Bigfoot or a literal alien, thanks
Yeah… I get where you’re coming from. I didn’t see it that way at first, especially since the entrance to the coffee shop as a werewolf halloween decoration displayed 24/7 and the shop has a rather queer vibe, but I still see what you are saying. I’m sure whoever designed the sign didn’t think that much about it, they almost definitely meant it to be lighthearted. Although, no matter the original meaning, people still have their own interpretations. It does really suck to feel othered as a non-binary person, we have been the butt of many jokes, and that sucks. I personally kinda like the sign because it is goofy and dumb, and I really like cryptids. That, and it was really nice to see somewhere in my tiny ass half trump-supporter town had a gender neutral bathroom in a popular coffee shop.
I've always hated these signs too. The options are:
- man
- woman
- a weird half and half creature
- fictitious

This is the shit that groups reclaiming dehumanisation of minority groups (most well known is currently called Voidpunk) try to fight.

Edit: format
I don’t think you’re being too cynical, I hate companies who act like having gender neutral SINGLE USE bathrooms makes them progressive in any way. They’re just opportunistic IMO.
I think it’s kind of clever because of the inside joke. Plenty of fashionly creative NB people identify as Cryptids or Aliens. This sign doesn’t care about gender. Neither do most of us technically. It’s cynical in a funny way and it involves the desire for a good habit (washing your hands). I think an NB person made this sign. It’s too clever for a Cis person to understand.
Non-binary is when only half your body is crippled by anxiety
I say this every time, these types of signs only work at DND shops or tourist spots for mythical creature sightings. 

Everywhere else it makes me feel uncomfy and slightly othered.
It's not great, it's excellent.
Or their asses
I love these signs. They equate enbys to mythical creatures
Wait, we’re not?
yes and not supportive of non-binary, just treating us as something weird to grudgingly put up with
But what if I AM an ooky kooky craaaaazy gender creature?  😢
Yeah, I Mean I Feel Like It's Fine When Actual NBs Do It, And I'll Allow It When It's Tehir Friends Referring To A Specific Person, But When Binary Folks Just Do It For NB Folks In General It Definitely Comes Off As Atleast A Bit Offensive. Like In This Case It Kinda Feels Like Someone Said They Should Put A Marker For NB Folk On The Door And They Were Just Like ""Pfft, Yeah, And Let's Add One For Bigfoot And Aliens Too!"". While It Could've Been Made With Good Intentions, It Definitely Doesn't Feel Right, I'd Much Prefer If It Just Said ""Bathroom"".
personally i think the sign kinda fits the vibe of the coffee shop, bc that’s the coffee shops whole vibe. they have a werewolf statue in the entrance and played stranger things on a projector
While I'm Not The Biggest Fan Of It ~~Partially Just Because Of Aesthetic Issues~~, I'll Definitely Admit It's Better Than Gendered Single-Person Bathrooms, Those Are The Worst. Like Literally All Gendering Them Does Is Inconvenience People.
I think at an event like that this sign would be great. But at a coffee shop where people would look weirdly at someone in full cosplay bc they’re out of context, it just reminds me that if I present outside accepted norms for my AGAB people are going to look at me that weird way as if I’m in a silly costume.
As a fan of cryptids, I personally disagree, but I 100% get where you are coming from. If a cis person made this design, it would definitely be kinda uncomfy
Oh well thank the gods we’ve been “allowed” to shit
The problem with this joke, is it treads the line between ‘laughing with’ and ‘laughing at,’ mostly because it’s unclear who’s making the joke. And cis people reading the sign and laughing at it turns it into cis people laughing at the concept of other genders as absurd myths.
“Divergent opinion detected”? Nah people just think what you said was shit. When people downvote you that doesn’t mean you’re some sort of edgy rebel going against the system, it usually just means people think you’re being an ass.

There’s also a difference between when enbies use xenogenders or joke about being eldritch creatures, and when cis people eqate being nonbinary to fictional creatures like bigfoot. This is just the attack helicopter joke rebranded.
Imagine victim blaming people for being reasonably upset at something. Grow up.
I definitely understand that. In my own opinion, it's just too much like the transphobic ""I identify as ___"" jokes.
Hi there, non binary person who you could say identifies with the cryptid/alien enby culture here. This sign is just an “attack helicopter” joke.
though it’s not a dnd shop, it has the vibes of one. this sign is definitely not out of place. immediately in the entrance is a werewolf halloween decoration that is there 24/7, they have an arcade machine in the middle of the common area with at least one alien themed game, and are always playing some slightly geeky show on a projector near the back of the common room, yesterday they were playing the batman cartoon.
Not really. It’s equating nonbinary people to imaginary things like bigfoot. It’s basically the attack helicopter joke all over again
*horrified expression*
I mean some people identify with mythical or eldritch creatures or the void and that's completely valid and I understand it's a common theme enough to be a meme some of the time, but when someone is complaining about ""non-binary"" as a whole being equated to non humans, it's clear that no it's not something that applies to all of us and you shouldn't repeat the same thing they said they hate. I'm very much a ""just a person"" type of non-binary and it's exhausting when random people (including other non-binary people) think I'm cool with dehumanization because of stereotypes
I was gonna say the same 😂
Ayyy!
True! Zero need to gender a single stall bathroom. 
Also, I personally like the aesthetic, but I completely understand if you don’t. Everyone has their own aesthetic and that’s part of the reason why I love the nonbinary community so much, because everyone is so different, yet accepting.
honestly, if you came into this coffee shop in full cosplay, people would probably just compliment it if anything. it’s very vibey
[removed]
[removed]
Oh do you personally know the person who made this sign? Please tell me about their history of hateful background. Please site your sources if you’re going to insist something as fact rather than single sided speculation. Also where is this helicopter you speak of in the above image?
Bigfoot is real
Yeah I get that, I was just trying to make a quick funny ha-ha. If I said something that was dehumanizing in anyway though I apologize
Tbh As Someone Who (Kinda) *Does* Identify With Myhtical Creatures I Don't Like This, Like I Can Say I'm An Eldritch Horror Or Somethin', An' Am Cool With My Friends Doing It, But Don't Want Some Random I Ain't Never Met Doin' It, That Just Feels Weird And Assumptive.
I may or may not describe my gender to my friends like this...
Well The Main Problem I Have With It Isn't Any Particular Aesthetic, But Rather That The Bigfoot And Alien Are Depicted In A Completely Different Style From The 3 People, It Just Makes Them Look Out Of Place. (If You Can Find My Other Comment, I Gave Like 2 More Words Of Detail About That Lol.)
Maybe you’re right. I hope so. And I hope a non-binary person was at least consulted before designing this sign. 

But also nobody is campaigning in force against these signs, and most aren’t getting aggressively offended or anything. But when they’re posted in a sub like this the overwhelming response is ‘yeah I don’t prefer it.’ Maybe that should be a clue that there’s probably a better way of de-gendering bathrooms.
Exactly! Beautifully put.
Did you not read what I said? I specifically wrote “usually” because there are fucked up communities like that.

And no I’m not fucking intolerant of you enjoying a joke because I and most other people here find it dehumanizing. That’s not what intolerance is. You’re being an asshole here and that’s why you’re getting downvoted, again.

Also nice touch with the “are you insane?” totally not an over reaction or ableist on your part.

Edit: Oh, no wonder you responded the way you did. Hardly surprised you’re a truscum.
Oh, you’re right. I should have said “intentionally or unintentionally.”
Are you being sarcastic or serious? I’m very bad at sarcasm irl, not to mention online.
Off topic question, but why are the first letters of every word in caps?
I just say I'm a whatever.
Absolutely, the consensus in this comment section does seem to be that while it's not wildly offensive, most people aren't super comfortable with it.  That should definitely be taken into account!  

I guess all I'm trying to express is that I think we have to be happy with any attempts at inclusion we're getting.  Honestly, I *am* happy about every attempt, no matter how poorly executed or poorly intentioned it is.  Progress is slow, but it's being made.  I feel like all we can do is appreciate every little bit of progress and inclusion as we wait for change to take its time, as it does.

In my ideal world, the norm is to have a single gender-neutral bathroom setup, in which each stall has actual ceiling to floor walls & an actual door.  Y'know, *privacy*.  My ideal world is a long ways away.  What I want in the meantime is for people to understand that I'm going to pick one of those binary-gendered restrooms, I'm going to pee in it, and everyone will leave me alone about it and not make it weird.
What’s your authority on the subject? How does it pertain to you?
Check his profile. Probably a sockpuppet account just to write dumb stuff against the ""libs"".
[removed]
Good Question. I'll Be Sure To Let You Know If I Figure It Out.
I agree about how bathrooms should be designed. I want privacy from others regardless of their gender, lol. 

But also I’m not going to just ‘be happy with whatever I get,’ especially if they’re not well intentioned. Begrudging and half-assed inclusion isn’t inclusion, and if we act happy with it that’s all we’ll ever get. Raising the bar and holding people accountable when they’re off-base is the real road to inclusion. If I get labeled as nit-picky and sensitive that’s not on me.
What’s yours? You make broad interpretive statements about the sign maker’s intent in your comment as well. However, people seem to disagree with you. As do I.
I checked too. Definitely a disingenuous account
Okay then…

On the other hand, you look real cool ~
gods why are you so cool omg
The freckles are flawless 🥺🥺
My work doesn't have any gender neutral bathrooms - thankfully I work from home 3 days a week 😔
OMG you are hair goals!
Love the hair
Yuuuup I feel like an idiot but at this point I'm ready to throw hands with some of my coworkers. I don't care if customers misgender me they're strangers. But my coworkers?? I see them more than any of the people I love, my support group that I worked so hard to build. I'm 27 and I've worked really hard to keep good people around me. I've been super depressed about this and working wayyyy too much. Still not financially secure either >:/
I wish

Most of my work is outdoors, so its not really possible

But good for you that you can do that \^.\^
You just have a precious face
my mother’s house but same
I’m sorry you have to go through that :( 

Personally I think there should be courses on gender and sexuality. (they’d fit right in with sexual harassment) Coworkers and employees will start the progress on correcting the stereotypical gendered greetings and phrases by replacing he/him and she/her to they/them. This would be a very useful tool for people working in communication as they talk to people frequently.

I wish people would at least try to use my pronouns. And if it’s too hard then use my name 💀 like bruh
If I could get away with it I’d wear a sign as a hat XD
Nope. I try not let peoples opinions get to me.

They don’t know me and are just picking a noun they see best fit at the time present.

Now those that do know you and still misgender you they can go suck a lemon.
Yeah. I go back and forth on when I wear my pronoun pin, some days I think it's not worth the hassle and I get misgendered as expected, but when I wear it it feels like I get misgendered more often. It's never outrightly malicious, but I think the intent is there clearly enough. So I try not to interact with customers often.
i'm sorry that happened to you :( also i gotta say, i LOVE your hair and your whole look! you're giving off some peak anime protag vibes /pos
To the point where I quit trying
Your very cool

My liege, how do you style that cotton candy mane of yours. It looks sick
The bathroom is a great place to have a breakdown ask how I know 😅😭
I started my friday off last week being misgendered as my boss told everyone I was promoted. Very much a mix of emotions, and yes, I did go hide for a while to get over it afterwards.
[deleted]
I use the family bathrooms or unisex
yee (they/she)
Literally did that today

VRO YOU LOOK SO COOL, WHAT?!
I would but can't :(
I have my pronouns written on my apron and I still get misgendered all fucking day 😤 I feel you 😮‍💨
You look incredible
Lmao I’m doing this right now
ugh yes. would just sit there in the handicapped single stall restroom for a long time sometimes since nobody would check... (they/she on our end)

glad I don't work there anymore.
Supeeeer off topic but you are so fucking beautiful. Like you legit look like a video game character that I spent an hour and a half customizing.
You look like an anime character and I am loving it, love your hair and makeup :)
Yes, yes I have
in my last full-time job - definitely. i'm out in school so i don't get misgendered much (fortunately!) and in my current part-time job i don't have a toilet to hide in lol

yes, at school literally no one (not an exxageration) genders me correctly
Yup…
Same here 🙃 I’m sorry you have to go through that. Hopefully it’ll get better one day 💛🤍💜🖤
Thank you 😂
I huff dust
thanks it's a filter 😅
Same! My partner helps too, corrects ppl at work A LOT.
Thank you! 😊
Thank you!
It's a constant struggle for sure 💀
Oh shit, hope the weather doesn't treat ya too bad!
I think you meant indescribably horrifying 😎
Oof I'm sorry, thank god for queer internet communities amirite?
Honestly yeah, that's such a good idea! Shame they probably won't do it most places, but more inclusive places might! At one of my old jobs they were very good about it and we had several other trans coworkers, it was nice!
I had the training through a school I worked at and it was already so outdated that going through it was a massive cringe-fest.
They won't let me have a pin or anything, not even on my hat 😔
It's face tattoos or bust
Ugh! For sure. At my last job whenever I had my pronoun pin, I had customers reeeeaaally stressing that ""ma'am"" out on purpose and I wanted to strangle them.
my look is black t shirt for work but thank you 😂 when I'm home i definitely feel much more like myself 💀
Sometimes I pretend that every time someone says ""ma'am"" they're saying ""man"" and stuff, but god it's really hard to keep a positive outlook with shit like this
Aww thank you
🍪🍪🍪 cookies!! 🍪🍪🍪
I don't know, I have to wear gloves and put my hands in lots of stuff, but jewelry is a great idea, thank you! I may just start wearing my pronoun earrings every day 😅
thank you, perfection is a scam but I'm glad it hurts to look at me! ❤
you can fight me for it

I'm gonna be honest I just shake my head a bit and it stays pretty fluffy 😅 I'm too scared of frying it to properly style it with heat tools or anything lol
Ikr? It's sad the amount of times I've cried in work bathrooms but they really are the perfect place
Wow! That really sucks, I would ask for a promotion name tag or something and put pronouns by your name if possible! I also started recently talking and joking about being trans more often and surprisingly, at least one coworker started trying her best to use my proper pronouns after that. I hope it gets better for you! 💜
Yes 😂 I'm v proud of it
Oooh i wish we had a family bathroom those are great for hiding lol

It is nice to get away for a minute, i usually get on reddit lol

It's okay it was leftover from the day before lol

That's super annoying, but at least you're representing yourself with the correct pronouns and no amount of misgendering will change who you are! ✊ fuck those transphobes
Aww thanks

Oof! Yeah
I'm secretly just a skyrim npc
Haha thank you

Aww damn, at least school sounds better!

Aww thank you
It's a single bathroom, so if you found me I'd probably scream
Thank you 😆

Why is it so hard to correct people 😅
Precisely!
thank god for online queer communities (and also my dad’s house)
That’s nice to hear 😔
Oooof i bet
For pronoun use?
I get a lot of ""thanks man"" and ""thanks bro you're the man"" and it's never outright mean but it feels very pointed
“I don’t mind the gay but this more than 2 genders is nonsense” or “File says your a man so that’s what I’m calling you”

Transphobes love to complain about trans and nonbinary folks getting ""offended"" when they get misgendered, but I've had so many transphobes get super offended when I correct them on my pronouns. I work in retail so I have to do it a lot, one customer just angrily said ""not my fault"", like what kind of a response is that??? Love when my coworkers correct customers on my pronouns for me because sometimes I just can't deal with people 👋
yeah my dad’s real chill and it keeps me sane
Damn. 😶
Can't go back to prison not after the *incident*
The dust store. Ask for bub.
Whom'st the fuck is that
i've had a manager, after trying to explain to them my they/them pronouns, that it's ""discrimination"" and ""disrespectful"" to be called what i prefer... :|
Wow! Yeah that's rough to deal with. I'm glad your coworkers have your back! I've been thinking about just misgendering back every cis person that misgenders me, then see how offended they get.
<33
Ask Bub for pixie dust, not the kind the angels make.
http://lgnavigators.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/5/2/58521739/his_dark_materials_omnibus.pdf
Wow! That's insane. I would for sure start misgendering that manager and flip those tables on them cause that's hugely inappropriate. Like yeah it's what you prefer, it's also *who* you are and they're not respecting your whole ass identity by saying things like that. That also does sound bad enough to report if you're interested in that.

i fucking hate people	so i work at spencer’s right, and this older couple comes up to me asking if we have any small rainbow flags. i tell them no, sadly we only have small non-binary flags left. the man asks what non-binary is, so i explain, and in response he laughs in my fucking face??? keep in mind, i’m wearing a non-binary flag beanie, i have a non-binary pin, AND my pronouns on my lanyard. im already having a horrible day, it’s shipment day and it’s been fucking packed all day and this is the biggest shipment we’ve ever had. that remark genuinely set me over the edge and now i’m in the bathroom crying lol	"When I was young being gay or lesbian was offensive to the straight people.  Now there is a month of pride.  You exposed them to something new.  Sometimes a person's reaction is to laugh at things they don't understand.  You were brave.  What they do with this new knowledge is on them.  Thank you for teaching the Cis people.  Be you!
Im so sorry to hear that. I was at hot topic ( as a masc presenting NB) shopping for new clothes for fem stuff for  school. These people,  very clearly in there 50s, starts to destroy a fellow NB. Understandingy, I rushed over to help them. I hope they are doing well.
Ugh, that sucks. I used to work at an ice cream place, where I mostly sold sugar to cranky Floridians on vacation. Can't tell you the number of times crusty old Republicans would intentionally misgender me because I was...AFAB and had short hair. A person just existing was enough to set them off. Somedays I could give as good as I got, and others were like ""oh, this part of why LGBTQIA suicides are high"". 

When I have rough gender days, which thankfully is pretty infrequent lately, I watch an episode of something like Owl House or Schitt's Creek. Stuff where homophobia and transphobia just don't exist. Or I'll look up YouTube videos of Alok Vaid-Menon or Jonathan Van Ness. People who make me hopeful about the future while validating some of m6 current struggles.
fuck im so sorry that happened, people are dumbasses
I think its so cool you have your pronouns on your lanyard! After seeing half a dozen or so people doing this I finally very recently started putting my pronouns on my name tag. I'm pretty socially anxious so I knever told any of those inspirational people what seeing their pronouns meant to me. I bet you make nonbinary people who come into your store and see you feel awesome.
UGH I’m sorry people really suck sometimes. That’s just awful and you didn’t deserve that in any way :(((
I’m so sorry about that happening to you :/ slightly off topic tho, do you like working at Spencer’s?
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened people are so shitty.
Why can’t people just be respectful and not laugh at someone’s identity in their face??
It takes some skill to be that guy. I'm impressed. I take it he came up to you on all fours? After all, there's no way something with that small a brain could do the calculations to balance on two feet.
Man go follow there car and go throw a eggs at there house and dip
I had a similar experience at my job. I wear my pronouns at work and a young girl talked to her grandad about how cool and brave it was. He then came over and asked me about it and I politely explained and he made an attack helicopter joke.

My manager came over in case he needed to defend me and calm me down. Girl was telling her grandad off while I stood there calmly with eyes like ice. He went ""see she doesn't mind"". To which my response was ""they do, but I've heard all the jokes and have no energy to entertain it today"". I sent him into his film, thanked his granddaughter for being an ally and got on with my day.

The people that don't want to understand will either lose family or die off soon anyway. All we have to do is wait.
I’m sorry love, you’re very valid❤️
WHO let the bigots into that hot topic 😡😡😡 exit our sanctuary IMMEDIATELY
Sorry
I also hate these people but it's really cool that you work at spencer's
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Customers can be real shitheels.
That sucks im sorry
i am so sorry to hear this. people are delusional and rude!
same thing happened to me when i posted something with my avatar on r/gocommitdie, needless to say the people in the comments constantly shit on me because of my pride flag
That would press my defiant little buttons. Mm, makes me wanna chew that guy out.
It shouldn't be your responsibility to teach the straights when Wikipedia and Google are free, but you did. Their reaction says infinitely more about them than you
Oh my god. I'm so sorry. People are so insensitive and fucking rude. I don't understand why people can't just respect others. Even if they don't understand. Even if it doesn't make sense to them at the moment, there's no fucking reason to laugh when you're learning about an identity you don't relate to. You are valid, I'm sorry you went through this.
Bruh wtf. Who in the world would life at you like that?!
This may not be the case, however it could be that when he laughed he was laughing in pleasant surprise, like a celebration. Sometimes when I encounter something unexpected I laugh, not to be mean but to express gratitude and appreciation for life. In some situations it may not seem ""appropriate,"" however that tends to be an perspective held by people who don't often find reasons to laugh. 

To be clear, I am not dismissing your feelings or perspective. I don't have a way of confirming the spirit in which he laughed, and not everyone laughs in surprise. It could very well be that he thought the idea of gender non-conformity amusing rather than something worthy of respect. I'm simply offering another potential perspective.
Hope your feeling better OP <3 <3 <3
Sounds like a rough day. I hope everything turns around for you
Working retail is the fucking worst.
Yeah that shit pisses me off when peo do that especially my parent, like my dad will go on full rants about it and my mother will make snippy comm about it making it less easy to come out.
Assholes gonna be assholes!
I mean doesn't that qualify as becoming baligrant or rude can't you at this point I don't know redirect the customer out of the store and tell them they are no longer welcome.
You hate some people. Me too
Not to defend their behavior too much, but maybe the way you explained nonbinary was wrong in the context. Idk, I definitely see that different explanations are necessary for different people. If you went with some ""people who don't identify with being a man or a woman"" or ""outside the gender binary"" can simply be too vague for someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. It's like the explaining evolution 200 years ago and people going ""I didn't come from monkeys"".
What a douche, why’s he laughing when he’s the dipshit who not only doesn’t know what that is, but knows so little that he’s surprised to see a non cis person working in a place like Spencer’s (dunno what it’s like at your store but it was known as a place trans, gnc, and non cishet folks in general were when I was growing up). I think ppl like that are currently over-compensating with even more blatant mocking and assholery towards us because underneath the bravado they’re realizing they’re wrong.
pronouns on a lanyard 🗿
thank you 🥹🥹 that honestly makes me feel a whole lot better about it. in retrospect i was overreacting a bit but stressful days will do that to you
When I was young we were still getting pistol whipped to death for being gay.

All-in-all, we’ve come pretty far… Just gotta get the rest of the way. Now is not the time to lose hope or focus.
omg that’s horrible!! i hope they’re doing well too :(
Wtf what happened?
destroy them? Like yell at them or physically hurt them?! wtf?!
Literally Owl House is how I coped through dysphoria today it’s amazing
OMFG soOO many ppl here in florida always emphasizes to call me ""ma'am"" way more as of recent after NB became more well known, a lot of it had to do with me cross dressing, it's honestly annoying
that’s a great idea :) i’ll try that right now 

no but fr i worked in food service before and i wish so badly it was legal to spit in stupid peoples food
The intentional misgendering is so fucking dumb. When I was a cashier a guy saw my pronoun pin and kept looking me straight in the eyes and saying ""ma'am"" in this dramatic tone after every sentence. 🙄🙄🙄

JVN is one of my comfort people as well. 🥰 She's so beautiful and has such a healing energy. I'm so thankful they're a public figure because he helped me come out to myself 😭
I also find that lgbtq inclusive and positive media help balance out the unpleasantness. 

I'd add The Penumbra Podcast and Dimension 20 to the list.
i will cry rn omg that is the best thing to hear. it’s so scary being as out as i am but the fact that i can inspire people like you make it worth it, i hope nobody gives you shit! you’re awesome
yes i do!! most people are very nice and have great vibes. 

all my coworkers are in some way alternative and LGBT+ and so am i, so even though i haven’t worked there as long as everyone else they accepted me with open arms. i’m pretty close with most of my coworkers already. 

plus everyday you leave you have a new crazy story to tell LOL. like we have a guy who comes in every single sunday to buy a pocket 🐱. we found out after he denied toy cleaner everytime that he USES A NEW ONE 5 TIMES A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK AND HE BUYS A NEW ONE EACH WEEK BC THEY END UP DESTROYED.
it’s a party for sure.
LMAOOO
bruh wtf that’s dumb asffff
it sadly seemed like the latter, but i appreciate your point of view. :)
i am! everyone’s love on here lifted me up a whole lot. i’m so glad to have a community like this <3
Nah, this is too much defense. Asking for an explanation and laughing at the answer you get is rude, period.
I'm gonna go a kinda big sibling on you if that's alright, if not, just disregard my comment: You weren't overreacting. It sounds like you were overwhelmed and that's okay to feel that, especially on stressful days. <3 your identity is valid and your feelings are valid and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise
You were not overreacting!! They laughed in your face over something that's an integral part of you that took bravery to come out with. That's hurtful!
People are scared and ridicule what they don’t know, plus, some “allies” are pretty gross acting. Be yourself, accept that, and don’t ask for permission to be yourself. Sorry this happened, but until people catch on that “this isn’t a phase, mom”, it may happen more. You’re valid, trust that.
They started disintegrating them with their mind beams, but thankfully u/local_ENBY06 came in at the last second
They were yelling at them, and starting to threaten to physically hit them.
Owl House and Amphibia are what I'm watching while I wait for this bout of food poisoning to clear. Definitely great comfort shows. I love that kid's shoes have such great representation these days. God knows more adults could benefit from them.
I wonder if they think you're a trans woman and are trying (ineffectually) to be respectful?

Also, the ma'am/sir problem for enbies is real. There just isn't an equivalent non-gendered term. ""Friend"" doesn't have the respect connotation, and ""comrade"" makes one think of Russia.
Food service is definitely a special hell. I'm pretty happy to be in healthcare now. The fact that my job now involves counseling trans folks who are on hrt is really validating. When work does suck, there's Our Flag Means Death.
Some people have been kind of rude, others havent acknowledged it at all, others have been really cool about it, but a few weeks ago since I was out to my boss they felt comfortable coming out to me as they had just realized they were nonbinary, i spent years at this job feeling too scared to tell anyone at all and they felt like there was someone there to support them day 1, it honestly felt pretty great so I try to focus on that when other people at work get me down.
That sounds amazing!! I actually asked cause I have an interview at the store where I love tomorrow :) it’s good to know that it’s an enjoyable place!!
OMG you wouldn’t believe what some customers at my store do, I had this one guy DEMAND that I accept a return for this stroker that was obviously USED, not to mention the whole bag he had brought it into the store was sopping WET with god knows what 😭😭😭

He wouldn’t accept making an exchange instead until I got my boss involved too (I’m already in a management position, however this guy wouldn’t listen to me after I explained our policy on these things… he may have thought he had leverage over me since I’m pretty obviously queer, this guy struck me as homophobic asshole 🙄🙄)

The list of crazy stories goes on lmao
im replacing my account so the last thing i do will be giving you a silver award
thank you so much <33 🥹
what an incredible rescue effort, I couldn’t imagine recovering from near disintegration but hopefully they’re healing up okay after being blasted with so many mind beams
jesus christ, it’s so spooky out here for our community, I’ve had people following me and pulling weapons on me while they said “people like you need to die” and shit
I meant to say shows, but shoes works too.
mayybe but i look cis since i still present somewhat femininly (at least as of recent more comfortable with that) , i have booba and i'm 17 and look young so like they couldn't really think i have had any surgery either (especially with the political state here ik it's harder for trans people now), but yea i mean maybe that's the possibility? still hurts 😭
trust me, you’ll love it. good luck at your interview!! :)
EWWWW OMFG THATS AWFUL
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH :D
Absolutely it would. I'm sorry it happened. You are valid just as you are.
Thank you!!

I'm blushing 😊
No both of you
No need for this infantilizing
sure It's very floofy
That's literally not what I'm doing. Have fun being an ass
Dude this is almost the dictionary definition of infantilization. Telling them they are extremely small and need to be protected? Do you not see that?
It's literally a joke. I'm not saying they're tiny and incapable of protecting themselves and therefore need someone bigger and ""stronger"" to do everything for them and make decisions for them and whatever else.

I said wow you're small and cute and jokingly said I would protect them and you decided to take that and make it into something serious. That's your problem"	fn43mg	NonBinary	1260	1.0	2020-03-22 18:10:20
My school got unisex bathrooms		"Ah yes what gender are u, man, woman , wheelchair
I went to use the unisex bathroom at the train station recently and got shouted at by a staff member that it was only for disabled people. I tried to point out that it was the unisex option as well but she kept shouting and people were staring so I decided to just hold it. The upside to that story is that after I emailed to complain a senior manager called me to make a formal apology.
The existence of a unisex bathroom: 🎉

The fact that it is labeled in a binary way: 😮‍💨
My university did get all-gender toilets as well. I like that every one of them has an individual different sign, who are all just pretty artwork to show how we're all individual and different, yet beautiful.
That's awesome!! Gender neutral restrooms should be the default everywhere, point blank. They improve safety for LGBTQIA folks, improve options for male identified people who need to change diapers, and also make things better for people with disabilities who need help in the restroom. There's just no reason to NOT have them.
Ah yes the new three genders...
my uni has gender neutral bathrooms too! shame they’re still labelled as “for both genders” instead of just neutral but still!
Not only are wheelchair people a third gender but also half the high of other people! The more you know, brought to you by signs.
I mean nice but why the gendered + wheelchair people
My school has them too except it is a bathroom that is in the back of the school where no one goes and most people don’t even know about connected by you would either go to the back hallway or down the stairs no one uses next to the band room. Very convenient indeed😭
the third gener, crippled
Ayy
Awesome!
POGGERS
Mine only has one
Slayy
Ah yes. The three genders. Male. Female. And wheelchair.
Woooohoooo yay 🥳
Aye thats cool
Can't wait til everywhere has unisex restrooms. It's a constant struggle choosing which one to use (usually my agab bc I don't feel safe using the other one but it'd be nice to be able to choose something that fit better).
Since when were wheelchairs a gender
Yay!!!!!!
My gender is not man nor woman! It is simply wheelchair
See, my school does something cool and just has a toilet sign that says “all gender” on it instead. 
[Like this](https://adasignfactory.com/product/all-gender-restroom-toilet-sign/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA54KfBhCKARIsAJzSrdoMi4GdVAtftoSY1SNu-B0u5q76ap56hUefvlAMREl2GmnsfrVpKH0aAl4FEALw_wcB) or [this if it’s an accessible bathroom](https://adasignfactory.com/product/all-gender-restroom-accessible-toilet-sign/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA54KfBhCKARIsAJzSrdqylFOwqt7T_s4xXTsluvc8mNF3Kis3EGsOmFBjyHnpOckpj9Yez9MaAjF1EALw_wcB)
AWESOME
wheelchair.
I’m none of those. I’m the background
I mean, as a nonbinary wheelchair user, personally I'd take LGBTphobia over ablism and inaccessible buildings any day, so, I appreciate it. 🤷🏻
I went to a restaurant and they had two bathrooms. One with a men’s sign. The other with handicapped and female sign. Like why are those two grouped together? Oh also they both the exact same bathroom
It's for all those things but binary bathrooms should always have a handicapped accessable stall anyways. I thought that it's part of the law? Also I've been yelled at for using a ""family"" restroom which is very clearly a ""unisex"" restroom because it's for ""baby changing stations only"". Again, no. The sign doesn't say anything about babies, but has the unisex symbol and handicapped accessable symbol. Does not say anything about ""baby changing"" but there was a baby changing station inside. I felt a little unsafe in that one though, there wasn't a lock on the restroom. 😰
fuckt on so many levels. Because obvs all disabilities are clearly visible and easily identifiable, thank god for for the bathroom police! /s
Accessibility means accessibility for everyone
lol.. they tried! they’re a little confused, but they tried.
[deleted]
I would love if they’d just include an “infinity” symbol for gender-inclusive bathrooms
doesn’t “male identified people” equal “men”?
Well, the person in the wheelchair is sitting down while the other two are standing.  As someone who uses a wheelchair, it’s pretty accurate
A bathroom no one else uses? Sounds great to me
Yeah. That's extremely weird. I have never seen that before. 🤔 Maybe, it was that store's version of a ""family bathroom"". It's wheelchair accessible and big, so, parents can help the kiddos go potty. But, most companies seem to expect dads to not care if their child dies of a serious diaper rash, so, they never put changing stations in men's rooms. Maybe, it's the ""what would an adult man need with extra space"" kind of bullsh*t?
I don't know if it's the law here but it's an old station and hasn't been upgraded in years. There probably isn't room to add accessible stalls to the gendered bathrooms.
Exactly! For all she knew, I may have had to change my colostomy bag. I didn't, but the point remains.
I hadn't actually thought of it in particularly those words but you're absolutely right! It's the accessible toilet. I'll need to remember that the next time it happens (which it probably will)!
The best one I've ever seen is at my old crossfit box. The sign just said ""gender neutral restrooms"" and the pictogram was the default male and female ones, an alien, and a dragon.
Not always. And I guess to be even more specific in this particular case/issue, I am thinking of people who, if only gendered restrooms are an option, would feel safest opting for the ""men's"" one. There are a ton of issues with that which can be hugely problematic for those individuals, and also for a child or PWD they need to bring in with them. Aside from LGBTQIA people, here's one common issue: many men's restrooms have no diaper changing table, so that's a big problem for men who have a baby. And it can be super shitty to deal with situations where a female identified/appearing person needs to go in the restroom with a male parent or caretaker. For example, my daughter is an autistic person who usually needs help in the restroom. Dealing with public restrooms is a nightmare when her dad or grandpa  are taking her anywhere.
Not always
Not when you have a 5 minute passing period and you’re on the 4th floor and you have to go to the most round about way possible to get there
No but the bathrooms are like the same size and look the same inside. Literally no difference
[deleted]
i like this because honestly not identifying as human is the most authentic i feel, hahaha, but i do understand other folks' perspective about how it doesn't actually feel inclusive. Seems like one of those well-intentioned, not-thoroughly-considered ideas.
So in this case, “male identified people” are those who wish to use a men’s restroom?
WHAT. 😐 r/crappydesign ????
Honestly same... It's a nice enough thought, but it makes something that's actually about basic human decency feel like a joke. 😒

My ideal? literally just put a toilet on the damn sign. What is the obsession with marking bathrooms by the figure of a human anyway?
Ah I never thought of it that way :/. FWIW that definitely wasn't the intent here, this place was super, super progressive and welcoming to people of all genders, orientations, etc.
Probably people who would go into a men’s restroom rather than a women’s restroom tbh
Or feel like that's the safer option.
Yeah, I never think badly of places who do that or feel like they're literally laughing about it or anything (except possibly laughing at the convention of gender to begin with), but I do wish that instead of making it into a goofy thing places could just normalize ungendering bathrooms in general."	10u3i8a	NonBinary	1177	1.0	2023-02-05 05:17:12

i never know which bathroom to use :-/		"I tend to pray for a unisex bathroom 😂
Both. At the same time.
Run at the wall between the bathroom doors at full speed and hope you clip through into the secret unused bathroom.
I always use family bathroom. I feel safer there.
I also i choos always the bathroom where is quiet and less crowded
i always use the girls one cause its cleaner
Being female passing I always go there simply to avoid bad situations but am really glad, the only differentiation at work that I face is whether to go on the no gender employees wc or that for clients 👌
If you can use a urinal, go to the men’s in a skirt and assert dominance
Enbies like us need to sew more chaos and just start using one for peeing and the other for pooping. I vote women's for peeing and men's for pooping.
Flip a coin if heads go into woman's if tails flip again
Same. I always use the mens bathroom because people rather put me in the male box and I don't like want anyone to feel uncomfortable or don't want to create any conflicts. Though this really hurts me. It's hurtful to know that people probably will always receive me as a male. :(
Whichever one doesn’t have a line. If I gotta pee I’m gonna pee.
I use male because it's a lot easier. plus i don't feel comfortable using the females.
I prefer to use a toilet
I tend to just go with the disabled bathroom.
Flip a coin, is a ciahet complains say fate decided you shall be there.
If you feel safe to do so, assert dominance and just go to whichever one is closest. Now that's efficiency. That's what I do, alongside considering whether my current outfit allows for urinal use
The one with the toilet and the sink
Use the one with toilets in it
The one that smells the least bad at the time lol
I know this is off topic but like, you have that fem and masc perfect blend and you're so stunning
okay but anyways bathrooms suck and I don't have unisex bathrooms where I am so avoid public ones as all costs
Both, take a shit in one and a shit in the other to assert dominance

Also I'm loving that fit
If there is a unisex use that if not womens because they tend to be nicer
I use the womens in these cases (cleaner)
 wow ur so wholesome
Please, use mine.
I tend to go for the disabled toilet, if that's not a choice then I go for the women's one because I'm more comfortable in there than the guys loo (energy and all, has always been like that even before starting hrt)
Doesn't matter which one you use, just get to the stall as fast as possible and look confident if you have to be seen by other people
idk but imo u look very handsome


:)


handsome lad
Shit in conservative mouths - the true gender-neutral bathroom
ur fit is so badass👏 wish i could pull off something like that😭
I usually use women’s bathrooms because of sanitary bins. They are also usually safer too
I just use the disabled toilets when I can :/ but unisex is even better
family restrooms 🙏🙏

im transmasculine and if im not wearing a skirt i almost always use the mens room bc men are nowhere near as up in ppls business abt “using the wrong bathroom”
Wherever you’re most comfortable!
I also never know which locker room to use for changing into my gym clothes at my university's rec center!
Just because of this I'm going to go in both and if anyone dares to stop me I shall take their knee caps 🤣
I just go to the one more convenient for me, idk if that helps
same but they’re such a rarity :’-(
You live too far in the future, sorry
they had one in high school but I guess people were using it inappropriately and they had to announce over the intercom to remind everyone that it was a safe place for lgbt kids.
i mean in the eyes of conservative people a person going by they/them IS multiple,,,,
Bathroom 9 3/4
now this i can get behind
Find the dev exit
unfortunately ive seen some really dirty womens rooms, so it's been no better for me 😭
I believe in this context it's ""sow"" rather than ""sew"". I do agree however.
i feel you on this
thank you so much !! and yeah i tend to just hold it
how so ?? 🧐

My school doesn't have gender-neutral bathrooms, so I'm forced to sneak into the staff ones :/		"Resistance is Queer!
Be Nonbinary, Do Crimes!
any bathroom is non binary if I'm in it


hehehehehe
Sad that you are forced to use the staff toilet, but you are smart and inventive.

Survive. Adapt. Win.💪
Don't you know? By being NB you are automatically part of the staff now! Nice to meet you Mx. betheydocrimes, did we have any homework last night?
I used to do the same but got caught and the school threatened to tell my parents. Into the dysphoria filled bathrooms for me :(
Male - Female - Staff

Ah, yes, the three genders.
Your so cute I wish I even had the courage to dress anywhere near as cool and cute as you you are now my favorite redditor!
I'm out as a trans boy in my school. But they have a problem with me using the normal men's restroom because I don't have a dick. So I'm doing it anyways, because fuck them
GODDAMN that hair is flUFFY also I love your outfit even if it is just casual.
[deleted]
I just sneak into the male restrooms. Not going to a girl’s restroom is quite freeing, lol
I personally always chose the toilets that were clean or at least empty. Nobody ever cared at my school, but that's three years ago now :3
my school does. come here. i’ll adopt you. i’m your dad now. c’mon kid we’re goin to wendy’s.
This is a crime I encourage. It's bad that you had to do that, but if that would've been my jr high or elementary school, you'd be the coolest kid in the whole building.🤩😎
Depending on where you live, you might be able to just ask them. I have a friend who does that. But by all means, be they do crimes.
I wish I could do this. The staff bathrooms are automatically locked until staff (who have keys) need them :/
I do this at my convenience often lol
Modern problems require modern solutions.
Wouldn't really care what bathroom to go in lol
I just need to go and thata final!
mine has a couple and I used to love being able to use them. then I got yelled at because apparently those are only for the special needs kids (there were no signs or anything indicating this). so now it's back to the girls restrooms and trying not to cry 🙃
Be they! Do crime! 

It sucks you have to go sneak around to use a bathroom though :(
You could try petitioning or speaking with administrators or the school board.  That's how my high school ended up getting gender neutral bathrooms (they converted a few staff bathrooms).
You are so cool... I go to an all girls school so this is a dilemma I always face 😭
how do you do your hair??? I need to know!
My schools staff bathrooms have genders sksks
mood
in my school the staff bathrooms are always locked :'')))
guess i'll use the bush
Ahh I get that
The closest girls bathroom is really far from my locker(it’s in a different hallway) so I just casually slip in there whole hoping nobody saw me go into the girls room and label me as girl even though I’m presenting as female and closeted at school so I wouldn’t dare go into the boys or the staff bathroom, too scared
That's what I did all through high school!!
I bet they're way cleaner, too!
Mine doesnt either, I'm just gonna ask to use the male bathrooms because it feels more comfortable than the female ones :p
I wish there were staff restrooms at my school but in stead i just hold it and tbr i rather embarrass myself with peeing my pants then going into the restroom

oh jeez,, I'm sorry to hear that..
but let me tell you this. one day, you'll have to do that for the last time, and when you're done school you wont have to use those washrooms ever again. I fully believe you can make it there, because you seem like a strong individual.
Lots of love, I'm rooting for you <3
god I wish I had the confidence to do that. people in my school are all assholes though so I dont feel safe going into any gendered washroom anymore because of how they're like.
The janitor came in 15min later and cleaned all the washrooms, so no worries there

Why can't everywhere have these bathrooms?		"Straightforward and not in the least bit cutesy. Love it.

Never seen a bathroom with urinals only, though. Huh.
Good I prefer these than those cutesey ones.
Ah yes I love standing to poop /s

This is actually great but I wouldn't mind it being all single toilets with stalls
&#x200B;

Every bathroom should be ""sit"".

&#x200B;

Most bathrooms should be single occupancy.

&#x200B;

Every bathroom stall should contain a toilet.

&#x200B;

Every urinal should be replaced with a toilet and stall.
Is this a motherfucking Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (tm) reference?
This is as close as it gets to true gender equality, any closer and those would be one bathroom
What about ""I'm a shitbird that pees on everything?"" There are a lot of those people out there.
I guess the ""Sit-or-Stand"" one will soon be ""Stand"" only, for it feels dirty to sit if you know some other people also use it when standing. But I like the idea that someone sticks on the door the desired way to use the toilet, so that when you sit you know it's clean.
I feel like I would have a hard time understanding that these are in fact bathrooms
Only once have I seen a washroom for neither girls or boys.
There were three washrooms and I was happy.
But that was tithe only time sooo
I honestly prefer there to be a non-binary room. I find guys, in general, to be pretty weird and frat-boy when there is a bathroom without just there bro's.
Lmao they tried to do that On always sunny
It's an interesting concept, if that's what they did. Bet it would reduce lines too, if the urinal one was half-sized and they used the remaining space to make the stalled one bigger.
Could also be that ""stand"" is for those who identify as male, ""sit"" for those who identify as female, and ""sit or stand"" for those who identify as neither/both
I've never seen urinal only bathrooms in a restaurant etc but it always makes me happy to see them at festivals! 

They'll be porta-pottys if you need to sit and a line of urinals with a small fence around if you need to stand - so efficient if you stand because obviously there's no queues compared to the porta-pottys.
I like cutesy, but only in appropriate contexts.
Ya but but a 5 minute wait easily turns into a 30 minute wait.
Urinals considerably reduce water use, often by three or four times maginitude.  There are even urinals that require no flush. I could see having urinal stalls, though. Respect the earth while respecting humans.
Thing is, urinals take up less space, so there can be more of them
Eh, urinals are nice imo. Way faster and easier
What about claustrophobics?
But I wanna pee standing up 

why u do me like this.
ORAORAORA
I think it might be a room with both urinals and stalls
Eh, not everyone is that paranoid about some people standing at the toilets they sit on.
Interesting. I find guys nothing because I go to the bathroom to mind my business lol
Maybe, but a cis man who needs to take a dump is going to be flummoxed thinking there aren't any toilets in the ""stand"" restroom. Cis men are ""sit or stand"", not ""stand"".
Same. I think if the place is themed for them, then cutesy is fine. If it’s going out of the way to be cutesy - then yeah it’s cringey.
>There are even urinals that require no flush

As a Brit, this is a very weird sentence to me. I've literally never seen a urinal that has manual flush.
Yeah I think it's weird guys don't mind whipping out their junk in semi public like that.
&#x200B;

Urinals do not reduce water waste as compared to toilets unless manually operated.

&#x200B;

Urinals often ""flush"" automatically or by motion sensor, irrespective of use, creating a tremendous amount of water waste. 

&#x200B;

Urinals that do not flush are not appropriate for indoor use, and ought not be featured in outhouses or porta-potties.
&#x200B;

The building code requirements of space between sanitary fixtures and between sanitary fixtures and sidewalls is relatively identical.  

&#x200B;

Generally speaking, the minimum spacing required between any sanitary fixtures is 30 inches center to center and the minimum spacing required between any sanitary fixture and sidewall is \~15-18 inches.

&#x200B;

Toilet and urinal widths rarely exceed \~20"", and most public toilets are becoming tankless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Urinating while standing is great.  

&#x200B;

Urinals are worthless, and can be cheaply and easily replaced by toilets, enabling full toiletry function for everyone.
&#x200B;

Claustrophobic people are not shitting in urinals.
&#x200B;

I invented a universal toilet that caters to every defecatory and athletic urinary desire (saving urophilic needs, which would require more cleanup than my product is prepared to service).
Anyway, there will always be people who are not comfortable standing next to each other while peeing. But when they go into the stalls they don't necessarily sit.
Just from my experience in guys bathrooms there's a good deal of ""yah bro my dicks so biggggg broooooo"". But I just think I do prefer the gendered bathrooms as long as there's a third option.

I'm amab so it's not like I've been in a guys room a few times.
Most urinals are a liter or less per flush, while toilets are at least a gallon. 

I never advocated autoflush urinals. I also find them annoying. 

Here is a perfectly sanitary waterless urinal: https://www.waterless.com/how-do-waterless-urinals-work
They flush automatically, but not after every user like a toilet, and use far less water than a toilet. In the UK at least, they are never manual/after every user. Just the occasional infrequent flush. And, yeah, they're absolutely fine for indoors.
I'd prefer anyone who's standing not to use a toilet I might end up sitting at...between seat splashes and the puddle of piss that winds up on the ground in front of it.
😂
Nice
>Most urinals are a liter or less per flush, while toilets are at least a gallon.

&#x200B;

Most urinals flush automatically and irrespective of use.

&#x200B;

Toilets seldom flush automatically or irrespective of use.

&#x200B;

The U.S. national standard for urinals (ASME A112.19.2-2008/CSA B45.1-08) established a maximum flush volume of 1 gallon. 

&#x200B;

All toilets sold in the U.S. must use no more than 1.6 gallons per flush.

&#x200B;

>I never advocated autoflush urinals.

&#x200B;

You claimed that autoflush urinals ""...considerably reduce water use, often by three or four times magnitude."", which is empirically wrong.

&#x200B;

>I also find them annoying.

&#x200B;

You appear to advocate for the same urinals that you ""find annoying"".

&#x200B;

>Here is a perfectly sanitary waterless urinal: [https://www.waterless.com/how-do-waterless-urinals-work](https://www.waterless.com/how-do-waterless-urinals-work)

&#x200B;

That ""perfectly sanitary"" waterless urinal simply isn't.  There is a surface above the holding tank that is urinated upon, and while it could possibly be hydrophobic, an amount of urine will collect on it.
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the UK flushing urinals flush a volume not exceeding 1.5 litres.

&#x200B;

Some dual flush toilets use as little as 2.6 and 4 litres per flush.

&#x200B;

Most urinals flush not only after every user, but after anything passes by their sensor, and flush for every occasion of use or misuse, 24 hours per day.

>  
>  
>In the UK at least, they are never manual/after every user. Just the occasional infrequent flush. 

More often than not throughout the United Kingdom urinals appear to be automatically flushed at set intervals, are not equipped with motion sensors, and are unable to be flushed by the users.  There is also some attempt to flush urinals with air that seems to be a particularly poor idea.

&#x200B;

>And, yeah, they're absolutely fine for indoors.

&#x200B;

I had stated that only urinals that do not flush are inappropriate for indoor use.
^ yep that's what my experience has been so far. Y'all can do whatever but urinals are just easier and less messy. There's a reason they're so popular
&#x200B;

There are inventions that provide splash-free standing urination into a toilet, within the bounds of a stall, using only existing plumbing.
This is clearly really important to you. Have a good life.
>Most urinals flush automatically and irrespective of use.

>​

>Toilets seldom flush automatically or irrespective of use.

Your point is that urinals do not save water compared to toilets. In that case, you are assuming that toilets are used very infrequently, infrequently enough that urinals will flush at least twice between every use. Imo, that is not a reasonable assumption to make. Especially (but not only) if we're talking about it in context - all urinals being removed and replaced with toilets, meaning all instances of urinal use would instead be toilet use.

I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at with the numbers. They do not help your case.

And finally yes. That was my point. I was talking about the UK, and here they do not flush automatically according to sensor or every use (though if it was according to use, surely that would still represent massive water savings compared to every elimination requiring a toilet flush?) And in the UK they flush at intervals. Meaning that even more water is saved, because multiple people may use the urinal before it flushes, cutting down on urinal water usage further.
If that invention doesn't hold and aim the person's dick for them, that doesn't solve the problem.
&#x200B;

I have a close personal relationship with reality.
>Your point is that urinals do not save water compared to toilets. 

Correct.

&#x200B;

>In that case, you are assuming that toilets are used very infrequently, infrequently enough that urinals will flush at least twice between every use. 

My burden of proof is not whether a urinal will flush twice as often as a toilet.

&#x200B;

>Imo, that is not a reasonable assumption to make. 

Your presumption of an assumption of mine is incorrect.

>  
>  
>Especially (but not only) if we're talking about it in context - all urinals being removed and replaced with toilets, meaning all instances of urinal use would instead be toilet use.

&#x200B;

When all urinals are removed and replaced with dual flush toilets, water will be conserved.

&#x200B;

>I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at with the numbers. They do not help your case.

&#x200B;

The empirical realities are what they are, and my hypotheses are correct.

&#x200B;

>And finally yes. That was my point.

And in the UK they flush at intervals. Meaning that even more water is saved, because multiple people may use the urinal before it flushes, cutting down on urinal water usage further.

&#x200B;

I am not convinced that the UK ""model"" of purely automated flushing is reasonable.  I expect that the ratio of flushes to urinations will be far more than 2:1 - the ideal you posited.  It may hold in high-traffic areas such as subways, but many buildings with lesser traffic are sure to flush at obscene rates.

&#x200B;

One common automating flush device may be set to actuate between 10 seconds to 3 days, with the standard setting being 1 hour.  If every urinal in an establishment is set to flush once per hour, then they must each be urinated in 12 times or more per day to meet your standard.
&#x200B;

If a person is unable to control their own penis responsibly, they ought to sit down to urinate.
Per your data, even the lower flush of a dual-flush system takes significantly more than a urinal flush. You have not made any proposal that states that toilets would use less water, other than assuming that urinals are constantly erroneously flushing (enough to completely offset the lower water usage) in the American model, or that urinals are very infrequently used in the British. On the British side of things (as that is where I am arguing from) I cannot agree that that is true. Let's assume all urinals are set to one hour. Urinals are used very frequently. It is, however, false to say that every urinal needs to be used 12 times a day to have an equivalent amount of water usage. It merely needs to average out, since we're not talking about something dependant on individual usage (i.e., if you have two urinals, one is used ten times in on hour, the other none, you still have five uses to one flush, in terms of water usage). I have no problem assuming most urinals would be used that much anyway, but I'd bet that the lesser used ones are heavily offset by all the ones used more often. Especially high-traffic areas (say, shopping malls) where there is generally a constant stream of people using them all day, and they are still only flushed at whatever interval they're set to (say, an hour).
Yeah, after that, I'm definitely not going to take you seriously. Saying someone should do something doesn't mean shit. Have fun sitting in someone else's pee, I guess. Not sure why you have a weird obsession with urinals, so much that you're spreading misinformation about them.
>Per your data, even the lower flush of a dual-flush system takes significantly more than a urinal flush. 

&#x200B;

The toilet is flushed far less often, and the volumes of water per flush are competitive.

&#x200B;

That hypothesis is highly plausible, and gaining the added function of a toilet vs a urinal is a considerable benefit.

&#x200B;

>On the British side of things (as that is where I am arguing from) I cannot agree that that is true. 

&#x200B;

The hypothesis is testable, if need be, but one might consider every other benefit of simply replacing urinals.

&#x200B;

>Let's assume all urinals are set to one hour. 

&#x200B;

Yes.

&#x200B;

>Urinals are used very frequently. 

Some urinals are used very frequently.  Most urinals are used infrequently, I suspect.

>  
>  
>It is, however, false to say that every urinal needs to be used 12 times a day to have an equivalent amount of water usage. 

No.

No.  Urinals that are not used whatsoever, or that are used to an infrequent standard ought not remain installed.  If there are two urinals, and one is used ten times in one hour, the other none, then one flush is wasted.  

>  
>  
>I have no problem assuming most urinals would be used that much anyway, but I'd bet that the lesser used ones are heavily offset by all the ones used more often. 

I don't think so.  One must account for urinals in places that are not frequented, but are automatically flushed.

>  
>  
>Especially high-traffic areas (say, shopping malls) where there is generally a constant stream of people using them all day, and they are still only flushed at whatever interval they're set to (say, an hour).

&#x200B;

Ultimately, I think it is an impossible standard (and not one that either of us has imposed) to assume that it is reasonable to expect not to smell urine when urinating or being in a bathroom.  People that are urinating are literally leaking urine into the air, and that urine has some odour in the place where urination is meant to occur.  

What we are attempting to avoid is the smell of long-standing urine, like wine in a glass that has been allowed to ""breathe"".  

In my opinion, I suspect that flushing all urinals automatically following only peak usage times and prior to and following periods of non-use would yield the most responsible results.  Uncivilized people may be up and about in the public around - say - 6 bong.  The working world is mostly wound down by the \*other\* bong of 6.  Between those two, is half of every day wherein flushing is superfluous, and avoiding flushing would cut water waste in half.  As for the other peak periods, the flushings only need to follow after at the rate that urine odour becomes distasteful.  So... 6am whets the whistle, 10am purges the breakfast coffee diuretics, 2pm manages the after-lunchers, and that may be enough to carry a sense of sanitation until the end-of-day-about-to-hop-on-a-tram whizz has mellowed.
>Yeah, after that, I'm definitely not going to take you seriously. 

&#x200B;

I don't require your validation.

&#x200B;

>Saying someone should do something doesn't mean shit. 

&#x200B;

Social mores are meaningful.

&#x200B;

>Have fun sitting in someone else's pee, I guess. 

I don't sit in urine.  At worst, I may be compelled to clean a public toilet with toilet paper.

Ideal bathroom signage		"It's just so... simple. I personally have never really liked the over the top, tongue-in-cheek gender neutral restroom signs that feature aliens or other non-humans outside of the context of say, a board game store. Even the ""half woman half man"" graphic is kind of ehhh, would it not just be more clear to put an icon of a toilet? I don't know, it was very refreshing to see this statement of ""of course, these single stall bathrooms are for everyone"". (For context, there was a sign leading in to the hallway where these were that said Restrooms so it was clear that these were bathrooms.)
it could be so easy!
This is ideal. Single bathrooms with locks. Such a simple solution to a ""problem"" which some people keep making a fuss about.
perfect!
Tbh, for a single shooter men’s/women’s restrooms, I just use whichever one isn’t occupied regardless of the sign.

That top looks great! don't feel pressured to wear a dress just bc other women are! wear whatever makes you happy!
How’d it go?
You look really lovely, i would love to have been your plus one.
Your post about top surgery made me feel seen, we seem to be sharing a very similar situation & type of dysphoria! I wanted to say you look amazing and your clothing choices make me want to try new things out too, so thank you!
I’m sorry you’re feeling so out of place. Haven’t been in that specific situation, but I’ve honestly felt like an oddball for most of my life, including looong before I realized I’m a AAA battery.

Just wanted you to not feel so alone (I think your sad puppy eyes got to me lol) and that all of us here got your back. 

Also, followed that Imgur link and...*shudder.* Don’t think I could’ve braved it! You rock!
I can relate, being the maid of honour at my sister's wedding(afab) was so overwhelming I was throwing up by the end of the night when I didn't have one drink of alcohol. Don't worry about how feminine the event may feel, maybe some of them are secretly wishing they too had the courage not to wear a floral dress. Shine on 🌈 🎊
You look great, and I love your tattoos. Hopefully you get through the ordeal soon. Functions like that are torture
What is a fancy bridal shower
I've had better days but thankfully I get to go home soon.
Thank you for this. I am really trying. It's incredibly scary and uncomfortable at times, but I'm trying so hard not to just give up and go back to being who other people want me to be.
Thank you 💜
Thank you!
Thanks! Now I've got a solid two months to figure out wtf to wear to the actual wedding lol.
Target, my friend! For real my fav clothing place at the moment, the men's section is full of super fun stuff.
This reminds me of the time I went to a rehearsal dinner with 'semi formal' attire where everyone just wore full on formal outfits while my family wore something slightly more casual. When it comes to fancy events though as long as the outfit is decent enough without holes or stains you should blend in. Personally I'd rather have people cross-dress than wearing ratty looking clothes.
Thank you 💜
Had better days haha.
I'm too tired to describe it so here's some pictures I got from Google that sum it up.

"I often say to (safe) people that my gender is whatever so this was amusing. This was the only toilet in the restaurant and the sign upstairs said ""all gender bathroom"""		"The logistics of either one of these creatures using a toilet is beyond me. The merperson would go sliding off and the centaur would have to support their weight like some kind of horrifying caterpillar.
I actually like this sign better than those others we've seen. The ones that have male/female/alien implying that NB are inhuman piss me off but since this one doesn't have a ""normal"" man and woman to compare to it doesn't feel like it's attacking us. But that's just my opinion.
These are cute, but I hate being compared to fictional, impossible creatures.
oh let us all just become centaurs and merpeople😭
Gotta be honest, I hate it. If this establishment is not run by nonbinary people, they don't have a place to equate us with inhuman and fantasy creatures.
If it's done ironically, them maybe fine..

I kinda doubt that it is tho.


Personally I think this sort of thing is a little before it's time.. maybe when trans/non-binary people aren't consistently represented as non-human and 'othered' by mainstream society, then it'll be supportive. Until then, it just seems crass.
Several years ago the queer community fought hard against these kind of insulting restroom signs and while they may seem cute to some of you they are completely insulting to non-binary, gender non conforming, trans, queer, and intersexed people by way of mocking us.

Most of my life - almost five decades - has been spent standing tall, proud, and loud as a queer two-spirit person in an effort to create equality for people like us, the key here being equal, that is, a human being just like anybody else and not some other mythical being such as a mermaid, a four legged creature, or an alien. Establishments like this need to be called out, its great they have a gender neutral restroom, and I say that as someone who as been constantly harrassed in public restrooms since age five, but I am person just the same as a cis heterosexual person.
Okay, some controversy in the comments. Heres my opinion. The signs do not have male, female, and others that would depict enbys as inhuman. This puts males and females on the same level on enbys. It also doesn't imply that one is a specific gender at all. I imagine the mermaid and a hot guy with beautiful long flowing hair and the centaur as a shaven haired girl. They can be whatever gender you imagine them as and they don't even care who uses it. I like when companies have (non-harmful) fun with toilet signs as long as it doesn't discriminate or alienate groups or individuals.
I just saw one of these at the restaurant I had lunch at today!
That's awesome! I wish here in Spain were more of this
Lol I have the exact same sign in a library/computer lab near my house
I frankly agree with those who find that funny rather than offensive. A lot of people have already pointed that out but there's no male or female on this sign. So they're not mocking enbies specifically, it's just a way of saying ""whatever you are, man, woman or other this is a neutral bathroom"". And I think that's way better than other sings I've seen where man and woman are represented but apart from them there's only mythical creatures. Plus, let's be honest with each other, anti-LGBTQ+ people wouldn't even bother making a gender neutral bathroom with that sign. I'm pretty sure it was meant as a joke, not mocking us at all.
I really dislike these signs. My gender is not ""whatever"" and it would be cool if we could shift to just identifying toilets vs urinals instead of this mess. It's great if you think this is funny or have it in your own home but for me these are tiresome and read as dismissive.
Yes
these signs will never not come across as anything but incredibly infantalizing to me
yes it is the best for guys gals and non-binary palls
I both want and not want to see an image of the centaur now
you...you really paint a picture...
Also, where does it even come out on mermaids/men/mex
i agree! this one is actually cool imo
I AM a fictional impossible character
Good point! I simply thought it was funny but this made me reconsider. Still the sign is meant for everyone and not just nonbinaries.
They're... not. This is not the same as the previous similar post where there were two ""normal"" people and a bunch of others. Cis people wanting to use the bathroom would be experiencing the same equating. It doesn't target non-binary people.
I think it's just that trying to convey nonbinary in a minimalist silhouette is difficult. So, they go with symbols that are pretty universally recognizable.
It’s actually up to non-binary people to decide where the line between condescending and fun humor is. Of course, everyone has their own idea of where that might be, but I concede that most non-binary people wouldn’t find a joke like this demeaning or harmful
> by way of mocking us.

Isn't it up to me and the establishment to decide if mocking is going on? I have a sign similar to this on the bathroom in my own home. Am I mocking myself? Do you get to decide that?

> I am person just the same as a cis heterosexual person

Is the cis heterosexual person using a different bathroom with a different sign? My impression here is that cis heterosexual people are using a bathroom with this sign too. Why would it be mocking to us and not to them?

I've been harassed and the victim of violence in gendered bathrooms. I am pleased when I see any kind of gender neutral bathroom, regardless of how it's labeled. Maybe I just have more of a sense of humor than most, and it would depend on the context where this sign was placed, but I just can't be bothered to be upset by this. There are so many more important things to be outraged about how we're treated.

So, I respectfully disagree :)
Yeah, I imagine it is like an Eeyore slump but torso instead of sad donkey head.
As you push past the possibly offensive restroom door, you notice a trail of water on the floor and hear some odd straining sounds coming from a stall. You think to yourself ""eh, people do as people do, and I just gotta wash my hands"". Before you can reach the faucet, a sound eerily similar to fish scales on porcelain and then fish scales on linoleum overwhelms you. In a flash, a roughly 6 foot long merperson slips out from under the stall door and goes sliding along the bathroom floor, sailing out that slightly offensive but accurate door. ""They didn't even wash their hands."" You shruggingly accept.
That is the same mystery the Cats movie created.
And the 'whatever'? A toilet symbol works just fine. 

They already had a sign that said 'all gender bathroom' 
Easily could have used another one instead of something with a flippant tone and fantasy creatures.

I LOVE longwood so much. The kid area they have right there in the same atrium is so fun to walk around, full of secrets! Next time you go back check out Kennett Square in it’s entirety, they have some really awesome secondhand bookshops, got a limited mark twain print from the 1920’s from one for $2! Also check out La Michoacana Ice Cream shop, seriously some of the best ice cream I’ve ever had (the ferrero rocher one is BOMB.) I’m not from kennett sq but rather north MD and frequent Longwood and the town pretty often because its just so cool! 
I would be honoured to take a shit in these toilets.
That is way cooler than I think I could've expected an ""indoor vine/ivy"" motif to go. :O Thanks for the pic. :D

Went out for a walk in my new dress. Felt powerful and confident before realising I'd forgotten to use the bathroom beforehand.		"this is such a perfect picture, and the maroon/magenta colour really suits you
You look awsome! I love lace on dresses
Oh that is a fucking mood right there! And you look cute :)
Oh noooo I love everything about this, 11/10 would *absolutely* stop you by in the street, at safe social distance, to go ""hi, I love your whole look, would you like to go for a beverage and scheme on further smashing of the gender binary together?""

Like, the picture itself is really neat, the angle, the colours-- but also, like, the superposition of the lace dress & the more casual jacket calls back to the contrast between nature, the park at the foreground, and the houses on the background! And now I'm thinking, something can probably be said of the parallel lines between you and the bench behind you, facing opposite directions. See? You're making art!
Aw thanks! I didn't mean for it to look so... dramatically angled, but I wasn't about to break lockdown rules and ask the family walking their dog and kids to help me take a selfie, so park bench it was!

And I also didn't think wine red would be my color - was really close to ordering it in black but I figured I needed *some* color in my wardrobe. Thank you for saying that ❤️
Thank you 🥰! Felt awesome too, not gonna lie. Super freeing and wholesome to smile at people AND HAVE THEM SMILE AND WAVE BACK WHAT.

Coming from someone who wears activewear as business casual, I didn't think I'd love laces on dresses... but I might just start wearing this to work tbh!
Yep, have learned for next time 😆

Aw thank you so much! Definitely felt it so this won't be the last time I go out and take on the neighbourhood!
Wow! 11/10 would strongly consider the offer, I'm always up for a bit of casual hydration and smashing of the gender binary 👌

What a compliment! You have an amazing way of interpreting things and it's super empowering to hear that! Would love to ""make more art"" when it feels this cool and you get this much out of it ❤️ be my outfit planner?
You should definitely wear it to work and feel all flawless and magical. I have a a dress with eyelash lace and bat sleeve and it is a whole mood!
Hell to the yeah! Consider this a standing invitation, whenever we're, you know, not in a pandemic, and maybe on the same continent. 

Thank you so much for your kind words. I'm so glad it felt empowering, which was the goal :D  I would *adore* being your outfit planner. All I ask in return is gentle encouragement to get bolder with my own fashion choices.
Gosh you're so supportive! I can't say no to that; once lockdown is over, this dress is getting the attention it deserves at work!

I was sexually harassed by a woman	"So... That happened. It's carnival season in Brazil. People dress up, drink a lot and have fun. My city is specially known for its street celebrations, and for being LGBTQIA+ friendly. I was dressed as Dr. Frank n Furter and waiting in line to use a public bathroom. There were people with costumes much more revealing than mine all around, all genders represented. Still, a woman behind me felt she could grab my ass and put her hands down my legs without asking for permission. I felt violated, it totally ruined the holiday for me and nothing nor nobody was able to put me again in the mood to party. Some people told me ""now you know how a woman feels everyday"", but to me it sounded more like an excuse, as if I didn't have the right, being amab, to be upset about it. Fuck it. I never took another being's way of dressing as an invitation for abuse, and I don't think having a specific genitalia gives anyone permission to abuse me, no matter how I dress. It was very traumatic for me, and I refuse to accept that the gender assigned to me at birth nullifies my right to be bothered by this kind of harassment."	"People who insinuate that it's okay for you or that ""now you know how women feel"" can jump in a hole. SA is wrong, period. No matter who they are or who you are, we were all taught to keep our hands to ourselves as children.
I'm so sorry you're struggling with this. Never be afraid to stand up for yourself. If you need someone to talk to, my chats are open. I wish you the best and a much better holiday next time
This is vile. I'm so sorry you're were subjected to that. I hope you find people who don't have their heads up their asses when it comes to this shit, & I hope you're safe where you are now. Best of luck to you.
>Some people told me ""now you know how a woman feels everyday""

Maybe they didn't intend it like that but it really just comes across as ""suck it up""
Firstly, I'm so sorry that happened to you. That's horrifying and you absolutely have every right to feel violated because that was a violation. Sexual harassment and assault of anyone by anybody is never okay
The people who told you ""now you know how a woman feels everyday"" are cruel and lack empathy. 

They also hurt themselves by downplaying assault and harassment regardless of gender because we're all human, you don't really get to put nuances or rules on when it's ok to dismiss this behavior. I believe they were trying to say that women experience harassment at a far greater level than men which is true but it wasn't the time or place to make that statement.

They were absolutely trying to invalidate how you feel and your experiences. 

This is a terrible situation and I hope you can deal with this trauma in a healthy way.
That would have ruined my day too. I’m sorry that happened to you that is NOT okay what she did.
The excuse "" now you know how a woman feels everyday"" doesn't cut it. You were violated and instead of someone trying to understand your opinion, you were told to "" suck it up"" and that sucks. And you are justified to feel however you want about this predicament.
I am sorry you had to experience this. What she did was wrong and your friends should have been far more supportive. I hope you are somewhere safe and with people who will help and comfort you.
You are absolutely correct. You had a violating and stressful experience and you deserve to have YOUR voice centred in YOUR experience. No one has permission to abuse you, ever. Gender is irrelevant.
Thanks everybody for the support and kind words. Last night I got home feeling really down and you all helped me thrive through today. The moment it happened, I half expected to turn around and find my wife behind me. But it was this totally unknown person full of satisfaction in her eyes, feeling really proud of herself. I had left home without my glasses, because the nerd in me told me it would ruin the look, so I squinted my eyes and tried to recognize the person, cause the only way everything could make any sense was if they were some friend playing a prank. When my mind couldn't find a name or a memory connecting to that face, I felt more naked and alone than ever. Luckily the bathroom vacated the next second and I jumped inside it, to escape that crazy scene. Later I found my wife and she got really pissed, and wanted to confront the woman, but I just wanted to get very far from that place. I love her so much. She's been my rock for the last 20 years and I don't know how I would survive this journey without her, or without this wonderful and amazing community.
>”Now you know how a woman feels everyday”

Ah yes. Using rape culture to justify rape culture.
Im sorry you had to deal with that and your right no one has the right to put their hands on you in any way you did not consent to! I hope this does not ruin this celebration for you in the long term and i hope you have some support around you who are willing to listen.
""Now you know how a woman feels"" classic terf logic. Sexual Assault can happen to anyone, does happen to anyone, and regardless of who is ""statistically more likely"", a thing that changes based on what study you bet your bias on, any gender is capable of committing assault. Spoiler: It's disgusting regardless of who does it.
I mean, I'm not a woman but I've spent my whole life with that feeling/fear/memory, so obviously it's NOT exclusive to women. 

**Being assaulted (hands on = assault) is something that's very reasonably justified to be traumatized by.**  Reporting it, or going to a therapist about that, wouldn't be overreacting.  

Take care of yourself and your mental health right now. Never be afraid to tell someone ""get your hands off me!"" in your most affronted rich white lady Karen voice (is there a Brasilian equivalent to Karens?) in public to establish a boundary.
Shit, I'm so sorry you went through that. My city also gets so full on carnival and I, as the gobin I am, just hide until its over. Can't imagine how awful it must be to want to participate and have to deal with this shit. I hope the rest of your carnival goes well, OP!
Yep what others are saying: this is sexual assault not harassment. I've experienced this as well and I still have nightmares about it and avoid crowds because it's happened multiple times. It has had nothing to do with the way I dress btw because I dress pretty plainly and conservatively, especially since this tends to be people's behavior in crowds with me for some reason (it's not like it happens every time but it's happened thrice). I don't think your reaction should be moderated by or influenced by your agab. This is disturbing no matter who you are.
It's never acceptable to sexually harass people. There's something wrong with the people who insinuate otherwise, and I would argue that it's antifeminist to act like people's genitals or gender assigned at birth makes any kind of a difference on that. That's messed up and I'm sorry that anyone went out of their way to justify it. You're right to have felt violated and to be angry at the perp and the people who defended her.

Edit: People have said similar to me in the past.
If it was unwanted and not consensual then you have every right to be upset. Dress is certainly not an invitation for mistreatment or abuse. Your feelings are valid. Holidays are not an excuse for poor behavior. People still need to hold themselves to some level of basic decency. You can still have fun without putting your hands on someone who doesn’t want it.
I’m sorry this happened to you, and, honestly, even more sorry you didn’t find your friends(/the folx you were with) to be supportive. The trauma of being violated is terrible on its own, but adding a lack of support to it must have made you feel extra vulnerable. [[Virtual hug to you if you want to take it :) ]] As someone else said, you’re absolutely right no one has the right to put their hands on you, full-stop.
Find her, and sue the shit out of her if you can.
I just saw your posts leading up to this and I’m so sorry that woman took the fun you had away like that. It was absolutely not okay, how dare she?! I’m so angry on your behalf. I hope this experience doesn’t stop you from dressing up again next year, you look really proud and happy in the picture you posted.
I am so sorry you went through that... You did not deserve that! Screw the people who invalidated your experience by comparing it to that of others. You are valid and nobody should ever have to go through that, just because others deal with the same doesn't mean you don't get to be upset about it. Assault is assault, whatever the gender of the people involved. Of course you're shaken by this harassment, it must have been a horrible experience.. I am so sorry, please do seek professional help if you can if the trauma affects you too much! You are so valid, please do not listen to those heartless people! <3 Take care..
Yeah, not only they lack empathy, but also, even if you set that aside, it isn't intelligent or strategic at all. We should be all together so nobody will get abused, regardless of gender. We should give everyone the power to recognize when they're in a violent situation, not put barriers between us.

I'm NB, but I have a cis male friend that one day told me ""I keep receiving unwanted phone calls yadda yadda"", and after a while I told him: ""ok I think you're being harassed. Not sexually, but harassed. It's something serious and we should do something about it. I can somewhat relate to this bc I've been sexually harassed before, like many women"" (I thought I was a girl at that time, I think it may be relevant).

I think that's what we should be aiming for. I think that sometimes cis guys and other AMAB people don't feel like they can be abused or harassed too, and denying and downplaying their feelings is the worst thing to do. My friend was having trouble even recognizing the violent situation he was in, and not even being able to talk about what happens because you don't have the words for it can be very harmful.

I hope that you can navigate this. Your experience is valid and you're not alone.
So sorry someone violated your bodily autonomy like this. It's not okay for anyone to do this to an unconsenting stranger, regardless of where they are, what they're wearing, or any other factor. I had someone do the same to me at a pride festival was I was 13 or 14. No idea what type of person, they blended in with the crowd. I wasn't wearing anything provocative, I was there with my mom and step dad. I don't think you or I had more reason to be violated like this. It's always wrong. Creeps gonna creep, and I hope we can stop them whenever possible but sometimes they get away with it.
This is terrible. I'm so sorry this happened to you, sib. Take care of yourself, please.
That is the worst feeling and it would ruin the fun for me too. And yeah, nbs are allowed to complain about being assaulted just as much as anyone. That is ridiculous.
I'm really sorry that this happened to you and I'm sorry people aren't being sympathetic. I can't imagine what you're going through right now but I hope you can come to terms with it.

Nothing describes better a Karen than ""Karen"", on any language 😂
Practtically impossible. There were thousands of people.
Yeah, I agree. I noticed that this type of cruelty and abuse directed towards amab people, masc people and trans men is sadly extremely common, that people will straight up blame, ridicule and dismiss these individuals if they report having been sexually abused. As if to say that if you're a man or perceived to be or have been assigned male, you ought to not have feelings, boundaries or deserve bodily autonomy and integrity.

Edit: typo
Harassment and sexual violence are always about power and reinforcing who is vulnerable to it.   So you'll see it heavily influenced by power dynamics - race, age, abledness, class/wealth, etc. 

 For (binary) women, sexism itself is fundamentally frightening (because basically all sexism is about reminding women they're fragile and easy to kill), but even if you take away the systemic terrorism the disgust remains, and the sense of violation is still very real. And that part is the same for (binary) men being harassed, who aren't enjoying it; it's still harassment, they're just as disgusted as women being harassed. They're just not also keenly aware that the very underpinnings of society are structured to keep them at the mercy of whoever could decide to hurt them just to remind them to keep to their places. 

(and don't forget your misplaced misogyny, whereby trans men are harassed in the name of sexism, who are QUITE aware of the (systemic or otherwise) violence that can await them. My simplistic take pretty much breaks down completely once you make it to enby circles, but the problem is that ""in the wild"" most people still expect to be able to slot you into a binary sex based solely on appearance, which means a large proportion of us are gonna get harassed out of sexism or queerphobia or some sewer cocktail of both no matter how good we are about respecting each other in our own spaces - that's not something we should have to put up with, it's just an observation about the risks of our existences)
I'm assuming the party continues outside at least through Mardi Gras, yes? everyone heads home for that ash wednesday morning hangover? 

Maybe just take today and relax alone, take an indulgent bath, get a snack; if you have a hotel or hostel space and everyone else is out partying, just get comfy? or if you're at home, just shut down the party in your place and let them go somewhere else (because there's like a dozen parties within twenty steps, aren't there?). 

but yeah don't ever hesitate to establish a reasonable boundary out loud. You shouldn't have to say ""don't touch me"" and it's probably quite fucking shocking that someone would just, like, do that??? the fuck?! so it's not a surprise that you've never sat down and thought, *okay, if some drunk gropes me, I shall shout ""hands off"" because that's perfectly reasonable!* 

and it's a shame to have to plan something like that in advance but yes, if you need permission to yell at a woman or in public or to be upset that you were touched, you have it. say no. you're allowed, regardless of your gender, regardless of your presentation or clothes, and it should be taken for granted by everyone else that the answer is no until and unless it's officially and clearly a yes. 

Hugs if you want them; otherwise... shit it's full summer down there, I'm used to February being winter up north and was going to suggest some cozy hot cocoa or tea. WELP. Get a matcha or chai smoothie? What's the frosty blended beverage of choice down there? Coffee frappuccino?

Officially, carnival day is next tuesday, but people have been parting since thursday and will continue till wednesday. But festivities sometimes start weeks prior. We have a saying in Brazil that the new year really only starts after carnival. Normally I would relax in the pool or at the gym, but today is actually kinda windy and chill, so my mood told me it was the perfect opportunity to stay under the sheets all day and binge some series. Later I think I will indulge my sweet tooth with some brigadeiro (cooked condensed milk and cocoa).
Women get more attention on the matter, but even that doesn't translate to more power. I'm afab and most people see me as a woman, and I've never been taken seriously or been able to do anything about sexual harassment either. It usually just makes you high profile and then everyone knows you're the ""oversensitive feminist."" In middle school a boy would sexually harass me right in front of teachers and they'd ignore it. As an adult I've been assaulted with no way to press charges or get assistance, and I've been shamed by female coworkers.

As non-binary people, getting that trauma contextulized and devalued in the ""binary-appropriate"" way for whichever sex is another layer of pain.

It's like the old debate of whether it's ""harder"" to be amab, queer, and villainized or afab, queer, and erased. There's no answer to that because the problem is the system making horrible experiences for people regardless of their unique identities, and individual experiences are not some little mirror of the whole.

Oh I totally agree with you and I don't think you were saying that, I just have seen that actual argument too many places, including on this sub. Unfortunately it builds resentment and frustration, which is where I think the comment ""now you know how women feel"" comes from. I want to be clear it is absolutely NOT acceptable to say that to anyone, and especially in this case where it is additionally hurtful to OP because it was transphobic. I sometimes feel that frustration when I see a cis man do something trivial I'd be punished for doing, like pulling up a shirt, and have to mentally check myself a little. Some people have so much of that feeling, and so much fatigue from it being overshadowed, that they end up taking it out on other people who are hurting. I think that the people in this incident wrongfully made OP the target of their resentment. Again, that's an explanation, but it's not an excuse. Our anger needs to be directed at the cause of the pain -- SA and the culture that perpetuates it -- rather than lashing out at other people who are suffering their own negative consequences from it."	1162a5m	NonBinary	331	0.99	2023-02-19 05:12:28
I want to petition my elected officials for more bathroom signs like this.		"Or, hear me out, it could say ""toilet""
I cannot tell if this sign has braille on it, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt that it does and that it matches the text. To folks who use that braille, this sign is not helpful when it comes to indicating this room’s function. Just “toilet” or “bathroom” would suffice.
I'd prefer a symbol of a toilet, tbh. All this human representation and categorization stuff should be unnecessary at this point. All bathrooms should be accessible to all people. We know what we're going there to do. And there's nothing more universal than trying to find a toilet, so gimme a little toilet sign, thanks
I want signs like this all around the world, fr. 

(Although I feel bad for the Aliens having to pee oustide. ;-;)
Oh jeez y'all I just personally think it would be more decent to wear both halves of the dress!
We definitely need more signs like these here in Australia!
ah yes the four genders
I want an owl sign. Because I don’t give a hoot 🦉
This would be my preference. If it's going to be a funny sign I'd also rather them not include the original icons at all. Lmao put the adams family on the sign and have it read ""be weird, but not in the bathroom"" 🤣🤣🤣
I just commented this, just in a more pedantic way 😂
There is braille. I can't read it, but it's visible below the sign
That's just their cape blowing in the wind, and by wind, I mean fart. The symbol depicts someone with explosive gas, which is obviously why they need the bathroom
(to be clear: the sign attempts to be inclusive but is just confusing and not inclusive. indicating what kind of facilities are inside the room would be more helpful.)
Hoo's that gonna benefit?
""Be weird, but not in the bathroom"" sound too much like ""i think trans people are weird, but it's pk as long as they don't pee near me"". 


Frankly, I don't think any ""funny"" signs are that funny or successful. I actually like this sign because I don't think it's supposed to be funny and it explicitly informs the reader that every gender can use it rather that ignoring gender on the sign. 


For instance, a sign that just has a toilet on it but contains multiple urinals inside might make some women question whether they missed the sign when coming in. Like maybe there was a sign indicating that it's a toilet and another sign indicating gender."	zvfkch	NonBinary	333	1.0	2022-12-26 05:03:43
we have a few gender neutral bathrooms in my school and I decided from now until I graduate (13 days) I’m going to try to leave notes there for my fellow queers! Just to brighten our day!!😊💕		"Beautiful
i would do this at my school but our gender neutral bathroom used to be a girls bathroom so guys never use it and im the only nonbinary person in our school 

it makes me feel kinda dysphoric because everyone in there is a girl and everyone sees me as a girl :/
You're so sweet! May you be blessed with the same kindness you give out. ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
this is so cute!! i wish we had gender neutral bathrooms in our school though. i think there are two? one for the nurses office one in the custodians office. even the bathrooms for teachers are gendered. they have female faculty and male faculty
That's super thoughtful and kind.
You are very strong and very brave and I am so proud of you.
You’re so sweet!! The world needs a little more people like you!
It's such an amazing Idea ! You have a really generous heart.
Thanks guys! I am glad you enjoyed it and I hope someone else does too!! ❤️

That's awesome! May I ask where you live? I thought it was illegal in most places in America to go into what other identify as the 'wrong' bathroom.
How did you get your pronouns in your display name??
illinois! the law here is you can go into whichever bathroom best fits your gender identity, which, for me, is closer to male than female (not really “close” to either, male’s just not as far away as female is). i was actually with two toddlers too (5 y/o boy, 3 y/o girl), as i was babysitting that day, so i don’t think anyone would’ve said anything in front of kids. it wasn’t a pool locker room or anything, it was just a small, 3-stall, vacant bathroom.
Its my username and I edited my flair 🌈😜
I can't believe it, that's cool.
How can I do it?
Go to the main subreddit page, under ""community options"" on the sidebar you can edit your flair to write whatever you want.  Not sure if it works on mobile (don't use Reddit except on desktop) but considering OP has emojis in their flair it likely does.
on the sidebar of any page of this subreddit just below where you click subscribe if your using the old theme.
Oh yeah I guess it's on any page of the new theme too haha - I usually have my window on half view (I mostly Reddit at work, I have my work screens on the other side of the monitor) so didn't realize.  But if you open the full view it is.

Public bathrooms when you don’t pass as either binary gender	"I’m afab and not on T and I figured I’d never be assumed male often enough to have to worry about this but well, here I am. I’ve used women’s public restrooms my whole life unless there is a gender neutral option. I’m 25 now, and I’ve never really had trouble with it until the past few years. I’ve started to realize that I don’t really pass as either gender and typically strangers assume I’m a young boy. 

A year or two ago I was washing my hands in the women’s restroom at a fast food place and a woman came in, looked at me, did a double take to look at the sign on the door, and then came in. At least she assumed she was in the wrong place, not me haha... But it felt super awkward. 

More recently, I was hanging out with my family and some of their friends at a marina. There were two gendered restrooms, and as I walked over to them, my aunt’s friend came out of the men’s and held the door open for me to go in. I smiled at him and then sort of ducked around him to go in the women’s. It was pretty embarrassing for me and probably confusing for him. 

After that second occasion, I’ve been wondering if I should be using men’s rooms in public. But I don’t know if it’s practical... I mean, I need to use a stall so from a functional standpoint it makes more sense to pick the one full of stalls. But I have social anxiety and I absolutely hate getting funny looks and feeling out of place. Not that I think I’d really be more comfortable in the men’s room.. Although I think if I could pee standing up I would be using men’s rooms all the time. 

I have this irrational fear when people assume I’m a boy that they will “find me out” somehow and I’ll be embarrassed if not in danger. So I tend to default to women’s spaces when I have to pick one. 

And that’s not to mention that I’ve been considering going on low dose T for a bit. So I’ll only get *more* masculine-looking. I’m not sure how to approach this. What are your experiences? Any advice?"	"I realized reading this back that I said I don’t pass as either gender and then gave examples of me passing as male. So I guess what I mean is that I pass as both depending on who is looking at me and the context we are in. When I’m with my friends who are women, I’m also assumed to be a woman. And I’m not out as trans to very many people, so most people who actually know me think I’m a woman. It gets really complicated bc if I’m with family who think I’m a girl, and then I use the men’s room, well I’d have to explain that somehow ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ But then strangers sometimes think I’m a boy.
Public restrooms suck so much because of what you describe imo. I’m over 6’ by a few inches with broad shoulders. I have had many experiences of women, typically elderly women embarrassing themselves telling me I’m in the women’s restroom. Same with locker rooms 

This happens when my back is turned, so when I turn around and my chest is in their face they have a look of pure embarrassment and I am always hopeful they’ve learned a lesson of leaving others alone.

I still use the women’s restroom, and also go for nuetral ones whenever they are available. I feel anxious no matter what in a public bathroom so imo switching to the male one would not help at all and probably bring on anxiety in a different way. 

Not sure if this is helpful to you, but now that I’m in my 30s it’s getting easier and easier to walk in and ignore the stares and comments, do my business, then gtfo
Firstly men’s restroom etiquette, at its  core, is simply : avoid unnecessary interaction.  It’s not friendly but it’s not unfriendly either.  They’re a bit like elevators.  People seldom look at each other or talk.  If a man clocks you as female, he’ll probably think the woman’s room is full or broken. 

When choosing, look first where you’re most comfortable.  If you can’t decipher or work it out, consider potential outcomes and choose the one with the least “risk”. 

You could also flip a coin and if you’re happy with the result, go for that- and if not - go for the other…
There's such thing as not passing for either binary gender? How can i accomplish this?
I've thankfully yet to experience this. I have had people call me man even though I am afab and not on anything (unfortunately they typically correct themselves when they notice my breasts). However it has never happened while going to the bathroom. I know you say you have social anxiety but honestly my advice would just not worry about it. I mean its no one's business but your own why you are going in one bathroom over the other.
My way of getting around anything like that is avoiding gendered public bathrooms at all cost.
All the other comments on here are great, just one thing to keep in mind, if you consider switching to male public bathrooms: they stink sooooo bad and are  often kinda disgusting in general.
Fck gendered bathrooms. Just go in the one you're most comfortable in what's in your pants doesn't matter.
I (afab nb)just use womens restrooms because mens restrooms freak me out. Id say i look more masc then fem in the face but with a more masc/fluid style and more fem body shape. I do have visible boobs but i wear boxy tees and stand tall so i look like a bean or pidgeon chested. Mostly older people are the ones who look at me weird in the women's restrooms but i fear violence from mens. I might not pass as male until i get a breast reduction revision but id probably still use women's restrooms

Thats just my experience though. You can always cater the rroom you use to the party of ppl youre in
I'm AFAB but I've been on T for six years and have a full beard and flat chest (post surgery). I went to the men's room very early on. Men simply do not give a fuck. Just keep your eyes forward and don't talk to anyone. I roll up in the men's room in heels and a skirt sometimes and no one ever says anything. I sometimes miss the warmth and camaraderie of women's restrooms, but I'm not at risk of getting booted out in the men's.
Speaking as amab who still uses men's restrooms when in boy mode, guys are much less likely to notice you or assume you're not supposed to be there. So, if you wanna start using men's restrooms, you probably won't find much complaints. Altho don't expect the same level of solidarity women tend to share in restrooms, with guys its more of a ""don't bother me, I won't bother you"" type deal.
Yeah it's a pain. I'm pretty androgynous and how I read can really depend on the person looking at me or my fashion choices that day or idk how the stars align or something. Its always a gamble. Public restrooms where there's no neutral option can be nerve wracking for this reason. Luckily where I work the floor I'm on has only gender neutral bathrooms, so that's less of an issue on a daily basis.
I'm the same age and in a very similar situation. I almost flashed some person at a restaurant who INSISTED I couldn't go in the women's room, and at a school event someone did the same double-take look-at-the-door. I personally feel safer in the women's room, especially now that I have a kid, so unless the line is INSANE or there's a family bathroom, that's what I use. I've kind of stopped caring what anyone has to say about it.
I just use what's available to me. Hasn't been a problem yet. I thought about what I'd do if someone said anything, and I'd say ""no Nonbinary bathrooms.""
I'm AFAB, but 6'1"" in my bare feet, and broad shouldered; so even before I knew I was genderqueer, I got called sir a lot when people only half-looked at me. 

It sounds like you're relatively small in stature, which is great, in this case, because you could really probably use either rest room without too much fuss. You likely aren't going to come off as a threat to people.

My size definitely makes it more of an issue, particularly on days where I lean masc enough to pass as a pretty big cis dude. I have gotten comments, threats, harassment, and have had to dodge outright violence on more than one occasion, regardless of which bathroom I choose. 

Thankfully, I live in Los Angeles, so it's not usually a big deal, but when I go back to my home town in Idaho, I definitely weigh my options carefully, depending on how I'm presenting and who's around.
I've started to wonder this too, still passing as a woman 80% of the time but recently started T.

IMO whichever one you feel most comfortable in is the right one to use. The chance of someone actually saying something is pretty low. Also a few other people have said it but you could try out a STP.

On the plus side, more places seem to be including proper gender neutral bathrooms. I've seen a few, mostly new buildings include a gender neutral restroom of some kind.
[deleted]
Why not try using both for a while, and then evaluate which one you feel most comfortable in? I'm afab and I also look pretty femme. Or use both like I do. I regularly use men's restrooms and they likely assume I'm a woman and typically they still don't even care.
I been using the girls changing rooms 4 a couple of times now i feel accepted as a non binary person and i really love the unisex code now in my school.
You belong in any space you feel most comfortable in. I get having social anxiety and it being weird, I have it too. It does get easier to ignore the stares. 

Just be confident that whatever option you choose, will be the right option. I have that saying as a mantra in my head most days.
I'm in a similar situation. I've been on low dose T and am just starting to grow a baby mustache, and I'm wondering when it might start making people uncomfortable to see me in the women's bathroom. I recommend getting some kind of STP to have more flexibility
You’ve got a few options. You can stick to women’s restrooms and just try to deal with the sucky bits, you can also go to the bathroom with some woman friends if that makes you more comfortable/helps you pass, you can try to stick to non-gendered bathrooms, you can go to the men’s and just use the stalls, or you can try out different ways to pee standing up (there’s some things you can do with female anatomy and also there are some devices made for afabs to be able to pee standing up). For me, I default to women’s if I really have to but I avoid gendered bathrooms when I can.
Personally I'd go with the mens room if you're in a state/country that is generally safe for trans people, like people are saying, the etiquette is completely different and you're safer in regard to interactions. I too usually get mistaken for a younger boy lmao most people won't look twice, especially if you train yourself to walk more masc

It's basically about holding yourself in your space and keeping your head up, like the joke that if you're walking towards a guy you need to move because he'll assume you'll move, it's not even like an intentional thing but it has to do with how they carry themselves and I've noticed a difference for me personally when doing that

You could also get an stp if that's something you'd be interested in, I can make some recomendations if you wanted, then you could use the urinals and be a lot faster and people would definitely question you less

Also if you decide on T, even just a little facial hair is gonna make you pass really fast, like just having a little scruff under my chin makes a huge difference interacting with strangers, but they do usually assume I'm younger
The same thing’s been happening to me since i was 13, I try to use gender neutral bathrooms whenever possible but when not i just use the women’s and don’t give a fuck about what other people think. Actually a few months ago just had an older lady yell “excuse me young man” at me when i headed toward’s the women’s to take a piss at a rest stop and just ignored her. Hopefully she can figure out i wouldn’t be in there if i wasn’t supposed to be lmao. I understand it’s harder w social anxiety but just know most people really don’t look twice, they get it. 

On occasion i use the mens, but usually only if they’re the single room kind and the women’s is occupied/has a line and i gotta go. For that being androgynous has its advantages lmao. I only worry about using a public men’s bathroom since they have more urinals than stalls and if the stall(s) are occupied you have nowherre to go but out. 

If you start going on T though you might as well use the men’s bathroom esp if you identify more w that. I don’t think most men are as observant as women in respect to differentiating gender either and tend not to care as much, so try not to worry about it.
In my experience, as a AMAB enby, men tend to not care at all who else is in the bathroom and pretty much never even register the existence of others. It's get in, pee, leave. This is a guarantee but men's restrooms are often a very bland space, in my experience.
I switch it up depending on where I am and who I'm with. At work the morning crew is mostly women so I use the men's and at night the crew is mostly men so I use the women's. I do usually default to women's otherwise but if it's full or dirty I'll go to the men's. I probably do get weird looks but I usually hurry anyways (toilet flushing is an awful sound) . In men's restrooms I find that they are WAYYY more uncomfortable than I am 😂 I don't be looking at them but it's hard not to notice when they move a bit to have their back more towards me like I haven't seen dick before 😂
My afab non-binary T taking 5’ partner uses the mens and finds them safer, though stinkier. They’ve been harassed in the womens.
It sucks. There isn't really a solution. It's why unisex toilets are so important

I've gotten kicked out of both toilets. I never know how someone is going to perceive me because I can go in one day from a conversation with someone who clearly saw me as a man to someone who's completely convinced I'm a woman

If you are with a passing woman, take her in with you and you'll be more likely to be seen as female. If you're with a passing man, you'll more likely to be unnoticed in the men's toilets

My experience is that male toilets are generally a bit safer, because you're more likely to just get told to leave. Whereas in women's, people are more likely to get staff as if you're a threat and even get threatening. I've had a man get really intimidating in a pub as I was walking into the women's toilets and I had to quickly pretend it was a mistake. But yeah, I also need cubicles so women's are better for that (I would rather kms than stand to pee)

It's a struggle. And all just for a piss lmao
I tend to lean towards the disabled toilets that are usually available. Gender-neutral, a key (if needed) costs next to nothing and you don't have the gender dysphoria of having to go into the wrong restroom.
I don't know if they're as widely available where you live but if they are I recommend it. It's a lot more comfortable, and you won't be taking away from someone who needs it more.
I highly recommend getting something that lets you stand to pee. I have heard that there are plenty of guys who go to the stall to pee, if you have a device that lets you stand it should make it easier to make either choice depending on how you're presenting or being taken that day. 

There are plenty of devices for standing to pee when that isn't the default for your body. Here's a [list](https://mashable.com/roundup/best-pee-funnels). These are for if you want to go into a stall or pee in bushes. I have used devices like this, I love them. Being able to keep one's pants on is wonderful. 

There are some choices for [blending in](https://www.ftmessentials.com/collections/stp-devices) at a urinal as well. Never tried these, but have considered. They've become much more affordable since I first started looking, too. 

Overall, if it were me I'd probably go to the mens and stand to pee in a stall if I was being taken as a teen boy. That's just me. I think you should do what feels comfortable.  I don't generally pass as male these days so I go for gender neutral single bathroom when available, women's in communal bathroom situations, and whatever is open for single occupant binary gendered bathrooms if I don't have much of an audience.
By and large no one in the men's bathroom gives a shit about anyone else in there
I generally don’t use gendered public restrooms anymore unless I’m with a good cis gf. I’m a trans enby lady 18+ months on e at this point. I REFUSE to use men’s rooms at this point. When I use women’s rooms i go as fast as possible. I went to a concert this past fall and was dressed very femmey but still was stressed about waiting in line to use the women’s room. I was very tunnel visioned to wash my hands and while doing so a cis lady complimented me (I’m assuming in an effort to Make me feel more comfortable) and I screamed and ran away lol. 

The whole dehydrating yourself to go out in public snd not have to pee is overrated.
transmasc afab, also not on t yet!

so i try and use male restrooms exclusively because of this, and as long as you keep to yourself in the men’s room no one will even look at you twice. 

i realised i “passed” (whatever passing is-i guess my goal is androgyny? but there’s no one was to pass for that-i digress) when i went into the women’s bathroom and everyone who was in there looked at me funny, and an older lady gave me a stink eye. 

i’d obviously prefer to use gender neutral bathrooms or single stall family bathrooms, but to make all parties as comfortable as possible i just use the men’s room.

ETA: at least most of the men’s rooms i use have multiple stalls that aren’t just  handicap, so i still sit down to pee. 

the only time i’ve been clocked in a men’s room is when someone was there as i was i washing my hands afterwards lol
I don’t have any advice, but I do have an option….

Spot on. Truly there's not a second thought in men's restrooms. Elevators is a good comparison.
I keep hearing that about men’s restrooms, but isn’t that also the case in the women’s? From my experience no one interacts with each other there either. Idk if this is just cultural differences since I’m in Europe and on the internet people assume everyone is American for some reason, but still…
Haha I think I probably look and sound like a girl physically but signal “boy” so hard with my clothing and mannerisms that it cancels out.
It's not as great as it sounds lol. HRT is how I accomplished it and it was great for alleviating physical dysphoria, but it means constant transphobic harassment, people in general are a lot less friendly and ruder, still have to come out as non-binary (people always see me as either male or as female) and I still get constantly misgendered after coming out 😅
Female strangers don't connect with each other in restrooms lol, what are you talking about?
Comfort is one thing, but safety is another.
This is probably the safest option too. Some places like my old university, have actually combined the disabled toilets with the gender neutral ones. I don't see a problem with this. One could argue that the feeling of 'anxiety' a non-cis person has using a gendered bathroom is enough reason to justify using the disabled toilets.

I'm disabled, queer and nb-leaning. I always use the disabled toilets, not because I have a physical disability, but because my anxiety spikes whenever I have to use a toilet with other people in it. I do stuff like hold my pee and wait till people leave the room if I have to use the women's toilets. Sometimes just taking a pee will take me half an hour, because I also won't leave the stall unless the toilets are empty.  Anxiety sucks.
Well, most of the time people dont care. But you always get weird looks when people see someone they peg as a man/boy in the women's, at least in America, I think because of some fear that they're gonna do something bad or just in there to peap. It's kinda wild honestly, like, why not assume everyone is just trying to use the bathroom.
I think they're fundamentally very similar, though in some contexts women's restrooms can have a social element to them, especially if there's a group of friends.  I find that women have a more active gaze in general and live in a higher state of awareness and vigilance.   I also think homophobia and external genitals plays a part in the men's room too, so men are just not as likely to be looking around and are more likely to barely glance rather than actually perceive.    


There are exceptions of course, like night spots/clubs/places where people drink/do drugs.

No i don’t have a phobia of using the bathroom, But i do have a phobia of being harassed in the bathroom by a transphobes"	y5h1xy	NonBinary	287	0.99	2022-10-16 13:38:00
parent woes	"I love my kid and I love being a parent… but the one thing I hate so much is how weird people act around me now. I pump for my 9mo at work and everyone knew I was pregnant there and since coming out the amount of people who have asked me what I go by to my kid I’m has been grating on me. I told all my coworkers many times while pregnant that I hated the title of mom. I actually kind of go by nothing with my kid because they can’t talk yet other than baby babble. And they call big people all Baba it seems so far which is cute. 

I get referred to as mom. I get called mom. I get lumped in with all the “mothers.” I have to go to the women’s restroom go get to the pumping station I use (there is another not in a bathroom but it’s a 5-10 minute walk and my breaks are not long enough to be worth it and be able to get enough milk.)

The stupid bags I pump into either say “mothers milk” or “you can do this momma” type stuff. The parent groups I’m in use momma exclusive language, minus the very few trans groups I have found.
 
I hate how gendered parenthood is. Automatically people put you in a weird gender box. Even though my spouse is the stay at home parent and baby is cared for most days by him and his brothers. So many assumptions are made about us just by our AGABs."	"It's a pet peeve of mine when someone has a kid and random people start with the ""momma"" talk. The parent still has a name! An identity beyond having given birth!
This is a woe I found even when I was pretending to be cishet. Spaces for babies are often reserved for ""mothers"" and men get into so much shit for entering spaces even if they're supposed to be ""family"" rooms (ie. The whole family is welcome in that space)

The thing is, parenthood is shitty, people treat you like a breeding cow and there is absolutely zero respect, even if you're cis!

My advice, leave spaces where people are being shitty and do not look back. You won't miss them, and you'll be much happier for it. If your workspace is not being inclusive or respectful, you might also have a case for discrimination depending on the country you live in.

Also, it might be time to think about how your baby addresses you, because they learn what to call you based on how you refer to yourself. Personally, I think 'baba' is really cute, and you could just go on with that. (As an aside, 'baba' is chinese for 'daddy', if a more masculine address would help you)
The English language has this beautiful word ""parent"". In English, I would definitely only ever be my kid's parent, no other word. 

But what the child should eventually call you, is a rather personal thing. You could use your own preferred name and make a nickname out of it. Like if your name's Sparrow, your be called... not something on s, and r is bad to... so maybe pallo?

Just saying it doesn't have to be something that sounds like mama, nana, baba. It just has to be easy for a toddler to pronounce. And it has to sound good to yourself.
All the solidarity here. I was out for several years and actually starting to make progress getting people to gender me correctly until I announced my pregnancy. It's been a long, irritating battle to get people to gender me correctly ever since. I'm so sorry you're going through this- it really sucks and the dysphoria can be brutal. It does get a little better as they get older.

My kid is 2.5yo now. I had planned to go by Moddy, but she decided I was Baba and it stuck. Rarely she calls me mama or mommy - I think she learned it from daycare- and I gently correct her. Once you have a parent name picked out I find people are much more willing to use that, especially if you can make a cute story out of it.
i'm really sorry people are so damn slow on the uptake :/ like jesus dude it doesn't have to all revolve around reproduction for chrissake, you're still a person.

on another note, i see you're still looking for names as a parent. i've seen some people use 'ren', 'parry', and 'mapa' 🤷🏽‍♂️ it's hard finding something that naturally fits into the mom/dad scheme because we're so used to it. but the point of names like mama/dada/papa are that they're easy for babies to say, so maybe just throw around double syllables like wawa or lala or whatever until you find something that fits?

i sincerely wish you the best of luck. parenthood is not for the faint of heart, especially with the added stress of being nb.
Pumping while working is hard af, good job on keeping up with it. 

My kid is in kindergarten now and has always called me mama but for me it's a title and not a gendered term, he knows I'm a guy and I don't feel like changing terms with him is necessary. But the problem with that is other people refer to me as his mother because they hear him call me mama.

For context I'm transmasc and describe myself as dude adjacent. On T and post top surgery
I hadn't come out until my daughter was born (not fully at least) and, while I'm proudly enby, I consider myself still her father.  That's the only vestige of my AGAB I truly wish to keep, and that's for me.  
HOWEVER I will be delighted to call any enby parent whatever they choose, because that is the most basic respectable thing I can do.  If I don't know your pronoun I will call you a parent, until you correct me.  My PiLs my ex and her siblings would call them the 'rents which, if I hadn't decided to be father, I would totally go for.
Damned that sucks, I would avoid introducing yourselves as mama, papa or some variation of that to your child then and just use first names (my parents did it and it doesn't really matter imo).

Or if you want a mama papa esque title name without the gendered part maybe take any other letter and do the same trick? Lala tata baba

Anyways, best of luck, sucks that you have to go through this as a parent 💜
I feel this deep deep in my mother wounds and my alien being. 👽 

I cant wait to see what name your LO gives you soon. I bet it'll be the cutest name for parent ever.
Honestly breastfeeding was so hard for me...I wouldnt make that choice again. Things got so much better for me mentally after I stopped. My kid calls me mama but I feel like its a really personal thing and don't really want other people to refer to me like that.
My dad is cis but I've called him ""parental unit"" for a long time (conehead reference). It could be easier to get others on board with it since it's fun. Obviously babies can't call you this but maybe they could just call you ""unit"" or ""uni"" for short?
Sorry that sounds annoying as heck.
I know this isn't exactly what this post was about, but have you considered the term ""ren"" for your child? When I become a parent some day, that's what I'm thinking about being called. Instead of ""mommy"" or ""daddy"" like a toddler would call their parents, I'm planning on going by ""buba"" or ""wawa"" and then when they get older, I'm planning on going by ""ren""

It does really suck, though, how gendered everything is for parents and babies.
Maybe use like “Jiji” “Momo” “Oya” idk about cultural appropriation, but Japanese is great for this.
Exactly!! At the hospital I asked them NOT to call me momma and it’s like I short circuited the entire nursing staff… they had no idea what to call me anymore. 

My name. Your patients name… it’s… literally written on the whiteboard and in my chart. It’s right there.
I’ve been struggling so much finding a parent name I like and most of the ones I enjoy have been vetoed by my partner for solid reasons (his Mom wants to be Nana so anything too close to that is hard, etc). I don’t mind Baba but it’s not 100% to my liking. 

Honestly it’s more the middle aged individuals who are shitty about everything instead of the atmosphere in general. My immediate coworkers are pretty good about stuff and at the very least refer to things neutrally. I’m just so exhausted and kind of disassociate a little to correct and push for everyone else to be corrected etc. and some parental abuse on my end means I have some hardcore anxiety about correcting older women.
One parent title possibility I read in a story the NB character came up with was “Mada”, and thought it was a great alternative. You can always just make up a title/name that is meaningful to you/your family and use that.
That’s the thing, babies cannot say parent XD 
I go by parent now I just don’t have a “cute”
Baby usable title. Or something I can really teach my kid who only has ma/ba/da and a few other sounds. 

The thing is random strangers never use parent, it seems to be the last word someone uses for parents In most spaces for some reason. People would rather use “mommies and daddies” or “moms and dads” etc.  a lot of people I know IRL (not close friends) when I say I go by parent double down and ask what my baby calls me or what the baby will call me or even what my spouse calls me to the baby. It’s just exhausting.
That’s the hope! Spouse and I are going to float around a few new names today! She has the Baba noise down and seems to use it for her uncles too so far XD so we say it means “big people” and she has started getting the hang of Dada (or just DAH) for my spouse. Hilariously she uses the mama/mumuh noise for things that annoy her or she wants given to her.
Daww thank you! Babe is trying so hard to talk and walk at the same time. We have a running bet which will happen first
That’s been my problem. If it was just my kid I wouldn’t mind as much but she can’t even say anything yet and full strangers come up and call me mama etc. 
after 9 months pumping etc I’m starting to feel burnt out too. One year is my goal and then I can just drop pumping at work slowly and hopefully start planning top surgeryyyyy
My parents used “parental unit” as one of their own designations. I also used to call them by their first names. This was in the 90s.

So +1 for “parent unit”!
Not quite sure yet about a name later in life, I think I’ll just leave that up to the baby as she grows up! If they are anywhere near as creative as I am usually I’m sure I’ll get all sorts of weird funny names. 

Spouse currently uses “milkbringer” like lightbringer from league of legends XD I’m going to try moobie/mobby and other B heavy sounds with baby to see if one feels right for now!
yknow i dont think i realised how weird that is until right now.. why do people insist on making parenthood such a huge part of one’s identity? granted it can absolutely change a person, but said person has likely gone through much more than just that yknow?
[deleted]
I hope you find a name that works for you! I was too late to come out to my family (although the other parent left when they realised I was NB) so even 14 years later I still get called the typical binary parent name.

Tbh I find parenting spaces are really judgemental, but most people in real life will want to do better, so I'm glad you have some support. I know confronting older people can be scary (and tiresome because sometimes they just don't want to learn) but hang in there! At the very least I know your child will love and support you no matter what. Kids are the only good part about parenting lol.
I know it gets frowned upon but you could have your kid possibly call you by your real name? If I ever became a parent I would hate being called “mom” (and I really can’t think of any other name) so I would just teach my kid to call me by my first name.
I've seen Ren or Renny be used by some nonbinary parents since the ren part actually comes from the word parent. if I ever have kids I'll probably have them call me Renny
Have you ever thought of Moddy or Maddy? Combo of the usual dad/mom.
[removed]
I book I loved growing up used ""garnie"", the kid's first attempt at saying guardian, for a character uncomfortable with ""mom"", and you could try that with parent or any other term you prefer too, just take whatever their closest pronunciation to it is
I know some people use Ren as an alternative to pa”ren”t with Renny as a counterpart to mommy/daddy. 
There’s also moddy/maddy (mix of mommy and daddy). Nonny also after the N in NB. For mama/papà there’s Bibi and Nini taking after the N or the B.

I think there’s a list floating around somewhere of alternative terms of terms children use for their NB/GNC parents. People act likes it’s so weird to deviate from the standard mommy/daddy but we’ve been doing it for a while :/
ugh ya the whole ""hey mama"" thing women do is so uncomfortable.
Sounds like you have some good ideas! Wish you the best!
Exactly! It feels like I’m not even here anymore just some kind of parent robot people feel sorry for sometimes XD 

And I even claim parent as part of my identity! I LOVE being my kids parent. I had been dreaming of being a parent… yet somehow it erases everything else I am too?!
Even forgetting someone’s name you don’t have to call them momma though. I forget peoples names all the time. And like I said, my name was written in 3-4 places in large letters. They taped up my birth plan in two places. They wrote my name on the board. My doula and husband only referred to me by name. 

I work in healthcare too. So I get it. But I tried to make it as easy as possible for everyone.
I would! But I know from baby sitting etc thst my name is verrrrrry hard for little kids to say and I also haven’t picked a new name that I like. I have been called Crusty and Fishy by kids XD
Oh no he made a good point. She is a menace of a miL and will do anything to get her way XD it would be a huge fight with her. So he really is looking out for me that way. Anything to get her to not go by “momma name” instead and try to take over our lives.  I was thinking about Zadie/zaza too because his family is Jewish but it also means grandpa so I wasn’t sure about it.
Garnie is actually really cute and the first I have heard of it! Thanks! I floated a few more to the spouse and we might try Mobee/mobby since it has some sounds baby can say. Garnie definitely goes on my list tho!
Oooh I like garnie (I’ve accepted the title of dad, but I look at it as just a title instead of gendered)
We are going to try Mobby/mobee/mooby stuff today to see if I hate it! XD I do like BiBi as well so we will see and maybe fall back on that. 

It’s wild to me because some people I’m out too call their parents like… Coach. But somehow calling me anything but mom is weird??? I really wished I like Renny and Parry more but they grate on me for some reason (or make me think of a platypus lol)
[deleted]
hahaha crusty and fishy?? I think if I had a kid they would probably pronounce my name the way my younger sister did as a toddler. maybe try a nickname?? otherwise I really liked seeing “garnie” further down in the comments!
I love Garnie, it can also be Gaga, Gagan, Gadan, etc. when they're little. My youngest is 1.5y and he calls his big sister Gaga - it bears no resemblance to her actual name but she trained him into it because she wanted a nickname that he could pronounce.

I'm really sorry you're going through this. I (nb) feel comfortable with ""mummy"", etc. but only really from my kids and even then it's only because I came out when my eldest was 3 and she already called me that. I know the feeling of being put into the ""mum"" category by everyone else, the assumptions and femaleness it forces on you. It sucks. I found pronoun badges actually really helpful - people stop making assumptions in the same way and those that do are more obviously malicious and easy to cut out. I hope you find a way through this that works for you.
Oh 100% agree. It’s just such bull they act like it’s your fault for saying the wrong thing to you. Very allistic XD it just annoyed me so much because I did so much to avoid it and make it easy and it still didn’t really help. I do commend you for trying to avoid it! I feel like a lot of the time trying to get care feels like no one ever looks at you as a patient and a person at the same time. Same in general as a parent/person.

Lol so a women told me that the mens bathroom was over there, I feel slightly confused because I am an AFAB non-binary person, which made feel more masc euphoric and oddly uncomfortable,I then went to the neutral toilet.	"Also I dislike how womens and men's toilets exist, but also I don't feel a 100% safe going to the mens toilets due to a time when I was a young kid, I felt embarrassed after being in the boys toilets because it was the closes toilet to the class room than the girls toilets.

I tend to go in the women's toilet because I know I won't get harassed but also because it is nicer the the men's toilet. 

However, I kinda wish people just kept their opinions to themselves."	"Agree that having two separate toilet room is completely unnecessary, kind of waste of space. We all pee and the other stuff, we all know how both sexes do look like, why this separation??
Yeah people could just keep their mouths shut, it's free. 

Out of curiosity, where abouts in the world are the neutral toilets? I haven't heard of them in public
I remember once I (amab nonbinary) was told to use the women's room when I was wearing pants and a shirt (I was wearing a short heel and had longish hair at the time). This was at a gay bar. I was taken aback because I usually use the bathroom that matches my outfit the most closely, but since I was wearing pants instead of a dress I felt that I would be better off in the men's room.

Honestly I felt kind of annoyed that a gay bar would police which bathroom I can use and said I couldn't use the men's even though I am not a woman. As much as having my gender policed in public is always annoying it's weird when the policing is happening in the other direction.
I woulda just been like ""oh cool"" and gone into the women's anyway.
I used to always simply say „i know“ and keep going my way. Now I basically „pass“ a 100% male, so I use the men‘s bathroom. Like I had that happening all my life. People looked weird me either way. You just gotta own it. In my experience men care less/make less eye contact in the bathrooms
I always worry about somebody saying something to me in the women’s restroom! I wouldn’t even know how to react
Im afab and used to clean toilets for a living. Even if I sprouted a penis tomorrow I would never step foot in a mens loo again
I wish every bathroom was just a single, gender neutral, floor to ceiling stall
When I get this I just say yeah I know. Or yeah I can read thanks. It’s a bit validating to pass but I’m also aware that it’s important to challenge anyone who would call someone out like that because they’re the type of person who’s dangerous for trans feminine people. So saying anything that’ll make them maybe not say that again but also not cause me any extra stress is the right thing
I use whatever restroom is nearby, when you gotta go, ya gotta go.
What I hate about gender neutral toilets is that they always have to be the disabled toilets. Like THANKS now I'm possibly taking up the space a disabled person needs just to feel COMFORTABLE USING THE BATHROOM. I just AAAAUUGH
I am AFAB and Non-binary as well. I just use the women's toilets as they are cleaner and more private. Where I live it's hard to find a bathroom for gender neutral, but when I do it's a family bathroom. And I don't feel like it'd be okay to use that bathroom so I just use the women's. But each person might feel differently. Honestly I feel safer in a women's bathroom as cis straight men can be scary. But if I had the option I'd use a gender neutral bathroom.
Yeah it's not like you watch people pee anyway
Genuine question: what about women (cis, trans) or femme-aligned people who are uncomfortable being/are unable to be in small spaces where cis hetero men have their penises out? I can see that for some people that would be very panic-inducing. Sorry in advance if I've offended anyone, that's not my intention - I'm just interested to hear others’ thoughts.
I've seen literally one in the UK and that was the disabled toilet with the gender-neutral symbol on it.
New Zealand, there isn't a huge  problem of AFAB people /trans men/masc  using the mens room the same with AMAB people and trans women/femine people in women's toilet.

I refer the disabled toilet as the neutral toilet and yea there are unisex toilets here in nz.

But there are still a few people who be like ""oi wrong toilet"" which is annoying
You’d probably get yelled at more or a surprised pickachu face.

Either way in the sense of OP, they are indeed AFAB so the lady can’t even use the normal excuses, she can try, but will fail.
Yea it is go in do your business and leave
Yea I think if it happens again I will say ""yea it's 2021 and I can decided which toilet I chose to go in, you have no business to know what type of genitalia I have or what gender idenity I have"" 

Along those lines maybe.
Like just maybe make disabled toilets, gender neutral toilets, and gender neutral disabled toilets
This is partly why I'd like to see bathrooms redesigned. Make stalls truly private, including urinals, with doors that go all the way to the floor. Mark the stalls by what's inside, not by gender. Sinks can be communal, perhaps in the open, so you don't have the discomfort of being in a closed off space with other people.
I wouldn’t be able to use the bathroom in the same room as a cis hetero man. I would have too much anxiety. So I appreciate you pointing this out.
I mean, same as if someone was uncomfortable with trans people in their bathroom: you’d tell them to fuck off. If someone merely using the same bathroom as you makes you uncomfortable, that really says more about you than anything.

I am curious why you’re specifically singling out femme-aligned people wanting to keep out cishet men and their penises as the one “acceptable” situation. Are cishet men and cishet penises somehow inherently more threatening than other people and other penises? How would you even know what gender someone is in a public bathroom situation?
It isn’t any different than the changing rooms at places like Target.
Pretty much every coffee shop toilet just says ‘toilet’ or disabled
That's cool. We don't have that in Australia unfortunately. Besides the disabled toilets. 

I guess there will always be annoying people like that.
I don't know the solution. If what I said sounds invalidating in any way please let me know
Thanks for the reply! Yeah I can see how your suggestions would definitely make things easier and would hopefully allay some people’s concerns.
YES! :O
I don’t know if I would either so I figured there must be more people out there like me! I just don’t want those people to be left out of the convo. There must be a way to make it so that everyone feels ok?
Um, no - comparing trans people to cishet men is  false equivalence.

>Are cishet men and cishet penises somehow inherently more threatening than other people and other penises?

Sexual abuse is perpetrated overwhelmingly by cishet men, so yes.

>If someone merely using the same bathroom as you makes you uncomfortable, that really says more about you than anything.

I raised this point specifically in the context of the many women and femme-aligned people who have been abused by cishet men and don't feel comfortable being in close proximity to them in such an intimate situation. You can't just ignore that issue, we need to address it and find a way forward that works for all groups who are subjugated to the patriarchy. Your antagonistic language here is unhelpful.
I see your point, but you can choose not to use the changing rooms at Target. If all toilets became gender neutral people would be in a position where they *have* to use a facility that potentially makes them very uncomfortable or could trigger their PTSD or a panic attack.
Yea I have the same feelings as a non-binary abled body person.
Like I am now taking an access away from some one who really needs it.
> Um, no - comparing trans people to cishet men is  false equivalence because...patriarchy.

“Patriarchy” is not an excuse for prejudice, and frankly this is a very juvenile understanding of the patriarchy. The word describes a complex series of social rules that govern gender - it’s not just “cishet men have power therefore cishet men bad”.

>Sexual abuse is perpetrated overwhelmingly by cishet men so yes, they are more of a threat than any other group.

“Violent crimes are committed more by black men than any other group, so yes, they are more of a threat.”

Do you see the problem here? Prejudice is prejudice, no matter what group you’re directing them to.

>I raised this point specifically in the context of the many women and femme-aligned people who have been abused by cishet men and don't feel comfortable being in close proximity to them in such an intimate situation. 

“I’ve been abused by black people before, so I don’t feel comfortable being close to them in an intimate situation, so it’s perfectly reasonable for me to want whites-only bathrooms.”

Let me ask you again. *How on Earth would you know what gender a stranger is in a public bathroom situation?* 

You don’t. Nobody wears their gender on their face. What people do is they’re going to assume based on appearances. Saying that it’s valid for people to not want to share bathrooms with “cishet men”, in effect, is sending the message that AMAB people, masc-presenting people and anyone that doesn’t fit into a “soft uwu” image of femininity is not welcome. You’re perpetuating cisnormative gender ideals.

>You can't just ignore that issue, we need to address it and find a way forward that works for all groups who are subjugated to the patriarchy. Your antagonistic language here is unhelpful.

Sure I can, the same way I ignore bigots who want segregated bathrooms. *Past trauma is not an excuse for bigotry and prejudice.*"	qi7i75	NonBinary	225	1.0	2021-10-29 07:42:10

the Gender-Chaotic Bathroom		"What's your gender?

Chaotic Neutral.
Is it weird to say I want to live in that bathroom?
this is at Cute Nail Studio on east 7th in Austin TX. it's an all-gender restroom, but I think ""gender-neutral"" doesn't quite cover it 💜

WHAT BATHROOM DO I USE?? (Check comments for context)		"So I’m non binary and my express fluctuates from masc to fem. so I don’t really know what bathroom to go in at school. I always used the girls one because I’m afab and I never thought I pass as anything else. But my friend told me I passed and I don’t want to go into the girls bathroom cause I would hate to make anyone uncomfortable. But the boys at my school are scary (transphobic) and I don’t wanna get hate crimed if they catch on.
I'm sorry about the transphobic classmates, this must be so frustrating.  
Please please take care of yourself and put your own well-being first. Do whatever makes you feel safer. Your safety matters more than someone's comfort.

P.S. is it an option to discuss this with anyone at school? (ie. any teachers or staff that you trust and can openly talk to?)
in my experience as an afab nb i have never had a question in the men’s bathroom (they don’t talk much in there) but i’ve been yelled at for being in a women’s restroom because they thought i was in the wrong place. i think bathroom culture is something to consider because women can be chatty in there and more outspoken whereas men tend to go in and do their business and leave. good luck!!
none. pee on the floor to assert dominince
I think youre enough on the side of androgyny that you could go in either without a problem, i would suggest just going where you feel safer
First of all I absolutely love your look!! Your hair is amazing frrrr!!!! But then I can’t speak to where you should go coz I’ve only ever used the women’s bathroom myself.. but just go where you feel safest I suppose? Personally I just leave everybody alone I don’t rlly get why people would call somebody androgynous out if they’re not bothering anybody :/
i  graduated high school with a trans girl, and there was an agreement that she would use the nurses bathroom and the teachers bathroom bc they were single stalls. i didn’t have a problem with her being in the ladies room (hell i shared a hotel room with her on a field trip) but some people were uncomfy. maybe talk to a teacher you’re comfortable with and they can help you talk to the principal about what will work for you. good luck 💛
I’m afab but present more masculine, I use the women’s restroom but I always get “the look” from older women. 

“The look” - Expression of shock that a man walked in the restroom

“The look” remains on their face until they see my large chest and immediately sigh in relief. 

I personally have never used the men’s restroom unless at a gay establishment.
In my experience as someone who came out as an adult, men are more likely to threaten or hurt you, and women are more likely to report you to the powers that be or draw attention to you. I don't know about teenagers, though. Teenagers are scary.

Mostly, I try to get someone supportive to escort me to whichever bathroom they'd normally use when possible. Doesn't even need to be a friend, just someone who very clearly passes as binary to validate your presence there. Just being there tucks any doubts away as ""oh they must just be an androgynous Y"" instead of ""oh that's an X in the Y's bathroom.""
I tried to talk to the principal but she was in a meeting so I asked my someone in the counselors office but she kinda just looked at me like I just killed someone and left to ask someone else (her reaction made me feel uncomfortable so I left before she could come back)
Thank you <3
Seconding to admire your hair.
Ack :/ Sorry to hear.  
Good on you for trying to get support. It's not your fault that the counselor was clueless and hurtful.

I wonder if you know anyone at school who is open-minded about Trans/NB issues, or who stood up for you (or other Trans/NB students) in the past?  
If you do, maybe you could ask to talk to them specifically? It's good to have someone on your side in case anyone gives you trouble about this.
I don’t know any trans people and the one open minded adult I do know doesn’t know jack about trans ppl. 🥲🥲
As long as they're open-minded, they can learn.  
If you're out to them, and if you are comfortable, you can try talking to them and asking for support. (Only if you feel like that's a good idea, of course.)

If you do, hopefully you wouldn't have to explain *too* much. There's lots of info on the internet, you can just point them to some info pages.  
(If you'd like help finding resources on ""Gender Diversity for dummies"", let me know.)

Is it normal to still go into the boys bathroom even if you’re enby?	"I’m an AMAB non-binary person, but I’ve always gone into the boy’s bathroom and the boy’s locker room and that never really changed when I realized I was non-binary.

If my school had a gender neutral bathroom, I’d totally go in that one, but it doesn’t, so I just default to the boy’s restroom. Is this normal?"	"I'm afab and if there's not a gender neutral bathroom, I use the women's restroom. It's where I'm most comfortable. So yes, totally normal.
Yeah I mean you can’t just piss your pants
Use whatever feels safest at the time, socially, psychologically, and physically. Separating bathrooms by gender was a scam made up by Big Toilet to sell more toilets. Normal was shitting outside most of history, so who cares.
Hey. You gotta go *somewhere*, right?

If there's no gender-neutral bathroom where you are, you gotta do what you gotta do.

Hopefully one day your school will consider gender-neutral accommodations.
I hate gendered facilities why not have floor to ceiling stalls with benches and have a huge row of those
I go depending on who I'm with, if I'm with the lads, I use the gents, if I'm with the girls, I use the ladies. If I'm on my own, I use the ladies. I'm AFAB and sadly have a more feminine physique so I'm less likely to be argued with in the ladies (although I do occasionally get Karened and then I offer to flash them since that's clearly what they want). I find as long as I'm with someone, people don't really care, but I live in the UK. The lads here rarely give a toss who's in the loos before whipping it out
I still use the men’s, sometimes I end up confusing people but it feels more comfortable than using the women’s.
After starting hormones, my AFAB sibling continued going into the women's restroom at work until people who didn't know them started getting alarmed by their presence.
Mmmmmmm what ever you're comfortable with
As a non passing transmasc, I go into whichever is more convenient
I just use whichever I feel like. If I go in and the stalls are occupied, I’ll just go to the other one. A toilet is a toilet.
As a fellow AMAB-Enby, yes it's normal to use the men's restroom if there isn't a gender-neutral restroom 👍🏿
Totally normal!
For me, I'm still more comfortable with the boys' bathroom. But also because they have urinals and stalls, as opposed to just stalls. So I can finish my business quicker and leave.
afab here, still going to women's bathroom. We have a lot of accessible toilets, but I don't really dare going into one because I feel like people would look at me weirdly if I were to go into one despite not being disabled, cause there isn't any sort of awareness about trans people in general...
What matters most is whether you feel safe. I'm also AMAB nonbinary, and I go to the men's. I only go to the women's to clean (for my job), and I go through the effort of making my presence clear when I do.
That was how I did... until I heard a guy come in after me asking another guy ""is this the right bathroom?""

I mean, I'm glad I wasn't the target of this confusion, but it was still uncomfortable to instigate it :(

And now I have to figure out which one would be less confusing to others for me to use based on my presentation one day to the next! And there was much rejoicing /s

Tl;dr: if your presentation hasn't changed from what's expected of your agab and you don't have dysphoria over the bathroom sign mislabeling you: yeah, why not?
tbh i use girls' bathrooms and it doesn't bother me too much, i take my peepeepoopoo very seriously and if i have to misgenser myself so be it. i prefer gender-neutral bathrooms but whatever's most convenient wins in the end
I prefer single occupant restrooms, but otherwise I use the men's facilities. I'm read as male and present male at work, and there's no reason I'd want to use the women's room. I don't poop in public, so it's so much faster and easier to use the urinals anyway.
Fellow AMAB enby. Absolutely normal. Whichever bathroom you feel most comfortable in is normal to use :)
I look pretty masc in the face and the way I dress, BUT I don’t have a way to bind yet and I have a big chest so I just keep using the women’s. I’ve had people do double takes at me but once they see my chest they visibly relax. It’s so weird.
personally I'm partial to just pissing on the street but if I *must* use a toilet, I still just use the men's lol
If there isn't a neutral option, I go with agab bathrooms to avoid making anyone uncomfortable, yes it's not idealfor me, but I'd rather not make anyone else feel bad.
It’s totally normal! I still use the one that aligns with my AGAB if a neutral one isn’t available.
I don't know what ""normal"" is, but yeah, that's what I do... I'm AMAB and use neutral spaces if they exist, male spaces otherwise.
Yes, absolutely. Whether for safety or comfort. You use the restroom most comfortable to you given your options and situation. If it's not an issue for you personally (disregarding what others even in the community think about it) than you do you. Your not hurting anyone nor are you any less valid
i use both !! depending on what i’m wearing that day :-)
Pee wherever you feel safe. It literally makes no difference.
Yeah, i still go in to my AGABS bathroom. I dont feel uncomfortable but id feel weird and less safe going in to the other bathroom.
I also go into the bathroom of my agab if there's no gender neutral bathroom. Especially because I'm not really ""passing"". I look a bit androgynous but not really like the opposite sex so it'd be weird. If no other bathroom is available I'll still use it though
I use the toilet for people who sit down to pee. But if the men's toilet is a private stall and no one is waiting then I'll use it. I have once encountered a gender neutral bathroom and used it with glee, it seemed hardly anyone else had.

That said, I frequently get directed to the gents anyway.
Yeah.

Because same here, and why would you switch when there's no reason to?
AFAB and always went to women’s bathrooms because I’m more comfortable there. Maybe one day I will pass enough to use the men’s. But yeah totally normal if you do that and that is what makes you comfortable. You gotta go when ya gotta go!
It's normal, as an AFAB I go to women's bathroom (we don't have gender neutral anywhere here).
Gender's fake, piss wherever you want
It is not odd. I am afab and I use the women's bathroom. mainly because the unisex one is no where near my work. I am comfortable in there since I can lock the doors.
ya do what u want u r the boss of urself
Im afab agender (and transmasc pre everything) and if somewhere doesn’t have a gender neutral restroom(unless im very confident in being able to pass in that moment) ill use the one for my agab, cause i don’t wanna get hate crimed, y’know? Anyways, the point is, everyone needs to piss so use whatever restroom you feel most comfortable in, just pls wash your hands.
trans demigirl here, still go to the men's room (and stand at the urinal) even in girl mode, i don't trust the toilet seat and better not to waste water lol
I mean, you gotta pick one or the other if theres no GN bathroom, so you just gotta pick whichever you'd feel safest/most comfortable in.
I wondered about this same thing. I'm an AFAB enby, but I still use women's restrooms if there aren't all-gender restrooms available. I'm my experience, women's restrooms don't smell as bad, and I don't feel bad taking up a stall since there are usually more of them. 🤷 Maybe it's just a matter of what we're used to!
Use whichever bathroom seems most comfortable to you.
Ok thank you!
Same. I feel weird going into the men's toilet.
real enbies piss their pants
lol yeah that’s true
You *could* but it wouldn’t be ideal.
B i g T o i l e t
As a disabled person, thank you for not using the accessible toilets if you don't need them, to leave them available for those who do.

Also, I'm sorry that there aren't gender-neutral facilities you can use :( I too usually default to the women's bathroom because most strangers still automatically ping me as female and that's the safest option with the least risk of harrassment...
Np!
>Ok thank you!

You're welcome!
Anarchy until we get what we want (ungendered bathrooms and free trans healthcare)
Pissing my pants to own the hets
Should able bodied people not use the accessible toilets if they are the only ones available? It seems silly to wait for a toilet just in case a person using a wheelchair comes in while you’re there.
I'd say it should always be the last option you use if you don't actually need them (so if you urgently need to pee but all the other stalls are occupied, go ahead, but if you can wait two minutes for another stall to become free, probably wait) because for those needing the accessible stalls, they're usually the only option. Plus, it's not only people in wheelchairs who may need those so you don't necessarily see whether someone needs them or not.
For sure, especially as someone who's disability is nigh invisible, but still causes me pain and means I need more space to do my business. I mean, having said that, I try to use the other stalls when I'm not having a bad disability day, but it's always uncomfortable. And as a disabled enby, sometimes I just feel safer going to the accessible washrooms than the gendered ones, because the accessible ones (those separate from gendered washrooms at least) are easier to lock if I feel unsafe.

I will say that if you're in a situation where there is a separate accessible washroom, and you don't feel safe going to the gendered ones, I think, even if you're not disabled, no one is going to fault you for taking care of your safety first. Just so long as you only take as much time as you need.
I'd say not being safe in the gendered washrooms definitely puts someone into the ""need the accessibility stall at this moment"" category."	y9hsz1	NonBinary	161	0.99	2022-10-21 02:53:35

And when simple-minded fools on the internet are bothered by it, it tells me I'm doing something right.

I actually never have any issues (knock on wood) with girls in the bathroom. Most are so supportive and often help when my hair is messed up from dancing.

Only issue i had is when the door guys at a popular club i am a regular at gave me an issue and told me to get out but the GM literally apologized (i was too drunk to remember) and told me she'd rather me use the female room than the guys

Thought y’all may like this bathroom door at the local dive bar		"Ehh. I guess it's OK. I would prefer it if they didn't make that much of a deal out of gender. Just have a sign that says ""RESTROOM"".
I don't like it, it comes off as passive aggressive and lumps in nonbinary people with aliens (I've also seen the same sign but with more fantasy creatures, as if our gender identity is so outlandish they also include actual imaginary beings).
The text is also snarky, had it been something like ""For everyone"" instead of ""whatever just wash your hands"" I wouldn't dislike it as much, now it just feels like they are making fun of enbies.
Big ""I’m not racist, I don’t care if your black, white or purple"" energy, but it’s still cute

Obligatory work bathroom selfie (MTX they/them)		"Eyeliner is ON FLEEK, save some gender for the rest of us omg 🖤
Just out of curiosity what is ur reasoning for saying MTX instead of just non binary or Enby?
Just another way of saying it. I recognize that some enbies don't associate with being transgender, but I do, so MTX kind of highlights that. Also, nonbinary is a lot to type comparatively, and I like using enby a lot more casually in sentences rather than as a label. As a label, I hypothetically could use nonbinary in place of MTX, context wise they both make sense.
That’s reasonable, i see the logic in what ur saying. 

I wonder if you’ve considered how the system of assigned gender at birth negatively impacts the trans and intersex communities and perpetuates the white supremacist idea that assigning gender has any validity. I also question what role sharing that status (agab) plays in the dismantling of a gender binary. 

As a last thought “NB” could be a shorthand used in this context.
I have thought about that for sure. I'm also aware that is almost impossible for us to dismantle the concept of a gender binary from current society. Because of that, I kind of just play the game from a literary standpoint. I try to do what I can in different ways though. Like being a full transfem person who has no intention on voice training.

""NB"" Can also be used, yes, but in other contexts, it's been used to mean ""Non Black"" so I tend to stray away from using that abbreviation.
Ok, I did not know that NB has been used to mean Non Black. Thank you for sharing with me. Also I can respect ur act of claiming the term MTX and I heavily relate to the desire to dismantle the gender binary by using transfem as a label and subverting it’s stereotypical “transition” related adjustments. I appreciate you, thanks for chatting.
Thank you for the chat! I love talking about stuff like this"	yjesvv	NonBinary	152	0.99	2022-11-01 17:21:18
I wish I wasn’t non-binary	"Honestly, I wish so much I could “just” be a trans man

I know it wouldn’t be easier, but holy shit I feel like it would be so much SIMPLER to be a trans man. I’m so sick of feeling way too trans to be cis and simultaneous not trans enough to have confidence in myself and just come out already. I’m so sick of feeling dysphoria every single day and knowing that even if I receive every medical intervention I want and get perfect results that solve all of my physical dysphoria, people are *never* just going to assume I’m non-binary, people are *never* going to gender me correctly, there is no option to “pass” for me. 

I want so badly to just squeeze my eyes shut and force my stupid brain to just go “all the way” to male. Why did it have to get stuck halfway there? After transition I’ll probably be seen as male for the majority of my life anyway, it’d be SO much simpler if I could just embrace that and let that be who I am. But it’s not who I am, because I’m not a man. And I’m not a woman either, clearly, because this whole being in a woman’s body thing is NOT fucking working out. 

I don’t want to come out to my workplace and have to explain to these mildly homophobic people that not only am I trans, I’m *different* trans, *special* trans (🤢), and you need to make even *more* effort to accommodate me. My boss is 73 years old, does he even know what being non-binary is? He’s a good man and I’m sure he’s down with trans rights, but non-binary people?? 

I don’t want to come out to my extended family and face not only their religious views but also their terf views with yet *another* complication. I don’t want to live the rest of my life picking between two bathrooms, two ID boxes, two standard pronouns, two sets of social norms and two sets of expectations, NEITHER of which feel right to me. 

I’m so sick of being deeply injured by transphobia, turning to trans spaces for comfort and seeing the new UltraWokeNess^TM “being trans is a choice!1! Gender doesn’t even really exist!!” like I would *ever* choose this, and bitch if my gender didn’t exist, why does it cause me so much pain then??? Or telling me I just want to feel special, I’m just appropriating intersex issues, I’m just confused, I’m just making things up, they’re just “not sure” if non-binary people are real, they’re just “not sure” if non-binary people can be dysphoric, they’re just “not sure” if I deserve a single *crumb* of human dignity. 

I’m so fucking sick of this life and being in this body, I’m SO sick of being afraid and uncertain all the time, I’m so goddamn tired of having to defend myself and my existence and my experiences over and over and *over* and knowing the attacks will never stop, I’m so fucking *done* with hearing she and her every single day like a slap to the face and knowing it’ll  be *ages* before I can correct them, *ages* before my body starts to feel like mine, *ages* before things will start being the normal I’ve never had. 

I just wish so much I could “just” be a trans man."	"[deleted]
I relate a lot to this. I'm a demiguy (at least I've taken on the label for convenience, because I'm trans masc and usually a guy to some extent), so I'm in this weird place where I'm not man enough to be a trans man and not nonbinary enough to ""really"" be nonbinary. I feel like I need to choose a side all the time, like I can't just be me. I've tried leaning into just being nonbinary and it's gone okay, but I just found out a big step in my transition is coming and that veered me right back to demiboy territory. I think I'm some vague kind of genderfluid, I don't even know. My gender is just plain fucked up and it makes no sense, changing all the freaking time but always being nonbinary. I just want different anatomy and I want to not be gendered by people. But I can't have that. In order to get the medical transition I want I need to totally be a man. In order to be seen the way I want to, I need to be totally nonbinary (and even then it's unlikely people will ever gender me correctly). I'm just... so tired of this.
It's rough always having to explain yourself, especially when it's well-meaning people with the exact same questions over and over. But, somebody's got to be the one to slowly educate the population on these topics so that future enbies don't have to deal with this struggle. At least we live in a time where after an explanation, most people will go ""okay, sounds reasonable""
I know how you feel, I identify as gender fluid for convince but I never feel like a man, it's only ever nonbinary or transfemme it's weird, and confusing and I hate my own gender, I want to look in the mirror most of the time and just have boobs, I hate my awkward skinny male body, but at the same time I'm not fully female either and I just want to scream.
I’m sobbing
I hate to say it but I honestly wish I wasn't nonbinary, or LGBTQ sometimes. I wish I could just fit into the mold that was prescribed to me since birth and just be the person my parents wanted me to be: Cis straight feminine girl that loves dancing is super responsible and has the same interests as my mom. But I just ended up the complete opposite. I have tried and I sometimes consider trying just pretending that I am that person they want me to be but it just feels so wrong and it hurts so much. I'm tired of being a constant disappointment to my family, but at the same time, I'm tired of living someone else's life. I have no experiences that are my own, and when I do it's riddled with so much shame, fear, and self-hatred, that I can't even enjoy them. I wish I could just do whatever I wanted without the constant shame and internalized transphobia/homophobia associated with it. 

TLDR: I relate lol.
I have had the struggle finding others that can relate to me.  I am notmsure of my labels.  I have thought I was demigirl, at first and then nonbinary, but honestly I am not sure. For years,  years! I felt that, that something was missing from me.  Recently, I had gotten up the nerve to wear a packer (socks) and see if it would help.  It did. I saw myself in the mirror, body hair, bulge, full beat of makeup, and I felt A LOT better.  I started crying! It hit me like a wave. Just looking at myself, it felt like a relief. I too don't feel specifically like a man, or like woman. I'm just me, it's all I know how to be.  I am still trying to figure myself out as well. Its a start.
Just want to say I relate and it's hard but also I think you're awesome and it's cool that there's other non-binary people like me out there
Tbh same :"")
This. So much of this. I'm fuxking tired, i don't even explain anything now, I just say I'm fucking queer.(both context😭)
i feel this. i feel like we’re at a point now where there is more binary trans visibility and understanding (including enormous pushback and violence), but that at least people generally get that there are trans men and women and that binary is more accepted. trying to explain being enby to my parents, who want to support and understand me, but clearly do not understand, is so hard! and i know it’s going to be hard forever, and i will have to either CONSTANTLY come out, or accept being misgendered all the time, which makes me want to crawl out of my skin. the world is so damn binary and it sucks. but i agree, i also don’t think it would actually be easier to be a trans man, i think no matter what being trans is not easy. sometimes i am so filled with self-doubt and loneliness i think about just being closeted and pretending i’m a cis woman so i don’t have to deal with the world. but i’ve done that my whole life and it made me miserable, and i know i can’t anymore. i can’t un-know my gender now. and i don’t even know what it is, i just know what it’s not. but i also think that we are showing the world that we exist and we’re valid and unless we do it no one else will. and it’s good to know i’m not alone in this struggle. ❤️
I feel those feels bro
Idk what I am
It's like you reached into my brain and pulled out exactly the thoughts I've been trying to put into words. It would be so much easier to just be able to pass as either male or female. It sucks that we not only get shit on by the transphobes, but also by the *""rEaL tRaNsGeNdErEd PeOpLe""* who still think gender is a binary system. I wish I could offer a solution or some advice but I can't. People are starting to become more accepting but it's still a dangerous world out there for us. Hopefully someday we'll be accepted into what's considered *""normal""* in our society, but until then we just have to keep doing what we can, being out to who we can, and coping as best we can. I can't offer a solution, but I can offer solidarity. You're not alone in feeling this way. I hope you're doing alright 💕
I'm struggling with something similar too  
Sometimes I wish I could just convince myself I'm cis so I don't have to worry and stress over all the obstacles that come with being nonbinary
I googled “I wish I wasn’t non-binary” and found your post. At the very least, thanks for making me feel less alone <3

Do. It. *Please*.
Add me to your mailing list please!
>I can’t un-know my gender now 

This, right here. In the past couple months I’ve been making an effort to “put being trans back in the bottle” so to speak, because I’m not ready to come out but not having a transition on the horizon is starting to seriously eat away at me. 

It was so easy not to realize I was trans for 23 years, but now that I *have* realized there’s no going back, as much as I might want to.

I was asked what bathroom I want to use	"I know this is going to sound weird, but earlier I was at a gas station and had to ask for the key to the bathroom. The cashier looked at me and asked if I needed the male or female bathroom. My brain stopped for a second, processed before aI answered ""female"" (since that's my sex). I walked out of there feeling strangely euphoric because someone asked me what bathroom I'd like to use haha
It's the little things 🌈"	"The women's bathroom is cleaner anyway
I love this!!
Something that can really brighten up your day. :)
Yeah, Ive heard DISGUSTING things about men’s bathrooms
In general it was the cleanest gas station restroom I have ever been to 10/10 would pee again

I got accused of using the wrong bathroom today at work ✌️ sorry they don't have gender neutral bathrooms and I gotta go based off of what type of reproductive system I was born with		"I relate. It can be such a struggle to be ejected from the women's room but be threatened in the men's room. Not passing in either makes it impossible. I never understand why everyone is so threatened in bathrooms, I just want to pee.
Ugh, the cis and their fucking bathrooms. I had a guy yell at me for stepping out of the mens room at my job... wearing my uniform... holding a spray bottle and a roll of paper towels.
I once attended a queer friendly conference that was using an entire floor of a building at a university. The organizers designated both bathrooms as gender neutral. It was awesome.

I've also been somewhere where the stalls were separated by gender but everyone used the same sinks. Not quite as awesome but I felt like it was progress.
Why do you have to go based off your reproductive system though? I mean go where you want and own it, why blame your gonads?
As recently appeared in the imgflip stream of AI-generated memes: https://imgflip.com/i/4v0l05
For real 😂 idk about everyone else but the only thing I'm worried about on our 10 minute break is making sure I can pee and get back to my area before the assembly line starts moving again I could care less who's peeing in there too lol
> either makes it impossible. I never understand why everyone is so threatened in bathroom

It's literally because the movies told them to. Lindsey Ellis just dropped a great video covering the origins of that particular trope and how it morphed into a TERF talking point
Because I could literally get fired for going into the men's restroom because work sees me as a woman.
I just saw that video yesterday and she made excellent points!"	lsgo12	NonBinary	147	1.0	2021-02-25 20:56:03

risks of switching to X gender marker amidst anti-trans legislation? (US)	"i’ve been preparing to change my name and switch my gender marker on my state ID, birth certificate, and passport. i live in a fairly blue state, but as red-state anti-trans laws pick up steam (including ones with consequences that extend beyond state borders), i’m wondering about how an X gender marker could become a potential risk to things like insurance coverage, IDs validity, bathroom access, etc. 

would love all thoughts and advice—and hang in there, everyone. we offer so much beauty to the world and they can’t erase us 💕"	"I'm nonbinary but my ID says Male, almost did X but I felt it was just painting a giant target.

 We just aren't there yet.
Tbh I'm terrified of just being out. Also in a blue state but the violence out there is real.
I have enough other demographic things that paint a target on my back to ever put my name on a list like that for government to abuse.

We need brave people to do it. People who already carry privileges in other ways. People who can afford lawyers, who have social networks, who live in safe areas and don’t travel elsewhere.
ultimately it's hard to say for sure what the risks are. if you think you're going to be traveling to places with anti-trans laws anytime, i'd avoid switching to X on your id for your own safety. i think it would mostly be an issue if you don't look clearly like one gender or another, or if you're visibly trans in general. i don't think ppl are asking for ids for bathrooms unless they clock you in some way. if you're in a blue state without that kind of legislation, the people trying to stop you from using the bathroom are probably not going to be officials who would care about your id, anyway. otherwise it's mostly relevant in situations where you'd need to show your id, like buying alcohol or being pulled over.

ime insurance forms, employment forms, and other bureaucratic stuff has not caught up enough to have the option of selecting anything other than male or female, and usually your id is used to verify like your name and birth date more than the other info (like eye color and height, for example). i have an X on my id and i don't think my employer even noticed. (not in a red state, but an awful town in a blue state that just held a far right white lives matter protest, with an ex-cop as my manager, so...)

it's really situational, basically. i look too trans right now for it to really matter what it says on my id, so i went ahead and changed it to X when i did my name change. in my case, my name and old gender marker would have outed me anyway.
[removed]
I live in Canada but I wouldn't change mine because of potential travel to the states or other countries. Not worth the risk imo.
Personally, neither F nor M feels right but I don’t want to mark myself as different with the X right now.
I'm terrified of being singled out, discriminated against, or hate crimed. I changed mine to an X anyway. Fuck the fascists - I'm not hiding.

But that's my personal choice. I totally understand those who choose not to and I support that - there is no should or shouldn't here. Just whatever makes you feel the most comfortable/safest.
To be honest, I was planning to do this a few days ago, but now I've decided to back off on it. Despite the fact that I live in a purple state with the Dems at the helm, I'm not too trusting of things at the moment. But what I do know is I'm not going back into the closet. I spent enough years there.
I live in a blue state and changed to X when I changed my name. I don’t travel to red states so it felt safe. The only place I really travel is Canada or even bluer states.
I had mine changed last year. Will be changing my passport when it's up in 2026. 

Personally, I am really sick of feeling scared and changing the marker felt very empowering. I also feel like as someone who is part of a fairly insulated group, I have an amount of protection that others don't (in that, academia trends to the left). With that, I feel compelled to be more visible in every way possible.
I'm in Iowa, year or two ago? I'd probably say hell yeah. But now? I'd be much more hesitant. Lunatic behavior in the government is on the rise.
I’m in a very blue state so I did my license, but not my passport.
I wish I could put that, but my state won’t allow it. The closest I got was ‘gender non-specified’ on my marriage application. The answer isn’t going to be compliance. They need to know we’re here and deserve equality. Do it for those of us who legally can’t!
I identify with femininity enough that having an F on my ID doesn't bother me but I think X would be nice and make me a little happier.

Sadly in the current political environment I think I am going to stick with the F for my own safety and comfort even though I am in a blue state. 😞
I have kept my AGAB on my documentation because of the travel I do throughout the USA for work. I wish I could get that X, but it’s not safe enough for me to consider doing it yet, especially for the current legislative situation. 

Especially if we have to deal with “drag” related legislation, I don’t want to have to explain how dressing as myself isn’t drag.
I did a post on this a while back, though I'm not even American but the anti trans shit is everywhere... I think X is too risky going to change it too M as it's what I pass as.
I've had my X for over a year. Not had any issues. But I am afraid
I'm with others on this. It would genuinely make me feel better, like you op, to have the X. But I do not think it's safe and I have to keep my family as safe as possible.
almost did it myself, but i fly often and many airlines don’t recognize X as a valid gender market and thus would cause lots of issues for travel.
It's a personal decision based on your own risk assessment.  I got an X on my passport and driver's license.  Makes sense since I'm a fairly well-off white guy with multiple lawyers in the family, living in one of the most blue states.  But I'm also planning to travel back to Russia whenever that becomes politically expedient . . . lord only knows when that will be, but I decided that regardless of travel plans I'd get an X and just give the establishment a middle finger, consequences be damned.  I doubt this is the right choice for most people, but I'm pleased with it so far.
I'm not sure. I've been thinking about this myself, and even in a heavy blue state, I worry about singling myself out. Employment discrimination is real, even though it's not legal, and a lot of forms ask you to list your legal sex/gender but only have two options. I *definitely* don't want to give the police an ""excuse"" to bully me if I get pulled over. I also have citizenship in an EU country, and I intend to get my passport in case anti-trans legislation comes to my state and I'm suddenly denied medical care, but X isn't an option there. I might do it because I'm white, live in a blue city in a blue state, and have the option to get out if I need to. Unfortunately, it does put a target on your back. If I lived in a red state, I would probably be planning to go already, but I'm in a very privileged position to be able to leave without messing with asylum claims or visas.
I fortunately havent been in a traffic stop since changing it so I cant speak to that. So far tye only thing that came out of it was an employer asking why it didnt match my passport even though that wasnt even an option till a year later. I still got the job
I have an x on my license, not my passport, honestly never had anyone even really notice the sex marker on my ID, or if they did they did not comment on it or seem to treat me differently. this is just my experience, and cannot be representative for everyone but wanted to share
I don't travel and my state is one of the more progressive ones, so I switched my ID to X as soon as I could. Probably not a good idea if you plan to travel though, unfortunately.
Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. I’m at this exact same intersection, and I travel with some degree
of regularity to countries where LGBTQ rights are frequently illegal. This has been such an internal debate for me. 

Somehow, your answer of “we just aren’t there yet” has made the most sense to me, beyond any conversations I’ve had with friends, family, lawyers, or my therapist. 

I hate it though.
All of my ID are still going to say Female on mine. Especially on my passport. And yet I’m definitely Nonbinary. But I do plan travelling to travel to countries such as Mexico, South Africa, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, etc. sometime in my life. I feel like travelling to the countries I’ve mentioned w/ X as my gender would put me in greater harm than good.
Sadly same here I feel like I’d be asking to be harassed if I changed it
Same here. I feel like it makes me a target on paper.
I feel this way as well especially since my license is a passport card. I don't wanna deal with all the trouble especially with traveling to southern states since federally we aren't really protected well.
I almost put X on my ID, but after some thought, F was just safer and easier. I’m lucky that I’m fem enough to not be bothered by it.
I’m struggling with this hard too, I don’t even feel like painting my nails. I am mentally exhausted and I live in a blue state too, but it feels like there’s no room for NB people
Agreed—my agenderish partner has white male presenting privilege and got it on his passport and DL. He also is a public defender, to your point about representation.

I’m hesitant to because of my disability, reproductive choice issues, and queer presentation, but I’m considering if I’m brave and safe enough or not. I think maybe not yet, even though I hope I live to see a day I feel I am so I can help others.
THIS. 
I'm not in the US but I'm changing mine as soon as I can. Unfortunately it's not a straight forward thing where I am.
I'm worried about discrimination but I've also faced it all my life due to other stuff like tattoos, piercings, mental illnesses... You name it. 
If we don't start somewhere we will all stay in the closet forever for the benefit of people that don't care about us. I'm open and proudly non-binary.
there are countries that will turn you away at the border if you have “X” on your passport. it’s just not safe for us to make ourselves so easily identifiable in these situations yet.
Yep! Hate it too! I hate it so much! 😭💖
There's plenty of room for us. 

I'm in a blue city in a purple state that's been turning blue. The people around me still struggle, and I also work in a customer facing position. 

I came out explicitly (stopped boymoding and added pronoun flairs) when people were getting confused or asking me.

Everyone has been getting better (language, respect, etc), even the customer who got offended and went off when I politely corrected him has been respectful. 

I've had multiple people approach me to ask trans questions, usually from people trying to be supportive of transgender coworkers wanting wanting to avoid being offensive.
Yep. I feel the same. It isn’t because I’m cowardly, which I sometimes feel. It’s literally because it’s unsafe for me, will prevent me from accessing jobs potentially, and can cause issues for my future kin.

I don’t have the energy in me to fight any of that. 
I’m just trying to survive most days.
Totally feel for you. From the sound of it, you’re anything but cowardly. (Plus we shouldn’t need to be brave to live our lives, but sometimes societies make it that way. Sending lots of love.)"	11izy0q	NonBinary	140	0.99	2023-03-05 15:37:38

I hate changing rooms	I hate that I have to change in the fucking toilet instead of the *changing* area. I can't use a place for its primary purpose because of bullshit. It's bullshit that my genitals determine where I go to do something simple and necessary such as taking a shit or changing clothes. Whenever I walk into the men's changing rooms, I feel humiliated and ashamed. Everyone has no breasts except for me. Everyone has a penis except for me. I don't belong here when I should. I can't perform a simple act without being stripped of my dignity and without risking being kicked out or labelled as a pervert. I can't even go change in the women's because I mostly pass as male so ill get shit for simply stepping foot in there. Every day I am denied the basic human right of using the bathroom/change room. It's bullshit and it makes me angry. I feel wronged, I feel fucked over, I feel denied what I deserve. I'm a human being and yet I'm not treated so. I feel like a beast, a monster, a freak because I am seen and treated as such. I feel I am denied my humanity because of the stupid men's changing rooms.	"I don’t even get why bathrooms need to be gendered anyways. Just make them all gender neutral with individual stalls and lock in them
I look almost like a man too but I use the women's. 

>I mostly pass as male so ill get shit for simply stepping foot in there

Nah, if they try to block me I immediately tell them I have a vagina. They never dared to fight me after I said that.

I would hate to have men looking at my boobs and ass. Not that women don't stare at me sometimes, but I feel less uncomfortable with women.
I feel you. Everywhere with changing rooms should have a non-binary one that is smaller but otherwise designed the same as the other two.
I empathize with your experience. 


But for what it's worth, i look fairly boyish too (sometimes) and have used the womens changing rooms in my area no problem. Sometimes i get a few looks but in gyms you just have to pick one and hope for the best. My area is a little bit more progressive tho so maybe thats the reason none of the older ladies get on my case. I kinda just end up undercover as a super butch lesbian which im personally ok with. Yanno when the alternative is someone asking whats in my pants and why im here. 


Doesnt always work out if youre on t though and have facial hair. But whichever changing room, no one judges you if you go into a stall rather than be nakey in the open. I find that most people in changing rooms are focused on themselves. 

I understand the body dysphoria that goes along with wishing you had x part to fit in or looked like them and could do the communal activity though. I wish more gyms had a gender neutral changing area.
I only recently worked out why I always felt I had to change in the toilets rather than the changing room. It wasn't just self-consciousness, it was gender, duh! It seems so obvious looking back on it
In the opening moments of the movie *Aliens*, they show future changing rooms to be non-binary, where all men and women and in-between shower and change in the same space without problem. I always hope that's the way it will eventually get.
This was a big problem for me in middle school and high school when I took physical education. I would run to the gym and enter into the changing rooms before anybody else came in, I’d hide in the bathroom stalls they had inside the locker room and get dressed there, then wait for everyone to leave so nobody could see me in the gendered locker room, and that’s when I finally exited and went to gym. I’d normally be late, but oh well
care to trade? i was a binary transwoman for two decades and got no problems, even though i wear neutral stuff most of the time, then i worked out nonbinary and had my hair cut short, so just changing my hair style wound up with ppl insisting i should go to the mens room
I've been struggling with something similar. When I go to my climbing gym (which is considered a safe space), I never know which locker room to use since I'm transmasc, but I don't pass as male. But I've been frustrated because whichever one I use, I still don't feel comfortable changing outside of a stall. And that makes everything awkward and annoying.  I feel your frustration and anger. You're not alone in feeling that. ❤️
Exactly. I think the differentiation comes from either having or not having urinals. But people with penises still need to use stalls as well, at least to poop, and even a lot of people choose to pee sitting down anyway or will use the stall to pee standing up. So that doesn't really make sense to me why urinals would make it gendered. 

One argument made against gender neutral stalls is that it makes it easier for sexual predators to get access to people of the opposite gender. But that doesn't make sense either because a lot of predators will assault people of the same gender. Among other reasons. Its transphobic bullcrap.
My thoughts exactly
Well said, it is the best argument that can be made. 

It goes straight to the fact that you have every right to use the bathroom designated for your AGAB.  

It also exposes any gatekeeping Karen as a defender of the patriarchal binary.  You shouldn't have to present a certain level of girly to enter the ladies room.

Everyone should have the right to present themselves as masculine or feminine as their spirit directs, without judgment based on their AGAB.
Yeah, same with toilets. I would rather ""all gender"" rather than non binary specifically though. I'm (sort of?) binary trans and haven't physically transitioned. I honestly would still feel anxious using a changing room if people could see top surgery scars.
Even if it’s to avoid predators, I would say that they can just have those gender neutral/family stalls that are big. And right by the entrance so a) avoids these situations because there will be people around since it’s near the entrance and b) it’s one person entering at a time
In Japan all public bathrooms have a panic button and if you push it an attendant will come immediately. It's meant for if elderly people fall down but it is sometimes used for cases of harassment

Just saying there are solutions to these problems but transphobes don't want solutions. They just want to fear monger and push us out of society
umm why agab? i assume you realize binary trans ppl do not want to use the one associated with their agab? sure i can do the vagina statement too but that is not the original equipment
I'm down for that, but yeah I'd probably still go to a stall.
Oh yeah, that's a cool idea. Where I live, there are family restrooms in some shopping centres. They full on have a place for parents to chill and small play areas for kids. They're decked out with pram friendly stalls and nappy changing stations.
I do stand corrected.  

Except for when TERFs get involved, it really is based on the genital configuration. 

Separate but equal accommodation based upon a person's sex is just as discrimitory as it is when it was also based on skin color.  And those that buy into the whole binary thing (and enforce it) just don't get they are actually supporting sexual stereotypes,  prejudice, and discrimination.
no probs, my genitals would be what is assumed in a women’s room but meant i had a vaginoplasty"	113ikws	NonBinary	129	0.99	2023-02-16 05:05:50
the bathroom thing happened to me today	I'm a senior in high school and today, as I was going to the bathroom, a freshman girl shouted at me to leave thinking I was a guy. For some context this year they put in a rule that states everyone must use the bathroom of their AGAB, despite gender identity. I usually always go for the women's bathroom vs the men's because its cleaner, so it's what I've been using since I came out as nby. The thing is though, I'm AFAB. I don't want to scare people in the bathrooms but I also would like to pee in peace. Ugh.	"I'm not saying you should do this, but I'd ask that hateful student if she needs to see my genitals in order to leave me alone. What an asshole.
USA?
Are there any less used bathrooms or private ones (like in a nurses office)?  If not it might be worth it to speak to a school counselor or general authority figure about which bathroom you’re using and make sure you have it on record.
This is the curse of more gender non conforming presentations. I don't really have ""bathroom use"" dysphoria but it's still stressful when I'm presenting more androdous. 

I have to do the debate, do I look afab? Amab? If Im going to the men's I'll probably be read as obviously trans (or super gay) which will draw hate, but the woman's I'll be read as trans (more hate) or.... Super gay.
I had that happen in public. An old woman seemed scared cus I'm quite a bit larger than she was . She asked multiple times if she was in the right restroom
I'm so sorry that happened to you :( 
I got damn hate peeing out in public/work. I don't think people understand how stressful it can be for us! 💕
I am sorry you are in this situation and that the whole legal thing is so complicated there.

I used to have this too, but of course it was a less loaded context I guess... I'm also afab and my voice is quite high. Without giving any explanations I would just talk back saying something like ""what?"" Or ""what do you mean?"" and people would feel super ashamed and confused. Honestly, I don't care about bigots or what they think of me or my gender, but I'm obviously quite old now and things are easier for me as a whole. 

Is there anyone safe in your school you can talk to?
I got so flustered in the moment I just said ""I'm nonbinary"" and went into a stall anyways. What I would have done to go back in time and tell her to mind her business
I’d do this too.  “Oh my god, I can’t believe you just asked to see my vagina, what the hell?!”  

If they want to try and embarrass me and be ridiculously offensive, I will be even more embarrassing and ridiculously offensive in turn.  

“God, what kind of pervert just asks to see someone else’s genitals in the bathroom?! What kind of predator are you?! I just wanted to pee in peace, the fuck lady!!!”
Yep. And a southern state too.
God I feel this, I don't give a fuck which bathroom I use. I only care for my own safety!! I've been given weird looks and asked if I'm in the right bathroom no matter which I used. 

One time I had a lady come in AS I WAS PEEING and she started going off about how this is the womens bathroom blah blah blah and I said something to the effect of ""would you like to see my fucking vag? I know what the sign on the goddamn door says"" when I was done I found her and yelled at her in front of all her co-workers about how she should leave people the fuck alone (she was a worker at the place). I have so many stories like this it's not even funny.
Yeah we all go through that. After the fact we all come up with super clever things we could have said during a confrontation. You'll get better at it, but I think you handled it wonderfully. 

You'll go on to live a fulfilling life and your schoolmate will be a sour, hateful person who resents everyone without realizing she's the problem.
are you at a private school or a public school?
That response was such a power move
public. I believe it's a district wide rule or something stupid
that’s really scary and i’m so sorry! it also might not be legal. have you asked your school to provide you with an alternate gender neutral bathroom? (if that’s what you want). your school/district could be at risk of losing funding as it’s violating title IX laws. wishing you the best op, hang in there 🙌

Bathroom Sign @ Sweet Melissa's in Decatur, GA		"I hate these signs. Cis people think they’re so funny but i do not. I’m not an alien or a unicorn or an object
the three genders, man, woman, alien. i know it has good intentions but man i hate this
Should I delete this then? I don't mean to offend people. I'm Enby/genderfluid and found it funny cuz like... I'm so used to seeing and going into gendered bathrooms. Both of em had that sign, so it was a nice change of pace to see that imo.
I get why some of y'all don't like it, though. It's calling us ""alien"" when we're just regular people who don't follow the gender binary. I get it, really. I just think of it like this: it's at least a small step towards inclusivity. And, given how all the boomers and ol' heads in the US Govt are tryna do away with any and everything concerning LGBTQIA+, it's nice to know that there are a lot of places like Sweet Melissa's who are at least trying to be as inclusive as possible even if it may come off the wrong way to some.
Honestly I adore the heck out of this sign and would gladly hang it on my bathroom door or use a gender neutral bathroom with an alien on it. I even saved the picture because I love it so much. Thank you for posting it!
Goss... im not an alien... What is so hard about a ""Toilet"" or ""All Genders"" sign?
Sure brought a smile to my face.
I have that “you are safe here” sticker on my fridge
i really dislike these types of signs. aliens, unicorns, etc is completely missing the point on why bathrooms need to be inclusive and what bathroom safety means.
It just has big 'i don't care if you're purple' energy. But it's better than outright hate I guess???
Ugh I didn’t even see the alien. That is super annoying.
I am an alien
id rather be an alien than a human tbh. i love these signs
i mean, i don't like these signs, but i also am glad you saw it and felt good about it. i think nonbinary folks have so many shitty experiences in public places (especially bathrooms) that it's cool when one of us has a positive experience. i don't find the signs suuuuper offensive (just kinda) and i defs don't find this post or your enjoyment of this sign to be offensive. i dunno, i think this post is fine? nothin wrong with you likin a thing!
You're allowed to like it.

Honestly, it's encouraging debate about where this is a good thing. Nobody here dislikes you for posting this- they dislike the sign.
No, you posted with good intentions. Some people like it, some including me don’t. But we are discussing it.
[deleted]
Idk, I think it's funny and I'd fall under the ""alien"" category
also! i still remember the first time i saw a sign like this. it was in a cafe about 10 years ago and there were 2 bathrooms with signs like this alien one (i think the ones i saw had an octopus instead of an alien???). i had never felt more included in a public space in my entire life. i was only visiting the city the cafe was in, but i legit debated moving there. i felt seen and welcomed. not that i identified as an octopus, but like, the cafe owners were aware ppl like me existed and i was just EUPHORIC. i spent most of my trip hanging out at the cafe, feelin like a cool bean and feelin like a badass whenever cis ppl bugged me. that was a long time ago and times have changed, but i think it's good to remember how far the tiniest gestures of inclusion can go. anyway, cheers op!
I... I thought it was funny.... cuz it's saying it doesn't matter...
Yes! We're all individuals!
I like it too."	o2uf9f	NonBinary	117	0.93	2021-06-18 17:07:16
Another bathroom selfie, another femme outfit that made me feel great today!		"Finally worked up some courage and wore this out and about today to go study at my university's library.

You look amazing!
Did you find your A-name?
Congrats on the big step, you look great in that skirt!
Awesome my Korean friend! ;)
Why only in the bathroom
For now I'm weighing the idea of Raleigh as a name (it means deer meadow and I really like deer), but I've also been considering Artemis or Apollo. If they weren't so strongly gendered I probably would've gone with one of them already, but I might use them as a middle name anyway."	d1m3km	NonBinary	112	1.0	2019-09-09 04:34:25
First time stopped going into a restroom	"No one has ever approached me in a restroom before. I default to my AGAB's restroom and got called out today. Feeling equal parts ""please just let me pee"" and validated that I was not immediately clocked as my AGAB. 

Really not sure how I feel about the interaction 🙃

Has that happened to you? How have you responded? Do you just stick to single stalls bathrooms?"	"Yeah. Restrooms are the place I get the most confirmation that I don’t look like my AGAB anymore.
[deleted]
Many years ago, I confused someone who entered my agab bathroom while i was existing, has never happened since 😔
But i hold onto that moment forever lol
r/ewphoria
I pass as male well enough, that I've used the men's a handful of times and no one said anything. But I've also been able to use the women's without incident. Now that I have more facial hair though I've just stopped using public restrooms. I'm just too anxious about getting questioned or, around where I live, I worry about people trying to get cops involved or something.
Nah I look too masculine
Prior to top surgery I was still very comfortable using the women's restroom. Since top surgery I'm almost exclusively gendered male by strangers, and that has made for some VERY uncomfortable bathroom situations. I've been once-overed a few times, mad dogged, called out, and even asked about by a small child (""mommy, why is there a boy in the girls bathroom!?""). It's now become a huge source of anxiety for me, to the point where I'm ready to cry after every public bathroom experience.   
I'm not really sure if I need to start using the men's restroom, or suck it up and deal with the harassment of the women's- but it's a shitty feeling either way.   
I'm sorry you're dealing with this. And I hope you, and all of us, find comfortable solutions to this problem.
Yeah I didn't really know either. I just walked out and said ""I'll just go find a single stall."" She motioned me out and gestured towards the other bathroom but I just walked away lol
Also awkwardly affirming best way to describe it lol
I don't want to make eye contact or conversation with *anyone* in the bathroom. I do not care why you're there. Leave me alone, I leave you alone.

The most I speak to anyone in a bathroom is warning them if a stall they're about to go into is out of toilet paper.

In fairness I think this person genuinely thought I was confused and missed the signs, nothing she did was aggressive, but I think we can trust adults to go to bathrooms that work for them"	11qv0lq	NonBinary	117	1.0	2023-03-14 03:13:38
My boss told me they will send me home and reprimand me if I don’t use the gendered bathroom they believe corresponds to my physical appearance.	"Has anyone gone through something like this?


I’m amab and have always identified with nb-ness but never embraced it as much as I would like, mostly out of self preservation and fear of losing relationships with loved ones (I live in FL, USA). 


My workplace has two **singular** bathrooms with one toilet and one door lock each with “man” and “women” signage on the door respectively. Again, these are single-use bathrooms. 


I almost exclusively use the men’s restrooms out of simplicity and again, self preservation. There are times where the men’s restroom is occupied or someone left a massive stink bomb, then I would use the women’s restroom without much thought to it like any other toilet. I understand my male coworkers would always feel some way about using the women’s restroom even under these circumstances, but this was never an issue for me personally.


Until recently, my boss announced that anyone who “pees standing up” or “identifies as male” are not allowed to use the women’s restroom (no explanation given.. we assumed it was an issue of cleanliness, or something). I always clean up after myself. I asked what about non binary and whether it was okay to pee sitting down. As soon as I asked through our work chat, I overhead them laughing to themselves in their office saying out loud “WTF is non binary?”


I had a personal conversation with them and they told me specifically, because I look like a man to them I must use the men’s restroom because “they do not offer any gender neutral restrooms”. I asked if they are the arbiter of who is man or woman and they told me yes and that this was entirely based on our physical appearances. 


Other gender conforming coworkers spoke out about this, saying this is more of an issue of cleanliness rather than sex or gender and they don’t understand why our manager is going about this is in this manner. They were ignored. I brought this conversation up again to them and I asked again whether it was okay to use either restroom when needed, they said no and I would be sent home if I did not comply. I asked them if they understood gender is a protected class same as race and sex, they stayed quiet and ultimately told me to “get a lawyer” and again laughed at my situation, saying I am the only person who has an issue with their announcement. They felt because we’re in Florida, I would not get anywhere serious with my issue.


At this point I need this job more than I am willing to risk losing it over something “trivial” (huge understatement), it’s also extremely stressful having to “watch my back” in a sense when I am at work when all I want to do is be a productive worker. I felt so disrespected and dismissed over something personal to me, something I felt was common human decency and respect between fellow people. I don’t understand why they’re behaving this way. Has anyone had similar experiences? I’m doing what I can but sometimes everything feels so useless. 

Thank you for reading. Feel free to ask any questions"	"If you're in the US, tell them to read Bostock vs Clayton County and prepare for an enormous loss in court over your Title IX rights.
I wish places would stop gendering single-stall bathrooms.  I identify as a person who has to pee, goddamnit!
They want you gone and are deliberately discriminating against you to get you to quit. Hate to be that blunt, but thats what is happening. You are protected under title 9, but theyre going to continue making your life difficult until you get a lawyer. There is likely a pro-bono law support center who can help you out.
OP- if they are trying to get you to quit- don’t. Make them fire you. More of a case in your favor this way and you should qualify for unemployment easier than if you quit. If they fire you, your case against them will just be even more ironclad. Contact resources like ACLU to get lawyer help!
Based on their reactions they sound very intolerant and malicious.  I think this discussion has shown their true colors. I would recommend laying low and trying to find a new job asap.
I just want to add to the discussion that you should make sure you're documenting everything. Every email, every conversation, date, time, who was involved, write it down in a notebook or send it as an email to yourself so you have the time stamp. Even posts like these can be helpful documentation for a case. If they fire you, you'll be able to point to posts like this and your notes to show that you were experiencing discrimination and prove that the discrimination was the cause of you being fired and not whatever other BS they might say instead to get around protected classes.
This is so fucking illegal. 

At least it is in California. Can’t speak to FL. I hope it is and you can somehow benefit from their illegal actions. Either way, I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this BS.
Malicious compliance baby. Every time you have to pee, leave. Go home, go to the gas station down the road, go wherever. When they say something, simply remind them that you aren't allowed to use the bathrooms at work per their own advice. Or, keep a skirt with you, and slide it on whenever you need to go into the ladies room. What do you mean I can't be in here? I'm dressed in women's attire, this is the women's room, what's the problem?
Jesus fucking christ. I'm sorry
Few things you can do: 1. Contact your state's LGBT advocacy group, they shod have a lots of lawyers willing to help. Or contact Lambda Legal directly, tho they are probably overloaded ATM. 2. File a complaint with your state's Equal Opportunity Commission for gender based discrimination. If your workplace retaliates against you for filing a complaint, you have a slam-dunk case--it's actually easier to prove retaliation than hostile work environment. 3. If your employer has an HR department, you can consider contacting them. This is only likely to be effective if your state has LGBT protection laws tho, cause then your manager is making the company liable for breaking the law. 4. Start looking for another job, because even if your complaint is substantiated/case gets taken by a lawyer, your manager is trying to force you out, and you're gonna need a paycheck while any settlement comes through, if there even is one.
I think there’s a way you can file against them without paying for a lawyer, or without involving a lawyer at all. Gender IS a protected class and they should be scared.
I understand you don't want to quit & you shouldn't have to. But they know the game they're playing. Under capitalism, many people are forced to work in situations they'd rather not. And when we complain, they go on about ""bootstrapping"" & some other boomer bs. They're banking on you not pursuing.

They'll do all that little things to push you out. They won't fire you right away, just make you miserable until you quit or they make up enough infractions that they can fire you for cause so you don't get unemployed benefits.

If you have the resources, there's probably a lawyer who can give you options. Consultations are often free. But even if you found one who'd take your case pro bono, it would still have a cost in time, frustration, emotion, etc.
It is not title IX but, title VII civil rights act
Yup. File title IX. This is the way. And *technically* they told you to get a lawyer so..... You are just following orders....
I had been searching Reddit and other sites for similar stories but could barely find any that did not end up with employees having to quit their jobs. I did not know they had a ruling regarding this so recently, must be part of the reason why. Thank you for sharing this
I feel like this is the lowest hanging fruit of inclusion.  All you have to do is change the signs! I don't understand why we haven't even achieved this benchmark yet.
I agree. At this point I am not giving them any reason to fire me outside of this specific issue; come in on time and always clock out for my breaks, keeping mistakes to an absolute minimum. It’s just difficult to think of actually going through with any legal routes and how things may end up for me. I wish they would just respect me/my wishes so I can do my job instead of “getting a lawyer” and having to make a big stink. 

Wish me luck. Thank you for your response
This wasn’t even the first time they spoke about this and showed their complete unprofessionalism. Initially a year ago, they had included a two-buttons meme with a stereotypical SJW-type choosing between “male” and “female” asking WTF to do… I had just been hired so I did not want to rock the boat so quickly. Incredibly disheartening
This! I would even take pictures of the empty bathrooms as part of it and ask the boss for their statement about the issue to be sent in an email and document the request of that as well.
Appreciate it.🖤 I keep convincing myself I’m ultimately the one making an issue out of all this (and technically I am), but the lack of basic human respect is what bothers me and keeps me wanting to push back. I can’t imagine if a trans brother or sister were to work here and have to hear or go through any of this. These type of people will never change their minds until it happens to them or they’re slapped with a lawsuit (and even then).. This is America, I guess. Thank you for the comment
So sorry to hear about this. You gotta get out of there! Even though you might have some legal protections realistically speaking it’s an uphill battle and and going to court or hiring a lawyer is no walk in the park 😢 I can only imagine it all. I’m so sorry.
Do you still have that? You'll want it for your lawsuit.
Yeah last time they flat out rejected my request to answer in writing through the group chat when I asked for clarification.. and then I asked for a policy or any writing of getting reprimanded for the bathroom usage and they laughed it off with the same “get a lawyer” remark.

Welcome to my bathroom! The mirror is filthy but I think I liked my outfit today? 😂		"I need a haircut...rull rull behd...  O.o;
Your outfit is great! and your jaw line is beautiful.
At least it looks so good at that length!
Of course, I encourage you to go for one if you feel like it but I agree with the others-- it looks amazing! And the asymmetry calls back to your outfit, too.
Y'all are so nice. 😂 I don't wanna cut the top, just the sides; I have to put a lot more effort in to make my hair look less ""traditionally femme"" (on days where I'm not feeling that way, or if I feel the need to present more androgynous/masc to confuse strangers enough to not call me ""ma'am"", lol).

But since posting this pic, the sides are juuust about long enough I can do tiny ponytails in the back to complete the flophawk... 😋
Thank you, I was really feelin' the combo of flowy and tight!

And thank you for complimenting my jaw, lol. 😂 I've actually become really dysphoric about it the last couple years...it's been becoming more rounded, less defined...more like my mum's. 😞 Being in pictures with her was already uncomfortable because she doesn't acknowledge my gender, she doesn't use my pronouns, I don't even know if she takes trans people in general seriously...so seeing my face next to hers in a photo, looking more like hers and less like mine, has been very distressing.

She is a pretty stereotypically feminine woman (though she is also a Career Woman ™️ in healthcare, very take-no-shit and fight-for-the-patients), and although she is very giving, she is also pretty stuck in her R-ticket Fox-News ways. She's not a MAGA-head, thankfully. But yeah, seeing myself look more like her...not comforting, not gender-affirming. 😭

But, I did discover earlier this year that one of my hormone levels was a bit high (DHEA, which has a lot to do with estrogen production). It's possible that that has contributed to my jawline softening. But I got on medication to lower it, and I've also been eating better (and less eating my feelings   >.>   ), have gotten a little leaner. So maybe between all that, my jaw is getting less rounded and I can just take your compliment without freaking out. 😂🤣😂

gender neutral disability accessible restroom has different code than men and women's restrooms	i'm at a cafe in an office complex where the bathrooms (part of the complex not the cafe) have codes to get in. the men and women's restroom codes are back at the cafe counter and the cafe employees can just tell you the code. but the gender neutral accessible bathroom has a different code that only the security guard has. and when you want to get into the accessible bathroom, the security guard has to enter the code and won't share it. so when i have to pee (which is unfortunately frequent) i have to ask the security guard to let me into the bathroom. on top of that, none of the bathrooms in the women's restroom (wasn't brave enough to go in the men's so didn't see) have accessible stalls so no stall big enough for a walker or wheelchair and the doors open inward and there are no handlebars for stability. being both disabled and non-binary, it fucking sucks that the accessible and gender neutral restroom is being separated in this way. it's embarrassing that i have to ask someone else to let me into the bathroom so i can use it! and i bet I fucking bet that the reason they don't let customers have the code for the accessible restroom is some anti-homeless policy. ableism and sexism all in one.	"That sounds questionably legal, ADA restrooms need to be accessible.
What the fuck? This is complete bullshit...

They should not do something like this. I suppose you tried to report it and it went nowhere?

God, this kind of stuff makes me feel sick.
You should contact an employment legal aid organization in your area and/or a national disability rights organization like DREDF or DRA. That seems extremely likely to be an ADA violation purely for accessible stall reasons but also new litigation is attempting to apply ADA protections to prevent discrimination on the basis of transgender status. All in all, this should not be happening.
Once went to a restaurant in San Francisco and my friend, the the waiter had perceived as male, asked for the bathroom code for me

I was presenting particularly fem this day, Halloween, and decided to use the women’s restroom. The code didn’t work! Used it on the men’s, that worked lol just used the men’s room 

Waiter later came up to me and told me the women’s restroom code. Uhh thanks..?
Hit up your local newspaper
 Where I live, if you want to use an accessible toilet in a shopping centre, you need to buzz in and talk to a microphone and explain to the security that you need to pee. They have a camera to check if you're ""really"" disabled or ""just seeking to use drugs"". On top of being humiliating the buzzers often don't even work so people have to walk extra to find someone who can contact the security. Human rights, ay?
ADA🔥
Oh wow that’s really embarrassing
Yeah that's definitely not ADA compliant. The pure fucking ableism and infantilization that if you're disabled you can't fucking pee without a guards permission. There's no reason why they can't give out the disabled code like they do for the other restrooms except ableism, and it's almost definitely illegal.
OP didn't say they're in the US.
no i didn't even think about the ADA implications

I've finally found the right bathroom for me after 25 years, I feel so euphoric (they/them)		"That’s incredible! Also, sick mask!
My favorite was a bar I went to recently that had on both bathrooms ""Go wherever you want.  We all have our own business to take care of.""
Omg finally a bathroom for people who only wear half a dress! (But honestly this makes me really happy)
where is that i must know

i only got visible abs when i lost too much weight (for me). :c 

if you're able to safely go to gyms where you live, there's an ab machine that helped me a lot. the kind that looks like an elevated chair, where you pull down a bar and do crunches basically.

🚹🚺 Favorite way to respond to people who think you’re in the wrong bathroom... GO‼️ (Pic is of me in a gender neutral bathroom.)		"Look around with concern, ""Are you sure it's not you?"" Or ""what, is there not a toilet in here?""
[removed]
A solid “why” is always good. And also asking if they usually check everyone’s junk in the bathroom.
I wanna use the bathroom. Pretty sure this is the place.
Mine is
""is it illegal for me to piss
Following, gonna need help with this
Damn, knew I shoulda studied
Then WTF are you in here for then...😳😳
I was gonna suggest ""What, are you gonna check?"" but that might seem like an invitation to some people -\_-

I've only just come out and the public restroom issue is very new for me... We only have gendered bathrooms at my work and I identify as neither, so I guess I can't piss there anymore?
That should honestly just be my response every time 😅😅
It happens more than I expect it to. Most of the time I don’t have time to even respond. The ones that are the hardest for me are when it’s a little kid asking their parent “is that a boy or a girl?” I wait to hear what the parent says before I respond. The best was just a parent covering their kid’s eyes with disgust, as if to say - “don’t look directly at the freak, it might pee on you. 😅🤣🙄
I feel you on the lack of options. I use the “family” one whenever I can (before I was required to work at home). One of the best parts of quarantine/working from home is pissing without a care. 

And you’re right, the “you gonna check” part gives me straight up panic like the scene from Boys Don’t Cry when Brendan gets his pants ripped down and they force his GF to look.
wow what the fuck
Yeah, life in a red state while existing as NB. 🙄

Utah was by far the worst, Arizona is pretty shitty, Oklahoma and West Virginia both blow as well. I travel for work a lot and can confidently report that assholes are everywhere ...
As an AFAB NB who grew up in Utah, this is oddly validating. So much of my trauma was the result of the grossly binaried and religiously oppressive culture that is Utah.
I’m glad it can help provide some perspective at least! Utah was by far the worst for me of all my travels. I sincerely hope you’ve been able to compartmentalize that experience because it’s fucked up and not a good indicator of the broader world, IMHO!"	hdmwm8	NonBinary	93	0.99	2020-06-22 06:30:54

best gender neutral bathroom iconography I've seen		"I feel like 'whichever' isn't actually all that inclusive though and the image makes me feel like half feminine and half masculine which many nonbinary people aren't. I'm maverique for example. I feel like just 'bathroom' would be sufficient.
I genuinelly think about running an establishment that the bathrooms arent gendered, just pick what is free
interesting, I'd never heard the term maverique before. iconography is important tho... we need to develop a NB icon.
I think it'd be cool if instead of referencing the person using the bathroom, it could just say 'bathroom'.

Speak for yourself, toilet! You don't know who's using you!
I agree icons are important, but yes we do.
Can’t it just be a picture of a toilet?
not a bad idea :P

A bright shirt would add a good pop of color I think too.
Thanks! The shirt and jacket are what I normally wear too, so they help make the skirt feel more natural. Still need to get used to wearing one, but I really like how it looks!

I wish I were a binary trans person	"I didn't want to invalidate my binary trans guy friend by saying this when he shared his realizing-I'm-trans and coming out story but...

I was jealous. Of how (relatively) clear cut everything seemed. How all the signs pointed to one destination, how everything about binary masculinity just felt right to embrace, how every day post-starting-to-transition just feels right.

I mean, I know it's not really that easy, but I'm not invalidating anyone and saying it is, but I wish I were also just a binary trans man who could embrace everything about masculinity and not be stuck in this weird limbo of being too dysphoric about femininity to not transition but too estranged from masculinity to do a regular binary transition, not worry about having to stop or cycle on/off HRT, perpetually worry about what bathroom to use with no end goal in sight, feeling like I blend in with neither social space or group.

I was kind of hoping that nonbinary was just my stage between identifying cis and binary trans, but I've been thinking about it and it just doesn't seem to be the case. :( "	"oof, owie this hits close to home. I'm amab personally and I view myself as so masculine that I think taking estrogen will just make me a bit more androgynous which tbh is my goal.
I believe this is something most people on here can relate to. While I can't tell you anything that will solve your problem or make anything easier for you, I can tell you that you're not alone and that together we will figure it out.
op, i am in the exact same boat. i’m afab and just now realizing that feeling not confident in my body wasn’t just body image issues but it was dysphoria. it doesn’t feel right being cis and i’m not 100% a trans man. falling in the in between makes me feel like an ‘other’ ... 
BUT, there are more like us out there and we are not alone. pls message me if u need to talk! ❤️
>stuck in this weird limbo of being too dysphoric about femininity to not transition but too estranged from masculinity to do a regular binary transition

Yep yep yep. I know a lot of people who REALLY identify with a gender and the sex it's connected to, but I also know a lot of people who don't find their binary identity important but who would also never think of themselves as another sex. I can't think of myself as a man or a woman, because I don’t really know what either of them are on an ""in-the-head"" level, you know? So identity-wise, I'm indifferent at best and depressed/confused at worst. If I transition, I might feel the same emotional disconnection but in a different body, but I do know very deeply that my body right now is wrong. So I will transition.
While I feel like this at times, it just doesn't feel much more right to say I am a binary trans woman than say I a man. 

One can look at the negatives, and be unhappy, or one can look at all the positives. There are no rules or standards, the whole mall is your department, no activity is off limits, and why blend in when you can set yourself apart?
I can certainly relate as well. I'm an AMAB person and I am only really sure of what I am not without any real idea of what I am. 

I sometimes wish I was just a binary trans woman. Cause even if transistion is hard, at least I would have a clear direction I wanted to go. 
I feel this way a lot, my boyfriend is a nonbinary trans guy who was more binary earlier in transition and we're both sorta jealous of each other :P But you did a great job articulating this exact feel. Oof.
Oh wow yeah all of this. Enby shit is hard and it certainly doesn't help that we are basically trailblazing as an open identity (at least in western culture).

Being a gender pioneer is friggin tough.
I can relate a lot.  Amab, 10 years on hrt and I am just starting to accept and embrace that I am enby.   I thought the fail mode would push me into a femenine position but being authentic to me means accepting I am both male and female.   But I still have some jelousy of how easy transtion is for binary folk. 
At this point, I just wish I was cis. And probably straight too.
I hope it goes well for you!! I'm kind of hoping that I'll get lucky and end up andro on T, but I'm also worried that that doesn't happen and/or my brain decides it wants to be genderfluid...
Me too.
> just now realizing that feeling not confident in my body wasn’t just body image issues but it was dysphoria

oh god this is SO real, like everyone reinforces the idea that your problems with your body, posture, walk, voice, etc. are just feminine insecurity, so I could never place what was wrong until I started trying masculine presentation and mannerisms on a whim and feeling like ""oh, it was that?"". Except, then I get around guys and feel like I'm putting on a silly man act without knowing what I'm doing :( 
yeah, this exactly! I have this weird sense, constantly, of missing out on something I'm supposed to ""get"" about being a guy in guys' spaces, and a woman in women's spaces. I tried talking to my binary friends about it and they were kinda confused and didn't know what I was talking about :( 
I think I'm learning to accept my nonbinary identity, but the medical transition part makes it really hard. If there were some kind of HRT lite that makes you end up andro, I'd be totally happy.
ahhh, yes. I notice that too. I've just come to realize that I need to express myself truly and maybe if it might feel silly sometimes, it feels better than presenting femininely. 
Yeah I feel that. I know that it's important for women to share things with women, and men with men, but I'm just too wobbly to get the full connection. Like a more sympathetic connection than empathetic, or like I'm observing rather than participating.

I do enjoy this. I could go for creative bathroom signage.		"Why not just have a sign that says ""toilet"" and not even focus *ironically* on gender.

A toilet is a toilet, it doesn't care what junk you have, its purpose is for your shit to go in it.
I really am not a fan, it seems evasive to me and still implies that each bathroom is only for one gender.  At least for now, while folks are still not used to all-gender bathrooms, I think all-gender bathrooms should be clearly marked as such.  
I do too. Others on this sub have criticized such signs as offensive to NB/GNC folks. 
I think if the world did this there wouldn't be such a stigma with what bathroom you can use. It's fun, creative, and I wish I saw it around! 
I love this! 
Shoulda given the merperson a crew cut and the centaur flowing locks.
It looks like it's 3D printed, cool!!
I'm with ya! ""toilet with urinal"" or ""toilet without urinal"" is all we really need to know! 
At my workplace, the unisex bathrooms used to have a male/female sign, but a few weeks ago, all these bathrooms got official new signage, which is refreshingly neutral: a picture of a toilet bowl and a wheelchair, underneath the text ""All-gender restroom"".

Sure, just restroom would have sufficed, too; but I don't mind the explicit statement ""All-gender"" because it puts the emphasis on inclusion into the foreground.
It's funny. That's why
Because sometimes it's fun to be kitschy and cute. Jokes are fun. ""Bathroom"" is functional, but boring. It's like saying ""can't we all just wear black chucks and forget about all the pointless adornment?"" 
People already think we don't exist and aren't real, comparing us to things that don't exist and aren't real isn't really the best way to get them to accept us.
Exactly!
Do you *really* think anyone that isn't one of us is looking at that and thinking that though? This is pretty much the one time I actually think people are making a problem out of something tiny. There's no way any cis person sees those and thinks anything other than ""oh that's cute"" or ""those goddamn pinko liberals with their fancy snowflake blah blah blah"" "	8czrl0	NonBinary	76	0.91	2018-04-17 20:27:46

I got misgendered 21 times in the span of 2 minutes	"I wish I was kidding. I was sobbing in a bathroom at a ""youth mental health centre"" which is SUPPOSEDLY LGBT+ friendly. I've been going there weekly for two and a half years. My girlfriend was arguing with a person of power outside the door (long story for another subreddit)

My girlfriend counted how many times this cis person in a position of power at this company misgendered me. My girlfriend corrected her every time, getting more frustrated as time went on. And this cis person in a position of power at a ""safe space"" for diverse people said ""I'm sorry, it's just hard for me""

I've introduced myself there every week with they/them pronouns. And I still got misgendered 21 times in two minutes.

After two and a half years there, I won't be going back anymore."	"I'm so fucking sorry for you. Fuck that person, and fuck that ""safe space"" for hiring them.
I find sometimes ""safe spaces"" can be much worse than random spaces. My sympathies.
I know how that feels.  Sometimes when I am at a restaurant and the server is talking to me it is 'sir' every other word and place someone could fit it it.  And I am wearing a dress and presenting myself in an obviously non-masculine way.  However, I don't get upset after the first occurrence because they don't know me and maybe I am in their eyes a non-conforming ""sir"".  And I am totally cool with guys who that is true for.  But, for me, I am more sensitive to being misgendered after I have either introduced myself or have asked them nicely to not call me ""sir"".  Regular pronouns such as ""he, him, his"" do not hurt as much and can tolerated those to a much higher threshold unless the person knows my preferred pronouns and then continues to use the non-preferred pronouns. 

The ""I'm sorry, it's hard for me"" is such a lame excuse.  Its called professionalism.  They are serving the public.  And in this case, a clientele that is sensitive to these things.   If this is too hard for them, then they should be in a cube doing a task where human interaction is minimal.  

I am sorry you experienced this.
I'm sorry
Would probably be a good idea to leave a review to this effect on Google Maps if you're comfortable with that!  You can always create a dummy account if you don't want the review associated with your main.
If this person in power has anyone they are answerable to, contact those people and relay your experience. Have your gf relay hers. Explain how this incident has destroyed your trust in their mental health center, which relies 100% on developing trust! If there is no one accountable, leave a review on websites with 1 star. Trust me, people like me takes those negative reviews very seriously, as I've had bad experiences with mental health care professionals too.
21?! FUCKING?!?! TIMES?!?!?! I feel SO sorry for you. I'm not open about being non-binary, at least not yet. I feel really uncomfortable being called ""he"", but I'm worried about coming out, ESPECIALLY after my family literally told me they don't believe in being non-binary and that it's ""not real"". I hope it gets better for you, and all the people out there who get misgendered due to ignorance and insensitivity.

Upvote for the petition to fire the idiot who somehow misgendered someone in an LGBTQ+ Safe Space for the love of A×20
That's absolutely brutal. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I hope you find a more comfortable space.

And props to your girlfriend. She did amazing in correcting the person in power.
I'm so sorry. Like...that person could have used just your name and dropped ALL pronouns. It's no excuse to find it difficult to remember someone's pronouns. It sounds like they blatantly didn't try.

I agree that you should say something though. Or write something. Or write to the other staff members. Or ask the other youth if they've experienced something similar with that same person. Because if they have, your speaking out could help them speak out too. Best of luck.
Her difficulty with remembering OP's pronouns is in a different solar system than the difficulty OP has in living their truth and hoping someone treats them with dignity even once during the day. Or even hoping to get through a day feeling safe, depending on their circumstance. This woman should not be in a position to deal with people.
That is what I tried to say regarding the woman who is dealing with people."	c5q1zz	NonBinary	72	0.99	2019-06-26 13:50:02

Some days are good, some I remember that this world was not made for people like me.	"Today I was having fun with my friend, we where out shopping having fun eating ice cream. And I needed to wash my hands. I’m afab and unfortunately very fem presenting so I usually use the female bathrooms but cause u had my friend (who’s a cis man with me) he was like “yeah just go to the guys one with me”, so I did. A man yelled at me from across the bathroom asking if I was a woman or man and even after I said I’m a man over and over he wouldn’t stop. Eventually he made some comment about me not going any further into the bathroom well laughing and left.

Ik it’s not a lot and I’m lucky he was “nice” but it’s just sad knowing I’m not welcome in those spaces Ig. It was so scary. It’s been so hard for me to try take a stand and be confident in who I am. I’m not strong, I’m not brave, I don’t fight back. I don’t want my existence to be something worth commenting on. What if my friend wasn’t just behind the wall, what if that man was more aggressive. I don’t want to live in fear. I don’t want to live in this tiny female body everyone thinks they have a right to. 

I want to have a bathroom I feel welcome in. I want to feel safe."	"I wish all bathrooms were single person, but in public ones why can't people mind their own fucking business? I am quite masc so I'm not comfortable going in the women's washroom to avoid making anyone uncomfortable, but I'm uncomfortable going in the men's room. There's no winning. Usually I'll just hold it til I get home.
Ugh yeah I relate. I'm 5'3 and petite and I hate knowing that anyone who wants to could overpower me. Honestly it's a big source of social dysphoria for me :(
I was in a restaurant the other day with bathrooms labeled ""all-gender (with urinals)"" and ""all-gender (no urinals)"" and I can't use em but I'll be damned if I didn't march my afab ass into that urinal-bedecked bathroom like I owned it
I feel this. Some days when I’m presenting very masc and my friends say I pass as a guy I’m terrified to go into the women’s bathrooms because I don’t want to bother anyone in there. I have been given weird looks before and I hate making people feel unsafe. But when I go to the men’s bathroom, they also clearly see that I’m not a man, either. It just feels so awkward. I love when I can find a single toilet bathroom or the VERY few and far between gender neutral one. I typically just take family ones if I can manage to find them.
Same...
I don't use men's bathrooms for that reason, but I'm double equipped to react violently if anyone gets in my face about my gender presentation on the streets.

I was exposed to violence at home, in school (for being neuro-divergent and masculine) and attacked in some street crimes. I also grew up watching crime on TV. I ended up developing PTSD. You know, one day I just got tired of it all and begun carrying weapons and training in self defense. Its been a long time that nothing happens thou. I think that my thousand yard stare, short white hair and muscular build scare people away even when I'm not trying.

Weirdly enough most of the time when I'm in women's bathroom they don't bother me, in fact they tend to smile even sometimes. I keep to myself and avoid eye contact. I would prefer using gender neutral bathrooms thou.

But you deserve to be in this planet as much as anybody else, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
With guys, it’s all about not backing down, you did the right thing. If someone sees that you’re just not going to back off, it will usually cause them to at least hesitate. If all else fails, carry pepper spray
For your safety I would advise you not to use a man's bathroom if you're fem presenting. Most people are ignorant on queer issues and things could absolutely have gone wrong for you. The first rule is to stay safe.

With that being said, I am so sorry. It must have been really scary and frustrating. The world hasn't been made for people like us, but slowly we're gonna make it so everyone who comes after us, has it better and better until things work the right way. I hope you can find comfort in your friends and in the LGBT community. You are your identity, not what they see you. Sending you love.
Unfortunately holding it isn’t an option for people who have gut or bladder issues :/
Yeah it’s just soo harddd…
Yeah it’s awful. I feel so week. Most of my female friends are also taller then me. I hate everything about it
Omg that’s amazing!!
*Fuck* yes, that is how we **slay**.
Yeah. It’s soo hard !!!
It sucks
Thanks!! It’s so hard. I also am nerodivergent and have ptsd but the ptsd is just from my parents. It’s so hard for me to stand up for myself.
Yeah
Thanks so much. Yeah I always use female bathrooms but my cis friend convinced me to go with him.
Absolutely, it's not always an option to wait which of course is why they exist anyway. Just wish the norm was a private form of public bathroom.
There is not much you can do about parents, best is to put all focus on becoming independent. 
If you have the chance please find a krav maga gym.

Does this makes sense as a way to explain what it's like to be non-binary in a binary-centric society?	"This was a random thought, but it might be a way to help people understand what it's like for us, or at least me.

Many aspects in U.S. society divide people by gender or make them explicitly or implicitly declare that they are male or female - public bathrooms, men's and women's clothing departments, driver's licenses, registering for sporting events or sport leagues that are all-male or all-female, etc. What if instead of dividing people by gender, we did it by eye color but we only gave people the options of ""brown"" and ""blue?"" What would this mean for the people with green or hazel eyes? 

Allegedly they only make up 2% of the population, so it's not a big deal to ignore them, right? (sarcasm) Just make them pick brown or blue, even though neither is correct but their eye color is probably closer to one than the other. Or they can get colored contacts to disguise their true color to fit in with the rest of society. 

Does that make sense? I'm sure some people would respond that eye color is genetic and something a person can't change, to which I would respond, ""Exactly."" I didn't choose to be non-binary. It's what I am; it's how I was born. Just like I can't control that I was born with blue eyes. I can adjust my mannerism and dress to try to fit in to a binary-centric world, but it would be a lie. "	"This is useful.
This is much less culturally relevant than it used to be, but I sometimes describe it as everyone being either Team Edward or Team Jacob, and not only insisting that you pick a side, but completely unable to understand why you wouldn't want to or feel like you couldn't, because their team is So Obvious to them.
As a green-grey eyed NB, I totally support this. :)
You can have surgery to change your eye color. And absolutely. I def agree with this description. 
I think it's useful, but I'm weary about placing too much emphasis on physical attributes when discussing gender.
Thanks. I wondered about that too. If I write a blog post about this, I'll probably include that it's an imperfect analogy, but I hope it captures the same idea/feeling of what it's like to be non-binary in a society that wasn't created with us in mind."	84dzq1	NonBinary	73	0.98	2018-03-14 14:55:42

i used to do something like this but id put sharpie notes in hidden places all around my school. most of them were painted over but i still like to hope some r still there and still making ppl feel a lil better about things
High school was meh. It existed. Shit got really fucking rough for most of it. Puberty, societal/peer pressure, lack of experience, and more all played into it. I started blooming in college when I met a bunch of different people and started to expand.

My library's bathrooms		"ah yes, the three genders: man, woman and disabled
We need more bathrooms like this. I heard there’s a new law that all single occupancy restrooms have to be like this starting next year.
As an agender person and former librarian, this makes me happy on several levels 💛💜🖤
Wow
Maybe one day we can have bathrooms that say all gender bathroom? No picture needed.
My Kroger has a bathroom like this!

My parents also took a picture of a bathroom with a sign that said ""Man? Woman? Alien? We don't care! Just remember to wash your hands.""

Made me laugh lol

Can the world hurry up and give us gender neutral bathrooms?? (Please)	"I don't feel comfortable in male bathrooms whenever I'm dressed ""fem"". Wearing a dress is just asking for abuse! There is absolutely no reason why train stations, malls, shopping centres and large institutions can't construct gender neutral bathrooms. Some days I dress so I can pass, just to use a female bathroom.

The weird thing is that I have never experienced abuse 10 meters outside of a bathroom. The world is fine with me wearing a skirt/dress in public or on the beach, right up until a bathroom. I'm fortunate enough to be andro and cute (thanks hrt), but it just makes the fear worse in a male bathroom. I'm a woman with a beard in their eyes.I've been pinned against a wall twice by ""blokes"" and literally got punched once. I can't use a urinal (unthanks hrt) so often I just need to bounce in place as men stare, waiting for a gross cubicle covered in piss.

I can't go in the female toilets because I would be arrested, I can't go in the male toilets because I'm fearful, and I can't use disabled toilets because I'm not evil. I literally plan my outings around cafes/bars that have neutral bathrooms. 
Rant over,"	"I don't understand why bathrooms are ever designed as communal spaces in the first place. Everyone needs safety and privacy in there regardless of gender or any other factor!!
I also wish more places in the world had more gender neutral bathrooms. It would honestly make me feel not as dysphoric and awkward when having to pick ""one or the other."" The only really gender neutral bathrooms are those at where you said and some bathrooms for ""families,"" which I guess would be considered neutral.
I literally had a dream the other night and got super excited over really nice neutral restrooms. Weirdest happy dream, but yeah can we PLEASE get more safe toilets? Like damn. Target is good about it but most of my city is not.
Agreed, problem is that I'm still closeted. So I couldn't use it.
I get this entirely, and I’m sorry people have given you abuse for being yourself. 

Although I do think the bathroom sitch is getting better. I stopped into a coffee shop in a small, mostly Mormon farm town a few days ago, and their bathrooms were specifically labeled “all gender.” As an older person I can promise you that wouldn’t have happened 20 or even 10 years ago. 

Progress is slow, but I think we’ll get there someday.

This needs to be in front of every bathroom		"I like having gender neutral restrooms, and I somewhat enjoy the playful tone here but these always annoy the hell out of me because it’s just another version of the “I identify as an attack helicopter” slur shit and I don’t want to be trivialized by every token accommodation of me.
I know people worry this is the “attack helicopter” meme shit, but irl the only places I’ve seen these signs are in LGTBQ friendly spaces where I’ve felt totally comfortable. I’m sure other have different experiences tho
I feel like women would just go to the mermaid one and men would go to the pirate one. People will gender everything as binary lmao
I think in a mostly cis context/place that would make me feel uneasy.
Nah. I'm a person - not a mythical creature.
See a lot of people think these are transphobic but like I think they are fun. I’m an enby and I have never actually seen a sign like that (in person). I do agree though that you do get the crappy “attack helicopter” stuff with these types of people.
 I think this is coming more from the perspective of mocking the fact that we gender bathrooms and *not* mocking nonbinary people (by pointing out that we shouldn't be obsessed with gendering bathrooms and should just focus on peeing and washing our hands completely outside of what gender is using which bathroom) but I definitely get how it could be interpreted as mocking nonbinary people for wanting gender neutral bathrooms ('my gender is a mermaid!!!') or just as weirdly performative.
It isn’t the same thing but it still contextualizes us as the joke at the limit of someone’s tolerance. It allows the attack helicopter shit to continue because it’s literally equating gender identity with mermaids and pirates and “whatever”. This sign may go up in friendly places but it has an effect.
Yeah but that’s on the same door.
They’re not directly transphobic, that’s not what I meant. They’re well intentioned but tone deaf. “Man, woman, fish-person, alien robot, whatever dude just use the restroom.” I don’t care if someone is trying to be accepting. I appreciate that, but don’t make me the unnecessary punchline. Just make it a gender neutral restroom and don’t make jokes about me. It’s like if someone gave a speech about how racist they aren’t, then ended it by asking to touch a black woman’s hair.
I don’t think it has bad intent. I think it has bad effect. It provides cover for mockery by placing the joke on the concept of alternative gender identities, and by using a tone of “sure whatever just don’t bother me about it.”
Ohhh, definitely didn't notice that lol
Yeah I get you- I wasn’t trying to imply you think they are transphobic but I just have seen a lot of people go off at them! But yes I do see your view
You bring up a lot of good points, but I still think nonbinary people especially should be allowed to foster different (or multiple) interpretations of what this means and whether or not they like or dislike it. I initially read it as 'the thing being mocked here is the binary gendering of bathrooms', likely because I've seen these kind of signs before but with much more abstract things (a fish and a sandal, for example, and usually for the purpose of confusing or upending cis people's desire to police who goes into which bathroom by highlighting how nonsensical it is by placing two literal non-gendered objects) and without the 'whatever' (which I do think changes the tone of this to more of what you're talking about). But yeah, your definitely allowed not to like it, your opinion is in the majority if we take upvotes to mean anything, but like other people are allowed to disagree.  I don't know if it requires a reply to every comment that is fine with it explaining why we are wrong.
Also it still supports a gender binary implicitly. It has two silhouettes which are each pretty obviously heavily gendered. It’s a step in the right direction no doubt but a fairly small one that has the effect of slowing future progress.
Sorry I don’t mean to say that people who are fine with it are wrong. I’m just trying to clarify what I meant because other replies directly mentioned my position as a counter. It’s perfectly fine for anyone to not be bothered by this or to be amused by it. I personally find it a fun design but just think it’s problematic in a few ways."	kvjcoz	NonBinary	63	0.93	2021-01-12 03:31:25

I’m non binary,biologically a female-would it be wrong if I went to the men’s bathroom?	"Hi, I’m biologically a female but I identify as non binary non or agender. I feel like I’m either something in between or none at all. 

I have an androgynous look and sometimes I get mistaken for a boy. Would it be wrong if I went into the men’s bathroom? I feel like if a non binary person (but biologically a male) went into a female bathroom it would be different because woman are always locked in the bathroom stalls but with men, there’s also urinals and you know, they’re exposing a part of themselves in a men setting so if I came in and a guy happened to be using a urinal would be wrong of me to go into a men’s bathroom? 

I go to highschool and they have this shitty thing where, all women’s bathrooms are on floor 0 and all men’s bathrooms are on floor 1. And my home class is on floor 1 so men’s bathrooms are always closer and our breaks are short so sometimes I can’t get to a women’s bathroom quickly enough so it would be more convenient to just use a men’s one."	"Honestly i do it sometimes bc when i go to the women's room there's always ladies going ""excuse me!! Get out!!!"" they ve even chased me into the bathrolm, knocking on the door yelling. So much for ""we can tell who's a ~real~ woman""
Go wherever you feel more safe! Depending on how you are read by others, you may get more flack from cis women in the women’s bathroom thinking you’re AMAB.
Because of the current social situation I would say that using any bathroom for anyone who may be deemed as queer/androgynous has benefits and negatives, at least for me (when I am physically fine ish I look androgynous) I would just use whatever bathroom my I.D card forces me too.
At my work, we have M/F single restrooms for staff. I use the men’s room as often as possible! If I don’t belong in either restroom, I’d rather use the one that makes me lol. I’ve used the men’s room in public places like at concerts or bars without issue too.
As amab I would not care if women used the men's restroom, unless everyone did so it was packed :p. When at home I dress however I want, but I'm an introvert and hate explaining things, so outside the house I present man to avoid complication. Lame but I work from home so it's not a problem 95% of the time.
I'm glad you're bringing this up and exploring this.  First, it's shitty that the bathrooms are split between floors and gendered. Sounds like something the student council can address. I'm a non-binary human as well and I see it as my right, at least here in CO, that I can use whichever bathroom I'd like. Especially if I'm packing. I'd say do what makes you comfortable and stand up for yourself and other gender-non-conforming ppl at your school. It's time for us to take action now to exercises our rights and stand up to these wack radical extremists trying to shift our gov into a theocracy. Okay, I've been listening to a lot of political podcasts. I apologize for overworking the bathroom issue. You are amazing and have a support behind you to make the choice that you make every moment you express yourself and desires.
Agender afab here too, I use men’s from time to time but only when I’m presenting masculine and they’re not busy.
I'm an AFAB femby generally I use women's bathroom but I'm for bathroom anarchy. Gendered bathroom is a fucking moronic concept made again to repress everyone just in the slight chance it could stop predators. Most predators are acquaintances of their victims and if they're not, doors don't stop them. People literally act predatory in public transports all the time, in from of everyone of all gender. They don't give a shit.   


So yeah if the women's bathroom is full, I will use the men's bathroom I don't care and if someone is mentioning it they better be ready for the rant of the century. Use whatever bathroom you like. It's fucking stupid.
NO use whatever bathroom you want
I love it! Right on!
Go whichever one you're comfortable and if someone screams get out

I don't have a solution for that it's your problem not mine
I see, that didn’t happen to me personally because there’s actually quite a lot of androgynous looking people at our school so I think everyone’s used to it but sometimes I worry still
This
Yeah I find it dumb that it’s separated into 2 genders...plus they make it extra difficult in my school since each gender has a separate floor for the bathrooms and I actually made a typo in my post but our main classroom is actually on the third floor...there’s no bathrooms on the third floor...only on the 2nd and 1st. And the woman’s bathroom is allll the wayyy down. Bruh..and it’s an art school. You’d think there would be a good enough architect to actually design a proper school but NO. 

So yeah I need to do my business and I’m going in whatever bathroom I feel like going to lmfao
Yeah that’s what I’ve done a few times too. Plus with the mask I can pass as a guy even more easily
Lord that's even worse! Yeah you do you!!

"My boss hung ""All Gender Restroom"" signs!"	"My store is moving to a new location in a few weeks, and tonight is the first time I've been in the new space. We're moving out of a 40 year old place into a space that we've been able to design basically from scratch. Part of this means that we have two big, shiny new bathrooms! Each of which has a shiny new ""All Gender Restroom"" sign!

The store owner special ordered them, and he was super excited when they arrived! These are employee only bathrooms, so we didn't even need signage (we've never had it before), so he did it just to be supportive.

My Homophobic School has Gender-Neutral Bathrooms!	I was dreading going to the very Catholic, very narrow-minded school that I go to now. Some of people were honestly worse than I expected, (which is very suprising since I have a very pessimistic outlook) and they somehow put gender into everything we do. But, they put in gender-neutral bathrooms next to the gym. Compared to the size of the school and all the binary bathrooms there are, it isn't much, but I'm just so, so happy there even is one at all.	"That’s amazing!!! It’s not much but at least it’s progress, I’m jealous honestly :DD
There is one in my school but it's in some remote hallway that I never go to so I just bite my tounge and go into the girls restroom"	qoqcu1	NonBinary	59	0.96	2021-11-07 15:06:00
here’s a mirror selfie of me in an airplane bathroom after realizing i’m non binary(+xenogenders but who cares)...		"the story no one asked for: i was watching something i had downloaded on my ipad and it had a non binary person in it and i was like wait a minute.... this is how i be feelin tho😳 so then i had an anxiety attack cause where tf is my binary. anyways i went to the bathroom to finish having an anxiety attack and i took some pictures cause i felt like it.
Xenogenders are so cool!! What labels do you use?
YOOOOOOO YOOOOOOOOOOO
I figured out I was trans/nb by watching trans tiktok compilations and then suddenly realizing I was nb. Sometimes you just need to know that you can exist... What xenogender labels do you use?
most of the genders i use now, i found when i used to be super anti-mogai and would make fun of these genders😂. i identify most with “atralgender”. probably cause for my entire life i’ve been very interested in space and i just really feel a connection to that in some way🤷🏻‍♀️
also it’s nice to see more people accepting xenogenders, i was expecting comments being like “ew xenogenders just hurt the community”
and stuff like that but it’s nice to see people accepting them!
Not really. I just feel like they're making fun of who I am
I realised I was trans when I was pegging my boyfriend. Suddenly I stopped with this look on my face 😱
Haha that's actually rad xD
You don't understand xenogenders then. Also please don't reply with this kind of negativity to my comment literally noone asked??
No one needs to ask. And what is it to understand in xenogenders?
If you're open to learn more please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/6GXZsP6DNts).

Mfw I realize ‘the bathroom problem’ now applies to me.		"I brought up, in an lgbtq+ discussion space, the thought that we should encourage businesses with single stall washrooms to make them gender diverse, and immediately had my queer community putting forward their fear about all washrooms becoming gender diverse and there being no safety.  Small fucking towns!!
This is such a huge mood.

I see people stop and take a second look at me before coming in all the time, when I’m just washing my fucking hands! 

Like, even if I was a man or amab, why’s it matter that I’m there?? You think I’m gonna stick around after washing my hands to listen to you pee?? 

Good luck on all your trips to public restrooms. Stay safe 😞

So my workplace now has gender-neutral bathrooms	"And it only underlines the question: why are they sex-segregated at all? Most can only be used by one person at a time, and none have urinals. Being able to use any would be helpful when one is occupied, instead of having to change floors. Dividing everything further in a office of about 40 employees (most of them women) doesn't seem like a solution.

Anyway, it's not likely to change soon. We're a small organisation, but with the managerial inertia of a much bigger one."	"There's no reason to have sex segregated single occupancy bathrooms. That's why they're illegal in California.
At my uni there are technically gendered stalls but since they're always so busy, people stopped caring about the sign on the door and use them indiscriminately. That was a relief for me, I can use any of the bathroom I want now! 
My work also has two gender neutral bathrooms, and it just makes good sense. Only one of them has a changing table though & it's about twice the size of the other one."	7f9vb5	NonBinary	54	0.98	2017-11-24 19:50:16
Today, another person did a massive double-take at the sign on the bathroom door after seeing me inside. I’d laugh if it wasn’t so upsetting 🙄		"People do that to me all the time lmfao. It can be a very good feeling or a very bad feeling depending on the day
This happens often for the most part I giggle inwardly. My favorite is when a guy followed me into the ladies room he stopped looked around and left, I had just gotten my haircut so was looking extremely boyish lol.
Though I worry about what's going to happen when I start T and I look more like a boy. Our men's room at my work only has one stall and one urinal
Usually it’s a bad feeling. Because I just feel unwelcome and uncomfortable no matter which option I choose. It’s a struggle when I’m at work and have no other option. 

I’m currently trying to remember that it’s more about them than me. Maybe they really are just worried they went into the “wrong” restroom.
They're probably genuinely confused. I'd probably check if it was me and I felt I was getting mixed signals. It's happier to not read any rude intent into it. Take it as a sign you're nailing the androgynous look :)"	decsbl	NonBinary	56	0.97	2019-10-07 01:41:02
I am making my first visit to an OBGYN and I’m nervous	"_This post includes mentions of medical conditions AFAB people experience. No graphic detail or phrasing was included_

Hello! I float around on this sub giving advice all the time, so if you haven’t met me I’m Annoelle! I’m an androgynous neutrois AFAB. Despite giving out tons of advice, I too have my own problems. I’m not looking for advice, just comfort in my community where people will understand. 

I made this appointment a few months ago and have been sort of dreading it. They set me up with a doc who works a lot of trans cases, which I’m really grateful for. While I do very much want androgynous surgery, I have other medical reasons for bottom surgery. I have this unreasonable fear that they’ll tell me like every doctor I’ve had in the past that my problems are ‘a normal part of being a woman’. 

I’m not a woman, so it isn’t normal for me.

On top of that, the issues I have don’t seem to be on the same level as other AFAB people. How many AFAB people have had to call themselves an ambulance because their menstrual cramps crippled them in a café bathroom? Even the EMT’s thought I was being ridiculous. I’ve fallen and passed out in the shower so many times, I’ve had to pull over and be picked up and leave my car overnight in an empty parking lot because I could no longer drive. Even with tracking apps my ‘cycle’ is beyond irregular, as if it’s a beast just waiting to catch me off guard. It can go months with no sign, or be only a few weeks between, it can’t be tracked. I have constant numb pain and scares when I think a period is coming, and then nothing happens. It leaps out of the dark and mauls me with no warning. Birth control staved the cycles off but caused irreversible gastrointestinal damage. Every ‘natural’ and ‘normal’ aspect of being a ‘woman’ has done nothing but torture me. 

None of this is new, either. It’s not some shocking recent condition. This has all gone on since puberty, and puberty is when my dysphoria began. I’m 22 now. It’s been something like a decade of this. I had to move away, become an adult, discover my gender identity, and force my way into an appointment because no one who could get me to a doctor ever believed me, because ‘periods are normal, woman up!’. 

I just feel like there’s something inside me attacking me from within, hunting me and toying with me, existing to cause me paranoia and agony. It doesn’t feel natural, it doesn’t feel normal. It feels like a threat, a danger to my existence, and it certainly doesn’t align with my null identity. 

I just want this appointment to go well. I hope the doc understands, I hope I can get the help I desperately need. 

I will post an update in the comments when I’m through. Thank you for taking the time to hear me ramble, and remember to eat fruit and drink water today <3"	"Hey I just want you to know that you're not alone! I'm AFAB and my cycles are horribly irregular (once every 3-6 months??? Idk why) 

And another one of my friends they have Endometriosis which causes a similar pain to what you get.  It's horrible and sadly not a lot of research is done on issues people who menstruate experience.  They're traumatic as fuck and people (even those who should know what periods are like) don't take you seriously, so I really hope you're able to find some relief - you're not alone out there and I hope the best for you 💕
That sounds absolutely horrible! I am so sorry you're going through that. I really hope the doctor will take you seriously and be able to help.
My spouse just got a hysterectomy for endometriosis after years of the sorts of symptoms you described, and is feeling much better! Their surgeon said that TONS of AFAB people have endometriosis and go on for years (or their whole life) without diagnosis or treatment.

My spouse was told so many times that ""this is normal"", and the surgeon (who also had a hysterectomy for endometriosis) said she heard that all of the time, and that endo is waaaay more common than most docs think.

During the hysterectomy they take a bunch of photos, so they could show my spouse the dozens of endometrial spots they ablated. Validation!!!

Anyways, I say all of this to point out: what you describe isn't ""normal"". Don't take that as an answer. Also, hysterectomies for gander affirmation should be covered by US insurance companies, so you shouldn't even need someone to agree with any diagnosis.
🤞🤞🤞 I hope it goes well! That all sound so stressful. Even aside from the physical pain itself, not being given appropriate consideration by medical professionals is absolutely abhorrent and I am so sorry ❤️ you deserve to be seen and heard. And you deserve the medical care you obviously need. ❤️
What you're describing sounds a lot like PCOS symptoms. The people I know that have it says that it took forever to get a diagnosis because they were always told ""Periods are normal, it's not that bad"" before someone finally listened to them.

Sending you all the best thoughts for this appointment! Since the obgyn works with trans people, hopefully the appointment will be gendered as little as possible and you can get through it!
Don't have much to offer unfortunately, but I'm actually going to be making my first visit soon as well and I'm really nervous, especially because of the trans part.

I'm so happy you have one that is experienced with trans people though, I'm working on finding one myself. 🫂💜
That sounds like an absolute nightmare, I’m so sorry you have to deal with that. Sending much love and strength, and good luck with the appointment! <3
I'm so sorry you're going through this! My cycles are out of control and super heavy and I hate it so much.  For me,  I'm new to realizing I'm nb and am still unpacking my feelings of gender dysphoria. I hate going to the doctor so much because I'm told that everything is normal but my life literally stops for 8-10 days per month. It's horrible. I hope you can get the help you need, knowing that your doctor is trans friendly will hopefully mean they'll be more likely to listen to you and help with your individual needs! 💖
__Update__
The doc was super understanding and respectful of my gender and pronouns! She walked me through the examination with care and avoided gendered language, she heard my story and was very sympathetic. I did my homework on hysterectomy and she said she was going to recommend it if I didn’t bring it up! 

I have another appointment to discuss the surgery! Im going to get help!! 

Thank you all for your support, couldn’t do it without you guys <3"	s62a9s	NonBinary	55	0.98	2022-01-17 11:51:20
It's 1:30 am, went to the bathroom and I really liked my hairs		"♥️
We have the same hairstyle and omg I like when it does this too but it only happens at night and idk how to recreate it when I'm going somewhere grr! Anyway ur a cutie thx for sharing 😘
Yeah, honestly I have absolutly no idea how to do it again ^^"	fb4cnn	NonBinary	51	0.95	2020-02-29 00:28:22
I just need to make it through the next 16 hours.	"My sister got married today. In BFE Idaho, at an air b&b with literally zero privacy. 

Now, I came out to my mom about 10 years ago. Since then, she kind of pretends that it’s not a thing. She asked me to wear a T-shirt dress (mind you, the high today was 40), I declined, and [wore this instead. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oDGKtF9) (please ignore laundry). I wore it with a binder, and purposely did not bring anything else. I knew this would start a fight. 

The rest is snippets of the day, I hope they make sense. 

At the wedding, my mom pretended she didn’t see what I was wearing, which was almost worse. I’m already feeling pretty alienated, as most everyone here is from the grooms side, or their friends, and they live about 14 hours from me. 

Afterwards, while we were making dinner, My mom  told me that she didn’t like my wedding outfit, it made her uncomfortable and was not flattering on me. And to please wear something different for the reception. 

I said I was sorry if I made her uncomfortable, but she told me to wear what made me comfortable. And that I would probably wear something similar to the reception. Unless she wants me to not go. 

My mom then cornered me in the bathroom *while I was on the toilet* so that she could cry at me. I promptly told her to go away, and we could talk later. Eventually she left. 

I would have rather waited until not this weekend, but She decided she wanted to have this conversation now. I essentially came out again. She called me her daughter and then asked me why I had to put labels on it. And argued that daughter is not a label. 

She also tried to guilt me with things like, “I loved you every day, and did so much for you” I said multiple times this isn’t what it’s about. Literally stole the rent line “take me for what I am, or leave me”

She told me that she didn’t like the way I was treating her. I told her I didn’t like the way she was treating me, and that was the end of that.

Later on, she interrupted my phone call from my supportive chosen family, and we had this lovely exchange:

Mom: you are my child, and I love you and accept you for who you are

Me; then show it. Actions speak louder than words

Mom: how?

Me: like not saying shit like you did today

Mom: I said I was sorry (aka get over it)

I am lucky that I do not live with her, nor am supported by her in any way shape, or form. She also lives about 9 hours from me. I am so lucky to have a supportive husband, chosen family, and in laws. 

My brother did tell me he liked my outfit a lot and what my mom said to me was wrong “cause that’s just who you are, and that’s okay”. So I’ve got that going for me too. 

Sorry for the long ramble, i am just trying to not feel so alone right now. I would have left already if I could."	"In the photo you shared, you can clearly see how comfortable and happy you feel in that outfit! You look so good! I’m sorry that your family doesn’t support you. 

I’m so relieved that you have your chosen family, friends, and husband.
That's a great outfit and I'm glad you stuck with it! I hope your mom's bs didn't interrupt your sister's day but if it did, know that that is 100% your mom's fault and not yours. You can make it through these final hours!
You look dope, I especially love the contrasting colors. Your family would be lucky to have you, and if they choose not to love you and accept you as you are they're the ones who ultimately suffer from it. From the sounds of it, you'll be able to head somewhere safer and more supportive soon which is fabulous. Try to breathe and remember this 16 hours isn't much in the scheme of things. You're a rockstar and I believe in you!!!!!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
Looking pretty fly! Don't change a thing if they love you they can meet you where you are and who you are. Glad you stood your ground.
I'm so sorry that happened to you. There is absolutely no reason that she should treat you like that. *hugs*

(Also you look fantastic!)
i love ur smile omg!!! i love this outfit!!"	ddxi49	NonBinary	51	0.96	2019-10-06 02:43:27
Bathroom selfie for another college outfit		"Great fit! You look like such a goth witch from the 90s! Btw, just a tip, turn your left foot straight when your taking photos in this pose (with the right foot out just like you have it now), it kind of makes you hold your self up in a more confident pose, like the models do.
I super dig this vibeeeee"	x2qqie	NonBinary	53	1.0	2022-08-31 22:32:30
Any other nonbinary lawyers here?	"Hi All -

I'm a nonbinary lawyer. I often wonder how I should dress for client meetings and court appearances and whether I should ask where the gender neutral bathroom is in courthouses and the like. 

Being a lawyer is about representing my clients' best interests. It's not about me, but I want to be true to myself, but not in a way that hurts my clients.

Are there any other lawyers on this subreddit who wrestle with these issues?"	"Just coming out to myself and the closest around me as NB.  I've worked in the same law office for the last eight years.  I'm lucky that I *don't* have to go to court, but in the context of my legal department, I'm growing out my hair, wearing nail polish to express myself.  
  
  However, my wife and therapist are both counseling me to stay in otherwise masc-mode at work.  Meanwhile, for Halloween I went full goth, with a long black peasant skirt and thigh highs and I felt more comfortable at work than I ever had before.  *C'est la vie.*

  To answer your question- Remember our oath is to zealously represent our clients.  One the one hand- you have to put their interests over yours, at least when you are engaged as their counsel.  On the other hand, you have to be *able* to represent them effectively, and may not necessarily because you're wrestling with dysphoria or self-image.  So, strike the balance, I'd say.
Yup! But I work remote, so presentation is rarely an issue, and I'm not out at work. However, when I do have to don lawyer-wear, it's usually dress shirt (with the first couple buttons undone instead of a tie, and sometimes lace accents or ruffles), jacket, slacks, sometimes a waistcoat, and oxfords. I consider that relatively neutral wear, though it's one step down in formality either based on the lack of tie (seen from a menswear POV; it's the right formality level for womenswear) or the shoes (seen from a womenswear POV; it's the right formality level for menswear). ...basically, you can sometimes build a good base by simply having a thorough knowledge of the appropriate formality levels for the two binary genders and either finding where they overlap to maximize neutrality, or picking and choosing from their differences. Or by taking one gender's prescribed attire and wearing another gender's version of it (like picking men's vs. women's oxfords) How well this actually works in court settings... I'm not sure.
I know this post is 4 years old, but I cannot tell you how relieved I am to find it. I start law school this fall and I’m currently cracking out of my egg, and terrified that my gender could be a career-halting issue. This is very reassuring to know just that there are other non-binary attorneys (or future attorneys) out there at all.
I would dress professionally in a way that is the best balance between making you feel confident and not making yourself the focus of attention in court. As you said, you provide counsel to your clients - this time is about them. 

Being legal counsel also comes with some restrictions to think about. Legally you are registered as some gender, so to quell any confusions or even possible open doors to getting a case held up on some stupid technicality of ID, I would use the pronouns suggested by your legal ID (if you haven't changed it from your birth gender). 

At this point, law is one of the harder professions to be outwardly NB in. Is it impossible? Clearly not, as you are NB and are a lawyer! But even so, there are small ways to massage your look and demeanor to be comfortably you while also making it damn clear that you're an outstanding lawyer. Inspire confidence in your clients by being confident!
I hadn't thought about how my dysphoria might impact my ability to effectively represent my clients. Thanks for pointing that out.
Your non-binary siblings are everywhere, including in the legal profession. So are a lot of allies. Good luck in school!  ;)
As a current 1L, I am so relieved to find other students experiencing this as well. You are not alone at all future attorney :)"	7wsqwu	NonBinary	49	0.92	2018-02-11 13:22:06
I went into an all gender bathroom and started crying!!!	Idk y I teared up. I just walked in and stood there and cried for a few seconds. It was just nice to feel validated by something especially as ordinary as a bathroom. It was cool that someone took the time to add it and make it all pretty and clean. I'm not out and proud as some of you are, but choosing to use that bathroom instead of the female one I normally use felt good. So good in fact I think I might come out to my friend group!	"[removed]
Once I was at a school and was about to use the guys bathroom cause of society but the janitor noticed me and pointed me to a gender neutral bathroom. I was very happy. Glad you shared a similar experience!
That's awesome! If you do come out to the friend group, good luck!
Nah this one was. Had a toilette, 2 sinks, trashcan for period products, baby changing station, and even a place to put insulin needles."	cgxczs	NonBinary	52	0.95	2019-07-23 19:39:24
feeling very euphoric after today’s bathroom haircut		"Ohh, very neat! Homemade haircuts are so hard, so congrats :D The black and yellow (bleached?) of your hair compliments your skin colour so well, too!

Never fully understood the problem with binary bathrooms until last night...	"I’m AFAB trans non-binary/masculine. These days, I present in a very masculine way although I do not bind (yet). 


I always thought that I was never even close to ‘passing’ as male due to the 38FF chesticles I have, and my hourglass shape. It’s something I’m learning to cope with for now while I’m losing weight (30lbs down yay!) since it’s way easier to be androgynous when you reduce that pesky sex-determined fat distribution. 


Anyway - I thought anyone with eyes would clock me as a butch woman, and I’ve never even considered NOT using the women’s restrooms. I’ve used them my whole life. 


Last night my boyfriend and I went to the cinema (he’s a total peach who is supportive of my gender exploration) and I just popped into the ladies before we went in. When I came out of the cubicle to wash my hands, an older woman came out of a cubicle and just openly stared at me, jaw agape. I made eye contact with her and smiled, and she just gave me a silent look of utter horror. She left without washing her hands (gross).


I live in the UK which hasn’t had the same debate about bathroom use for trans individuals that the US has had, so it’s not on people’s minds at all. I don’t blame her for her reaction (apart from not washing your hands, that’s icky) but now I’m left thinking - what bathroom am I welcome to use? This is something I’d genuinely never worried about. I always thought the stories of people being too afraid to use gendered bathrooms were paranoid. But what I got last night was a very mild reaction, but I am so shook - I made a woman flee the bathroom, she didn’t even say anything to me and nothing happened afterwards. But now I’m like, this is only going to get worse. I am already being ‘othered’ and it’s lame. 


Thank you if you read my post, have an excellent day :) "	"USA, AFAB NonBinary! I hate being stuck using girls restrooms because I'm too scared to use other ones. I switch depending on my expression that day. Or I just go ""how much am I masc passing?"" Also, i don't use men's rooms for #1. It awkward to sit and pee in a place that's stand and pee . Passing in a shitty concept! Let me be ambiguous in peace. 
Also in the UK, and I wouldn't say i'm afraid, more just uncomfortable now because i can see how it makes other people feel uncomfortable for me to be in the same bathroom. If i'm super unsure about whether i'll get fuss i just use the disabled toilet. 
So, I’ve had a few friends with this very issue. My response is always this - use the bathroom you feel SAFE using. Where possible, have someone with you while you’re in a public bathroom. 

Your safety is by far the most important thing. I’m sure we’ve all heard stories of people being attacked just for using the bathroom they’re most comfortable with...

All the best friend!
I’m not binding right now as I’m nursing, but I have a beard. I always feel much safer using the men’s room. I’m more scared of the man outside the ladies room thinking he needs to rescue “his woman” from me than I am of a man in the men’s bathroom. When I’m on “their turf” it throws them off. You have to be able to walk in there like you own the place and you fucking well belong there, but I haven’t been binding for a couple of years now and no one has said boo to me in the men’s bathroom even when I’ve just been in there to change my kid’s diapers. 
AFAB non\-binary in the USA. I prefer to use the gender neutral bathroom when it's available. When it's not, I usually use the women's bathroom because I still pass as female and I suspect I'm less likely to be attacked/killed in women's bathroom than a men's. There have been times when the all the stalls in the women's bathroom were in use and I opted to use the men's \(b/c as non\-binary, I can use either bathroom if a gender neutral one isn't available, right?\) and I've never had an issue.
Yeah, it's awkward. I'm not comfortable in either.  I use the womens if that seems to be how I'm getting gendered (hard though because I don't get gendered either way much anymore).  

But then occasionally there'll be an awkward time when I head into the womens and a security guard will persistently call after me ""sir! sir, that's the womens!"" or similar. Didn't know that uniform came with a degree in gendering people.
Yeah I’m in the US and I’m at the point of resisting using public gendered restrooms when possible, but I’ve got a bladder condition so I have to go often :/ I use the all-gender (single stall) restrooms when I can, but when I can’t, I use the women’s. I have had one really uncomfy degrading experience, but usually no confrontations, just the feeling of people staring + my dysphoria. 

I can’t imagine going in the men’s tho ... I’m terrified. I’m still quite intimated by cis men and hyper masculinity. But as I continue on t, there might be a time eventually when it is safer to use the men’s? But if I get to the point of passing as AMAB, I’d probably feel best presenting more fem than I do currently (more makeup and jewelry, to achieve genderfuck/androgyny balance)... and I think there’s danger in either bathroom, in that scenario. Hnnnng I hate it. I just want to be ME and be safe
I dont look male enough for that and i am so small everyone thinks im female, but if i had that issue i would just try getting used to greeting. Short things like ""hi"", "" hello"", ""good evening/morning"" etc. If your voice is feminine it will probably calm them down.
Same, I wouldn’t say I’m frightened or anything, I just felt like an intruder despite the fact I’m using the bathroom of my assigned sex. I’m lucky that my workplace uses unisex bathrooms, but they’re the minority really. 
Honestly ""walk in there like you own the place"" can give you a lot of advantages in so many situations... Fe back in my school only 11 and 12th grade were allowed to leave the school area during breaks and when i was in 9th grade my best friend in class used to check which teacher was at the door and if they didnt know her she just walked past them as if not even the queen of england could fucking stop her - never got stopped and i always got coffee XD"	8g6clq	NonBinary	50	1.0	2018-05-01 06:20:53
I changed my pronouns on Facebook	"Tonight I finally did it. I’m officially non-binary and using they/them pronouns. I’m AMAB and have been questioning my gender identity for a while (some of my earliest memories are of playing princess and ballerina with my sisters), but I always chose the path of least resistance and just identified “male.” As a dude with a beard (that I quite like), I never felt “non-binary” enough to justify using they/them, and convinced myself that I was “male” even though I hated it. Tonight that changed though. I realized that this DOES matter to me. I WOULD be happier if people called me “them” instead of “him.” Gender IS a myth made up by bathroom companies to sell more bathrooms. And I’d like to thank /r/NonBinary for helping me get to this point. Seeing all you wonderful people existing outside the gender binary inspired me to do the same, and helped convince me I AM “non-binary”enough (because apparently feeling like you’re not is super common?). This milestone is a little pointless since I hate Facebook and might delete it altogether soon, and I haven’t actually told anyone irl yet, but I finally made a choice to stop living a lie. Anyways, it’s 2am here, so I’ll start telling my family when I wake up. 


TL;DR: thanks :)"	"Congrats!!!!!

I too struggle with feeling not enby/trans enough, so much that I didn't even feel like part of the community until recently. Even though I changed my pronouns on FB and came out to my husband like 5 years ago 🙀. It's a hell of a journey tho and now I'm so happy and gender(s) euphoric 😻😻
That ""Gender is a myth by bathroom companies"" sounds a bit quirky to me but otherwise YAY! I'm really happy for you! Still totally on my way to figuring out where I fit on the genderspectrum so seeing you figuring yours out is just a crazy awesome thing to me.
I'm incredibly happy for you. Im so happy for you!!
Congrats friend! I too did that to my Facebook, I don't have a gender listed, but I changed it so that when referring to me it uses they/them (like ""shrapnel updated their profile picture"" etc). I don't use it actively and am also not out to many people, but it makes me feel better at least lol

It's a small step, but it's movement in a direction towards your true self!

Thank you! I'm so happy seeing the enby community grow. Knowing there are other people out there who feel the same way as I do has been really empowering for me.
Lol thanks I’m a bit quirky and that line was me trying to be funny at 2am. I don’t really blame the bathroom companies, but it kinda reflects my desire to not take gender too seriously. Like really, what’s the point of gendered restrooms? Mixed gendered restrooms are perfectly functional. I just feel like society has gendered a lot of things that don’t really need to be.
You being happy for me makes me happier :)
Thank you! Everyone on this sub has been so supportive! It is a small step, but the response I’ve gotten has convinced me that I’m on the right path.
Has anyone noticed that you did that? I'm very intrigued by how subtle that is...but...it's also public and scary 😬
I mean, it's definitely a funny idea :P. I agree tho, too much of our daily lives is gendered and restrooms are a big part of that issue.
No, no one has commented on it, but I also don't use  it much, I think the most I've done since changing it is liking someone's status. 
I do feel like the only people who would comment on it though are people who are are suspicious already, like if they were actively looking for a sign that you might not be cis. I don't think too many people would notice and it's easy to change back if you need"	bd1053	NonBinary	51	0.99	2019-04-14 09:10:00
So sick of the enby-phobia	"I know I shouldn’t have engaged, but I got into an argument in a local lgbt+ Facebook group about gender-neutral bathrooms. And all the classic arguments were thrown at me (“men dressed as women to assault people,” “I don’t want to see penis in a bathroom,” and “what about the children?!”), which is. Okay. Fine. Expected, unfortunately.

Then come to find out *its a gd trans woman arguing these points against me.* 

I’m so goddamn done. How fucking *dare* a trans woman suggest that gender-neutral spaces are a bad thing. How fucking *dare* she act like me wanting a comfortable place to pee is a bad thing, because the Big Bad Cis-Men will put on dresses and assault the WAMMENS. 

How fucking dare I want a space to pee in peace without fearing cis-men assuming I’m a woman in their restroom, or fearing cis-women thinking I’m a man in theirs. 

I’m so pissed.

And so upset that someone in my own gd community would feel that way. 

I know it’s probably just internalized transphobia. But damn. 

*Damn*"	"That's incredibly offensive and isolating that she said that. I mean, If we don't belong in queer spaces, then basically the only place we have left is college coffee shops with gender neutral restrooms, which are nice, but you also can't talk to anyone because of headphones.
I've seen a lot of this behavior and it's saddening yeah. Honestly the thing that gets me though in these bathroom arguments is if a bathroom is well designed how in blue monkey fuck are you seeing the equipment someone else is packing? If you're honestly checking out the junk of the person in the stall or urinal next to you to ""make sure they belong there"" that is a little weird my dude.

I'm kind of mad at myself for not being surprised that it was a trans woman doing that to you. Not that I think all trans women behave that way but I had a really bad experience with my now wife's former partner who was a very toxic trans woman. She spent most of the time that I knew her trying to convince me that I wasn't really non binary. That I was really just a trans woman in denial and needed to ""get over it"" as she put it. Honestly it still hurts a bit to think about. But I try to police that reaction because I hate assuming the worst in people.

I'm extremely empathetic though for better or for worse, so I mostly just feel bad for them. It feels like a lot of them hurt so badly about their own situation that they have a hard time abiding anyone that has an easier time than them which leads to extreme gatekeeping. It almost seems like in their minds someone not having to go through the pain they did is invalidating them in some way. My heart hurts for anyone that feels that way and it hurts for the people that end up being the targets for their misplaced anger. Since at the end of the day what everybody wants is to just be able to be themselves without fear of being hurt for it.
It's easier to just not leave the house these days.
I totally agree. And these people always act like they’re going to be *forced* to use a gender-neutral restroom. When really, they probably wouldn’t even notice it was there?? 

They’d just go about their business, use the bathroom most comfortable for them, and move on.

*Just like we would like to do.*"	d80hki	NonBinary	51	1.0	2019-09-23 02:39:52
(mostly for safety reasons) which bathroom would you direct me to?		"I honestly wouldn't blink at you going into either bathroom!
From first pic I thought womens, from second I thought mens... I think if you confidently walk into either your either you will be okay!
I wouldn't think twice if I saw you going to either, and I've never been in a position where vaguely ""there"" wouldn't do, but if they were truly separate, I'd probably direct you to the women's.
Which ever one you asked me too! If there was a family, disabled, or otherwise non-gendered room I’d go for that one though.
Womens, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I saw you go into mens.
Full honesty, your face and style is pretty masculine and if no one stares too much you'll pass easy but your body is curvier than a male body typically is so you might be given away (as not cis) by that.

I don't think being perceived a certain way in a bathroom is ""more dangerous"" than being perceived a certain way anywhere in public but I do understand the concern.
I've only been in men's and gender neutral restrooms and wouldn't think you were out of place in either. That doesn't mean you'd necessarily look out of place in a women's restroom, but I'm not qualified to judge that.
Wouldnt think twice at either bathroom as well
I don’t think you’d get worse than suspicious looks as people try and fail to determine your gender. You should be safe if you act confidently in and as you have every right to be here
Men's if pushed to answer one, but I honestly wouldn't blink whichever one I saw you go into
Probably women's.
Either, both, idc, whichever one you prefer. I’d just direct you to ‘the toilets’ and let you figure it out from there
If you can stand to pee the men's, if not you can still go to the men's, but if you're worried about getting clocked for sitting the women’s. I think people are more likely to assume just based of which you go to, might be harassed in women’s more but I don't think it's likely. Also depends where you are, people in different places have different ideas about femininity in masculinity. I honestly wouldn't blink whichever you went into.
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised to see you in either. If you asked me where the bathroom was and they’re in separate places I’d ask which one bc I’d have no idea how to respond lol
Nice shirt! I have the same one 😃
Idk they are both next to each other behind the carpet aisle. I'll let you figure it out.
Either I don't think I'd think anything if you went into either
Oh I just tell people ""oh the restrooms are down the hallway, I know the women's restroom is on the left but I think the other is on the right"" for all sexes/genders :)
Off topic, but cool Camp Unus Annus shirt!
Good to know. I mostly ask bc I feel like I get the opposite, weird looks either way 😅
I agree with this!!
Thanks! I cherish it lol
I mean. I think the typa people who scan bathrooms to see if any potential trans/gnc person is there will give you weird looks either way. 

But ppl who are just there to use the bathroom probably wont look at you much at all since, yeah, you look fairly neutral. 

But honestly i think this varies a lot based off the outfit. Ik personally theres clothes that i feel safer using the womens room in and others that i feel safer in the mens wearing. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Honestly i just try to avoid multi stall restrooms if at all possible"	u85por	NonBinary	47	0.96	2022-04-20 20:29:16

Lol I love your hair and freckles, I'm too awkward to go to any public bathrooms so I wouldn't know, my bathroom has shitty lighting XD
Thank you! I’m having a really good day and feeling myself in these photos tbh which is unusual but I’m not complaining 😂
This is my uni accommodation bathroom, which is normally shitty but I got lucky with the light hitting the window jusssstttt right 👌👌

Any pointers?	"Hello community! I just wanted to introduce myself. I am the father of a 10 year old non-binary child, biological male. They have been this way since I can remember. So far, the subject of puberty is very stressful for them. We are taking a slow approach, but this morning I woke up early (insomnia) as I realize this will happen rather quickly, and couldn’t sleep. Childhood seems so short in some ways.

We live in a relatively accepting area, though there are more conservative areas around that would likely be less so. I guess what comes to mind is managing things like road trips in areas that are less accepting (bathrooms, etc) and things of that realm. I really have no cares what anyone thinks of my child, but I do think about their safety. And perhaps I’m wrong, but I’m perceiving that there will be some bullying in school going forward at some point, though they have a solid circle of friends at this point. We are well aware of the risk of depression and suicide as well. I don’t want to be pushy (about puberty) but we can’t bury our heads in the sand either.

I don’t want to sound doom and gloom. This has been a beautiful and unexpected journey. They have our full support, but I’m clear in knowing that I cannot expect the world to adapt to my child, and that there will be times of difficulty. I was just wondering if anyone could share things that helped, or perhaps things that they would have done different. I apologize in advance if I’ve made any faux pas, as we are still learning day by day. Thanks much for your help and patience."	"Great that you’re reaching out to community! I would say one of the most powerful things is that your kid can connect with other trans or non binary kids. Find a community, obviously online is easiest but in person is really helpful
Have you tried talking to your pediatrician about puberty blockers?
Also, having you on their side is incredibly helpful. Just taking your kids lead, using their right pronouns, and listening to what they want even when it changes. These are amazing ways to support them in a world that has such mixed responses to non binary people
You are doing a great job and already on the right path. I read above the comment about finding friends that are going through similar things and I love that. I would also like to add that I wish I had realized or been told earlier in my life that your friends can be well-meaning but can get it deeply, deeply wrong sometimes. To me, it’s just as important to make sure your child is contextualizing their friendships and processing some of the things their friends say as much as the “bullies.” 

Not in a critical way, simply because we should put as much care and thought into the effect our friendships have on us just as much as the nay-sayers. I’ve learned so much in adulthood about good friendships—supporting one another without competing, being there for one another without being toxic or demanding, etc. I know these are higher-level relationship concepts for kids, but learning to cultivate good relationships with people who affirm you is just as important as learning how to deal with bullies!
https://www.refugerestrooms.org/ Is a resource for finding safe restrooms while traveling since you mention that specifically. 

You seem to have a good attitude and want what’s best for your kid so the only advice I have is to try to be more careful about when and how you mention their “biological sex”. Many nonbinary folks, myself included would feel hurt being introduced by a parent as their “non-binary child, biological male“. I’m sure you included it because you’re just trying to provide all of the relevant information and their sex at birth and endogenous hormone profile are relevant to transition related health care but it’s usually best to wait until you are talking those things rather than bringing it up out of the blue. A person’s biological sex is actually not relevant in most conversational contexts and a nonbinary person’s doubly so. As a parent of a nonbinary child you are going to encounter people who will be very insistent on learning what is in your kids pants and as a parent your responsibility is to help them understand how incredibly creepy and inappropriate they are being. When talking to a doctor or in a trans support group like this it can be relevant but it really should never be one of the first things you say about any nonbinary person. I understand that you are here with good intentions and I’m not trying to scold you. I just wanted to mention it so you can try to be more mindful of of when and how you talk about this in the future
When I’m on a road trip I try to scope out Starbucks on my route since they are common and typically have gender neutral bathrooms. 

I think you’re doing great… I came out to my parents in my mid 20s and they were very sad to find out I had been identifying as non-binary for more than 10 years but never felt comfortable to tell them all that time. Being open to whatever direction your child’s identity might evolve in will make a huge difference to them 💜
just do your best to prepare them for people being rude and make sure they understand how to deal with transphobia(as best as a kid can understand) for bathrooms you could always let a older female (their mom or older sister someone they know) take them to the womens bathroom I isn't uncommon to see a mom with her son or not female passing kid in a womens bathroom and nobody asks questions
We are working toward that! We know of one child, and are trying to have play dates at least periodically, but it is difficult since their parent is busy with work and also they go to a different school. But we are trying!
Not yet. We have a referral to a gender clinic that will be happening this spring.
You providing resources, community, acceptance and opportunity with your kiddo taking the lead helps reinforce they can trust their decisions surrounding identity. It’s creating another layer of secure attachment.  validating them is HUGE particularly when none of you know the “answer.” Keep at it :)
Thanks so much for your comment. I will share all of this with my family. We’re all in this together, I guess- much love to all of you. I wish you all the best and thank you for all of the support. 

Why can’t the rest of the world be like this?
Thanks for that- not even sure why I included it, in hindsight. And thanks for your patience. We are new to this and are really just finding out how to navigate this and definitely wouldn’t want to be hurtful or inappropriate.
And thanks so much for sharing that app! That is such a helpful thing!
Sounds like you’re doing great tbh
Oh good I was about to suggest an endocrinologist who can give recommendations for things like binders/packers/breast forms etc… as your child grows regardless of if you use puberty blockers."	tikx65	NonBinary	42	0.93	2022-03-20 13:20:55

There’s a place by me that just says “both” kinda irks me

At my current job we have two restrooms and they are both single restrooms, one for employees and one for customers. It feels nice knowing that i dont have to pick a gendered bathroom. I usually just go to the mens restroom and i always feel so uncomfortable with having to make that choice.

possible to pass as a guy when wearing a skirt/dress?	"I'm a afab male , pre-t, but I like to wear skirts and dresses sometimes. When I do, I'm often misgendered as female. Sometimes when I need to use the bathroom, I'll get scared to use the men's so I just use the all gender toilet. 

How can I be seen as a feminine man rather than a woman?"	"It's definitely possible, but for most people who were afab unfortunately only once they've been on T for awhile.
Your question interests me,  but I'm not sure I can answer.  I think the 'giveaway' signs of maleness might be body size / proportion,  beard shadow,  jawline, Adam's apple and gait (walking style). Some of which can be individually strengthened, possibly with coaching. 

Although some males will wear skirts and dresses, cis males in general are still pretty conservative due to social and peer pressure. If you're afab, pre-t and 'crossdressing' in skirts and dresses I'd respectfully suggest being misgendered (as female) comes with the territory.  I look forward to more enlightened times. 

In addition (imo) male restrooms can be intimidating even for cis (amab) males. That said, I've known women to use them when in a hurry and generally for men not to react,  but this can't be guaranteed.  

Although trans myself (amab), untransitioned, and suffering fairly acute dysmorphia, de-personalisation and dysphoria, I do sometimes take refuge in the fact of being able to hide in the male body I inhabit.  I wonder whether it might be easier and less risky just to use the female facilities when likely to be perceived as female.  The ""humans' need never know.   (I often feel like an alien visiting a strange incomprehensible culture). 

Hopefully there's something in my post that might be useful!
I do all the time. Unfortunately.
To be fully honest it’s going to be hard to pass as a man without HRT, especially when wearing traditionally womens clothing. I’m personally grateful for gender neutral bathrooms because then I don’t need to worry about those issues just to use the bathroom! I wouldnt stake my identity on being comfortable using the mens room…. i would say it could be a fraught environment even for many cis men…
I'm AFAB, pre-anything, and I regularly pass as a man while wearing womens clothes. I lift weights a lot so I have quite big muscles and when I contrast the muscles with extremely delicate, flowery, feminine clothing and it creates a really masculine effect. 

I also noticed people with softer builds are the opposite: they look more masculine in boxy, masculine clothes because it contrasts with their body. 

I think a lot of masculinity is about that contrast between the shapes that make up your body and the shapes of the clothes you wear. And femininity is the opposite, it's about harmony; I look really feminine in masculine clothes. I hope I explained it okay.
I know for me I bind as best I can and for some reason I feel like doing slightly messy makeup helps cus most guys wouldn't really know how to do makeup. Try to make yourself as tall as you can. Shoulders back and try to look confident.  Maybe wearing a mask can help so they can't see if you have facial hair or not.
While I think anyone should be able to wear what they want and be gendered correctly, I get that isn't how our world works. 

Maybe someone can chime in here and let us know if wearing a kilt would be cultural appropriation? I know they are seen as ""guy skirts"" to many Americans. I admit I'm ignorant of the culture so I'm not sure if that would be frowned upon.
Btw, I posted this after walking towards the men's bathroom in a skirt and I was instead directed towards the women's bathroom by staff. I was about to say ""oh im actually male"" but I panicked and went into the all gender toilet. I wish I just explained myself because I'm certain they wouldve been cool with it lol. But not every place is like that and sometimes I do have genuine reason to be anxious so that's more why I'm asking. But, I do also just wanna look like a dude in dress.
Ofc you can wear dresses and skirts as a guy! But I your not on t there's not really much you can do to get people to see you as one, just try to stay confident in yourself and hope that the people around you will see you for who you are.

Side question tho: how come you're on r/nonbinary when you're trans ftm?
>Although some males will wear skirts and dresses, cis males in general are still pretty conservative due to social and peer pressure. If you're afab, pre-t and 'crossdressing' in skirts and dresses I'd respectfully suggest being misgendered (as female) comes with the territory.

\+1
I haven't been working out for a while since I'm overseas so that may be making me more feminine looking, so that's something I'll consider. I'll see when I start gaining muscle again if I still get misgendered in a skirt. Or maybe people will just get confused lol.
I'm Scottish and I'd say the kilt is wearable by anyone.  While originally male clothing, it has long been worn by both binaries. Its also now worldwide,  especially in countries that were part of the former British Empire,  like Canada, India, the US and others.  Its an item that can be more masculine or feminine depending on length and styling.
Op should check out r/FtMfemininity !
These things aren't mutually exclusive!!! I'm a feminine trans man and use nonbinary to describe myself as well.
I went on r/nonbinary because I already know y'all are really open and friendly, at some point I thought I was genderfluid so i started following this subreddit. Though after realising I'm a guy I still wanted to stay here because everyone here is super cool.

Enby Actor - Director did dressing room assignments NOT by gender!	"I have had the pleasure of working with the same director two summers in a row and she has been one of the most accepting and loving people I have worked with in the professional theater industry. On day one this year she asked us to go around the circle and say our names, our roles, and our pronouns. She's a very woke white woman from Chicago and I just love her lol

Well dressing room woes is a big one for me. If we all go around the circle and give our pronouns then I'm not the odd one out, we're all participating... But if I'm the only trans actor in the production then obviously I'm the only one making this an issue. But ahead of time this director pulled me aside this year and said hey, what do you think we should do? I recommended the six characters that interact the most in one room (4m, 2w) and the four ensemble members in the other (me, 1w, 2m)... And that's what we've been doing... and it's been AMAZING. Everyone said they were comfortable, we're all of age, we're all professional, we can run lines and talk about our scenes and bond... And there's bathrooms attached to both rooms if we want privacy, no big deal at all.

I have been so spoiled by this experience, it's going to be sad to move on to my next projects where this won't be considered so sensitively. But I'm just really enjoying this small victory for now."	"this is really great and makes me so happy for you!!!!
[deleted]
This is absolutely rad. Also a stellar idea: I feel like bonding and being together based on role is much more sensible than being together based on assumed genitalia :P

I know it's bittersweet to know that future projects probably won't be as great, but definitely enjoy it while you can!! This is such an amazing thing to be able to experience and have everyone not be weird or dumb about <3

That sounds absolutely great, I'm happy for you 😊
I wish I did. I got lucky with this director, who just happens to be a wonderful person who is always educating and better herself. It was no influence of mine. Sadly even when I have been asked my pronouns or there is an ""other"" option on a form at an audition or casting call... 5 minutes later they'll say something like ""Men over here, women over there"" and it's like wow, thanks y'all. Glad you're all on the same page with this...
At first there were a few comments like ""Really? Wait I don't think she means permanently right?"" but that's just because several have worked at that theater before and are use to women being in the left room and men being in the right room. At one point another staff member was confused and asked why someone's stuff was in the wrong room. When we explained it wasn't she was like ""Okay that's weird."" I kind of bitterly chirped ""I think it's progressive"" and her response was ""Yes, but is everyone comfortable?"" and it was like YES DUDE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE'RE ALL ADULTS WE'RE OKAY THANKS.

If anything it'll be nice to know this can work out and maybe I can be more outspoken with offering it as a viable alternative in the future.
Hah yeah idk what a good workaround for that would be, I never have to deal with it cuz im a sound mixer lol 

I worked on one crew and afterwards the director posted on instagram something like ""our crew today had no men on it and guess what we wrapped an hour before schedule and had no major conflicts"" and i was like ahh thank u "	8vy5t5	NonBinary	44	0.98	2018-07-04 02:45:10

There was an attempt to be inclusive. There was the same sign on the mens bathroom as well. I still felt dysphoric about going to the restroom...		"This made me think about truly neutral signs. First I thought just a human, but that's what they use for male! (how is that for patriarchy?) Then remembered the more old style signs ""WC"", just tell us it is a toilet/washroom rather then who is ""allowed"" to use it. 

Just need: ""toilet"", ""accessible toilet"", and ""toilet with baby changing facilities"".
This local CD/video game/whatever else store in my town has one that has the man, woman, and an alien, and it says ""Whatever, just wash your hands"", and while I get they're trying to be inclusive and funny, like, we're not aliens.......
Ugh, my job has signs like this too. On the one hand, the attempt to be inclusive is nice...on the other, what about those of us who identify with neither?
Whelp！over to the men’s I go!
A local bar's toilets are labled ""sit"" (toilet) and ""sit/stand"" (toilet and urinal)!

Wish I was an alien tho. Would be cool if I could go a wizz round other planets. 
I find myself identifying more with aliens / alienness since identifying as non-binary, but that's for me to decide and not a a sign on a bathroom door!! yeah I find that pretty insulting 
Like, it's cool that they're accepting, it's great that they're open to trans people, but stop forgetting those of us that don't fit the binary. I'm kinda tired of it.

I was at a coffee shop in Minneapolis once where the bathrooms were so confusingly labeled that I didn't know which was which, until I realized it didn't matter, because both of them had a regular toilet and a urinal, and that's what the signs on the door meant. That was definitely a better way to do it, because bathrooms are just about voiding your bowels/bladder, not being specific to what your label is. Nobody has gendered bathrooms at home, why should they do it in public? 
Agreed, it's truly bizarre and backwards. let me pee in peace please!

Fight back against misinformation about the Loudoun Rapist	" A 15-year old boy in Loudoun County, Virginia, raped a classmate in the bathroom. This was covered up by the school board before coming out.

Right-wingers are spreading a lie that the criminal was a member of the trans and/or nonbinary community by saying he was wearing a skirt, or normally wore skirts.

THIS IS NOT TRUE.

No legitimate news organization has drawn any kind of link between the rapist and wearing feminine clothing. There is no evidence that he did this at all.

The reason the right-wingers are doing this is specifically because it happened in the bathroom. They know no transwoman has ever attacked anyone in a public bathroom. They want this to be the first public example of such.

Contradict them at every opportunity, or else they will control the narrative.

This attack had nothing to do with the trans and/or nonbinary community, and everything to do with patriarchy and rape culture."	"https://reason.com/2021/11/01/conservatives-wrongly-portrayed-the-loudoun-county-sexual-assault-as-a-transgender-bathroom-issue/


I posted about this on my Facebook the other day. The kid may or may not have been genderfluid, but he was in the womens bathroom for a hookup not because of their gender.
[removed]
I'm not sure why this article is echoing the notion that he was wearing a skirt. That detail is not in any of the direct reporting by actual reporters, only in the editorials.
[removed]
I don’t think they were saying he was in a skirt, I think it was that he was supposedly in a skirt. It was just the first one I found where they had al the extra info about “hey, this isn’t as simple as it appears. People are stretch the truth at best and lying at worst”

I got a negative reaction using a public bathroom today.	"I just barely came out a couple months ago, even though I've known for almost a decade. I'm pre-T, pre everything, but I've been binding and fully presenting as masc. I've always looked very naturally masculine.

I use the womens restroom because I don't necessarily feel safe using the men's. I left the bathroom stall to wash my hands, and a girl was washing hers in the sink next to mine. She slinked away a bit and said, 

""I'm in... the women's restroom...right?"" 

I said, ""Yes.""

She said, ""Okay. Cause they have that new law where anyone can go anywhere or whatever-

""Not really. But don't worry."" I said.

She laughed at me a bit and left. It was really rude and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but I can't help but feel a bit proud someone saw me how I've wanted to be seen for once, even if they didn't want to."	"I'm sorry for how things turned out😐  The good thing was that you were seen for who you are.  On the bright side, if you are going to get treated poorly....the women's room is the lesser of two evils....bc who knows what could happen in the men's room.  It's still crappy that one small minded woman would treat you like that.
Oof. Sorry you had that uncomfortable experience. I had something kinda similar, when I was looking particularly masc (loose men’s clothes, backwards SnapBack, minimal makeup) and I used the women’s room. I’m not 100% certain what they said but the two women in there seemed to be murmering about me as I was in the stall... one saying to the other, “don’t leave me yet, its still in there” with “it” referring to me 🙃 
I think you handled it really well. Many people still have internalized transphobia (not the fault of the individual, but a societal issue) and everyone reacts differently when they get to the edge of their comfort zone. As much as their behavior may have been rude, there's already a chance you're the first trans person they knowingly encountered, and their mouth went onto unfiltered autopilot, without having the proper words. I mean.. thank God she didn't say ""right bathroom"" instead of ""women's bathroom"", that would have been even more awkward.

I still remember how slightly-weirded-out and awkward I felt when a former colleague came out to me as trans to me (on the phone) because she needed a reference for a future job. And I'm glad this happened because it made me think about and research something I had theoretically known about, but never really knew I needed to think more about.

It sucks that, if we're not red as cis, we find ourselves in the other side of this encounter more frequently because it is not less awkward for us than for them, and in top of that we're annoyed.

But from what you've written, it sounds like the other person was more uncertain than anything else, and my even have made an attempt at expressing her support, and you have contributed to them widening their horizon! 
You handled the situation well. I wore flannel and had a beanie on over a bun, and women lined up to use the bathroom were kinda confused haha
I've had similar things happen a few times as well. I always feel awkward as hell. In the beginning I also found it a bit funny and I was proud that I was read as confusing. But with time I've grown weary with it and now am mostly tiredly annoyed. (I live in Finland and I feel like the possibility of physical violence isn't very big, but I'm still uneasy every time.)
Sorry friend, getting clocked sucks. It also happens to me sometimes when I bind, and is always uncomfortable. I still use the women’s restroom because I don’t feel safe using the men’s (plus they’re usually way dirtier for some reason.) I figure if I’m going to potentially get confronted in a bathroom, I feel physically safer having it be a woman vs a man :/
“That new law where anyone can go anywhere.” They should! Honestly, gender neutral bathrooms make sense.

Honestly if I didn’t already avoid public washrooms because they’re gross, I would hate them now because people are idiots. The only reason you should care about someone else in there is if they didn’t wash their hands.
Honestly, that was really positive compared to some of the shit I've gone through using public restrooms....
Hmm, maybe im missing tone but it didnt seem like rude statements... I mean unless it was intentionally offensive. Binding and naturally male-looking. 
Awe that's rude as fuck. I'm sorry that happened to you.
Honestly I feel the same way.
She was kind of laughing the whole time. It just seemed like she was very uncomfortable. I struggle with a lot of dysphoria and I often feel like I'm not sure I pass. I surely wasn't aware I was passing well enough to make someone uncomfortable.
Oh dang, well than that was too bad. With more knowledge, hopefully people are more understanding. When i think about it, I probably had a similar interaction with a seemingly cis female. I was just stepping into a gender neutral restroom and this woman asked if she could use it “too”. At first i was like no i really have to go, i’ve had about two beers, but after the fact I thought about her statement and how she just walked off almost immediately after asking... She probably was being sarcastic but AY, she didnt put her hands on me so Im good! "	8f8vhj	NonBinary	38	1.0	2018-04-27 04:10:41
Just got home from San Francisco! I have never felt more okay to just be me than at University of San Francisco and the city itself!!!

‘The Sims 4’ will introduce gender-neutral bathrooms & Pride gear in new update		"No offense but they should start by updating the create-a-sims. That's pendering.
I’m sure no capital G gamer will get needlessly pissed about this
I'm actually confused. Granted I play the sims like a sociopath but was there gender specific bathrooms present in the sims?
they better add they/them pronouns for our sims or i will RIOT :(
Pro tip: You can have gender-neutral bathrooms in The Sims 3, too. Just go into edit world, edit the lot, and replace the bathroom doors with standard ones. It really is that easy. :)
Dear FogofXymathia, I believe it is in fact the bathroom doors in themselves that are being updated and not an actual game play mechanic. Best of luck, FogofXymathia"	bzwuce	NonBinary	37	0.98	2019-06-12 21:14:11

NB: Used the 'wrong' restroom	"Little funny story for my first post: Work recently installed agendered bathrooms next to the male/female restrooms. I've recently discovered that I am a bi-gendered demi-girl enby, and was tickled to start using them. (Yay, bathrooms just for us! :) 

I went into the male restroom on autopilot, and as I sat down my brain popped up with 'Hey, you stepped in the wrong bathroom!' Gave me a jolt of adrenaline until I realized that I was 'passing' as male and it was perfectly fine (I'm not out at work yet).

Anyways, gave me a chuckle. Thought I'd share.

This is such a wonderful community, may your day be as spectacular as you are. :D"	Heck yeah for you fam!	ds5dnn	NonBinary	35	0.95	2019-11-05 20:52:58

Y’all! My brain kinda needs confirmation that I’m allowed to identify as non-binary (even though I know I am allowed) and therefore questions have been written!	"Bit of backstory, growing up, I’ve never really had one gender that was really ingrained into me. I was born female but never really was 100% female. With being allowed in the boys’ bathroom and always being in the girls’ team during sports, and a bunch of other things, the boundaries were always blurred for me and my brain never really made the connection to any gender identity. Despite this, I’ve referred to myself as a female for the past 18 years, despite not really connecting to the term. Like at all. Now onto the questions!! These questions were brought to you by the anxiety goblin living in my head. 

1) Am I still non-binary if I don’t experience dysphoria?

2) Am I still non-binary if I don’t care to correct when people refer to me as female? (Though, I actually might start doing this one just so they know. Not in terms of pronouns though. My pronouns are whatever is easier for them.) 

3) How did y’all know you were non-binary?

Those are the three questions!! Thank you for reading and I hope y’all have a good time period!"	"1) yes

2) yes

3) tbh, it cracked when I registered at a site and they had more then two gender options. I didn't hesitated to select GQ (NB was neither an option, nor popular back then)
1. Yes
2. Yes
3. It's gonna sound dumb, but I played a non-binary character in D&D and it kinda clicked with me in a way I didn't expect. I asked my friends to use they/them pronouns (obviously this part is specific to me, not everyone has to use they/them pronouns) and realized I had been missing out on gender euphoria this whole time, even though I hadn't had dysphoria.
1. Yes! After finding the gender presentation that most represents me, my dysphoria all but disappeared (not that I had it strongly but still.) I am still non-binary. The discomfort of dysphoria is what sparks people’s need to change, it doesn’t define it.


2. Again, perfectly valid. Someone’s gender identity is their own business; you don’t need to correct people if you don’t want to.


3. I always have been, I just didn’t have a word for it. Gender happened to other people when I was little, and then was inflicted upon me when I hit puberty and was growing up. That never changed who I was, just how people saw me. I’m getting better about it all the time.


Hope that helps! If you need a buddy or just someone to talk to, you can DM me at any time. Just might not respond right away cause I’m working
1. yes and same
2. yes and same!
3. Browsing this subreddit for the first time last year, I found myself inexplicably emotional. I actually burst into tears, and when I started thinking about why that might be the rest of it just followed. I used to have short hair when I was in high school, and when people mistook me for a guy or were confused by what my gender was in low-light, it was weirdly exciting for me. All the pieces fell together as I looked back and I'm much happier now :)
1. Yes, me too! 
2. Yes, me too, too! 
3. I had the great opportunity of getting to play with a certain queer skramz band when they opened for another, very famous band. Two of their members are non-binary, the first two enby individuals I’d ever met. Spending time around them as they expressed their genders in their own completely different ways, as well as being ridiculously helpful and supportive of one another in this journey, helped me to realize that I too was non-binary. It’s a new thing for me too, something I have lots of anxiety over, so to see you deal with same doubts I have is sort of relieving in its own way. We’ll find our way through this together :)
Nice! I honestly love how sites have been adding more options. And thank you for answering!
The D&D thing honestly makes a lot of sense to me. It’s what got me to ask my doctors to test me for autism because I was doing a whole bunch of research for a character. D&D opens doors that you’d never think were in front of you in the first place.
I’ve identified as agender/nb for years but never honestly admitted to friends that I wanted they/them pronouns. When I rolled up a new character for our ongoing campaign I made them a nonbinary eladrin and used they/them pronouns. Last night I came out to my group and asked for they/them pronouns and they joked that my character was priming them. I swear I wasn’t trying to make a self-insert but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t delightful to be referenced as they/them in character 😅
Definitely helped, thank you! I too always found myself to be a weird bean floating somewhere in between the two genders. And I offer the same friendship to you as well!
That’s pretty cool! And it’s really great that this subreddit exists and is such a great support system. Questioning your entire existence is hard especially when you know it’s a touchy subject to lots of people. We definitely will get through it together!"	gc5z0x	NonBinary	33	0.98	2020-05-02 12:53:22

Cis people pretending to be trans*	"So I was at work tonight and I wanted to go to the bathroom. I see that the women's bathroom is occupied (one toilet per bathroom, I associate more with my feminine side than masculine so if there's no gender non conforming bathroom I go to the women's bathroom). So I wait and one of male coworkers leaves the bathroom, I was a little shocked because I wasn't expecting him to come out of there. He said ""oh I'm non binary"". This made me so happy, and I told him ""oh yo same!!!"" And then after a few seconds I asked him ""really?"", He said ""no I'm not but I'm glad you are!"". That made me feel like I was lied to and like I was violated in a way? 

I'm not out to many people because I fear they won't take me seriously and my mom is extremely homophobic so this made me feel really mad. I came out to this cis man who pretended to be non binary for a moment. And what's worse is that he is gay so does that make him feel like he has more of a pass for this than people who are straight? Ugh. Like what do cis people get out of pretending to be trans*?"	"Someone I work with insists that he is non-binary and that he can 'identify however he wants', which is true....but I know he's doing it to make a joke out of me and everyone I work with agrees.
Ugh oh my gosh, sorry that happened to you. That has happened to me, but with the word gay. I was like hey same, and he was just like uhhHhHh.,.,..,
Since they're single occupancy, he was probably embarrassed to be ""caught"" coming out of the women's and made a ""joke"" as an excuse. If he seems like a generally a decent person (i.e. if he seemed sincere about being happy you told him about yourself) this could be an opportunity to educate. But only if you feel that there could be benefit to it.
Reminds me of my first time attempting to come out to my mom. I was trying to explain to her I wasn't a girl and whatnot...Very poorly.

To which she responded ""Yeah, me, too. I think we should break gender roles."" And I was like ok, that doesn't sound bad?

So then I tried to explain the dysphoria aspect and...Well...She told me there was something wrong with me and no ""woman"" should feel like that and that my cousin had schizophrenia so that's probably what I have, too...

That was terrible.
Maybe he's an egg.
My sister pretends to be a trans ally. She makes money selling feminizing drugs and promoting trans issues. However, my sister calls me homophobic slurs at home and sexually abused me when she was a teen. I want to report her but no one would believe and she’s a financially successful mother. Also, if people found out. About my identity I wouldn’t be safe.
God, what an asshole. I'm sorry you have to work with him
When people do shit like that, I like to over-cater to them. I ask about all sorts of details about what makes them uncomfortable being treated as a cis person, pronouns, social dysphoria, dysmorphia, the whole bit. If you make a big deal out of it and are overly sincere, it can make them think a bit, or at least annoy them back. It’s kind of like saying “identifying as a gender actually means something you douchebag”. This game is especially fun to play with attack helicopters... poor dears, they just want to fly...
Why do people do that? I don't get it. Do they enjoy mocking LGBTQ folks or is it that they just don't use their brain at all to overthink their actions?
Oh yeah I started with ""What pronouns do you use? Shall I use they/them for you"" and I then had to explain using they/them in the singular and then he laughed and said ""Yeah sure do that haha"". So infuriating."	ecnn2c	NonBinary	30	0.92	2019-12-19 03:46:58

All-Gender Multi-Stall Restroom!!	I have finally seen one in the wild. The sushi place I ate at tonight has 3 bathrooms - 2 single occupant (labeled simply restroom) and an All-Gender bathroom. They employed an extremely complex solution to ensure everyone's comfort there - the stalls are fully enclosed. Such an innovative, advanced concept, it's completely understandable why no one has implemented it before. /s	"My person's college has a dorm that has a unisex restroom, as well as a unisex shower room (again, separate stalls), and a room that's just sinks for brushing your teeth. I think that makes so much more sense than gendered stuff
We have ones that are basically ada
I've also found a few in a bar situated on the corner of a boulevard and a tram line. Quite meh facilities, tho i guess they're better than most. It's pretty obvious which one used to be the ladies and which one used to be the gents tho, as one (still) has urinals.
there's a brewery in my city that has a fantastic, large first-come seating space (hard to find here) and an amazing fully individual stall design (with like...30+ stalls?!) with a central hand washing sink. amazing bathroom design. it feels totally natural. unfortunately their beer kind of sucks. but I definitely still go there and admire the bathroom design every time!
The first place I ever saw this was a whole foods actually, which I went into specifically for the bathroom. It was a pretty long line and while I was near the end watching people come up and see the situation I enjoyed how confused so many of them seemed lol. A few even got upset and left.
I've seen plenty, but it's always in gay bars or queer spaces, which makes sense!

In the UK it's not totally uncommon for restaurants to have them, but it's not the norm either.

Stalls here tend to be fully enclosed or almost - on American TV I see that they have a crazy amount of space to see inside! I don't think I'd ever go to the bathroom over there, haha.
Only places I've seen those have been college campuses and at my church. Always a great feeling."	dktwqx	NonBinary	31	1.0	2019-10-21 02:30:39

Am I faking it?	"I am so confused about my gender identity. I am totally fine with people calling me female (afab) and using she/her pronouns, but I also want people to use they and he pronouns too (I'm either female, agender, or non-binary). However I'm scared to tell people to use any pronouns, because I'd be losing the female part of my identity or something.

I've taken tests online to see if I have gender dysphoria but it really doesn't seem like it, because I like my chest area and don't feel uncomfortable going to the women's bathroom or being called she/her. I'd like to bind my chest and stuff but not because my body makes me feel uncomfortable, just because some days I want to present more androgynously. Can I be trans if I don't have dysphoria? I'm questioning, but what if I'm just female and overthinking everything?

I don't feel any gender inside me, really, which is why I think I'm agender/enby, but it's like I'm attached to the pronouns and labels that go with being female. I simultaneously want to and don't want to transition.

I'm so confused. Any of you have some advice or knowledge about this kind of thing?"	"Believe in your instincts. In times when we are unsure of ourselves, it might be helpful to rely on labels and identities. You are free to pursue your happiness.

I met them through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates), and I adore their sense of style.

They've given me a lot to think about, and I think highly positive things about them.
There's only so much good thinking can do before we have to act and do. All you need is one friend who is curious and excited to explore with you. Play with clothes and with pronouns and any other bit of expressing that strikes your fancy. Play with them in different contexts, playful and mundane. Trust your feelings. You're not obliged to want to wear the same outfit every day. 

It's sometimes nice to lean on labels and identities when we're unsure of ourselves. They can give us confidence to try on a certain way of being and really go all in. That's valuable. Feel free to take the enby label for as long as it's useful to you! No one is ever precisely who they think they are. And human beings are much too intricate, ever-changing, strange and beautiful to be perfectly contained by boxes or labels or identities. 

You're not fake. You're complex. And you have all the right questions to begin acting and playing to figure out who you are. <3
pronouns have no gender ! You can do whatever you want, I exlusively use they them but if someone chooses to use she / he doesn't mean they are binary or cis
Gender dysphoria tests are pretty geared to the 'binary' trans(ftm or mtf) experience and not so much to nonbinary people. They are also geared to more extreme versions of dysphoria. Some people feel varying degrees of discomfort or apathy/disconnect or fluidity. For a more professional opinion, I'd talk to a gender therapist.
Safety note: Binders can be dangerous if worn incorrectly. Be sure to do research before trying one out
I found this post because I was having similar thoughts. For a long time, I didn't care what people called me, and I didn't change my name. But it really bothered me that nobody is really taking my other pronouns seriously after I identified with he/him, they/them, AND she/her. So maybe a month or two ago, I stopped accepting she/her, but I'm still fine with my name. I feel the same about my dysphoria, as i feel its not as bad as binary trans peoples' dysphoria. I'm fine with my genitals, and my breasts only bother me sometimes. I don't mind being seen as a woman or using that restroom, but I've been thinking its because I'm scared what might happen if I try to change what I've known all my life for something I'm not even sure defines me yet. So, I searched, ""how do I know if I'm faking being non-binary,"" looking for someone to tell me that it was all in my head, that I shouldn't believe myself if I wasn't 100% sure. But instead, I was sent here, where the comments are supportive, thoughtful, and wise. I don't think there is anything wrong with how either of us are feeling, or maybe you don't feel this way anymore, as it has been a year since this question was posted. I think you were, and I am, going through an experimental phase. And when most people think of an ""experimental phase"" they think of clothes, or music, or hobbies. But I believe that now that the alphabet mafia is becoming more accepted, it should also be normalized to experiment with sexuality and gender, or lack thereof. It is an important piece of self-image and identity that I feel the majority of the human race has neglected. Curious cis-het people or even people already in the community, should try to learn more about themselves. Even if it turns out there really wasn't anything out there different from what you know that stuck with you, at least you tried. You won't have regrets about never trying to explore yourself and your identity, and you'll be more confident as a cis person. I feel it is the lack of confidence in someone's identity that drives their hatred in homophobic and transphobic acts. I hope you're doing well now, this question and the answers to it helped me a lot, and I'm sure it helped numerous other people struggling with their identity as well. Rose
As someone who literally just googled ""Am I faking being nonbinary"" knowing full well I am 100% nonbinary, you ARE nonbinary if you are questioning it
wow! i am literally in a full blown non-binary crisis right now and i feel so seen by these comments. as many of y’all i feel fine with the woman part in me it really is just the pronouns. i like my boobs sometimes but other times i wish i could walk around shirtless with nothing there. i feel fine with my name but she/her pronouns just sound like nails on a chalk board to me. i truly appreciate everyone being so open and honest and feeling seen!!❤️❤️
I just want to say that this comment made my day
I've been struggling with this exact thing. Thank you for this comment
Needed to hear this ty!
Ty! I needed this <3
Thanks so much for typing out this thoughtful response, I actually forgot about this post so it's nice to see that my past confusion is validating for others. If it helps in any way, I am now confident in my non-binary identity after trying stuff out and getting more comfortable with internalized cis-normativity telling me I was faking it. Also, I learned about social dysphoria, which is one of many lesser-known kinds of dysphoria that would have helped me explain my confusing emotions greatly had I known before (feel free to do some research on it). The thing is, everyone has ups and downs in the journey it takes to understand yourself, and that's okay. Don't stress too much about if you're faking it or not, you have to have some trial and error to grow. Nobody can define you except yourself, and if I could do it, so can you.
Ummmmmmm 😂😂😂 that is I got to this thread
the idea that “your are non-binary if you are questioning whether you’re non-binary” is very problematic!

which bathroom to use?	"AMAB non-binary here. I'm at a point in my transition where I'm still very much male -passing, but aim to be completely androgynous someday. My question is what bathroom to use in the meantime? I mainly use the men's room because I look like a dude and I don't want to seem like a creep in the women's room. However, I feel a lot more comfortable in the woman's room. I don't want to bother anyone, but I also am guessing most women don't care. What should I do?
Thanks!"	"go where theres the least possible risk of being assaulted. prioritize safety.
I have the opposite. I fear the risk of being assaulted for being Enby, because red states and also just people not realising that Enbys don't NEED to be androgynous.   
Side tangent: >!I hate that modern shows and media keep portraying the majority Nonbinary representation as ""what are you"" or ""neither male or female"" in appearance. Some, like myself, do not have the safety or even the financial capabilities to do so. So, it will eternally aggravate me that Enbys can't be themselves. All because society now believes that we MUST look Nonbinary to be, nonbinary. !<

But yeah. Prioritise safety above all. Hailing from a red state myself (AMAB, NB), you need to absolutely be safe and ensure you aren't attacked before comfort or euphoria. Even I learned this recently. 

Stay safe, a fellow Enby passerby! <3
Agree with the other comments all saying safety first.

If a tie for safety, then going for better comfort as tie breaker makes sense.
I suggest using the women's. You're right that most don't care. People are there to do what they came to do and get out. I dunno where you live but my experience where I live in Canada is any security or staff see it as more of a bother if anyone brings it up to them. All they care about is that people are safe and, in those instances, the people complaining are the ones making others unsafe.
I guess it depends where you are.  Is there more risk of a Karen calling the cops or of being attacked by a drunk?
I would say go in the one you’re less likely to get hatecrimed in. Fuck this fucked up world
Considering the factors you've mentioned and the fact that you're in the US in a red state I'd say stick to the men's for your own safety.
agree
That's a good point. I do live in a red state in the US though, so I'm slightly more worried about people caring and complaining
Totally valid and ultimately your safety matters more.
I’m AFAB and present very androgynous.. I use the women’s room and get looks, questioned and made uncomfortable quite regularly. I live in NE. I think for the most part, women that enter the bathroom just get worried that they themselves have entered the wrong bathroom, but occasionally I run into someone who takes it a step further and confronts me. I’ve learned to live with it, as I feel very uncomfortable going into the men’s room. If I am very worried based on where I am, I.e more rural areas, I will try to find a single/all people restroom or bring a “passing” cis-woman as a sorta shield. Good luck out there OP."	117089b	NonBinary	26	0.93	2023-02-20 07:01:37
Genitals	Why does everyone care so much what genitals we’re born with? Isn’t it more interesting to know what we currently have and eventually want to have? And even that only matters for bathrooms and sex...	"It doesn’t even matter for bathrooms. I really don’t care what genitals the person in the next stall has. I’m not planning on peeking
Nb and ace here. I'd rather just have no genitals.
also depending on the person it doesn't even really matter for sex. ass is ass
I'm honestly not sure how I feel about this (in regards to sex in general). I'm bi/demi so it's hard for me to wrap my mind around -- but a lot of monosexuals may be specifically attracted to certain types of genitals. 

Does that make those people transphobic? If they're totally supportive of trans folks in every other area, but just don't want to bang people with certain genitals (regardless of gender), should we expect them to feel differently? 

Just running around asking random people about their genitals is fucking ridiculous. Worrying about what's in the pants of the person in a bathroom stall, fucking ridiculous. Worrying about people's kids' genitals, what the everloving fuck. 

But when it comes to sex stuff, I get all befuddled.
I feel like this isn’t a first-date or tinder type of question but maybe it’s valid to ask when you’re getting serious, both people are consenting to sex and want it to go smoothly?

I’m out of the dating scene and have been for some time but this just never seemed like an appropriate question to ask someone unless you’re specifically planning to make them comfortable for an intimate interaction.
Yeah, I don't get it either
Well... I can’t use the urinal very well.
SAME
A person of good taste 👌
I think of it like this: I’m not ace. I am attracted to certain parts and others just don’t interest me. (Boobs and penises are great! Vaginas are meh until I can have a penis installed, maybe then I’ll feel differently.) But I DON’T have a gender preference. That all being said, if someone with the right personality comes along, that personality will turn me on like crazy and I suddenly care a lot less about their junk. So it depends, really, on my partner’s personality and what we’re doing. I have a pretty deep kink so that helps simplify things for me... if you are good at it, then I am interested. If you’re not, then I am not.

That’s my sexuality. Is it pansexual? Well, no, not really. I definitely have a preference. But it’s weird and kinky, just like me.

That probably does not help at all, but that’s how it is for me.

I originally wrote this post because I used to work in customer service as a trans man with a he/him pronoun button and I could almost see the “wait... what genitals do you have?” question forming.

That annoys me. I mean, who fucking cares? I’m selling you groceries. My genitals are not an issue.
Yeah, and in that sort of situation, I’m totes fine with it. In fact, I’m usually the one who brings it up first in a dating/sex context, just to make stuff clear. (In fact I might go ahead and add that to my profile... AFAB but on Testosterone.)

But the more comfortable I get with trans and enby stuff, the more I realize that it’s rather odd how total strangers who I’m casually talking to wonder what’s in my pants.

Could some kind soul answer a couple questions from a young confused person?	"1. How did you know you were non-binary?
2. What are the sexuality terms that go with being non-binary? Can you still use the terms straight or gay?
3. What are some of the best ways to present as more androgynous?
4. What are some non-gendered terms of formal address like Mr or Mrs?
5. What are differences between terms like non-binary, gender-queer, gender-fluid and the like?
6. What bathroom do you use if you're non-binary?

It would really help me if you could give me some answers, as I am but young, confused, and scared. Thank you for not judging me lol. Also my apologies if that's not the correct fair."	"Mx. (pronounced ""mix"") is a common gender neutral form of Mr. Or Ms.
Trixic is a term (I personally) like for nonbinary attracted to women, and toric is my favourite for nonbinary attracted to men. I hope this helped! There are of course more terms, but there are a lot and these are my personal favourite!"	g94jna	NonBinary	25	0.95	2020-04-27 16:56:27
I might be non-binary	"Hello. I'm not the best with introductions, but my name is Natt. (My birth name is Natalie. Want to trade names???? lol)

I was born female, but I experienced a lot of gender dysphoria growing up. I think it started when I was six years old. I didn't have any friends who were girls, because I was frequently bullied by them for being ""different "".

I remember some girls blocking the entrance to the girls bathroom because I acted and sounded like a ""boy"".

When I tried going to the boys bathroom, the teachers would shout at me to get out. When I got older, I liked being called ""bro and dude"". I had Ninja Turtles and Transformers themed birthdays.

I remember feeling a deep connection to the word ""adrogynous"" and I liked adrogynous fictional characters. 

People simply thought I was a tomboy. In my early teens, I kind of had a ""feminine phase"". However, that was quickly ruined by some inappropriate responses from adult relatives and my moms boyfriend.

Finally, at age 18 I cut my hair and started dressing masculine. I felt really good and I felt like myself. I hated wearing makeup and other things that gave me a feminine appearance. 

I grew my hair out, but then I cut it again. I'm 25 years old and I recently discovered what non binary means. I have a non-binary friend and I wonder if I'm like them.

I don't mind she/her pronouns but I also don't mind they/them. Also, I don't think I can come out to my family because they are the religious Baptist type."	"Maybe you are, but only you can decide that for yourself.
Honestly? That sounds pretty similar to my experience. I've never been very excited about being seen as a girl (which is my assigned gender), and after getting my hair cut short and wearing more androgynous clothes I was finally able to look in the mirror and start feeling like I was looking at myself. I identify as nonbinary, and I use they/them pronouns, although I'm not very attached to any pronouns in particular. 

If you're looking for validation, you have as much right as anyone I know to call yourself nonbinary. If you're looking for answers, I can't really give them to you, other than telling you that if being nonbinary makes you happy then that's what you are. It certainly sounds like it does, and if you choose to embrace it, then welcome to the community!

(Side note: I totally feel you about not coming out to your family; I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian home and even though I've been publicly out for years they still use my birth name and pronouns. Keep yourself safe, first and foremost. You don't owe anyone your gender identity.)
I think you and I have had a somewhat similar experience. When I was younger I leaned towards ""masculine"" interests, characters, clothes, etc. and I still do to this day. I didn't consider myself FtM trans and never did, and eventually I discovered that I might just be nonbinary.

I understand not being able to come to your family. I'm from a very religious eastern Orthodox family that I know would not accept me. I'm thinking of waiting until I've moved out and become independent to fully publicly embrace my NB identity (including to them - my bf/friends/coworkers are all aware by now). If you feel like it isn't safe to come out to your family now, I would suggest waiting it out as well, as frustrating as it can be.
You just might be non-binary, try the term on for some time, see how you feel about it. 
Maybe treat it like buying shoes; put them on, walk around, jump up and down and if you like the fit they're yours.

Even if your non-binary friend experiences aspects of their gender differently that doesn't mean you can't also be non-binary.
Natt you are so very welcome here! It sounds like non-binary might be the fit for you. If not, you could also think about ""genderqueer"" or other such terms.

I understand your concerns about religious family. My family is very religious and I don't think I'll ever come out to my parents. It's okay if you do or don't come out, and it can happen on whatever timeline you choose.

I'm so excited for you to find this community!
I am starting to consider it.
Hey thank you so much for the advice. I also never felt right being wholly ""female"". It always felt a little off. I feel very welcomed, thank you :33
I'm sorry that you are in the same situation. It feels good to know that there are others out there like me. I think that waiting until you move out is a good idea, because you don't have to live with an unsupportive family. I don't know if I made any sense or not lol
Oh that is a good idea. Thank you!!!!
Hey thank you so much for welcoming me. I appreciate your kindness so much. Trust me, I know how having a religious family can be. I'm glad we at least have this as well as other communities.
It makes sense haha!

I agree it's better to wait, I hope that your situation gets better as well :)
Thank you so much :'3"	t20p8y	NonBinary	27	0.97	2022-02-26 16:18:13

Could I Be Non-Binary/Agender?	"I know you probably get this question all the time, but it's been weighing me down a lot.

I'm AFAB and with my friends the last couple of months I've been identifying as a trans guy. But a part of me feels it's much more likely I'm non-binary or agender. Online in certain parts I've actually been identifying as trans-masculine and it's been working for now but I still don't know if it's really that accurate. 

Also, I know that labels don't really matter but I am obsessed and won't be able to settle down until I get an actual idea of what I can call myself, even if it's just in private.

Well... Here are the facts -

* I don't like she/her pronouns. I don't mind they/them pronouns. He/him pronouns are weird but I think I like these most.

* I have friends both male and female (no NB friends that I know of) and I feel a connection to all of them, but when I'm looking at strangers trying to see if I connect more with the guys or with the girl, it's typically neither. Sometimes it's a little more towards the guys but that depends.

* If I HAD to be seen as one or the other, I'd rather be a guy but I would rather just be neither.

* I honestly, truly wish I lived in a genderless world. 

* Some days I feel like I'm definitely non-binary and I'm just fooling myself by sticking to the binary because it would be easier and I have some internalized shit to sort out when I think of non-binary identities.

* I kind of want to identify as agender and say I ""don't have a *specific* gender"" but I know that doesn't really fit the definition all that well.

* When it comes to bathrooms, I very, very heavily prefer gender neutral bathrooms and feel most comfortable there, though I don't hate the women's bathroom and I haven't tried the men's bathroom due to anxiety.

* In a way, I feel like partially every gender and partially none at all, though clearly more male than female. I feel very ""other"" most of the time.

* I get some dysphoria, mostly about my chest, sometimes about my genitals (honestly, my preferred genitals would be the bottom growth on T and nothing else), my name, and mildly about pronouns/being called a girl.

* Sometimes I don't hate my feminine body, but I almost wish it were a costume I could take off most of the time. Which I know is not an option, but it's how I feel.

Well, I think that just about covers it. I'm also in the process of getting a therapist but there's a chance they won't be a gender therapist because I haven't come clean to my parents about my questioning and even still, the process is slow going.

Thanks for being here, by the way.
"	"It sounds like you kinda know already & just don't wanna admit to yourself by giving it a name because that means stuff is gonna change. What you're failing to consider is the change could be good for you & make you more comfortable.


Give that therapy a shot, even if it's not with a gender therapist. I'm getting the sense there's more at play here than just wanting a label.


If that's really all you need though, then go with genderqueer for now. It's not like you can't pick a more precise word later if you wanna.
To me it sounds like you're agender with a hint of demiboy. (Although I don't identify with either of those, so I'm not sure how accurate it is.) But then again, the masculine leaning might be the result of being called a girl your entire life and wanting to be the ""opposite"" for a change.
You used ""sometimes"" a few times in your post. If how you feel changes (not just dysphoria coming and going), you might be genderfluid. It's possible to be genderfluid between nonbinary genders too. If the label nonbinary feels comfy for you, you could just use that to explain all of those experiences.
you sound a lot like me. the people around me see me as a binary transguy, but in reality, i don't like he/him pronouns that much more than she/her pronouns, though i do prefer them. as well as RE: gendered bathrooms, body dysphoria, neutrality - we're very similar.

no one can tell you what you are. so i advise you to take time to think about it. explore your own thoughts and feelings. put yourself in different situations, e.g. try presenting as female for a day vs. presenting as male, or try a men's restroom and see how it feels. do you have a strong preference? or is it all a similar sort of anxious muck with no distinguishable winner? then you might not be binary. best of luck.
Maybe take a look at the neutrois label? I'm still looking for my aha moment with a label that fits right. Alot of folks say neutrois and agender are the same, but I feel differently. 

""Neutrois is a non-binary gender identity which is often associated with a ""neutral"" or ""null"" gender. It may also be associated with genderlessness, and shares many similarities with agender - people who consider themselves neutrally gendered or genderless, but some may identify as both, while others may prefer one term or the other.
Neutrois people may experience dysphoria and wish to transition. Often, Neutrois people prefer their gender expression to be gender neutral or androgynous.""
I feel similarly to you in many ways. I'm AFAB and I've always said ""I'm gender neutral, maybe a little masculine."" It's been years and lately I'm trying to process it more again because I've started feeling insecure about being biologically feminine again. I feel like you're probably agender. I've been trying to sort it out between agender, nonbinary, and gender fluid after only briefly thinking I might be trans male.

They say trans people go through a hyper feminine or hyper masculine phase. I think we as agenders do that too. I think that since I was born female and have had femininity pushed on me, I went through a hyper masculine phase. Maybe you're doing that.
> Sometimes I don't hate my feminine body, but I almost wish it were a costume I could take off most of the time. Which I know is not an option, but it's how I feel.

That's how I feel about the masculine aspects of my body.  Tucking is not fun."	8beg0e	NonBinary	27	0.94	2018-04-11 04:34:41
Enby tings	Being non-binary is walking into the men’s bathroom cause the women’s was full instead of waiting as Freddy Mercury is playing and saying “it doesn’t really matter” over the PA system	"So I’m in my yoga pants, scarf and cropped purple hoody and my small black purse, walk into the men’s room at the airport a few weeks ago since I pee standing up, and was walking away from the urinal after doing my business and a guy walks in, sees me, and RUNS OUT, like he didn’t know how to handle this femme person in a men’s bathroom. It was really funny.

Great bathroom experience last weekend had me euphoric as fuck!	"Bit of a long one.

So last weekend I went to a club that was throwing queer friendly event. I'm AMAB and having been try to go out more in more typical feme outfits to test the waters. That night I was wearing skirt, crop top, and purple lipstick So the night is going super well having a good time with my friends and making new one's and the nature calls... so this club is usually  relatively straight which meant gendered bathrooms.... The vibe was good so I picked up the courage to go to the womxn's, this this the first time I've been to in one in such a public and busy place. So I walk in and everyone is cool and the are a few non-femes but no bats an eye at me. So I'm waiting my turn and I see most of the femes going in the stalls two by two. I'm like cool, I'll wait my turn and go alone. Then this person in front of me, who looked AFAB and expressing that, who I have never met before, and says ""Hey wanna grab the next stall together?"". And of course  I agree. So we go in the stall both take our turns and exchange chit chat and leave. I have never felt so included in my life, by some stranger too.

So defs had an amazing night and beaming the whole night. Even after go to get some food and get my phone pick pocketed. Nothing was gonna take feeling away from me.  I has filled with a lot of hope that one day I will be able to dress the way I want in the sun shine.

Short version: Went to a club and went to the womxn's bathroom. shared a stall with a stranger womxn and felt super included and happy."	"Wait, is stall-sharing a common practice in clubs? I've never been clubbing. Either way, nicely done.
Great! 
Yeah it is. There's a club I used to go to in my town that even has a double toilet stall and twice the room. Its not a disabled stall because the entire club starts up a flight of stairs and isn't accessible at all. It just kinda exists.
I’ve never experienced that at a club, but that’s just my experience.
I think I was cos it was so busy, it speeds up the waiting process. But I don't don't it? Lol"	94uwzh	NonBinary	27	0.97	2018-08-05 20:28:18
I (30nb) am struggling big time with acceptance.	"Hi guys. Like I said I am Non-Binary but having a hard time with acceptance. I was born female but don’t look like a stereotypical female and I have a hard time using public bathrooms. I use the female bathroom because I have those parts but definitely don’t feel male or female. I just feel like me. I get major looks and get nervous going in because I have short hair, dress more masculine. I also am a car sales person which is primarily a male business and get misgendered quite often. I use an all gender bathroom as much as I can, but sometimes it’s just not an option. 

Another issue I’m having is that I am planning on having children soon with my (29f) fiancé. I have no idea what to have my future children call me. We have come up with a cute name for nieces and nephews as RaRa. I like the idea of my future children calling me Nonni but it is WAY to close to my first name. 

Any insight on these issues would help out tremendously as this has been bothering me for a while."	"I've seen other non-binary people mention ren/renny (short for parent) as a gender-neutral term for their kids to use!
As a NB parent I am ok with mom. Because anyone is able to be a mom. But I understand if someone would be uncomfortable with that.
Depending on your name, it could be a fun shorter version or something with a Y on the end. 
Like if your name was Susan. Susu Su-ie etc.
My partner and I refer to me as Baba to our cats, and I plan to use that for kids too. I like that it’s a masc term of respect for being a father in some Asian languages, but also plays on the Russian for grandma ‘babushka’. Plus it sounds gender neutral in English."	y7b5ah	NonBinary	27	1.0	2022-10-18 16:07:28
Trouble Accepting Myself 10 Years After Transistioning	"I could word barf for hours about this because I came out at 14 and I'm 24 now but let me preface this: where I live trans life is night and day now. I am hopeful for society to keep learning and changing.

My dilemma: I came out as ftm because it was easier to choose he than something else at the time for me. I learned quickly I knew wasn't necessarily a boy but it didn't matter because I was able to get all the medical, social, legal things I wanted.

Growing up I didn't pass as a girl. Long hair, feminine clothes, I got kicked out of bathrooms and misgendered. My (transphobic and estranged) mother growing up told me she got my ears pierced because as a baby people told her she had a beautiful son. And piercing my ears or putting on dresses didn't stop it! (I look back on that now and laugh...). As a kid I remember wishing I could be a women one day, inherently somehow knew there was some doubt? But women seemed awesome?

Even when I try to dress 'male' or 'female' I get it wrong! People see through it. Kids understand somehow I'm not really a boy or girl with me fruitlessly trying to tell them I'm a boy. At least a few times a year I get a stranger stopping me to tell me they can't tell if I'm a boy or girl and I'm beautiful. One time I had a stranger at the DMV point at me, ask my partner ""what is that? Is it boy? Because it's so beautiful"" and then just stared at me for a bit. I didn't respond because this. Is. Not. The. First. Time. My partner finally got to experience what I go through. He just says he thinks I'm intersex but my doctor doesn't and it's beside the point I feel.

It's been ten years and I don't feel any less visible. I've nearly erased my dysphoria but I rarely experience euphoria. I recently found out my family has a long history of male puberty starting late which explains why it took me double the time to physically become more masculine than my peers (I've been on T for 6 years and only began shaving this year, yes my doctor and I have been actively talking about it). And when I look at gender labels I just can't get the past how don't want some lesser known term. I want to just know what I am, others to know that, and be able to settle. It feels like everyone else can accept I'm nonbinary but I can't. 

With nonbinary people becoming more accepted, especially in my area of teaching and geography, I feel increasingly frustrated for some reason. I don't get kicked out of any gendered space anymore regardless of how I look now but I'm still on guard for rational reasons. I also realize I'm 24. But I just really want a label home and a community I can claim. Idk.

Thanks for listening at least, It's been hard to find in person trans spaces for obvious reasons."	"You have my sympathy, that doesn't sound like an easy path. ""Queer"" feels the most like home to me, because no label really feels like it tells the whole story, just more of a foreword or intro."	p86e2h	NonBinary	24	0.92	2021-08-20 14:31:36

Starting a business marketing to trans and nonbinary people- need your opinion?	"My girlfriend and I are going to start up a small business to help fight cisnormativity by providing products that are gender neutral and/or more trans inclusive.
Wedding decor, bathroom signs, greeting cards- these are a few starting points for us to open up the market to families and relationships that are not two hetero cis people.

We’ll have a specific emphasis on normalizing gender neutral language and normalizing terms like “mx.” and pronouns like “they/them” and “ze/zir”, because I have a lot of personal experience with these as a nonbinary person!

What are some things (products or markets) you’d like to see be advertised more neutrally or in a less cisnormative way? Your opinions will help us make the products you want to see and I appreciate any and all feedback!!! 
"	"Greeting cards for sure. The only option for an ungendered birthday card is usually the dumb joke genre. If you want anything more sincere or loving your choices all have daughter, son, etc on them. 

Baby stuff. Especially alternatives to ""gender reveal"" parties and stuff like ""It's a boy!"" yard signs. (I think a whole genre of ""It's a ____!"" yard signs would be hilarious but I'm also a little odd.) You might look at old fashioned independent toy shops for an avenue of distribution. The ones that have wooden trains and neutral puzzle toys and such.

Bathroom signs that literally say ""toilet"" and have a toilet graphic on them (The man/woman/alien bathroom signs are meh.)
[deleted]
There are some bathroom products I'd love to see advertised more neutrally. Wet wipes, period products, razors, deodorant, f\*ing soap or toothbrushes sometimes. I understand if it's not what you want to be selling, but I am heartily sick of trying to choose between shit that works and shit that isn't coded. Bathroom routines are hard enough as it is without being faced with the choice between the razor that's supposed to look like a race car and the razor that's supposed to look all glittery pink unicorn fantasy. It is too danged early.
Someone mentioned greeting cards and I have to second that. Looking for a Valentine's card as a non-binary person (and my spouse looking for one too) is just frustrating.
But what if I *like* to use the bathroom with the mermaid on the sign?
I agree!! Wedding stuff is so hard to find.
My take is that we are already dehumanized enough as trans/NB folks, we don't need to be compared to mythical creatures. We are REAL HUMANS and we need bathroom signs with toilets or urinals so we know what to expect when we walk in. 

Though I have been to some cons where the mermaid/alien signs would actually WORK. It's about context. 
I don't inherently disagree with you. In a ""serious"" setting, a ""Toilet"" sign is good and sufficient.

There is a book/toy/game store near me that's very LGBTQ-inclusive and the toilet has a mermaid/pirate/centaur (or something) sign that says ""Whatever. Just wash your hands."" And in that context, I think it's wonderful (also, hand-washing is important!). In a corporate office or a Target, that would be weird.

So yeah, I was being slightly tongue-in-cheek. But I have always kinda wanted to be a mermaid...
I recently saw one (online) where it was also a lot of different figures with 'whatever' underneath... but all the figures (with exception of the one in a wheelchair) were *very obviously gendered* (like a feminine mermaid, a manly pirate, etc...). To the extent that it gave me the impression of being deliberate... which just confuses me. "	9en6bl	NonBinary	27	0.97	2018-09-10 13:33:21
SOS- My mom walked in while I was trying to take off my cjkker and saw it- what should I do?	"Im not out to my parents (16AMAB) and I was trying on a choker in my bathroom. My mom just walked in and saw it. Uh.. any ideas in how I can get out of this one?

(EDIT: I meant to say choker but panic made me misspell it)"	"I mean chokers aren't exclusive to women in most of the subcultures they're popular in, so depending on the style, you could easily pass it off as trying a different style even if that isn't your actual goal.
Throat mic for some military operator esque cosplay?
How did she react? Has she said anything since then?
just tell them you are into heavy/dark metal music, and a bit into goth culture maybe. but yeah some heavy metal dudes paint nails black and ive seen some of them use a choker(i think it was a fan, im not sure) but yeah choker is common in heavy metal emo culture

edit: they are called ""Punk Goth Rock Heavy Metal Spikes Spiked D O Round Button Leather Choker Collar Necklace"" , can be found on aliexpress .com
How do you think she would react to you coming out? Cuz these kind of interactions are only going to keep happening if you have to live with your parents for much longer. Also reminding your mom that knocking is a thing can start it's own issues 😕
My mom figured me out long before I (still haven't) came out to her.. she's done her best to ignore it (religious reasons). Your mom may not bring it up til you do.
When I first started buying clothes in the store I would say it was for a bet
To get out of it you either stretch it or undo it like a belt. Now to get out of your parents confronting you might be a bit trickier. I think once they do then we'll actually know how to move forward. From your post it just seems like your mom saw it and left so idk if you have much to worry about. Did she give you a weird look or anything?

Just transferred into the gender inclusive dorm and I’m scared people won’t accept me	Hello I’m (19 AMAB NB) a student, and after a week of classes I realized I wouldnt be able to handle using the men’s bathroom and my school was great and they said since it was early enough in the year I could transfer in the gender inclusive dorm. I moved in today and I’m sort of scared that people on my floor won’t accept me because I still look so cis. I was able to get a pronoun sticker and put my preferred pronouns on it and I finally shaved my beard off but I’m really scared that i look so cis. I was going to paint my nails for the first time but I wasnt able to and I look like a regular cis guy and I fear they won’t accept me	"I'm sure you're not the only one in this situation. I bet there are a lot of other people there who are only just now being open about their identities, or who are still very new to it. And college is a time where everyone's identity is shifting in big and small ways anyway.

More importantly, though, there's no one, single look for nonbinary people. Lots of us ""look cis"". If that's how you prefer to present, that's totally valid. And if it's not and you haven't figured out how you'd like to present, that's fine too. In that case, if you ask around, I bet you'll find a lot of people there who would be enthusiastic about helping you come up with a new look!
There is no one way to be Nonbinary. Just be the best you you can be. The whole point of a gender inclusive dorm is to be inclusive, everyone belongs. So if people there are excluding you because of the way you dress, then they’re the ones who are wrong. 
The other part of that is that it’s a dorm, and there are people there to support you, including RAs and housing staff. Use those support systems. 

You got this <3
We love our baby gays. You'll be just fine <3
They've all either already had this exact experience or are having it right there, right now with you!

Ask around, I guarantee one of them will be willing to share nail polish. If you have a hall meeting (which you probably will) it's a good opportunity to get to know people.
Ideally I’d want to look perfectly androgynous 
Keep in mind that looking perfectly androgynous is nearly impossible. Like others have said, your identity is how you identify. If someone tries to tell you that you're not really non-binary, that's not there place. 

I imagine what you'll find is a lot more acceptance than otherwise. Obviously I cant speak for everyone, but the non-binary people that I've met have been some of the most accepting and inclusive people I've met.
I’m realistic in the sense that I know it wont ever be perfect but I really don’t want to look like a guy anymore, and I dont want to look too much like a girl either

My Gym has gender neutral bathrooms!	"I live in Melbourne and I've noticed a few places with gender neutral bathrooms. My uni has a few (5ish?) scattered around campus with 'all-gender' signs on them. And my last 2 gyms have had exclusively gender neutral bathrooms instead of men's/women's. One of these had 2 stalls with the toilet/sink/shower inside the stall so there was no shared area at all. The other is one big bathroom with about 12 stalls that anyone can use and shared sinks. Both of these gyms were built in the last few years, so I'm hoping this means its becoming standard to offer neutral bathrooms.

Its so nice to be able to use a public bathroom in the 2 places I frequent most without needing to worry about which I should be using."	"Ay that's awesome! Currently at my job, we're in the process of moving buildings (we had one built) and the new place has a gender neutral locker room! Unfortunately it'll probably be about a month (or so I'm told) until it's operational bc the building's still under construction but still a win
That's great!"	y62qpd	NonBinary	25	1.0	2022-10-17 05:42:39
Third bathroom or genderless toilets?	Hi everyone, in my school they have to decide if they want to put a third bathroom for non binary people and my mother, being the headmaster, has asked me what I think about that. She doesn't know if it's better to put a third bathroom, remove the gender from all the bathrooms or just tell the non binary community in the school to go in whatever toilet they want to. I gave her my opinion but I'd like to know a few suggestions from someone who is non binary and experiences this kind of discomfort. Thanks to everyone who will take the time to answer❤️🏳️‍🌈	"I think bathrooms should not be gendered, but that would be in an ideal world in my head. Irl, the option of a third bathroom would work better and have less complaints from other students and their families
I can understand the school's interest in offering a separate space like this to reflect the separateness of non-binary identities from a traditional dichotomous bathroom structure. However, with schools in particular, I am afraid students who might benefits from that separate facility might feel stigmatized away from using it, for fear of reprimand from bullies and even negative social consequences from less-than-understanding friends. So, if the school goes that route, they should also be prepared to handle issues that spring up in its wake for an already vulnerable student group.   


Also, if the school cannot add this third bathroom immediately adjacent or in the general vicinity of the existing school bathrooms, they should not go this route. Making non-binary students trek across the school to a single set of bathrooms ""meant for them"" can be stigmatizing as well, not to mention inconvenient. If anything, offering a unisex bathroom as an option while still allowing those students to use a traditional binary bathroom of their choice might be a good way to offer autonomy to these student.  


Good luck with this effort. I hope your school finds a viable solution that supports and protects students like you
In my university they flat out forgot to label bathrooms until 5 years after it had been opened and everybody just used whatever bathroom they wanted without problem so it was left this way. The stalls cover enough for everyone to have privacy and nobody minds. I feel this is the best since having gendered bathrooms that include nonbinary might still be uncomfortable for people who don't want to come out yet or are unsure of their gender.

Spare them the anxiety of having to choose and let the bathrooms be genderless, it's a lot easier for everyone.
Unisex bathrooms, all the way. Discomfort with shared bathrooms is learned, not innate. /u/babel-fishing also made many good points about possible factors to consider.
Hey! Me and two other students have managed to introduce a unisex toilet at our school and i can give you some Points.

- Not only Enby students might go to the Unisex Toilette. Maybe even Ftm/Mtf/other trans identitis, which arent out yet, but dont feeling comfortable to go to the toilett which is for the Gender assigned at birth.
- not every cis person wants to share with other genders
(Example: some cis girls dont want cis boys to use the same toilette)

So. I think a third toilettroom would be good and works fine in our school!
Its used by all Gender identities, or who is comfortable with.
We didnt had problems.
in german we have a short word to say anyone but a cis man, and my favorite toilet solution was to make half the toilets all gender toilets and half for everyone but a cis man. One study i once read showed, that basically all trans teens who have to go to the same bathrooms as cis boys got harrassed and bullied more. So imo there should be an option (also for cis girls) to be safe from that. If thats not an option I would just put a third ideally not just one and not unreachable & open the boys and girls bathroom for nonbinary kids too.
Genderless bathrooms in a public school are a recipe for disaster. This is because there is always a group of teenage boys that will destroy these bathrooms and make them filthy. This will start a flame war between girls and boys. Or worse the cis could blame us for their problems. This is because that they think that we chose this identity, and intended for this to happen. This belief will cause the cis to harass, and attack us for problems we didn't cause.

There is also a problem with having a third bathroom. This is related to harassment from the bigots on campus. These monsters will seek us out effectively by monitoring who walks into the third bathroom.

neither option is a good option.
Looking at it from an objective historical standpoint, bathrooms should not be gendered - and they weren't, until it became an upper-class affectation in the Victorian Era. 

However, as others have noted, third gender bathrooms would cause less distress among average parents who aren't well-appraised of what actually makes sense for anyone, much less GNC people.

Personally, separate bathrooms for trans/NB/GNC people is uncomfortably close to segregation. I don't cherish the idea of something being added ""for GNC people"" but that actually reinforces their status as a second class citizen.
I use it at my school :DDD

BUUUT Staff thinks it’s their ‘private bathroom’, some ppl use it to go #2, or girls use it to film tiktoks. 

It sucks because I end up missing ten+ minutes of class waiting. :(

Thank you, I will consider your opinion as I will with the others. I'm not non binary, though (Idk if that's what you meant with the last part), that's why I asked others
I second this, for sure.
What word is that? I’m very curious about it!
flinta its short for the german words for: women lesbian intersex nonbinary trans agender. Lesbian is not a gender, but its there for historical reasons. some ppl write variations like linta if they mean only queer ppl, tin if they mean trans inter and nonbinary ppl etc"	r48ha2	NonBinary	26	0.97	2021-11-28 16:45:07
any nb/transmasc folks feel this way?	"i’m non binary, use they/them pronouns, just started a low dose of T two months ago. I’m not a guy. I have wished that I was born a cis guy, but alas. But I don’t think I’m a guy. I’m content with being non-binary, except for the fact that the world works in the binary. And strangers gender me. Everyone genders me. I am constantly left to make uncomfortable choices between male and female bathrooms, SECURITY LINES AT CONCERTS, locker rooms, buying plane tickets, etc. the binary feels inescapable. sometimes I just feel like i should “go for it” and transition to male. but then that still wouldn’t be me. i’m not a woman, but i’m not a man.

I just truly feel stuck in this grey zone, and sometimes wonder if I should maybe “make my life easier” and transition. which is so ridiculous because trans people have it rough even if they fall into the binary, but it’s almost like, mtf or ftm folk are “accepted” more than nb folk. I honestly don’t mean to start any drama or play oppression olympics, I guess i’m just looking for other transmasc/nb people who feel the same way?"	"It took me a long time to realize I didn’t want to be a man I’m just the absence of femininity... and I’m sure as hell not killing my own spirit by forcing myself to either end of the spectrum just so OTHER PEOPLE can feel less threatened.
I’m NB / masc of centre and I’m really glad it wasn’t an option to transition back in my day (pre Internet when identities like nonbinary, genderqueer and “spectrums” hadn’t been invented yet.
The binary is what was causing my dysphoria... not the body I was in. So glad I was able to learn that naturally as I mature instead of after it was too late.

If you wish to transition further you’ll know when / if it’s time and questions like this won’t be in the way of that decision... celebrate where you are right now - it’s valid, it counts. You’re not “unfinished” ... it’s the world around you that is. 🦄💞
Nb here. All I can say (I’m AMAB) is to do whatever feels comfortable. Don’t feel pressured to fit into anything that doesn’t feel you. I don’t know if this helps. Just know that you are valid and a beautiful person. 
It took me years to figure out I'm a female aligned agender person who is butch. I identified as genderfluid in my teen years. If nonbinary or X was offered on ID's in TX I would take it.  I wear a binder from time to time for chest dysphoria. Sometimes its just accepting you live in a grey area. 
also i finally came out to my parents a little while ago and asked them to use my pronouns and it’s really like it’s harder for them that i use they/them than if i came out as a trans guy and used he/him. it’s so frustrating
I’ve been thinking about this lately on kind of a smaller scale, like I wish I was comfy with people using he/him for me along with they/them because yknow, not everyone knows how to and/or will use they pronouns, but I just can’t feel comfy with anything other than they/them
Yep, definitely. I wonder all the time if that's why I'm more content now with presenting female and hearing female pronouns. It was stressful to deal with those situations, as happy as it made me when I passed as male. I eventually stopped the T too, I just stopped wanting the changes. But I don't think I was ""cis all along"" - I think my feelings legitimately changed, and this reason could certainly be an influence on that change.

Pretty sure if being NB was more accepted and acknowledged, I would have continued living that way.
Yep I relate!
The world is unfortunately unkind to trans people for the most part (especially transfemmes, and especially TWOC)
But the world is still very binary, and it seems like nb are even harder to truly understand for most of the world. If our existence is acknowledged at all, we still are seen as “basically” one binary gender or the other. So there is a particular difficulty when you completely go against the binary social order yknow. 
Of course binary trans folks have really serious struggles! - but sometimes I think it is even trickier navigating the world as nb, depending on individual circumstances 
Yes! All of this! I’m NB AFAB and currently work in a LGBT workspace. My name I’m known by is pretty feminine and I’m in the process of getting the guts to open up about my neutral name I’ve chosen. And that’s coming from someone in a queer workspace. I can only imagine dealing with this in a non-queer work environment.

I’m usually read as a woman. Sometimes a teenage boy. I’m 25. I’m dyspeptic about my large chest that even a binder doesn’t flatten super well and have contemplated starting low dose T. 

Living in a binary world is hard. But also I feel lucky to exist in a time that gender is starting to be looked at beyond the binary. I mean, how does gender get critiques unless we openly and outwardly and loudly exist outside of said binary? I spent an hour tonight describing NB identities to a 75 year old gay man and he listened. It’s frustrating, but I hope to see our understanding of gender as a culture shift towards a more fluid perspective soon.

That being said, I had to provide two forms of photo ID other than my passport issued 9 years ago at age 17. I also had to show a credit card to make sure my legal name lined up. Then went through the body scanner three times and we “patted down” by a male TSA employee before he goes “got another one wrong” and ushered over the female employee.

Was also asked tonight by a middle aged woman that “if I had to pick which gender would I be more comfortable with?” She didn’t understand my answer of “non binary” and asked six times. I finally said “neither. I’m in the middle and don’t prefer either” just to end it and eat my pasta in peace.
i totally understand!! i wish i was amab and im currently on t and getting top surgery soon. I wish i wasnt always seen as a man but i realize that society sees things as strictly masculine and feminine
Yeah, sometimes I feel like I ""overshot"" in deciding to go on testosterone. There have been some positive changes that I'm really happy with, like my voice getting deeper. But after a while, I've sort of realized that I'm more agender than anything and being perceived as (binary-speak blehh) a man is just preferable to being perceived as a woman. If we didn't live in a society that so forciby genders everyone into one of two groups, I don't honestly know if I would have decided to take T. Right now, I feel a little less dysphoric but not totally at peace. Even when I share that I use they/he pronouns with other queer/trans people, they all just use ""he,"" and I don't have anywhere near the bandwidth to start using they/them when I know the vast majority of people are just going to ignore it and reach for binary language. Idk it sometimes feels like there's no escaping the binary unless you're with other nonbinary people."	87orc1	NonBinary	25	0.96	2018-03-28 03:25:09

I want one of these for my bathroom at home.
idk I kinda like the idea of being a mythical creature, it means I’m not necessarily bound to the laws of physics

I feel like I clash with a lot of common nonbinary opinions, considering I really like the word “enby” too
I fully support you getting one of those signs for your own home! It's totally valid to identify that way, the issue I have is putting these in public spaces to stand for all Non-binary folks.

What would you like to see from a workplace that supports nonbinary identities?	"Hello friends! I’m in the scary but exciting position of creating a queer group at my workplace, and starting a dialogue about what queer folks need to feel welcomed. However, I’m just One Small Enby, and would love diverse perspectives on what we should implement in a workplace setting! So the question is ... let’s say you worked somewhere where you felt comfortable being out, you felt supported, and free to present/act/exist as you wish. What would that look like? What actions would be taken? What resources would you have access to? etc. 



Here’s some of my current brainstorming:

- single stall, gender neutral bathrooms
- asking for pronouns as everyday thing, pronouns included on name tag/business cards
- medical insurance that covers transitioning/gender therapy/mental health in general
- non gendered dress code"	"If you work somewhere with official HR I think ensuring HR receives proper reading material and/or training in regards to queer identities would be pretty paramount to guaranteeing everyone feels like their problems can be decently represented.
* Required anti-oppression training for all 
* Policy of using they pronouns for any person who has not stated their pronouns otherwise
* Policy of avoiding phrases such as ""ladies and gentleman"" or ""guys and gals""

I wouldn't require people to share their pronouns, because it would force some people to either lie about their preference, or out themselves when they weren't ready yet.  Instead people could optionally share if they have a preference other than ""they"" or the use of their name in place of a pronoun.
A pamphlet with answers to all the common questions about NB genders.  I made an amateur version of it for my workspace.

Specifically, the issues of grammar, how we're not making this up, and why some if us don't ""look"" nonbinary.

A specific question I would warn against is ""when did you *choose* to be non-binary?""

HR policies that include non-discrimination. My workplace just added protection this year, and I honestly feel much better about expressing myself.
I would like to see a very clear statement of support for LGBTQIA+ people and people of color made at time of hiring, not just a toothless policy hidden in an employee handbook. 

At my current job I interacted with a few openly religious folks in my first few days on the job. No one said anything particularly bad, but it made me feel pretty unsafe to be open about my life at work. Over time it became clear that HR world side with me over any religious person who had a problem with me, and that there were other queer people at work but that wasn't made clear when I was hired.
For sure - our HR has been pretty decent so far, but I think providing more detailed training could really help them see why the current state is An Issue.
Yeah, the pronouns thing is sticky and ultimately isn’t going to be comfortable until there’s a strong culture of respecting non-cis identities. I like the suggestion of “they” as default, but I hesitate because in practice it may only be implemented for visibly GNC folks. I love the idea of alternatives to “ladies and gentlemen”, and I think that’s something that can be an immediate change :)

Feeling Gender Euphoria in a Target Bathroom			mhl6dl	NonBinary	22	0.94	2021-04-01 02:02:00
My first weekend out as non-binary (long post warning)	"# Intro

A few months ago, I had an epiphany that I'm non-binary.  

What led me to that decision was how I always felt that I never truly fit in as a guy (I'm AMAB) and couldn't relate to the typical guy experience.  And when I did try my best to fit in, like play sports with other guys, dress like regular guys, speak a certain way, act manly etc.....not only did it feel unnatural and forced to me, but guys would laugh at me for even trying.

But the thing is, the possibility of me being a girl on the inside also didn't feel right to me.  Yes...I do relate to girls better than guys.  Yes....I do get envious that girls get to wear certain things that guys can't.  There's other small things like that too, but I don't actually feel the desire to be a girl.

I like myself as I am just fine, but it feels like I'm caught in the middle of 2 genders.  Not quite fitting in as a guy and having no desire to fully embrace fitting in as a girl either.

But still....I wanted to test the ""limits"" of my girly side, to see how I would feel.  I've always been scared to, because I didn't want to add more fuel to the ""he's not manly"" criticism I get sometimes.  But over the past few years, I've grown a lot...I've gained more courage and confidence.  I felt the time was right to finally take the plunge and embrace my inner girl.

# Preparation

I did a lot of research over the past few weeks on transforming myself into a girl.  There's a lot of info I had to catch up on.....girl's clothing, girl's clothing sizes, wigs, using makeup to hide my masculine features...each one of those topics has a TON of info I had to sift through.  Doing all the shopping was it's own experience...going into typically girly places as a guy.

I researched safe towns where I could venture out as a girl.  Luckily, I live relatively close to quite a bit of LBGT friendly places.  I ultimately decided on NYC.  It's CROWDED as fuck right now because of the Christmas season.  People are too busy shopping and being tourists to pay any attention to me....I could blend right in and just experience what it's like as the girl version of myself.  I'll also be by myself during this trip and there's a lot of nice solo activities to do here.

# Initial Impressions of girl me

So the day finally came that I would be a girl.  It took me something like 3 hours to transform myself into a girl, mainly because I was learning how to do makeup for the first time ever.

I present to you all, the girl version of myself: [https://imgur.com/a/RoatAiu](https://imgur.com/a/RoatAiu)

When I looked at those pics for the first time, I was VERY surprised.  First of all....I didn't look half bad.  I still looked like a guy posing as a girl, but I looked good doing it.  But more importantly, I felt like I was seeing a part of myself for the very first time ever.  Like I was exposing my inner girl after locking her away in the dungeon all this time.  The euphoria I experienced...I can't describe.  I haven't felt happy like that in a VERY long time.  All the hours and money I poured into doing this experiment....it was worth it for that moment.

# The Positive

Walking around in NYC as a girl was quite the experience.  With fresh makeup on, I could mostly pass enough as a girl that people mostly treated me as normal and invisible.  Just walking around, I felt like a badass and like I had a ton of confidence.  I walked around heavily trafficked areas...places that could easily trigger me to be hyper-vigilant of people judging me....and it was very little problem for me.  I visited Bryant Park, American Dream mall (2nd largest mall in America and PACKED for Christmas), Central Park and other places.  I went into women bathrooms and with no incidents or looks.  

""Regular"" people wouldn't dream of going out as their opposite gender in public...A few years ago, I myself would've been scared to death to do something like this.  But here I am....as a girl in pubic and I'm unphased and proud of that fact.  I felt a lot of my own personal growth in those moments.

# The Negative

As the hours wore on, my makeup began to fade and it became more obvious that I'm a guy as a girl. (Pic of how I looked:  [https://imgur.com/4GsNmBq](https://imgur.com/4GsNmBq)  )  At this point, I was outside around Times Square, which is a heavily touristy spot.  It says something that as I'm walking through literal mobs of people, I'm starting to get stares, double takes and weirded out reactions now....some people grimacing and smirking.  It also didn't help that by that time, I was tired and overstimulated from being out around a ton of people and it's clearly showing on my face.

Those looks from people triggered flashbacks for me.  I used to get those same looks as a guy, when I didn't display typical guy behavior and traits.  My confidence started to regress until I had another epiphany....that inside, I now felt like a COMPLETE person.  I was no longer worrying about trying to fit in or how I'm perceived by others.  Being a girl was something I was doing for MYSELF....by my own action and choice.  If I looked weird or out of place in that crowd, it was on purpose and not as a failed attempt at fitting in.  In simple terms.....I didn't give a fuck anymore, I was being myself.

# Non-binary?

Another revelation was that throughout the weekend, I felt surprisingly.....normal?  Going into the weekend, I was expecting to feel a lot of intense and weird emotions.  I've read lot of posts of people experiencing intense euphoria, confusion or other extreme emotions when exploring other genders.  Besides the initial euphoria....I mostly felt like my regular old self, but dressed as a girl.  This is actually the biggest evidence I have that I'm non-binary.....""no matter what I looked like, there I was"".  

At the end of the weekend, being a girl simply felt like another tool of self expression for me.  I didn't feel like I was abandoning my male side at all, but expanding the range of gender expression.  I gained the courage and ability to now present myself as a girl.  Now when I have the urge to feel pretty....I CAN feel pretty, with no self hating judgement.  As a person that has dealt with self hating judgement his entire life.....that's worth its weight in gold!

# Conclusion

My experiment has been a WILD success.  I have increased confidence in myself now.  And the confidence wasn't only contained to the girl version of myself either.....I have confidence as my old GUY self too.  I know I keep saying this, but I just feel like such a complete person now....my inner boy has been supported and my inner girl has been freed....2 parts of a non-binary inner child that has now been validated!

I created this post mostly to put my experiences out into the world and hopefully it'll resonate with some people.  This weekend has been the best decision I've made in a long time.  I've already came out as non-binary to my girlfriend, another friend and my therapist....I'm still on the fence about coming out fully as non-binary.  I know my family is generally unsupportive of LGBT issues and my workplace is a hive of stereotypical guys....if I'm to come out as non-binary, I would definitely need to change my environment first, but that's a story for another day.

I plan to mostly stay as a guy, because that's what I'm used to and I'm just lazy like that.  When you're not raised as a girl, transforming as a girl is hard fucking work lol.  But I absolutely will embrace my inner girl more often and venture out as a lady when I feel the urge.  No more holding back!  I also plan to integrate some girly things into my guy ""persona"" too.  The 2 parts of my gender will reach a nice compromise and not neglect each other :)"	"I’m so happy for you you see it as a success. And allow me to say you are beautiful even on the faded make up picture. Your eyes are amazing in their own!
I really enjoyed reading about your experience, and the part where you talk about feeling like a complete person, and that ""no matter what I looked like, there I was"" really resonated with me and made me feel something deep inside me.
Thank you, that means a lot!"	zp4xh9	NonBinary	22	0.97	2022-12-18 18:32:50

Trans Day Of Remembrance and feeling pretty terrible	"So as most of you probably know, today is the International Transgender Day of Remembrance, where we remember the trans people of all identities who have died at the hands of others or themselves over the past year.

A couple of the murders this year were near me, as were some of the suicides. 

I feel so sad and genuinely grieve for the people we've lost. It feels like my heart's been ripped out, every year. Every time I hear of another death. And it terrifies me. Any day, I could become one of next year's statistics. I've gone through a lot of harassment and rejection already as a result of being trans/nonbinary, including incidents where my physical safety was threatened or compromised. All it takes is for one person to get a little angrier than usual by my existence, and that's it. I'm scared to wear my binder, I NEVER use public bathrooms (did it before, *miSTAKE*), I sure asf don't talk to people or tell anyone.

This is just kind of a rant I guess, idk really. But yeah, TDoR today and it hits me hard. "	"I feel that. I’m sorry. Lots of love today. Here’s a great screamo song. [GLOSS- Trans Day of Revenge](https://open.spotify.com/user/kapplerm/playlist/73gKxHOBoIyGMUXGzSwHpf?si=oRfikHsMSdSI8QxEQegwIQ)

I recently came out as non-binary to my whole fam and best friends, my new name is Jae and my pronouns are they/them, I’m thinking getting gender neutral bathrooms to be a thing in my district. I’m also going to my first pride this summer! Here’s my gender-neutral oc, Moona!		Congratulations, Jae!

Awesome experience at Sh!t-Faced Shakespeare tonight!	"Three fantastic happenings at the theater tonight:

A sign between the (legally required) gendered bathrooms reading ""Bathrooms for Humans: left - general seating, right - standing room only"".

The show runner greeted the audience with ""Guys, gals, and nonbinary pals!""

In a completely impromptu conclusion (because Drunk Macbeth killed Malcolm), Banquo crowned herself the ""King...or Queen...or some non-gendered royal title - whatever, all that matters is I'm in charge now, I guess."" (Not verbatim, but pretty close)

They are playing for two more weekends. I'm going again next week! It was so amazing and welcoming to be explicitly included! Even in my crazily liberal, progressive city, (a)gender inclusiveness in language is still working to gain traction/visibility."		dke4qx	NonBinary	21	0.94	2019-10-20 03:11:54
passing as a black man/masculine person, what should i consider?	"im getting top surgery in a couple of months and my mom keeps pointing out that ill have different experiences once im able to pass more easily as a black man.. i understand that this is something i have to consider, but i dont like the way she says it .. she says it almost as though i havent considered that angle for myself while preparing for top surgery, like im rushing into this without thinking of all possibilities.

i thought it would be worthwhile to ask other trans people how it feels to pass as a man, specifically a black man.. is there any specific things i should consider? i know that there will be little things like figuring out which bathroom to use, but what sorts of things should i prepare myself for? if it counts, i am not on T and have no real desire for hrt as i am nonbinary, but i have relatively androgynous features naturally"	"hi! are you already passing? i’m white so this could most definitely be diffferent, but top surgery didn’t affect my passing or how people see me. only once i went on T did people see my as male. i would guess, and could be wrong, that how you’re navigating the world now will largely stay the same (except maybe in shirtless spaces like a womens locker room). my friend who’s black and non-binary and not on T already passes pretty well so they completely avoid the womens restroom due to racism and transphobia.
The only thing I’d say would be keep an eye on how you are perceived. If you are already seen as friendly and warm you should have less issues then if you are seen as intimidating and dominating.

Check your local community and recent crimes n such, do the cops treat everyone equal or do they have a bias? If you find people acting more distant towards you for seeming no reason it may be wise to ensure that you do not have to actively protect yourself if cops end up getting in the mix.
I'm mixed but ppl racialize me as black and I've been wondering this as well as I prepare for top surgery.
I know there's a subreddit r/blacktransmen I'm pretty sure. I haven't checked yet but the guys over there probably have more insight into the possible social shift.
I’m white but I had week after a hair cut and with masks and stuff I was assumed a man a lot and women were sometimes less nice around me and it gave me anxiety about using public restrooms (niceness could be due to other reasons too but 🤷). It’s kind of sad to be seen as someone like less safe. It really hurt my heart. I bind full time tho and I don’t think other people will notice me being flatter after surgery so I don’t think top surgery will change this for me.

Edit: Also I would ask people in your area, as geography can have an impact on the intersection of race and safety and race and gender
i think i pass probably.. 10-20% of the time.. i generally believe that what gives people pause from calling me ""sir"" and stiff *is* my chest or the shape of my body, but its difficult for me to tell.. i notice that i pass slightly better when i bind but not very much better..
word. i’d guess it’ll be similar to when you’re binding, in which case sounds like you have a handle on how you navigate spaces already. i can’t assume, but i would think your mom is just worried about your safety out of care and not trying to pass judgement on your surgery choice. so stoked for you to get surgery! it’s such a game changer."	sl9bzh	NonBinary	21	1.0	2022-02-05 15:20:24
How can I tell if I'm nonbinary, and how did you realize that you were?	"My name is Giulia, and I'm 18.

As a small child, I really liked ""girly"" stuff (pink, makeup, etc.).

At about 7 I started to become more of a ""tomboy"", I preferred shopping in the boys' section of clothing stores and preferred ""boyish"" activities.

At 10 I cut off all of my hair, I was so happy. I loved it when people mistook me for a boy and called me ""Julian"". I hated going into public bathrooms. I always felt ashamed and embarrassed. I would try to always go with a female relative, to use them as a sort of shield, like; ""look, she's clearly a girl, and I'm with her, so it's okay for me to be here, so please don't stare at me."" I felt uncomfortable with my body as I entered puberty.

I felt extremely embarrassed and ashamed to do anything I deemed ""girly"", such as makeup or the Sims (yeah, that last one didn't make much sense to me at the time either), even if no one else had a problem with it. Eventually, these activities' place in my mind as ""taboo"" would make me want to do them. So, I would try them out in secret, quickly get bored, and forget about them.

At 15, despite my deep embarrassment, I decided to grow my hair out, and slowly, over the course of the last few years, wear ""girlier"" stuff (still no dresses or skirts though).

I had mostly forgotten the dysphoria of my past, until, a few months ago, I saw Ted Talk by a young non-binary person. So many of their experiences were similar to mine, I really resonated wit what they said, and it brought back all of those feelings. I suddenly became very aware of my outfit, long hair, and breasts, and became very uncomfortable.

I have been telling myself that ""gender isn't that important to me, I don't really care how people perceive or refer to me"", and ""it's too much trouble anyway to have everyone refer to me differently."" But, I'm not so sure that that's true. I feel uncomfortable and stressed about my uncertain gender identity, and dealing with my parents should I identify as non-binary and choose to use they/them pronouns (I have gotten into heated discussions with my parents about the misgendering of non-binary people, and why it's important to respect everyone's pronouns).

So, I wanted to ask, what are some good ways to tell if you're non-binary, and what is your experience with discovering your gender identity.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Thank you all for your advice! I'm going to continue research and exploring being NB to see if it fits for me! You all seemed so relaxed about the whole thing, which made me feel a lot better. I was feeling very stressed. Sending love <3"	"i don’t think there’s one way to tell if you’re non-binary. it’s more about adding things to your life that feel right. like asking friends to use different pronouns and seeing how it feels. maybe write a paragraph about yourself in 3rd person with different pronouns and see how it feels. it’s more about trying out things you want and finding what makes you comfortable, than having to “arrive at a conclusion” that you’re “officially non-binary”. in college i cut my hair, started buying different clothes, bought boxer briefs. at age 26 i started using they and he pronouns and binding my chest. then i decided to take testosterone and get top surgery. the steps are different for everyone. i would focus more on taking little steps to make yourself feel happier, and not worry too much about solidifying the identity part. 💖
lol sul serio ti chiami UovoAnsioso? rido
Idk this sounds a lot like me.. I realized because like you, I kinda had euphoria when people would be like ""Sir uhhh miss? Uh...."" and like genuinely couldnt tell my gender. I also dont mind being taken for def a boy or def a girl. Its like...  what do YOU think my gender is :P bc I dont care one way or another. I identify as butch, GNC, nonbinary, genderfluid but I feel like those all fall under the NB umbrella so I use NB. 

Also feel free to try out identifying as nonbinary in private, in your head, online private spaces and see if it feels good
The way I could tell I was non-binary was honestly just me thinking; “I don’t think I want to be a girl anymore. Im gonna be non-binary! ÙwÚ”(I probably actually made that face lol)I’m still very confused about my gender identity, but the best advice I can tell you is; if you feel uncomfortable dressing like one gender or another, then you might be m-f/f-m. If you feel uncomfortable with gender specifics, then you might be non-binary. That’s like the only stone cold advice I can think of.
Just to throw a wrench in the works: I identify as agender (which as far as I understand is a subset of nb) partially because of that ""what do YOU think my gender is""

Because my experience of gender is highly situational and usually ""brought out"" by other ppl gendering me. Like, I'm not uncomfortable with others gendering me, but I'm extremely uncomfortable with gendering myself because it feels dishonest. 

But that heavy duty euphoria from ppl being confused about how to gender me... that's the good stuff. It's like ""you're soooooo close..."""	hqh0g3	NonBinary	21	1.0	2020-07-13 15:13:09
No one cares about bathrooms at my school and it's awesome	I just love how transphobes would hate my school. We don't live in a trans friendly country but our bathrooms are very far away from one another so a girls bathroom might be on a different floor than the boys and so on. No one wants to go to a different floor just to go to the bathroom (just stalls also) not even cis people. So we all go to the bathroom that's closest to our class. Which happens to be the boys. In a class of 31 girls, 2 boys and my nonbinary arse. And the teachers are so mad about it but can't do anything to stop us. But none of us care.	"Shoutout to my male philosophy teacher who went to the girls bathroom to get water when the boys bathroom just a few meters further across the hallway.
it was the same in my high school, because it used to be a boys' school before (blergh) so there was only one restroom per floor
Same case for my school. It was made in the 1800s. 

There's 2 restrooms on the ground floor but not on any other floor. And to acces the other one you have to go outside and then enter a different part of a building. Or go through the teacher's lounge which is a no-go.

My dad's old highschool was only for girls but that one is being renovated currently."	yy7ffn	NonBinary	21	1.0	2022-11-18 01:24:39
What is the your favorite non-binary bathroom sign?		"A toilet
The ones that are explicitly typed up to say ""people can use whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable with and please trust that people are in the correct bathroom"" etc etc
A local cafe converted both of their bathrooms to have both stalls and urinals in them and just removed the gendered signs. They replaced them with one big Restrooms sign that points to both. 

Signs on the inside of the bathroom say ""we're all just here to pee but please wash your damn hands""
I was at an airport this summer, and there was a family bathroom that also had ⚧️ on it. Made me very happy.
The ones that identify the equipment in the bathroom: as in stalls or stalls + urinals.
“Whatever, just wash your hands” is my personal favourite especially the one that features the alien on it lol
🚽🚾
id really just like a sign that says bathroom on it and doesn't make a big deal out of it, or perhaps one that specifies if there are urinals or sanitary bins in the bathroom
I like the toilet that says all gender restroom.
Just wash your hands with different icons along with the female and male icon 
There is also a Spartan warrior icon.
There's a sign in my therapists office thats of a toilet and ""(NON)GENDER NEUTRAL"" written beneath it, it makes me smile everytime i pass it.
""whatever, just wash your hands""
real
That’s great, though my own experience with a favorite restaurant that did the same leaves me wishing there were also a sign with a message to the effect of, “If you prefer to stand, please use the urinal.”"	1005tzz	NonBinary	21	0.93	2022-12-31 22:52:53
AFAB that pees standing up	"(They/them)

And every time I do it in public I get nasty looks upon exiting the bathroom stall. Usually older women trying to eyeball me and figure out if I'm secretly packing a penis. :/

I haven't started presenting andro, largely because I can't afford a haircut, let alone a whole new wardrobe. But honestly? It seems like being even mildly femme presenting is the only thing keeping from turning this into an altercation. (I wear tees and jeans, don't usually wear makeup, and have long hair)

I'm not gonna stop--aside from being gender affirming, it's easier due to my hip and knee issues, as well as being more sanitary. (Well....more sanitary now that I've practiced my aim. Lol.)

Hope y'all have a better holiday than I've been having."	"Who is checking to see what way your feet are facing in the stall?? Cis people are wild
Honestly, as an AFAB person, I need to learn how to do this because most toilets are too low for my friggen hips and knees anymore.
I pass as male but don’t identify as male and absolutely never want to be in a room full of men (even a restroom) so I still use the women's.  I definitely get looks but nothing has actually happened.
This really sucks for you and I'm sorry you have to go through this! But if I can be ignorant for a minute, how did you learn to pee standing up? Is it an anatomy thing or a technique? I would love to be able to do this.
[removed]
It's pretty rude they do that, but I'd ignore it. You have every right to be there and you're just doing your buisness. Plus maybe they are just crabby and have no idea what you're doing 😂 I was afab and always use the mens washroom. I look feminite, I guess. I'm there to relieve myself so I don't pay attention to anyone. I've been told like, once or twice in my life ""you're in the wrong washroom"" and I just laughed. Mostly cause I had no idea how else to respond well, build me a nonbinary bathroom if it's a problem ya narks.
I haven’t been brave enough to try it in a public rest room for this reason! I’m probably just paranoid, but I always feel like the noise it makes when the stream hits the water is absurdly loud and everyone will know. Im even kinda anxious doing it at home, even though I doubt any of my family will think I suddenly sprouted a dick or anything lmao. 

Sorry people are jerks. I second queermoth, I bet they’re jealous!
Have you used a urinal yet?  It's a whole other level of peeing, and and it's a great experience to degender the urinal.
That's always what I thought! I'm halfway terrified that someone is gonna stick their head under the door.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Oh, not a problem! A LOT of people have asked me this.
I'm assuming you have genitals that are either AFAB or close to it. That's the only practice I have, I'm afraid.
1. spread vulva out so that pee stream doesn't get interrupted. If you have full bush you gotta spread wider :(
2.  tip hips forward so that you're angling forward, rather than down. Practice in the shower and try to hit a specific hole in the drain to get your aim right.
3. The first few times you do it in public, wait until you have to pee REALLY bad. The strength of the stream makes it easier to actually make it to the bowl. If you only have to kinda go, forcing your pelvic muscles to push hard can feel weird (AHH I'M GONNA POOP) but you're fine. Wait until you're more versed to do that one too. 

And that's it. I learned to do it because I worked at the renaissance faire and wearing 6 skirts in a portapotty is already a fucking ordeal. This made it slightly less insane.
Peeing off a tall building is a goal of mine
Have you ever challenged them to a peeing contest knowing you would win anyways, just to flex?
Ahhh, no. Unfortunately, I'm still very female presenting, so I don't see that going well. 

Maybe I will soon though!
If they do just pee on em
Here's how: spread your labia so they don't block your stream, then pull up so that you pee forward.
https://www.wikihow.com/Urinate-Standing-Up-as-a-Female
I'm baffled and intrigued. Thank you!
I am in awe. I'm going to start practicing immediately
Me too!  I also dream of challenging a cisgender man to a peeing contest and winning, but I don't think that's happening anytime soon.
You don't have to be male presenting to use the urinal.  that's the point of being non-binary.  There are some single person bathrooms with urinals.
Me, turning to address the head under the door as my stream of urine goes uninterrupted: why yes may I help you
Any luck?  Curious as to how often effective this technique is.
I'll have to look for some in my area.
Fair warning, that may be what they are into.
You know, it's kind of a mixed bag. It took a little finagling, but eventually I got the technique down. However, there's always a risk of a little spray (but I reckon that people with penises have this problem too), and also if you don't have those labia pulled well apart and out of the way, pee is going to go anywhere it damn well pleases. Also gets trickier if you have any pre-existing moisture or stickiness down there. Still, once you can lift and separate everything the right way, it's a pretty good method! I say this, also, as someone who doesn't shave.

I think it's worth looking into! It's a pretty useful trick, and it saves on toilet paper, which may be useful in these strange quarantined times.
Have you had the chance to try a urinal?  It's peeing evolved - more convenient, both more public and more private, plus you get to aim.  It's a travesty that AFAB people are told for so long we can only pee sitting down.
in these strange quarantined times, it may also be the ripe time to find a deserted men's room and claim the urinal as non-binary.  
What would you say is your success ratio?
I'm no good at statistics, but taking into account the things I mentioned, 60%

The other thing is that it's very hard to entirely empty your bladder while standing up.
What about the other elements of peeing standing up?  Can you get it through the fly?  Have you experienced a urinal?  
I heard it helps to cut off the stream before you're totally done peeing.  I also heard it helps to shave.
Shaving probably helps a lot, but I couldn't speak from experience with shaving, or using a urinal. I don't dare try through the fly because my fly and urethra are so thoroughly out of alignment that I don't doubt that I would pee all over myself. Maybe different anatomy would make this easier, but since you've got to have your hands all over yourself, I have my doubts. Cutting off the stream before you're done is definitely neater than letting it peter out naturally, it just exacerbates the problem that you can't empty your bladder.
Have you tried men's pants?  And lowering them a little bit so your butt is still covered?  
Do you care much for peeing with your pants on like that, or peeing into a urinal?  For me, that forms a very big component of what it means to pee as a nonbinary (ftm) because I'm taking something that men do, peeing standing up into a urinal and through the fly, and turning it into something that someone of any gender can do.
It's not much of a concern to me at this point, so I haven't really explored these options. For me it's more of a skill I can utilize or use for convenience. I can see how you could get that feeling from it, and I do too, but it's not my primary goal for it. Up until the quarantine, I also didn't have the luxury of taking the risk of peeing all over myself. Maybe now that I've got the time, I'll experiment and get better at it so I CAN do it with my pants on though

I can’t change others, but I can change my perception of the situation.	"I’m mostly masculine presenting (it’s a WIP). And I’m lucky my job has 3 bathrooms and that one of them is a “family” room with space to twirl around and have a dance party with the door locked. Sometimes it’s occupado and I don’t want to wait (maybe someone else had the dance party idea). So, I go to the mens room and do the thing, but I don’t see myself as a man. I don’t want to give in to The Feelings when I can’t control how the binary is set up, or what goes on in other people’s heads. Instead, I see myself as a spy with a covert mission to enter the lion’s den undetected (that means no dance parties. 😞 always a dead giveaway) and they’re so clueless! It’s not a cure, but it’s better than getting angry, ya know? 🕺 

How do you all find little ways to deal with things you can’t control?"	"Where I used to work, customers would frequently call me ""sir"" (except not in English) and then doubt themselves and get all confused, so I decided to go by a (extreme) shortening of my name that sounds almost but not quite like Sir. Getting to say, ""No, no, it *is* Ser!"" and thus exponentially increase their confusion was delightful."	sohhof	NonBinary	20	1.0	2022-02-09 16:23:27
Just had a good cry in the bathroom at work	"A couple of my coworkers were discussing ""they"" being the word of the year and one said ""I will never call anyone they,"" and both proceeded to talk about how ridiculous it is, including the old bullshit about it being not grammatically correct. 

They've done this before and I usually just try to turn my music up and ignore it but this time it was just too much. I respected them before and its especially frustrating because my workplace is otherwise pretty open and accepting of things. But I'm not giving them the time of day anymore.

I'm considering going to HR, just so they are aware of this. I work with the head HR on a committee and she's pretty nice so I think I'd feel comfortable letting her know what's going on. I may also see if I can move desks but there's not really a good place that's close to my team and farther from these people. 

Ugh I just feel so flustered and shaken up and I have to go sit in a big long company-wide presentation and I'm afraid my eyes are still red."	"Firstly, refusing to call someone by their preferred pronouns is rude. End of.

But if you want some facts to rebutt them with, let me drop some grammar on you.

Your idiot colleagues already use singular they, I guarantee it. I would bet next month's paycheque that none of those ding-dongs use ""he or she"" in day to day speech. ""Whoever left their bag on the table, could they please move it,"" as opposed to ""Whoever left his or her bag on the table, could he or she please move it.""

I had a grammar teacher, a lovely woman, accept all personal pronouns in theory but said she wouldn't accept it as grammatically correct until the Chicago Manual of Style okayed it and therefore wouldn't use it in speech except for students who said those were their pronouns. I then proceeded to raise my hand every time she used singular they in speech. Turns out we do it a lot. She conceeded my point.

Thirdly, for about 60 years the rule was to use ""he"" if the gender of the subject was unknown, so rules change.

Why only 60 years? Because, using ""he"" for everyone, only dates to about the Victorian era, when two particular people decided they didn't like singular they and ruined it for everyone. Prior to that, it was used by just about every famous English writer you can think of. And if singular they was good enough for Shakespeare,it's good enough for me.

Additionally, ""you"" used to be the formal plural which is why it's conjugated the way it is. So let's not pretend English isn't a language that evolves and changes.

And, finally, singular they is now in the Chicago Manual of Style, the Bible for editors. So it's officially, grammatically, proper.

Your rude and wrong colleagues can kiss my big white non-binary ass. I'm so sorry they made you feel unhappy.
So sorry this happened to you. It definitely won't hurt to tell HR. A reminder may need to be made part of future training.
Oh darling I feel ur pain
A couple of things to consider.  Is there any anti-discrimination specificaclly protecting gender/presentation in your state or company?  I only ask since this is still an issue in the supreme court if we are protected or not.  Especially if you are in an ""at will"" state. Cover your butt before you go to HR and out yourself.

If you still want to go to HR and you are NOT protected, dont out yourself.  Make your views known, and state that you found it inappropriate, though dont mention you are NB.  

Obv if you are out to HR about this, it becomes a lessor, or even possibly non-issue for you since you already have a history.

Its sad we need to think this way, but also necessary, no matter how shitty/bigoted/uneducated your coworkers are. Hope things get better friend.
Thanks for the concern and pointing that out. An especially frustrating aspect of all this is that we had mandatory anti-harassment training here not even 2 months ago. I know from the training that gender is a protected status at both company and city level, so it should be ok. But it seems not everyone took the training as seriously. These same coworkers are also constantly patting themselves on the back for being so liberal and open-minded.... :/
as long as you are protected, I would definitely go to HR. Obviously from what you say its an ongoing thing, and probably wont stop.  So if it were me, and I was upset as you, then Id definitely be doing everything I could to try and stop that nonsense."	e98w3r	NonBinary	19	0.95	2019-12-11 15:59:34
Public Bathrooms	im amab, but when i use a mens room, i usually get gawked at or directly told that people think im a girl. im too afraid to use the womens room because im pretty andro and im sure some women in there would think im a man, and im afraid women are more afraid of a man in their bathroom than men are of a woman in theirs...one man at a gas station waited outside the bathroom for me to finish washing my hands before he went in, and like he seemed well intentioned but its just,,,im not a girl dude. places that have gender those single-agender bathrooms are godsends 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼	"I look for those, but then there is usually a parent and 5 kids waiting in line for it because that is where the baby changing station is.  But single occupancy unisex bathrooms are the best.
I'm afab and perceived more frequently as a woman than not but I have the same thought process when it comes to gendered bathrooms - I'm more likely to use the men's because I think it will cause less panic even though if I were physically confronted I have 0 muscle to defend myself. I avoid them at all costs but in the event I have to choose a gendered facility I choose one which is in a less visible place then just cross my fingers and hope for the best."	bxu6ey	NonBinary	20	0.96	2019-06-07 12:44:47
Ranting from a NB teen.	"I’m super glad I found this community! Sorry for the wall text. Anybody who reads the whole thing or the majority of it is amazing and I really appreciate it.

I was filling out a form for college credit and it asked for gender. Guess who wasn’t there? Me. It was M or F. I kinda sat there and contemplated for a while before giving up and circling F (that’s what it says on everything else)

The other day I was talking to a friend and he said he couldn’t fight me because he wouldn’t hit a girl. And in my head I was saying “well then you should have no qualms with hitting me”

Told my parents I wanted to use they/them pronouns. After a week or so, they went back to she. Ugh.

Why is everything gendered?It’s always “niece” and “daughter” and I always refer to myself as their child, a neutral title for a younger person.

A kid came out as trans and like everyone immediately switched to the right pronouns for him and everyone was super accepting. He emailed all his teachers and was like “hey that’s not my name or pronoun”. I wish I could do that. At least he has a bathroom to go to.

I’m passing, I know. I appear super feminine. Even if I wore a binder, people would just think I’m small. I have long hair, I love skirts and dresses and fishnet tights and makeup. I don’t blame people who don’t know for using the wrong pronouns. I would too.

Has anyone else immediately caught feelings for anyone who uses the right pronouns? If the person uses the right pronouns, they could kill someone and still be ok in my book. (That’s a hyperbole)

I’ve always been paranoid about going into the wrong bathrooms. I stare at the little wall sign to make sure I go into the “right” one. The women’s bathroom is more comfortable for me because that’s the one I’ve gone to for my whole life.

At this age, everyone’s exploring their sexuality and doing all sorts of stuff like masturbating, sex, etc. and I’m just in the corner kinda disconnected to everything in my body. I understand it’s purpose and function. But it doesn’t really seem to be a part of me.

I’ve dealt with so much crap from people who say that my identity isn’t valid. And then other people agreeing with them. It’s so frustrating.

Periods aren’t a big deal for me, they’re more of an inconvenience than anything.

And I’m tired. I’m just super tired of the crap I had to go through to figure out who I am and then having my identity shit on by idiots who think that trans folks are perverts or that they can equate our community to pedophiles. It’s frustrating.

I know for most of my life people are going to use feminine pronouns. I understand that. But I hate it with every fiber of my being.

Thank you for reading. I appreciate it."	"You sound like you are close to enlightenment, hope you keep finding supportive and understanding people.
I'm 25 and still get mis-gendered all the time, even in queer-focused spaces. It's unfortunate and really hurtful. I get why people have a hard time with it, but it doesn't make it any better. I take a lot of solace in the fact that since I came out to my partner, they haven't messed up even once. It gets me by a lot of the time. So nothing but support and solidarity from me, and a reminder that you're not alone.
Yo, I'm 26, I feel exactly the same way that you do. I gotta say, I wasn't even aware of what it meant to be non binary until I was around 23. I've just gotten very used to and ""okay"" with the idea that 99% of the world will refer to me as she. I have found peace in my personal acceptance of who I am and my friends who make the effort to use the right pronouns and what not. I'm also super lucky that I work at a youth LGBTQIA+ center, so I have a world that knows who I am. I suggest you try to find a meet up or some organization that respects pronouns and hang tight to them. You can make your own world of acceptance and find others who make the effort to use correct pronouns, etc. 
It’s sad that I immediately think “oh that’s so sweet of your partner” and then it’s kinda like wow literally just using the right pronouns is considered sweet and kind. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they do and I would love to have someone who does, but also using the right pronouns shouldn’t be considered sweet. It should be the norm. I’m happy to see that I’m not alone in this. I’m glad you have someone who used the right pronouns in your life.
I’ll try that. A lot of my friends are also members of the community so it shouldn’t be too hard.
Exactly! This should definitely be the norm. Regardless of being a respectful person, they are incredibly sweet but correct pronoun usage is just basic respect. I truly hope you end up surrounded by people that use your correct pronouns, you absolutely deserve that in your life.
Thank you. You deserve it too."	99k645	NonBinary	20	0.96	2018-08-23 04:03:01
