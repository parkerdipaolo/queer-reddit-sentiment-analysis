shaved my head again and realized i look like bill watterson (author of calvin & hobbes) and honestly i vibe with it		"Oh my god I've never seen a picture of him. I'm proud of you both.
At first I thought this was a before and after of you shaving your mustache.
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me.
Don't be shy, add a 'stash :)
I was scrolling and after a few photos of ppl transitioning I saw this and thought ""wow what a transition looks 20 years younger this is awesome!""

Then read the title and felt like a f* idiot. It has been a long day...😔
*That's* what the creator of Calvin and Hobbes looks like? Not at all what I expected lol. Also, you rock the look better than him, ngl.
My immediate response to this in my head was: ""nah Bill Watterson ain't got nothin on you!""

And while that remains true, the longer I look, the cuter he gets...
*bill watterson by lemon demon starts playing in the background*
I support this. Total look goals.
such a vibe. u look rly cool !! couldn't help but think of lemon demon tho lol
I was scrolling thru and scrolled too fast and thought this is a ""before and after shaving moustache"" (no offence, I thought it was nice!) but then I backed back isjxiaka
You look great btw!! 🥺
Obsessed with your glasses! You look 👌🏻
Thought this was somehow a before and after and I was like?? What the FUCK lol but you look great! Love your style
Pulling. It. Off.
Amazing :D
Nice look. My favorite is the one without the stash.
you are so cute! Also I love the aesthetic lol
I love Calvin and Hobbes and I love the look!
Such a good vibe!! I wish I looked like Bill Watterson 😓
lmaoo nice
You look gorgeous, it really suits you ☺️
I’ve always loved Calvin and Hobbes, but it’s kind of funny, both Bill Watterson and Charles Shultz were known to be reclusive assholes in real life.
As a huuuge Calvin and Hobbes fan, I fully support this
such a good look!! also wth i didnt know bill watterson was hot ?! new goals
I dig the vibe! That’s dope
Slap on a stache and you're ready to go homie
whoaaaa

I literally wish I had his energy
Well now I love you both ❤
I am confused
Help
You look cute in both picture
Who are you?
How is your mustaches so bushy on one side and not the other
Edit: just read the caption 
Still don t know wich side you are
Still looking really good love your outfit/sweater
valid
Ughh I’ve been wanting to shave my head for so long this is making me want to do it more
Oh wow, I'd never seen what Bill Watterson looks like. Not at all what I expected, but very handsome, nonetheless, and that goes for you, too. ❤️
[deleted]
i guess i’ve been subconsciously digging his aesthetic the whole time, thank u
glad i'm not the only one
Don’t treat me like I have rabies.
I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO MENTION THAT
YES.

lmao thanks!
Yeah I noticed that. He also has Calvin's mischievous grin.
Wayyyy cuter tho

Indeed so Bill Wurtz		"yeah! i always address people 'per person', like you can be 100% sure that the person you speak to/of is in fact a person (shocker ik)

funny thing is how terfs cry when u call them 'a person' like wdym, you're not a person? lol and they sometimes go with this dehumanizing phrase ""I'm not a person I'm a woman"" (???????) or ""you're erasing women!"", and I'm always like, ""no, it's okay i have no problem calling you a woman, just the first guess is to call u a person in case u happen to be enby""
""I'm a princess!""

*puberty later*

""Wait sorry, I read that wrong, I'm a **dunce**""
What about cat people, are they cool too?
Gneurshk
I'm just here to say that, today, a woman came into the female washroom (I'm afab so gotta use those) and, upon seeing me, she had to do a double-take on the door to make sure it was the right one. Gender euphoria!!!
Tell me why I read the last pic in Laszlo’s voice
I love this!
They r bein too goofy fr I think they need other things in their life to overthink instead

teachers in florida fighting against the “don’t say gay” bill with malicious compliance ❤️		"What's the term? Malicious Compliance? Use their words against them. They were the ones who wanted to erase gender and sexuality : )
YES!!!!!!! THANK YOU 💜💜💜💜
I was just joking with a friend that they might do this, I didn't think it would happen, yes!
These kind of people who created this bill obviously forget being a cis boy or girl is still a gender identity, and being heterosexual is still a sexuality.
Ayyyyyyyyy👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Yessss
Or what I call the only kind of compliance.
Do they just not notice that they will probably not have any books left in the classrooms?
Hell yeah
Everyone gets to be like an Enby now! Yay! Definitely complies with their rules right? Haha.
Smells like false flag, what teacher would be dumb enough to direct concerns to ""your local congressperson"" (federal, who weren't involved & are power-separated) instead of legislators/senators/representatives (state, who were involved)?

Saying ""your student"" is false-flaggy too, as politically-active teachers tend to regard students as theirs, not yours.

*Only please, Brer Teacher, please don't throw me into the briar patch.*
Seriously teach about bugs ! And flowers! They are all over the place and it’s not about humans. Haha :P sneaks
These parents just pulled one of the best uno reverse cards on Florida! GG
I work with a Ftard that thinks teachers are grooming kids in Florida.......he's gonna take his AR and fix this......

The most dangerous people are conservative middle aged white single men with low incomes.......beware.
[removed]
Right! Because it’s easy to forget that fact when it’s forced on everyone all the time and becomes second nature for most to not question anything about it.
Moms4Liberty repost transmisic and bigoted tweets, such as Rowling.  
Their description is crypto-fascist.  
Sharing the letter seems like trying to fearmonger the conservatives/GQP/alt-right, but the letter content seems like good intentions and showing the ridiculousness of the bill.  
Even a sarcastic “gender neutral pronouns and honourifics” would be r/AccidentalAlly material.
Hey person we never said anything about fucking kids
Do you have any brain function left
LOL Forced......
Yeah its like. On one hand I could see them trying to fear monger reactions to the bill.

On the other hand, _could they even come up with this?_ And if so, why share it?

My personal theory is that the ""teacher in palm beach"" a) may or may not have been a teacher and b) is using the group to advertise the letter to try and get people to use it.

Hard for a random to share widely, but easy if it goes viral...
It absolutely is.
Conservative Equal rights: live & Let live. Unless you're gay.....or different.....

This effectively gives a gay parent the right to complain in Florida If a female teacher mentions her husband. I hope they get the shit sued out of them and your idiotic stance reveals to you How short-sighted your idealism is. I feel that you're playing tic-tac-toe not even checkers when you need to be playing chess sir. 

Did all this start when you accidentally watched RuPaul's drag race and you felt something move in your organs? Now you're trying to protect others from that funny feeling?"	tuxt0v	NonBinary	773	0.99	2022-04-03 01:40:49
Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/
If you are in the US you can report her to the state board, and if you utilize insurance you can also report her to your insurance."	11196wq	NonBinary	702	0.99	2023-02-13 14:13:29

Big Yay!
I love this for you. I just had my first day wearing a binder. My nips are a little sore, and I think I kept rubbing my chest cause I’m getting used to being flatter, but all and all it was a great day. My breasts were pretty sweaty by the end of the day. Anyways. Good luck. I hope you enjoy seeing your new body shape in it. For me it was euphoria.
Congrats! When I can, I'm going to order one from there too.
Congratulations 🎉
*high five* I ordered my first one this morning too, super excited and nervous to try it 😁 I went with Spectrum Outfitters because they're based in the UK where I am
I also ordered my first binder today! Congrats!!
Congrats! I wish you so much euphoria from it :)

Recently came out as nonbinary, and I'm feeling rather happy with how accepting my family and friends were. Here's a picture my older sister took when I came out a few days ago on my birthday showing off a ripped $1 bill I found.		"You look so happy! Yay!! Congrats!
Thank you so much!"	hckuix	NonBinary	94	1.0	2020-06-20 11:37:44
Can I vent for a minute about my child's experience?	"My 6yo came out as non-binary. He uses what she calls ""mixed up"" pronouns. She's been saying he's not a boy or a girl for over a year, and put a lot of thought into it. 

Nearly everyone in my child's life has been warm and positive about their identity, so I feel like I can't complain when I know other people have it so much worse, but... I also really want to vent for a minute.

1. My kid went back to dressing like their AGAB for a while after other kids were rude and it breaks my heart, but I am really anxious about accidentally putting pressure on her to wear something so I'm trying to leave the ball in her court. She wore GNC clothing yesterday, though, and the other kids were cool, so fingers crossed that he gets back into it because she seemed so much happier in it.*

2. My FIL sent easter candy labeled ""HAPPY EASTER DEADNAME"" when he's never ever ever sent candy with a specific name on it before. He apologized, and maybe I should let it go, but I'm still mad.

3. I'm trying not to obsess over this aspect of my kid's life but with all the anti-trans bills it's hard not to focus on it.

4. My child said that they wanted to do something that physically their AGAB can't do (extremely specific narrow case) and I hated having to explain that the science isn't there yet to make that happen. Crushing a kid's dreams is never fun.

5. I am trying to give my kid space for this to be permanent and space for this to be a phase, if that makes sense. Just validating who she says he is and not trying to plan her future for him. I realized that I would be embarrassed if my kid announced that they weren't non-binary after all and I'm trying to let that go - so what if they change? We all change.




(* Yes I know, boys can wear skirts and girls can wear cargo pants, but realistically there are gendered associations with certain clothing.)"	"It always makes me happy to see such supportive parents. Sounds like you have your kids best interests in mind. We need more parents like you around.
I have a little non-binary kid too and I definitely hear you on all this. Mine goes very much for femme-styled clothing and it's difficult for people to disassociate that from using she/her. They're in a support group a social worker from the school district runs and even the binary trans kids in there do it regrettably often. Letting it both be permanent and potentially a phase is something I try to keep in mind too. I worry that the overwhelming number of people who use she/her for them even when they really really should know better will eventually make them think they should just use those pronouns and/or identify as a girl, and I'd struggle a lot if they did decide they were a girl because it'd be so hard to tell whether it was completely, idk, authentic or intended as self-protection.
I'm sorry that had to happen to the both of you! People can be asses. From my perspective, you're doing an amazing job for your child!
You're doing great!  I'm an adult but my mom thinks I'm being dramatic and attention seeking by identifying this way.  It's so nice to see you show so much empathy for your kid. <3
Thank you for posting this.  I'm a parent of a 13 yo NB kiddo and have just begun encountering the same frustrations and situations.  

 *Just validating who she says he is and not trying to plan her future for him.* 

Gonna use this as my mantra this week.
I really sucks to have your child treated unfairly, and you have every right to be annoyed, frustrated, or upset by it. Just keep being the awesome, supportive parent you are and keep advocating for your awesome kid!
I think you’re doing a great job he’s lucky to have you there’s an artist called DJ sprinkles who makes beautiful music and uses the same changing pronouns
I think you’re doing a great job as a parent! You’re being supportive and letting your kid explore without feeling like they have to stick to anything or worry about losing your acceptance. I’ve been out to my own parents for four years now and they still get mad at me for trying to correct them on my preferred pronouns. I honestly think that just knowing that you are there for him and accept her as he is going to mean more and more to them as she gets older. You’re forming a health perspective on gender and individuality early on and even if other people in his life try to force her to be something she isn’t, you’re what he’s going to remember most.
Have you heard of the One Bad Mother podcast? Biz has 2 non-binary kiddos, 6 and 11 I think. I'm NB myself and found those conversations wholesome and hopeful"	mutdsa	NonBinary	87	0.98	2021-04-20 15:50:37
California bill passed that allows non-binary marker on birth certificates and driver's licenses by self-identification	"California bill SB-179 passed!

No doctors certification or court hearing required for changing the gender on your California birth certificate or driver's license. Also a non-binary gender option will be available. 

Unfortunately the bill does not take effect for a year. 

But still awesome news. 


http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-will-allow-third-non-binary-1505415754-htmlstory.html

That's awesome! Now I just have to hope that Virginia will do the same (I don't see that happening anytime soon 😔)
Can't wait for the day where Michigan/ the nation entirely does the same 🙌🏻
and people still say we're invalid and don't have rights. oh well
Not surprised it won't take affect for a year. California needs to prepare for the flood of the ppl that will be coming to change their documents.
I still look more femme, so it's just easier to leave my sex marker F, rather than cause the confusion and headache of having explain a non-binary marker or M marker.. Perhaps if I ever look masculine or mid-range I'll change it. But I'm leaving my birth certificate alone, to not add confusion for future geneologists to track family lineage. *To me* DNA lineage is more important to people who will be around 100 years from now than what my gender identity was.
Now, seriously. How does your welfare system works? Does everyone have access to a state retirement? 

I ask this because in my country, every man can retire after 35 years of work, and every woman after 30 years of work (it gets more complicated than that, but hey...).

So, what would be the impact of the self appointed gender on Welfare and other systems? Couldn't this mean it would be _easy_ to basically fraud the state?
Holy Hooves I love your flair.
This is super exciting! I can't wait til Australia legalises SSM.... God I can't believe how behind the times Australia is.
Generally all new California laws take effect one year after being signed. It gives the courts time to process any objections to prevent having to rescind new laws that aren't constitutional, gives the public time to acknowledge the new law, and gives officials time to prepare, if necessary.
Yeah, they will need to update the dmv software etc. 
An X marker on birth certificates  may allow those born in CA but resident in other states to bring law suits to get X on their drivers licenses or passports. 

Personally I'm going for one ID with male (nyc ID), one with female (probably passport, though quite a number of counties have x as a passport marker now, so it would seem less unusual), and one with X (hoping for NY to pass the proposed bill on this but not holding my breath). Basically that would allow me to use X which I want, but be safe in other circumstances.
The US government retirement payments are not gendered. 

Also, the US government retirement system (“social security”) just provides subsistence amounts of money to keep the elderly from being without food and housing rather than providing a “living wage” in retirement (we are expected to save on our own for significant retirement funds). 
Thanks! Yeah, it jokes about the dreaded nullPointerException, as well as the attitude of lazy devs towards bug-fixing.
that's true. most ppl don't know that though and then ask why can't CA do it faster like OR when it comes to NB ID's. I usually answer with different state, different process. CA is also pretty big. 
Thanks for the info.

Over here our retirement system is not that good. You make at least the minimum monthly wage, and at most 5 times the minimum monthly wage, dependent on the average of 80% of your 30-35 year contribution to the system.

_Personally_, exactly because of the gender differences that do exist in my country, I don't really see ""non binary"" as an option. But of course that works in places where you don't have different rules based on genders.
Indeed, the (not a bug) is the icing on the cake. :D"	70a7aw	NonBinary	81	0.96	2017-09-15 14:32:41
NJ bill to allow changes to birth certificate gender marker, including nonbinary/undesignated, by self-affidavit	"The New Jersey state Senate passed a bill that would allow people to change the gender on their NJ birth certificate with a self-declaration of gender identity and provides a ""undesignated/nonbinary"" option. It is expected to easily pass the state House and the governor has expressed support for lgbtq rights in general. This bill has passed the NJ legislature in previous years but it was vetoed by the former governor.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there is a bill creating such a process for NJ drivers licenses. It will be interesting to see how NJ resolves the issue of gender on state DL applications when the state issues nonbinary BCs.

Details from https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/this-was-likely-the-best-week-for-gender-minorities-since-trump-took-office.html : ""[T]he state Senate passed a bill making it much easier for transgender people to change their birth certificates. Under current law, trans people born in the state could not alter the gender on their birth certificate without proof that they had undergone gender confirmation surgery. But not all trans people feel that surgery is a necessary component of medical transition. The new bill allows trans individuals to correct their birth certificate by simply declaring, under penalty of perjury, that they are switching the listed sex in order for it to conform 'with that person’s gender identity.' It also lets gender nonconforming people change their sex to 'undesignated/non-binary.' ""

I thought I was one of the lucky ones.	"I was wrong. [30ish, AMAB, NB, they/them, just dont call me sir.]

This is about to get very very very long, but i just need to write it out.


[BACKGROUND]


I grew up in a very small town. Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. 

I was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father's repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn't. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.

By high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don't think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.

When I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn't wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.

During the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don't ask don't tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. 

After around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I'm not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]

Thus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.


[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]


Which brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we'll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn't seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. 

It was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.

Sue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn't want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).

We were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren't awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. 


[SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT]


Three years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can't really describe the feeling, it wasn't that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.

A couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn't for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn't want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.

She freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I'm fairly certain she cried.

The next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn't something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn't home. I never said I wouldn't, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.

After a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn't make me gay, I'm not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I'm not trans, but I am queer. I just don't know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn't think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn't have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.

But I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.

I look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. 

And maybe we were?

One night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn't WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.

I wouldn't try to change my voice and I hadn't been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn't like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn't want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn't sure how to fully communicate that.


[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]


I feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.

Sue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.

But it did get normalized. 

I broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.

But I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn't know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.

We bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can't do that, you're about to be a father."" And I started crying.

We had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" 

After the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn't feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.

Late last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.

I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

That month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. 

And the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.

The floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. 

I started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn't go to the gym, and carrying a purse.


[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]


Christmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I'm out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I'm the same person I've always been. And I blew it.

I don't know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter's christmas presents. 

It wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn't drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.

But the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970's NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.

Her father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what 'non-binary' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: 

He said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, 'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don't like that we shouldnt get together.' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" 

I understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I've skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.

Sue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.

A month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: 

1) I am hurting people by doing what I'm doing

2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again

3) I don't think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.

I tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I've thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.

Not satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don't stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""

That hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.

The woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sue knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here's johnny."" 

I deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.

It was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn't try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.

I was alone. 

And I've been alone ever since.

I have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I'll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I've been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.

I've had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I've still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.

I was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won't be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.

I'm so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.

I have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she's been such a huge support. I've reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.

I didn't get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.

I had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. 

I am up for a big promotion so I've had to go in on weekends and stay late.

I havent left my couch all day today. I don't even think I've turned on a light for more than a second.

I thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I've had my blinders on to all those times she wasn't supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.

I doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.


TL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.

EDIT 2: As if you need more to read, here is the contents of my ""coming out post"" I made the day after she left.


Dear World,
My name is [birth name]. I am not a freak. I am not a monster. I am a person. With hopes and dreams and fears and ambitions. I am also non-binary. What does that mean? It means I don’t let the shape of genitalia determine how I interact with the world. It means I don’t shove myself into a man shaped box or a woman shaped box. The shape of my body does not define my role in the world and does not preclude me from finding joy where I see it. In practice, I’ve been experimenting with makeup and a more feminine expression in my clothing choices. I choose the middle path. It shouldn’t hurt you to hear this, and if it does you should ask yourself why. This has been a journey I found myself on over 5 years ago and it has not been an easy road. At times it has been very lonely and painful, but I find that most of that pain and anguish came from holding a part of myself back from the world. I come to praise [birthname], not to bury him. The label only serves to describe my feelings, but it does not define me. Only I define me. And I am [birthname]. The passionate, sympathetic, caring, and loving person I hope you’ve always known me to be. I will not be held hostage by society. I will not be made to think I am “less than.” I am the new normal: a world existing in and on a vast spectrum that “black” and “white” couldn’t begin to describe. Join me or not, but I hope you will. ✌️one love

"	"Wow.  That's quite a story.  I can relate to some of the core parts.  My wife is currently trying to take all of my kids away bc I am transitioning and bc of how embarrassing it will be for the kids.  At this point, I'm pretty sure I still have myself and my job.....everything else is a crapshoot except the certainty of losing my marriage.   I think at one point in life, I thought I was one of the lucky ones too.  The only comfort or solace I can offer you is the reassurance that you are not alone.
I read it through. I'm so sorry Sue can't understand you and can't see how not letting your daughter see you doesn't help her at all. Do you have any lawyer friends that you're discussing with about the situation?

You sound pretty amazing. 💕 Thanks for sharing your story
Have you gotten your own lawyer? My understanding it that the longer you allow your daughter to lived away from you the harder it will be to get custody as a judge will not want to change her lifestyle/what she knows. Start the fight for custody rights *now.*
This was a sad post. Friend, I truly hope things get better for you and that you get to see your child more. I know it's not the same, but I've not seen my little sister in almost two years and I've yet to meet my youngest sister due to coming out to my mom.
>I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

This resonates a lot with me. I’m agender, but I’m very fem, and this is a really good way of putting it into words the way I haven’t been able to.

Thank you, and you always have us as support.
:( im sorry about what happened with sue, it hurts so much to be in search for support in people you care about and not finding it, but from this post i get the impression that you can handle anything life throws at you. you are beautiful!!💜💜
I'm sorry to hear all that.

It sounds to me like you got to a point where you sort of had to force the issue that you are non-binary and she would have to be okay with that, but she isn't.

If you can't be together, I hope for everyone's sake that you and Sue can be adults about this.  I know that we hear many horror stories about how the family courts handle situations with divorcing couples with children, but you don't hear a lot about couples who divorce and then successfully co-parent afterwards.  I hope that you and Sue can come to an agreement to be able to parent together.

Some USA jurisdictions now have ""presumption of joint custody"" policies in place.  If you live in such a place, you are fortunate that you have the law on your side that Sue must make an affirmative case against you in order to take your daughter away.  In any case, /u/UVSky is right that you need to get in touch with a lawyer and learn about what the policies are in your jurisdiction and what you need to do to secure your right to parent your child moving forward.
That's a big story, and it deserves a big post. I'm so sorry.

But you know what? F*ck Sue and f*ck her family. You don't deserve that kind of hatred and toxicity in your life. I firmly believe everyone has the right to be happy and open about who they are. You are part of everyone.

Remember, this community is always here for you.
I'm honestly really sorry you had to go through this. Much love to you and thanks for sharing! 
Hey friend, I'm really sorry all of this  happened. You're incredibly resilient and you'll get through this mess too somehow.
you already fully went through puberty at only 14 and call yourself a late bloomer? ok.
Friend, that's neither here nor there.
Maybe I didn’t word that right. Like I didn’t ejaculate for the first time until I was 14 and I don’t think the mechanics had turned on until then. The things I’ve heard about 9 yos humping everything or the 12 yo taking 1000 showers a week was never anything I experienced. 

Maybe it wasn’t “puberty” but I just didn’t “discover myself.” I didn’t know it was supposed to do anything other than pee.
that's what the post said."	8an4qz	NonBinary	52	0.99	2018-04-08 02:32:31
I did a thing!	"Hello!

So, not sure if this type of post is allowed here, but I wanted to share some personal accomplishment and good news! Feel free to start commenting something that you’ve accomplished as well! I want to hear all about your triumphs and your ambitions. Here’s mine:

After years of second guessing and deciding, I finally got accepted into college! I start this Summer for a Medical Billing and Coding Diploma! What this means is after the program, I will be certified and able to work in a hospital building setting in Insurance Follow Up/Medical Billing/Medical Coding or even a remote profession! I am beyond excited and I look forward to starting.

What’s even cooler is the college I applied for and got accepted by updated their markers and I was able to choose the Non-Binary option! They also asked pronouns. I know it doesn’t seem like a huge deal, but, I love that so many places are becoming more open and inclusive!

I hope everyone is having a good week and I can’t wait to hear what you’ve accomplished!"	"I have an appointment with a surgeon tomorrow to talk about getting a gender affirming hysterectomy!! Very excited!!!
Sounds wonderfull!!!
A couple months ago I got my fire fighter cirtificate, so I'm officially a fire figther, and I think thats pretty cool hahah!
Good luck with college!
Congratulations!!

I finally updated my chosen name at college so when I start they won't use my dead name 🤩
Huge congrats! 
I’m going back to school after dropping out 6 years ago. I’ve done a lot of growing since then and have come to realize that I’m much better suited to learning in a hands-on environment and would love to spend as much time as possible with plants ... so in 6 days I’ll be starting the first phase of apprenticeship in horticulture! 🙂
Congratulations! That’s awesome! 

 I am traveling in another country for the first time by myself with my X gender marker on my passport, and feeling really proud of my self. 😊
Nothing as big as y’all’s but this week I got one step closer to my euphoria feels with a haircut that’s buzzed short all around (a 2) except for the chin length hair left on top that can style masc or fem depending on what I’m feeling that day. I smile every time I see my haircut in the mirror now ❤️
congratulations!!
That’s awesome! Congrats!
congrats! i moved from the US to australia a few months ago for uni, and tomorrow i have my first appointment with my new endocrinologist :)
I’ll be sending positive, healing vibes your way!
That is amazing! I’m so proud of you! That’s a huge deal. Thank you and I will be sending you positive, successful vibes as you venture more into your career as a Fire Fighter.
Love it! That’s awesome!
Thank you!

I wish you all the best and best of luck as you return to school!

Call CA governor to support Gender Recognition Act signature (allows for nb marker)	"The California SB-179 bill, the Gender Recognition Act, has been sitting on the governor's desk for signature for three weeks and only has four days left to be signed into law.  This bill creates non-binary category for gender on birth certificates and driver's licenses. It also streamlines process for transgender, intersex and non-binary Californians to obtain identification documents. 

Please consider calling the Governor's office in support of SB-179,
The number is Governor Jerry Brown: 
(916) 445-2841

Here is a call script:
Hello, my name is __________, from _______________, California. I am calling to urge the governor to sign SB 179, the Gender Recognition Act. This act will increase the efficiency by which our transgender and non-binary citizens can obtain gender documents that are accurate. Also, our community members who do not identify with binary gender categories must be protected under state law. Making ""non-binary"" an officially recognized gender will enable thousands of Californians to carry identification that describes them as they identify themselves. It will send a powerful message that America's future must be one of inclusion and protection for gender and sexual minorities. Thank you!

I was nervous about presenting more femme in public for the first time, but I'm super lucky to have a really supportive partner who is helping me out and has my back	"So i've been a little anxious this week because I've been planning on dressing a bit more femme for the first time in public this weekend. There's a protest against a 'Religious Discrimination' bill (basically the Australian Government trying to take us back to the good old days where you could fire/harass someone legally about their gender or sexuality) and I figured that would be a pretty safe space to try out some clothing and makeup around some non shitty peeps. 

It's been a little worrying to me because I'm unsure what sort of reaction I'd get from other people and most importantly my wife, who hasn't really seen me do much in the way changing my wardrobe yet, although she was really supportive about me when I came out to her as NB. But I had a super awesome night where I brought up that I might want to present a bit different and she wanted to see what I was thinking so we spent the whole night trying on clothes and she even helped me with my makeup, which I really needed since my result where pretty shaky from just youtube tutorials. 

I'm actually really looking forward to tomorrow now, and hopefully plenty of people show up and I'll try and get some photos if I can get a decent look going."	You have a great wife and I'm proud of you, that you opened yourself up to her!	etay91	NonBinary	42	1.0	2020-01-24 14:15:24
Gender X driver’s license option in Massachusetts (USA)	"The Massachusetts state Senate approved a bill to allow gender X markers on driver’s licenses. It now goes to the state House of Representatives. If approved, it would take effect in November. 

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/06/28/us/ap-us-drivers-licenses-gender-x.html

Bill: https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/S2562

NY has a similar submitted state assembly bill that has not received a floor vote. Maine recently passed a similar bill. 

Call or contact your state legislators in support.

UPDATE: NJ has just passed bill that would allow self-affidavit of gender, including “non-binary/unspecified”, for birth certificates and their amendment."	"Yay!  I got my Oregon “gender x” drivers license one year ago today, and the same for my birth certificate in February.  Feels great!
I want this in Ohio!!
What would happen if someone with an X gender license later moved to a state without the option though?
I have used my non-binary DL many times at airport check-in and security.  I have yet to receive a single comment about it. 
Got a few years to go until my license renewal when all this SWHTF personally, but I'm wondering if CA's Gender Recognition Act & the Real ID Act will work together or not. All I have to prove identity is my certified U.S. birth certificate, so AMAB might be copied over to the Real ID... unless I have to escalate towards a federal lawsuit assuming nobody else has settled the issue of government not needing to know our stinkin' genders.

Real ID was passed over a decade ago, so you'd think CA would have had enough time to figure out if the non-binary DLs will be Real ID Compliant vs Federal Non-Compliant... 

If Real ID Act isn't agnostic on gender standard, I don't see it being amended by Congress to allow for non-binary licenses until at least 3/4 of the states are in on it.

https://transgenderlawcenter.org/archives/14062

https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/realid
Have you used the DL all by itself in any Real ID Act situations?

My Google-fu is weak as to anyone being refused boarding planes, et al, with only ""gender x"" licenses; only finding the standard ""if government agents want to be totalitarian, can they?"" articles [narrator: they CAN keep getting away with it via various grants of immunity].

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/07/will-new-gender-neutral-licenses-fly-with-tsa.html

https://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2017/06/d-c-offers-gender-neutral-drivers-licenses-odds-federal-law/
They’d probably make you pick M or F and might maybe you  demonstrate  the validity of your choice with a birth certificate or medical professional’s letter.  Or you might have the basis for a lawsuit against the new state.
X gender markers are valid under the Real ID act. The act requires  that Real ID compliant driver’s licenses/IDs have a gender marker,  but it does not require that they be M or F. 
The Real ID Act requires that gender be included on the ID, but it does NOT specify what gender options are acceptable.  The right wing “Judicial Watch” article is blatantly lying. 
I don’t think this is a significant  concern, despite the scaremongering of very conservative groups.  Many states, including those with x marker options, have extensions to become compliant with the real ID act. If their gender marker options would make them non-compliant, they will be told before their extension is up. Also, TSA accepts passports from other countries with x markers on them and it is considered a legal marker by the main international body that sets passport standards.
So as usual, we're left at totalitarian/government agents' mercy if they say ""X isn't a gender [marker], you're not getting on that plane with just this DL"" etc. As the magic wand of immunity is waved over their every human rights violation.
No, they're pointing out what should be an obvious angle of attack so we (our competent lawyers) can prepare for the inevitable totalitarian fuckery. Even if you see Judicial Watch as your enemy, why interrupt them from making a mistake? [Strategy more.](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/napoleon_bonaparte_103585)

You have to think like a government lawyer: ""What soon-to-be-rubber-stamped POS totalitarian argument should I make in court to defend my client's fucking of human rights to death? I know! Male is a gender, Female is a gender, non-binary or an X denotes the absence of gender, therefore that's no more acceptable as a marker than leaving a blank space!""
Lambda Legal is a very conservative group?

> Potentially complicating matters for the federal government is a pending lawsuit filed by Dana Zzyym, a U.S. Navy veteran and intersex person.
>
>Since 2014, Zzyym has been trying to obtain a U.S. passport for use traveling overseas, but the State Department has repeatedly rejected Zzyym’s application for an “intersex” passport.
>
> The department permits individuals who transition from one gender to another to amend their passport to reflect their sex, but does not recognize an individual who is born with both male and female characteristics. 

If the US executive branch fucking with one of us trying to not put M or F on an official document over the span of both major parties' presidential administrations, isn't significant...

ETA: Not sure of the case status, now.
R-i-g-h-t....because your paranoia always trumps the actual experience of persons who have been using their ""X"" gender DL for the past year, flying many times, without the slightest hint of negativity from TSA agents.  

Paranoia much?  Thank you for the morning chuckle, though.  The fact that you think pointing out the lie of a right wing conservative rag in this forum is ""interrupting"" the right wing conservative rag is peculiar, to say the least.  The fact that you think every lawyer employed by the government is a right wing extremist bent on destroying human rights is just beyond the pale--I'm not sure if you take that position out of honest ignorance, or just hateful prejudice.
The lambda legal piece says that the x marker is not a problem for the real ID act and that state bills that allow it are specifically designed to comply with the act. The vast majority of news pieces regarding this report the same thing, including Fox News. 

Judicial watch is just speculating and scaremongering that this isn’t the case, and yes they are a far right group. 

Even if x markers were one day ruled non-compliant, that would be an action against the state not an individual and states would rectify it, not leave people in limbo and unable to drive/travel. 

Also, you could use a passport with m/f marker on it for travel (including domestic) if you are concerned about illegal action by TSA agents and use an x marker license for everything else.
2/2

R-i-g-h-t....because your feigned omniscience always trumps the actual experience of persons who have ever & will ever use our ""X"" gender DLs & wouldn't necessarily want their cases out of the closet.

No mention of Real ID in https://transgenderlawcenter.org/resources/id/ca-sb179

break

> D.C. Councilmember Brianne K. Nadeau consulted with the National Center for Transgender Equality when drafting her bill, with the express purpose of ensuring compliance with REAL ID.

TSA was still working to develop guidance, so WTF does Oregon.gov get its confidence from? NCTE's not a federal government agency, so how can D.C. justify that they have compliance on lock?

States would have to sue the federal government on behalf of their citizens but there's no guarantee they'd rectify it. And the citizens would be left in limbo until temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions are issued, stays pending appeal are lifted, if at all. Courts move at a glacial pace; justice delayed is justice denied. Non-refundable tickets & airlines not willing to make exceptions for TSA-denied NBs? You can try claiming them as damages...

The whole point of me bringing this up is because we shouldn't have to hold US passports, let alone any primary/secondary identification with the wrong gender marker, to pass any kind of federal screening. It would be consistent for any fed to say the same type of fuckery against Zzyym's US passport applies to state DLs/IDs.

Any argument that international non-M/F passports pass muster is inapposite, as the US has no jurisdiction over foreign state departments & those countries would love if the US briar-patched over bigotry.

"Hello folks just to start I am 36 amab nonbinary and have been on HRT since september of 2016...I currently work  in a call center and have been there for a year (it suck but is pays the  bills).   I primarily present still in androgynous dress and such as womens jeans tees  nothing live overtly feminine but  definitely not mens dress.   My mannerisms are probably still kind of male leaning and I  have been trying to bring out my softer side here recently.  Since day one at this place gay men have started  there whisper campaign against me because I don't act flaming like most of them do, we are all different.  They are like that ""that is a man"" that is  not a girl blah blah blah.    I basically get treated like a fraud at my job because I do not conform to some  stereotype of what a trans person is non binary is still trans.  The main thing that bothers me is people that dont know me trying to take my indentity away from me.  That burns  me up getting the side eye from people who don't know me. "	"There will be a day when you leave work and that will be the last time in your life you see their faces. You won't know it on that day, but a week later, a month later, a year later, you'll realize they're gone from your life. You can not change their negativity all by yourself, but you hopefully can create and influence positivity around you to fill the space as they leave. 

Until they fly the fuck away, kill them with kindness. Meet their side eye with a smile. Meet their whispers with genuine conversation. Be the incredible person you are meant to be, and let them stew in their hate or embrace a dialogue of acceptance.

<3 I am sorry you are in this position. We don't know you, but you have a hell of a lot of people here who care.
First, I am sorry you are going through this. I have found that people still have a hard time thinking outside the gender binary. It may be they just don't understand.

Have you tried talking to them? I realize that is emotional labor you may not want to spend. But, if you think they are genuinely just confused, it might help. I try to think of people as good before coming to other more nefarious conclusions. I have found if you give most people a genuine chance, they rise to the occasion. Mostly.

Alternately, you can talk to HR.

Not a long rant, but I’m so frustrated right now. I just told my sister and nieces that I was planning a name change and I like they/them pronouns and I’m all butterflies now. Young people take note: this isn’t always a one time process. 

Sometime in the late 80s I realized I was “gay” but I still liked girls too. “Gay” was pretty much the only word, unless I went on stage in drag and then I was a “tranny.”  

By 1992 we had “gay, lesbian, and bi” and the LGB movement. So I was now bi. I came out as such to my closest friends. 

In 1995 I got married to a pretty masc woman. We’re still married, she’s the most supportive thing, cis (heavily closeted nbi but I’m not here to force people’s evolution) and we little 5’6 things are raising a 6’3 monster together. Yesterday was his 16th birthday. I was still bi. 

In 2000 I started a new career and moved. In 2005 when my son was born I came out as “bi” to the new people I worked with. I’m a film tech, so it cost me some work and some acquaintances, but it was worth it. 

I have always worn funky clothes and dressed a little unconventionally (dead giveaway). Sometime around 2012 or 2013 I started adding little “cosplay” touches. A leather pouch, fingerless gloves, etc. 

Im 2017 I go on the Keto diet and lose almost 100 lbs. I need new clothes. Out of my love of sixties fashion I order two pairs of women’s stretch bellbottoms from Wish. They fit great but they are a little thin (and tiny pockets goddamn it amirite?) Still as a “bi” I go to Marks because I need something underneath to keep me warm. Oh, what’s this? “Buttery soft leggings?”

Buttery soft. Those two words change everything. I go to Old Navy, take a deep breath, and cross to the women’s section. It’s all so COLOURFUL! And INTERESTING! And so so so soft. Still justifying it as “a hippie look” (I probably should have just clued in here) it’s soft, comfy cardigans, blanket scarves, oh look at me I’m just a hipster pfft... 

In 2019 I get the news. I have a terminal illness. I’ve got years, but not decades unless I’m lucky. So now I start thinking about what I want to do with my remaining time.  

Bringing us to now, where I have ditched a lot of toxic people from my life and now I’m trying to get out of my 70 hour work week business and find something where I can use my experiences to help other struggling LGBTQ people find peace and acceptance. I just need to figure out how to pay my bills with it! 

Oh. I guess it was a long rant. Anyway thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."	"Thank you for sharing! It’s inspiring to hear how you found yourself. Much love ❤️

A message to all UK enbies!	"In just under 3 months, on November 13th 2020, the 'Non-gender-specific Passports Bill 2019-21' will go to the house of commons for its second reading and will be up for debate. NB gender identities currently have no meaningful legal recognition in our country and this is our chance to make our voices heard and demand that our politicians recognise the validity of our existence. 

Although the bill specifically refers to our ability to identify our gender on passports, this marks an important step in the overall legal recognition of non-binary gender identities as a whole. It is therefore of vital importance that we all contact our local MPs and request them to support this bill at this stage and to support the legal recognition of our identity in overall political discourse. 

As part of this, it is our responsibility to educate our representatives on what it actually means to be non-binary and how this is distinct from those who are gender-nonconforming, binary-transgender or transsexual. Included below are links to some documents that I believe could be helpful for us to provide a baseline understanding of what it means to be non-binary and why it is important for us to gain the legal recognition we deserve.

Tips for getting insurance to cover your top surgery	"Hi all,

After going through this process, I wanted to share my experience and what I learned after getting my top surgery approved through my insurance.

*Step 1:*
Call your insurance company to see if you have coverage for gender-related procedures, if so - ask to see if you have out-of-network benefits.  If you do, this is great.  This means you have more options when it comes to looking for a therapist (you'll most likely need a letter from them in support of your surgery) as well as locating a surgeon (Dr. Garramone will bill insurance for patients who have out-of-network benefits).  Make sure you understand the fine print of the out-of-network benefits.
Step 1A: If your insurance does not cover gender-related surgeries, you can appeal this!  There are some great resources out on the internet to help you do this, use Google!  

*Step 2:* Once you know that your insurance will cover such procedures (as they should!) the next thing you want to do is to ask about your deductible and how much it is.  A deductible is something that you need to pay first BEFORE insurance will pay anything.  For example, sometimes it's $500, meaning you need to pay out of pocket $500 before insurance kicks in.  Sometimes people have really high deductibles and in my case it's $2,000.  I'm lucky enough that my employer will cover 90% of that deductible only requiring me to pay $200.  So things like that could happen and you'll want to find out either from parents (if you're using their insurance or your own employer on how that works).  If you're using a government funded plan, you'll want to clarify that information when speaking with the benefits representative. 

*Step 3:* Find the procedure policy that indicates what documentation you need to get this surgery covered.  Google top surgery and then the name of your insurance.  This should pull up the policy which will tell you how many letters you need, sometimes it's 2, usually it's just 1.  What the letter should say, for example my letter needed to state how long I was living as my preferred gender and needed specific examples of how my gender dysphoria impacts my daily functions.  You can print out this procedure policy and give it your therapist or doctor, whoever is writing your letter.  This will ensure they include this information in your letter. 

Insurance has *30 days* to make a decision on whether or not they will approve a surgery or not, however it typically takes them 5-7 business days.  You'll be notified via snail mail of the approval or denial and from there, you'll either be able to schedule your surgery or file an appeal. There are also great resources out there for a constructing an appeal for an insurance denial.

It still doesn't feel real and I was happy that I was able to navigate this crazy system.  I worked as an office manager in a Physical Therapy office for 3 years, so I became very familiar with CPT codes, insurance and benefits.  If you have any questions or want any help, please message me! *I want others to know it's possible and that you have my support and help if needed.*     "	"Thank you so much for this, currently feeling very overwhelmed at everything insurance and almost stopped trying because I got so overwhelmed. Gave me the strength to keep trying tomorrow, thank you!
I'm not at this step yet, but I'm getting closer and am already overwhelmed/anxious just thinking about it!
I’m a non binary female and I really want top surgery I don’t care about the hormones I just want my chest gone. I don’t have insurance and I just started to work at shoprite my goal is by the end of this year I probably will have enough for top surgery but I’m just stressed because my mom doesn’t have a job at the moment but when she does get one she has insurance but she said I’m one my own for this and she would let me use her insurance. (Wow thanks) so I’m very stressed about this cause I feel like this is medically necessary for my mental health. My mom doesn’t really believe in non binary stuff she said that a person should be just a boy or a girl that’s how “normal” people are. I found that very effensive and I decided to just work this out on my own. I only have $200 rn in my bank account so I have a long time but my goal is to reach 8k since that seems like enough and I’m a skinny person and I read that the cost depends on the body size and breast size and etc. So that’s my problem but I just hope that this year goes by quick so I can get this surgery and I will be sure to work ALL summer. Thanks for listening 🤟
Hey thanks for this. I have medical and everyone i call is saying that it can take months for them to approve the surgery or even the consultation. Is there anyway around this to speed them up? Most doctors in ca (im in la) dont have avail till winter or next year. Which is extremely depressing. Is this just how long it will be? Is there anything i can do?
so helpful thank you!! would having a high deductible make you more likely to get top surgery approval? and should i chose a plan with a higher or lower copay in order to get them to cover more of the surgery (i’m only 19 and know virtually nothing about insurance so i was just looking for some guidance as i am not in therapy and not out to my parents)
Hey so i have like medicaid washington and i feel hopeless. I thoight i was moving states so i cancalled my consult last month and the nest one isnt until may. And after that it takes a year. I cant work bc of like chronic pain from like trauma but i dont have medicare bc i got dissaproved from like ssi. But my dad might be willing to pay an insurance for me? So i can get it. Bc i fr feel like i have no other option. Like what insurance would u reccomend? Im also a student if that helps i start im yhe fall
I'm glad!  It is truly unbelievable how much you need to advocate for yourself and when things are not going you way, it is soul crushing.  I feel for you and glad this was helpful.  If you need anything else, please let me know. 
Hey there.  You're welcome and I'm glad people find this post, almost 4 years ago now, still helpful.  

Given your geographical area, it sounds like LA (even CA in general) is just backlogged and a lot more people seem to be openly trans now, so that means more of a demand.  Also, I'm sure there are many people outside of CA who pursue this sort of surgery in CA, especially if you have a decent amount of surgeons/doctors.  Consultations are normally free - so I'm sure many people are pursuing them/setting them up to see what their options are.  

I would schedule your consultation ASAP just to get on the books with a few surgeons that you think you like/want to work with.  After that, you can let the office staff know you're looking to get in ASAP and that if they have any cancellations to call you.  You can also call once a week to see if anything opens up so they can get you in sooner.

It does not take months to approve a surgery, in fact - I want to say insurance companies have 30-45 days to reply to a surgery request and authorize it.  Honestly, my insurance company took like 7-10 days if that to make a decision.  If your ducks are in order and you have the right paperwork, your surgery will be approved.  Once it's approved, it's more so getting your surgery date.  If anything, that's what will take months in this situation.  So, in that respect, unless you have OON (out-of-network) coverage that allows you to use any surgeon regardless of state, you'll have to work within those restraints.
Of course! 

The deductible wouldn't impact your eligibility or approval for surgery, but it would impact how much you would pay out of pocket for that surgery.  For example, if you have a high deductible plan, it's most likely that what you would pay per month for insurance would be cheaper, since you have more out-of-pocket costs.  If you have a low deductible, your monthly bill for insurance would be higher, since insurance is covering more of your costs.  

And when I say monthly bill, I am referring to the monthly payment people make just to be insured.  Most likely you would get your insurance from an employer, so this would come out of your paycheck directly but if you're on a government issued plan, I'm assuming those people are logging in somewhere to make a monthly payment just to be insured.  Your other option is Medicaid - which is a government insurance plan with essentially no out-of-pocket costs.  You have to qualify for this and meet the eligibility requirements, I believe it's usually based on income but those on Medicaid, depending what state you're in do have trans-related coverage and would have no out-of-pocket costs.  If you are covered by your parents insurance, you wouldn't be eligible for this.  

Back to the deductible - 

Let's say you choose an insurance plan for yourself with a $2,500 deductible.  Insurance will pay nothing until you've met that deductible.  You would meet this deductible by using your insurance - such as going to doctor's visits, having a procedure done, going to the ER, etc.   People who don't have a ton of medical issues, usually don't ever meet their high deductibles.  What sucks about that is you're paying more for those doctors visits because you haven't met the deductible, so you're being billed maybe $100 here, $200 there, $250 for emergency.  Now, for something like top surgery - you would certainly meet that deductible but would also be required to pay for any other copays or fees that would come with that.  I do not have a high deductible plan, but for my surgery I had a $200 surgery copay and my responsibility after insurance was $200.  Top surgery overall with my insurance cost me $400.  

So, if we took the plan above with the $2,500 deductible - this person would be responsible for paying $2,500 + any copays or fees associated with that surgery.  That could maybe run in total $3,000-$4,500.  

Not knowing much about your situation or work situation, I would certainly see what insurance your employer offers (if you are working) and if it specifically covers top surgery before you sign up for anything.  The last thing you want is to sign up for insurance and there is no coverage related to trans procedures (hormones, top surgery, etc.) 

I personally am a fan of a low deductible.  This allows you to meet the deductible way sooner and even though you may have higher copays, it is still lower than what you would pay for an appt w/ a high deductible.  

Given your age, there are many other factors at play such as being on your parent's insurance, what sort of insurance you can afford on your own, and what is available to your in your area.  Please do not hesitate to DM me or ask more questions, it is a lot to take in and understand!
Sorry to hear you had to initially cancel your consult.  I would get another scheduled ASAP.  Sounds like you’re back on the schedule for May… but are there other surgeons who do top surgery in Washington that take Medicaid? I would start calling around and seeing how soon you can get a consult with them.

I’m sure it is limiting in terms of your options with Medicaid, so that sucks but I would still def search around to make sure you’ve maximized your options.

If you’re a full time student at a college in the fall, you can get health insurance from school.  I don’t know what it covers exactly… and it can be pretty expensive I think.  Normally international students sign up for this coverage. 

How supportive is your dad? And how willing is he to pay and get you signed up for another insurance? I also think depending on the insurance, there are certain periods when you can sign up and can’t.  So, that is something to consider as well.

Those I know who have had top surgery covered by Medicaid… can be a lengthy process just due to surgeons available and the rigmarole of the documentation needed.

I think your best bet is to make sure you’re looking into all of the surgeons in Washington willing to do top surgery through Medicaid.

If you have, and your only option is this 1 surgeon, I would call a couple times a month to see if they have any consult cancellations and if you could get in sooner. 

If that is a bust, I would have a serious convo with your dad about your need for top surgery and what your options are.  I would start by googling top most trans friendly health insurances and comparing. 

I hope this helps in some way.  Hang in there, it will work out.
oml thank you so much you have no idea how much this helped! i am on my family’s insurance but i plan on moving companies and paying for my own, as i’m assuming they would be notified. plus the surgeon i want to go with isn’t in network with them(god i hope i said that right lol) 
my current job does not offer me insurance but i am currently looking for other jobs anyway!
am i correct to assume that if i chose a plan with a low deductible higher copays and higher monthly bill it would make my medications more affordable or at least not a lot more than they are now?(cause i take pristiq which i hear can get pretty expensive, and my family’s insurance makes it a lot cheaper apparently)
Hed only be willing to pay for insuranxe just bc of all my other health issues honestly. And thank you so much for the responze i really appreciate it. I will call around some more honestly but i think it might only be tbis surgeon. But im gonna call more places today. Thank tou so much :)
Yeah.  Whoever is the policy holder, normally a parent or caregiver - would most likely be notified.  It is possible that your family's plan may have out-of-network coverage, but you'd have to ask.  

You can always call that insurance company yourself and ask those questions to get a good starting point.  All you need to do is google the name of insurance and contact information.  A phone call wouldn't notify the policy holder or anything like that, and you can talk a customer service rep about what is covered and how much and even then, confirm if the policy holder is notified should you decide to go through with the procedure. 

Most likely the plan that would cost you more money per month will result in more affordable medications.  That isn't always the case, so when shopping for insurance I would ask 'with this insurance, how much is Rx going to cost?' They should be able to give you an exact amount or estimated range.

D.C. Council unanimously passes bill allowing non-binary gender markers on IDs			9hqj43	NonBinary	20	1.0	2018-09-21 14:36:46
Date turned out to be transphobic	"So this guy asked me out. I was indifferent to it but I talked myself into going anyways. He assumed I was a cis man, he never asked me my pronouns and I didn't tell him. I could have told him I was trans nonbinary but I thought that would be more trouble than it was worth especially since I already wasn't planning on dating him. 

The date itself wasn't great, he did majority of the talking and every time it did become a conversation he interrupted. But we were talking about the importance of kids feeling safe in classrooms so I brought up how harmful the anti-trans/gay bills in schools are. And he went ""ehh"". This started an hour long discussion (again he did most of the talking). He regurgitated some anti-trans talking points and super specific examples of one person making a mistake. A lot of emphasis on preserving tomboys and feminine men rather than having trans people. The only time he took back anything he said was when I laughed out loud at him saying the detransition rate was 70%.

It was really difficult to argue my perspective without revealing I was trans. Especially since it didn't feel right to argue ""facts"" with personal testimony. I knew he wouldn't be so honest if he knew I was trans, so I kept it to myself. He acted as if it was kinda fun to have ""debated a controversial topic"". But I was exhausted and felt as if I didn't defend trans people well enough. I texted him afterwards with some reliable trans studies and ended up coming out as trans. He said that we could have ""changed the subject if it was making me uncomfortable"". And he said that it was ""cool of me to debate him since most people would just think he was transphobic"". I declined his 2nd date and said we should split ways no hard feelings.

In the days since and after talking with friends I feel as if I was too polite to him. That I really could have called him out better. But idk I feel like there's a constant struggle between trying to be the nice trans person that deals with a lot of shit but ultimately gets people to change their views and the mean trans person that doesn't take shit but ultimately doesn't get people to change their views. I also felt so desensitized to the transphobia that I didn't grasp how bad it was until I told my friends."	"You did what was safe and still put a doubt in his mind about his way of thinking. That's better than I could've done, so good on you! /g
I'd rather be polite and feel defeated than the chance of being blunt/rude and the date not taking that in a non punchy way. I think you did the best option, it feels shitty, but it's better than being possibly terrorized by someone who felt ""deceived"" by you being trans.
I did send him a study about the actual detransition rate and he did admit it made more sense than what he was saying. So at least theres that. He said that he wasn't transphobic because he had close friends that were trans and he supported them. Still wish that my calling him out on that actually got absorbed. Win some lose some I guess. 

Thanks for the reassurance and support I appreciate it
Yeah that's true, it's so hard to gauge how someone's going to react unfortunately. I was on the fence about coming out before the date, especially since I'm still getting used to being mistaken for a cis man before and it felt nice. Mighta saved me an uncomfortable few hours tho. Thank you for the comment"	xxn6o9	NonBinary	19	0.92	2022-10-07 02:24:56
Came out to dad and he was shitty about it. Resources?	"Right so I (afab nonbinary) came out to my dad, first by text (cuz it was late but i promised myself I would do it) and then I sat him down and told him that I'm nonbinary, and use they/them pronouns. Then he said, and I quote, ""okay, so persuade me."" He said that I needed to convince him to use my pronouns, and that sex was different than gender. I tried to tell him that I didn't expect to have to write a persuasive essay in order for him to accept me, but there it is. He doesn't think it's scientifically correct to separate sex from gender, and that he doesn't want to anyways because ""that's how he grew up"". He also thinks they/them is grammatically incorrect, cited his English degree from 1990's, and also said that he won't use they/them because ""that's how he grew up."" I called him transphobic because he refused to use use my pronouns at all and he told me I was wrong because he doesn't have a ""dislike or prejudice"" (google definition) against trans people. 

I know it's shitty, and I know I don't have to ""prove"" my gender in order to be valid, but I rely on him for college money and housing and I'm scared that if he doesn't accept me he's eventually going to kick me out and retract his GI bill money. I could theoretically go back into closet with him, but I have a history with depression and might spiral and huut myself if I do that, so it's out of the question. 

So if anyone has any links to resources that I could use to prove ""my side"" to him, PLEASE send. I greatly appreciate it. thank you."	"Well id just write him the most passive aggressive essay ever about how using correct pronouns prevents suicide in young non cis  young adults, and how petty it is to even even come close to riskig something lime that for your own child. Correct citations and all. But I might just become have bitter over the years.

No srsly this is some shit you got right there. The validation of you as a nonbinary person does not depend on anyones dumb ass understanding. Its not you jobto do that and youre not any less valid if you decide to follow his stupid rules dor survival! So proud of you for coming out!

It's literally in the dictionary
I like your way of thinking. Some people just need it said to their faces in such an unambiguous way: What would be worse in your eyes, using a certain word to address me or risk me being sad, depressed and possibly suicidal?

Sure, it's not super easy to adapt your language and even I sometimes gender people wrong, simply because I forget it for a moment. But I still try and it costs me nothing to do, but on the other hand for the people it affects it's a huge deal and can potentially save their lifes knowing that their gender identity is respected.
thank you so much, for the links and the support. It really does mean a lot and give me hope :')
Of course! There’s also a gajillion articles from the nice people of the internet who wrote the persuasive essays so you don’t have to! I’m sure after a while he’ll come around since he doesn’t seem to vehemently hate trans people. It’s also worth mentioning that science and language change all the time, otherwise we’d still believe the sun revolved around earth and would be writing in Ye Olde Englishe."	ed44o6	NonBinary	20	1.0	2019-12-20 03:08:20
I came out and it went horribly	"I (20) fully expected confusion and maybe even a little agitation from them. I expected them to be disappointed but somewhat accommodating. I thought my “mom” would at least try to use my pronouns, but she went off on me. I came out yesterday before I went to work and she keeps texting me telling me how disappointed she is. She said she feels let down and called me crazy and said I’m being “brainwashed” by the “trans movement” ????? 

It’s so weird and unexpected because she’s not religious and she acted fine when I came out as a lesbian three years ago. And now all of a sudden she’s calling this a “choice” and saying I’m making bad decisions. She literally called me an “it” today. 

Thankfully I live on my own and I pay my own bills, have a job, a car, and I go to school, but I never expected her to react this way. I am beyond shocked and disappointed. I keep sending her resources to help her process it, like links on how to use they/them, how to accept your trans kid, etc., but she refuses to open them. 

I told her she was losing her daughter either way and if she wanted to at least keep a child, she should collect her emotions and stop acting belligerent. (there’s screenshots on my twitter lol @/plutolesbian) 

So, yeah. I’m really frustrated right now. Any supportive comments would be helpful.

Edit: my roommates and friends and professors are all amazing and super supportive. I’m going to be okay, I just feel like shit right now. But my binder came in yesterday so at least I have that :)"	"I'm so so sorry, sounds like your mom may have encountered some TERFs along the way, especially if she was fine with you coming out as a lesbian. I'm glad you have people around you who support you; chosen family is so essential for queer and trans folks like us.

I hope she's able to come around. And if she isn't, I hope you're still able to surround yourself with love and support. Because you deserve to be loved and supported.
Yikes yikes yikes I'm SO SORRY you have to deal with that from a parent.  If she wants to have a literal temper tantrum over something completely out of her control, that's her perogitive, but like damn.
I'm really sorry you have to deal with this. My mum also refuses to use my correct pronouns but is much less directly against it. More of a passive-aggressive liberal attitude. I don't feel like I can talk about it with my parents despite being publicly out.

It's really great that you have that strong support network elsewhere though, sometimes it's better to stick close to those who support you than try to change the minds of those who don't, but it's so hard when it's your parents. 

I hope however you decide to go from here, you make the right choice for you and not for your mom 🤗
Dude, I am so sorry to hear that. Usually when people do that it's just because they are so uneducated that they block it out Rentirely.emeber that you are loved and cared about here and that I will be your parental figure for goodness sakes. (i mean im younger but f it)

"On swedish parlament and ""third gender"" recognition"	"I am sad. 

Today the swedish parlament will vote on ""a third gender"" bill. However, in our parlament there are committees handling different legislations, and the committee that is handling the subject of non-binary and intersex recognition wants the parlament to vote down this bill...

This means that non-binary and intersex folks still (most probably) will have to live with a wrong gender assigned in their ID papers. By this point I have pretty much given up on ever being seen as for who I am. "	"I know it must leave a bitter taste in your mouth to feel hopeful and end up being disappointed but you are seen and valid and we see you. I know from a bureaucratic point it's gonna sting every time you fill in a form or need to show your ID but the fact that it went to that committee is still a win, it part of public discourse now.  In most countries it wouldn't even get that far. There is still hope just don't give up.  We have your back. Change is coming. But having said all that in doesn't make your saddness real and my heart goes out to you. 
Update: as expected the bill was voted down, just like another one was a few years ago.

Though as you said I will try to see this as some progress. Also, I have realized that I have to push for change myself if I ever want to see it happen. Therefore, I am planning on writing an article for the newspaper this weekend. This might sound ambitious, but hopefully it will be published. 
YES! Write that article, keep the conversation going. I know it's gonna be draining to keep pushing but you have a community that's here for you. And don't forget to be kind to yourself. "	8gq8zb	NonBinary	17	1.0	2018-05-03 13:10:58

I think I'm nb @32 and I'm literally freaking out	"I guess this might as well be something to get stuff off my chest. I'm 32 years-old, cis-gay-male. Very hyper masculine bear. 

&#x200B;

Spent my whole life not really caring about gender or looks, I always had a unkempt and groomed, scruffy look. I was blessed with a career that I can actually not care about looks instead of dressing like a man. 

&#x200B;

Last week I watched a video from [ThoughtSlime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrr7y8rEXb7_RiVniwvzk9w) and there was a conversation about non-binary. And I cried, and it felt personal, and it made me remember things from my infancy. I kinda dismissed it but I kinda had this thing hanging in my head, it's hard to face the idea that I'd like to wear a dress. Cut my hair in a [fem-style](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/74/ed/7d/74ed7da35161c07d5098e5315587a65f--melena-bob-short-hairstyles-for-women.jpg). Paint my nails. Jesus, I even had this idea for years about dying my hair in [rainbow pastel colors after watching this video](https://youtu.be/ARH6P3MqmwQ). 

&#x200B;

Then I'd think what people would think and dismiss it like some sort of silly vain desire. 

&#x200B;

Today I decided to come here and as I look people's pictures I feel like crying again. My heart is racing. Is this dysphoria? Wiki states it as ' a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction', sounds like the story of my life. It seems so silly but at the same time, feels like something that causes me deep anxieties to flourish. 

&#x200B;

And people saying they had this thing about being CUTE, goddammit, it seems only 8 years ago I managed to feel myself cute in my own shoes, usually wearing t-shirts with positive and kind characters, like Totoro, Unicorns and whatnot. 

&#x200B;

I feel old, like a pervert, like someone who is faking it, someone who should grow up. Ended up writing some stuff and realized I have this will I still be deserving of love if I become someone else? Would mom look me straight?

&#x200B;

I remember having to change things about my looks, there was a time I used eye liner when going out, both friends and sisters kinda told me not to, at least to not freak my parents. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm here. Living alone for at least 6 years, paying all my bills, all my rent, all my shit. Graduating in 2020, and feeling like a scared kitty. 

&#x200B;

I think I'm afraid of it all.   


I wanna go buy makeup after work. But I'm afraid I'll like it. 

&#x200B;

And a voice inside tells me to ignore all this and focus on my career. Like a \*good boy\*."	"I'm so happy you are starting to question. I know what is it to look back and see that all the signs were there. It took me decades to finally realized that all I liked that was bottled was OK. I've been lucky with acceptance at home, from my girlfriend, my grown up sons, my mom, siblings and everyone I've encountered.

I must accept that 2 months isn't much to judge reactions by but I hope the reactions from people close to you are positive. If not, their loss.

It's amazing the freedom of not being encased into a stereotype.

At 51 I'm out and proud and free!!!
Hi there. 

I think these are things everyone experiences when they first discover their true feelings about their gender identity and presentation. I completely understand feeling like you're ""faking it"" and feeling like you should just ignore it and focus on things that 'really matter'... but what matters more than your own happiness? 

I think the classic trans narrative of ""always knowing"" is really harmful. I only realized I was non-binary a few years ago and it changed my life. (I'm afab and used to be hyper-feminine, until I realized I had a choice in how I could look, be perceived, behave, etc.).  I've been out for over a year and I still have the feelings that I'm faking it. Maybe they'll never go away. But the question is... would anyone really choose to be this way (in our society) if they didn't really feel it was true to them?

I think you should follow your instincts. Paint your nails. Maybe get a wig if you have short hair just to try it out. Buy some makeup and watch some makeup tutorials on youtube. (Here's a link to one of my favorite youtubers doing a transfeminine-centric makeup tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi7\_6SqretM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi7_6SqretM)) 

Something that will also probably help you process these feelings would be seeing a trans/lgbtq+ affirming therapist (it's really helped me). 

At the very least, you might try it all out and say, hey, this isn't for me. But..... you'll probably love it <3
I am 31!  I am still figuring it out :)  I know sometimes I feel fully male and sometimes I feel okay with my assigned gender (woman) with just a hint that it doesn't fit exact because women don't swing to fully male, and sometimes just feel generally non-binary.

Navigating how to express it and trying to understand what really is feminine and masculine is tough!

I think men can wear dresses to express their femininity and still be men. I think men can wear dresses to express masculinity, because who says a dress can't be masculine? and still be men!  (Like Billy Porter's Oscar gown:  [http://time.com/5537621/billy-porter-dress-oscars-2019/](http://time.com/5537621/billy-porter-dress-oscars-2019/) )And I think people assigned male at birth can wear a dress to express the actual gender they are - be that women or non-binary.

So there are many reasons to wear different looks that are typically gendered as masculine or feminine.  Everyone should feel free to question and try on different styles and see what that makes them feel about themselves, and they can learn more about how they want to move through this world.

I love this video Stef made on femininity she gave a nod to non-binary but mostly talks about wearing what makes you happy and comfy!  :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EomMR-MuBgo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EomMR-MuBgo)

This video is on non-binary dysphoria  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nylaxsl7J8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nylaxsl7J8)   I found super helpful to talk about disliking vs dysphoria.  FFor me personally, I grow my hair long and it looks good, it is pretty, but then I get dysphoria (that unease) and I cut it off - and it doesn't look as flattering, and even I dislike my haircut (I didn't do the best job) but I no longer feel dysphoria when I look in the mirror.

Take the time to explore and question :)  You can never be too old to learn more about yourself and how you want to move through the world :)  <3
Okay so, here's the thing. 

&#x200B;

You can be non binary in whatever way feels most comfortable and safest to you, and that can change over time. If wearing an undergarment only in the house under other clothes is your limit, that's fine! If putting on makeup and going out in a dress is your jam, that's fine! There is no requirement for expression. You could even be a big burly bear masculine male presenting human and still be non binary as fuck. It's all about how you feel inside. Remember - there are very butch transwomen and very femme transmen. It doesn't make them less of a woman or less of a man. You are who you are.

&#x200B;

If you're getting used to the idea, try stuff where you feel safe. Order some stuff online that won't break the bank. My god, you can get anything off amazon and it arrives so discretely. Makeup, a nice sundress, pretty shoes, whatever you want. Then try it. Put on that item and then like... chill. Watch youtube. Be in that garment or in that makeup and see how you feel, knowing you're in it. Do you feel awkward, or do you feel free? Do what feels good in your heart and don't ever feel like you need to push yourself farther than you're comfort zone, ok? 

&#x200B;

I'm here for you if you would like to talk.

&#x200B;

Sincerely, a 34 year old AFAB non-binary bi human.
It took me 29 years to figure it out and I had a lot of the same thoughts and worry. Get a counselor you can trust if you can, read, keep reading stuff here and everywhere you can. It will all make sense and it will get better. It's really fucking scary and hard and all the things you are feeling are valid. Those feelings will lessen as you accept yourself over time. They will eventually be replaced with feeling comfortable in your own skin and loving yourself.
youre not alone , i am mid thirties and enby
It's okay to be scared when you feel it all at once. You don't have to try to do anything or everything right away.  It's okay to change, it's okay to try something different. It's okay to change the way you look in ways that make you happy, at any age.

You deserve love. You don't have to become someone else if you don't want to, you can just be you. Even if that might be different than it used to look. I'm glad you found us here.

Also, if you want to see a later-in-life enby who's still doing great in their career (you don't have to choose just one), I recommend astrophysicist @astro_jje on twitter.
Ahhhhhh this post made me tear up. Sending you so much love and good vibes.

Accepting myself as nb was pretty scary. It's been five years since I first started coming out and it's still a journey but I've never been happier.

I hope you find the courage to discover and be yourself. You sound like such a wonderful person 😍😍😍😍

Thank you for the kind words. Let's see how things go
Well, I didn't paint my nails, but I got nail polish and eyeliner. There were people over at my place and I didn't feel comfortable doing anything. 

But yeah, I had this rush of simply getting those things... 

I'm already seeing a therapist... I think she's pretty open, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to share any of this.
Thanks for the resources! Will check it out!

And wow, that Billy Porter gown was just amazing.
I just checked out that last link. Holy Crap, they are amazing
I'm big and fat, 6'1-285, I fear most of things I buy won't ever fit me. And... there's fear. Like a lot of fear. 

Which is ironic, I have dozens of friends who are openly trans and androgynous. 

But just thinking about being in public... give me chills.
I'm 33 afab with a super feminine shape to my body and I've struggled with the whole ""dressing like a girl because people expect me to"" thing and it sucked. 

I've struggled with feeling too old and pervy for wanting to dress like a guy... I work in a library and didn't want people to think I was just trying to ""look gay"" or dress like a guy for attention or something stupid. I dunno, the self consciousness and social anxiety about all this stuff is a lot to handle sometimes for sure.

I'm genderfluid and I've had long stretches (years) where I would let myself go.  Only wear baggy clothes, basically live in pj's, never do anything with my hair, not shower or brush my teeth often enough... All because I hated who I felt like I was supposed to be? I don't know how else to describe it. I let myself get fat, which made my boobs get huge, and made me hate my body even more 

Anyway Ive came out to my family and husband and some friends and at work now and it's made me so happy. I hired a personal trainer, lost 30 lbs, gained muscle, shrunk my boobs, cut my hair short, and wear mostly guys clothes or gender neutral now. 

I still have girly days sometimes. but now I enjoy them, and dress the way I want, FOR ME, and not because society or some asshole or even my husband wants me to. 

Anyway sorry for the novel, I just wanted you to know how much you said resonates with me. And how much better it can get!  Right now I'm the happiest I've been in years
\+hugs+

&#x200B;

Okay, I totally feel you on that. I'm 5'6"" and about 240, so if I can find clothing all over the gender spectrum, so can you! You're afraid because well... it's not a supportive time to discover that you fall under the trans umbrella. Of course it's scary! I cried when I came to that realization. I was really scared about it. But over time you kinda realize like... I've been this forever. Why am I scared about the label? It's a word, and it's a word I can keep to myself or share as I see fit.

Additionally, you are AMAB, yes? I'll bet somewhere along the line you were conditioned to think that being too feminine was bad and would get you punished or hurt. As a gay guy I'm sure you've had your share of assholes being horrible at you... but your defense was being very big and tall and masculine. Maybe you're afraid that if you start softening it, then the defense is gone? Whatever you do, and however you express yourself, keep your safety in mind. Like if you live in a hyper-conservative area, be a big butch bear out in the wild with a scowl that promises a cyclone of pain to anyone who'd mess with you, and at home cuddle up in some lovely pink nighties (so soft!).

&#x200B;

My point though, is that it's okay to be upset and afraid. This is a big change. This is a scary time to undergo that realization. There are people in the world who love you and will fight for you and your dignity. There are people who will love you and respect you for who you are. I'd be happy to call myself your friend, and I (my little 5'6 chubby self) will bring a world of suffering to anyone who gives you shit.
> Only wear baggy clothes, basically live in pj's, never do anything with my hair, not shower or brush my teeth often enough... 

Oh god I identify so much.
Yeah I only realized recently that things like not changing your clothes or showering often enough are sometimes symptoms of gender dysphoria. Whoops, makes sense tho, I didn't want much to do with my body back then"	bcfare	NonBinary	16	0.84	2019-04-12 16:05:07
Anti-trans Bills and Intersex people	"One thing that pisses me off the most about the dozens of anti-trans bills that are popping up is that no one talks about intersex people. Even ignoring the fact that people should be able to make decisions about their gender and healthcare regardless of government interference, there are legitimate biological reasons for someone to appear and identify as neither male nor female.

Intersex people make up 1.7% of the population. Most are not identified as intersex at birth (and if they are their parents might not tell them) and may have no identifying characteristics until puberty or until they try to have kids. This means in a state like Texas over half a million people are intersex, but most probably have no idea. If the argument is that gender should align with biological sex then that’s half a million people who should identify as non-binary. 

I’m both intersex and non-binary and had no idea until I was 21 and stopped taking birth control. I started birth control at 15 because I had extremely light periods, wasn’t developing breasts and had a lot of weird hormonal things going on that my doctor thought birth control would help (she never even considered I might prefer a different hormonal treatment). Turns out my body doesn’t actually produce sex hormones like it should and I am medically better off when on testosterone. 

BUT I knew I was non-binary way before my doctors figured out I was intersex. I started going by a gender neutral nickname when I was 6. I cut my hair short when I was 7. Most people assumed I was a boy unless someone corrected them until I was in high school. I knew and everyone else sort of knew before there was any medical backing for my gender identity. 

The whole anti-trans thing is just stupid and based on a lot of complete misunderstandings about sex and gender. Just because the first doctor to see you after you’re born thinks you’re one thing doesn’t mean you should be stuck with the wrong sex/gender."	"the bills also carve out exceptions that allow doctors to continue giving unnecessary (and often harmful) genital surgeries to intersex children who don't consent to them, because this whole thing is really just about control
on that note.

you got transphobes/trans-haters claiming, that children are too young to get on puberty blockers.

meanwhile they are 100% ignoring the MASSIVE genital mutilation and forced HRT onto intersex people to FORCE THEM into the assigned gender, that came from some child mutilating abusing parasite in a white coat.

and another example is the MASS male genital mutilation going on called ""male circumcision"".

they are murdering babies (yes lots of babies die from this) and  harming them FOR LIFE both physically and mentally/emotionally. it is generally done without any pain medication and it changes FOR LIFE based on all that we do know. all while removing the most sensitive part of the male sexual organs.

\_\_\_\_\_

some freaking how these clear violations of bodily autonomy, that 100% go against the will of the child are nicely ignored by all those trans-haters/-phobes.

isn't that weird?  almost as if they are following a hateful agenda against transgender people and will grab onto whatever straws, that they can find, instead of ""carrying for the children.... ""
Thats so absurd considering they are all up in arms about consented gender affirming surguries. I know this isn't about logic and control but damn that pisses me off 🤬
best part are the talking points from those people.

they will actually say, that trans children get genital surgery before the age of 10.

that is the type of nonsense i am hearing over and over again. showing, that not even the slightest research gets done, or that they are deliberately spreading nonsense.

meanwhile genital mutilation going on with straight up newborns in the form of male genital mutilation ""circumcision"" and intersex genital mutilation and they are clearly all fine with that it seems...."	12drfjm	NonBinary	15	1.0	2023-04-06 17:29:21

It will only take 5 minutes of your time but we urgently need more submissions.

Nervous to tell my parents I want top surgery	"So I'm nonbinary, and have identified that way for about 8/9 years and as generally not-cis for about 15 years. I'm about to inherit a considerable amount of money from my grandmother who died a few years ago, which my parents want me to invest. I agree with them, totally. And I'm going to give some money to my friends and pay some bills and invest most of it. But I also want to use some of that money to get top surgery. And, like, I'm an adult. I'm almost 30, but I'm still nervous about telling them that. They are generally accepting of my nonbinary-ness, but they don't \*get\* it. And since I haven't brought up or talked about top surgery to them for about 10 years (I'd put it out of my mind as something I'd never ever be able to afford), they're probably going to react with ""But you haven't mentioned it! Why now? Why are you thinking about this? Are you sure? Blah blah blah."" But I feel like this is a chance I have to use this money to do something that I've wanted for 15 years, and if I don't I feel like I'm going to regret not doing it. I mean, my parents wouldn't DO anything to me or whatever, they're somewhat supportive, I just feel like I'm going to have to defend myself to them and ""because I want to"" maybe won't be good enough. I was on the phone with my mother earlier tonight for another reason and I wanted to bring it up but I just couldn't. It's so stupid. They live 3 states away and I rarely see them and I could just go and do it and then be like ""surprise I got my titties gone"" but instead I'm nervous about telling them because I think they're going to ask me to explain myself and my explanation won't be enough to make them get it. But since I realized that getting top surgery was suddenly an option that was back on the table I've been watching every youtube video I can get my hands on of various ftm and nonbinary top surgery reveals/vlogs/information/etc and it just seems like the right thing to do. I'm just nervous that because I don't talk to my parents about my gender identity and haven't bound in years and generally just don't communicate much about that part of my life to them, they're going to question my motives and stuff like that. But top surgery is something that keeps popping up in my life and man, do I want it."	"Honestly - maybe the ""surprise, no titties!"" option might be the best for you in this case! I mean, you really don't HAVE to explain yourself to them, you're a grown ass adult! And you know that it's something you want. Are you looking for their approval before you do it? Are you looking for their advice? If they flew off the handle and said ""oh my god, absolutely not, we can't have you doing that, that's terrible!"" would it stop your desire to do it?
I think you have to ask yourself why do you feel the need to tell them about getting top surgery. You’re right. It’s your money, you’re a adult. Even if You don’t invest it and blow it all, you still don’t have to tell them what you did with it (please invest or put away into savings). 

You can get it done then at the next family function you can explain it to everyone at once. They may have questions, but I think your family just want you to be happy.
Just do it and don't tell them. That's my plan."	csveks	NonBinary	14	0.84	2019-08-20 09:08:54
New bill proposed in CT on requiring state agency forms and options to include nonbinary option. Really not all that much but at least it’s a start		It's nice that even in the midst of all this hatred and bigotry, there are still measures being proposed and taken to promote equality. I believe NJ added a gender-neutral birth certificate option a few days ago. It's not a replacement for full equality, but it's something.	amtwf8	NonBinary	14	0.95	2019-02-03 20:54:16
Dating experience -	"Okay so for all my NB folks here..I am NB but am AFAB. My dating preferences are still heterosexual men, but I’ve been told I’m too “masculine” when it comes to men?? I’m wondering if there’s anyone else that aligns with me situation?

Most of my dates lately have been us going out to dinner and either splitting the bill or me offering to pay. It seems like men get turned off by this? I’ve always been taught to bring my own money in case of situations where end up paying?

My whole dating experience has been weird because people see my dating app photos and think I’m magically femme in person?? It’s just a weird situation."	"If they get upset by a small thing like sharing the bill you probably have dodged a bullet anyway-  


Still, Good luck on finding someone !
I avoid dating straight men since I realized they often perceive me as just a girl and project their gender roles onto me. If my masculinity changes anything for them it's that they think I'll be down to dom them.
I'm curious why your partner's sexuality is important? I get that it can feel like it's reflecting on you, but why not, for example, bi men?

I get the frustration of them still seeing your agab and acting along those gender norms though. Very shitty to have to deal with.
I don't date straight men, straight women,  wlw,  mlm, Because most of the time I find that they won't accept you're gender and say that it's embarrassing or something
Thank you✨ I didn’t know if it’s just a people I’m meeting situation or if anyone NB is going through this as well🥲
This happened to me on my first date today and I guess it's bc I look really femme too but I've come to realize just now that it's a significant reason why I feel so uncomfortable and weird and kinda grossed out atm....he was treating me in a really forced gentlemanly way, it made me feel hyper feminine...the gender roles were very thick in the air lmao. It was enough to be uncomfortable even for cis women probs, but it felt like being fake the whole time🤢 


I didn't notice how much I was faking things till now, and it's draining, so I would vm recommend to not gloss over your identity as a non-binary person to try to people please on a date
I’ve liked bi men, but usually heterosexual men I match with. Sexuality doesn’t matter to me as far as that goes, I should have worded that better my bad.
In my experience people assume that you are gender binary unless you express that you're not.. And sometimes continue to act like it even after. So yeah, you're not alone in this case
I date anyone except cishet men for a similar reason. You may want to narrow your search to only bi men and/or AMAB nb - you will get fewer possibilities but you will likely have better experiences.
Yeah, I don’t really know a specific place to find exclusively bi men. Kinda sucks."	109ylle	NonBinary	12	0.94	2023-01-12 12:34:31
What do y'all do for a living?	Jobs? Careers? What pays the bills? I'm asking because my mother told me one of her fears, when I came out to her, is that nonbinary people seemed unprofessional and I wouldn't get a job, at least not one that requires a college degree, or other certifications. Do people over look you because of gender/presentation?	"I have a B.S. and an M.S. and currently have a full-time salaried position working for the US Forest Service. Your mom has a valid fear since many people do discriminate against nonbinary people (and trans people in general). I have experienced discrimination and uncomfortable/unwelcoming professional environments, but I feel strongly that this myth of all nonbinary people just being confused dysfunctional teenagers who need to snap out of it to have successful lives needs to end. We can and do live happy and productive adult lives.
I'm a graduate teacher of English as a second/foreign language. I teach teenagers, but mostly adults. Follow the career path you like, and look for jobs with employers who understand your identity doesn't affect your performance as a professional.
I work as a carpenter apprentice. The construction field is mainly men, so there was already discrimination before I was out (AFAB). But my current job is the first one I've been out at, and I've actually been treated more equally here than any other construction / manual labor job I've had. Doesn't hurt that it's a union job, so I have extra back-up in my corner against discrimination.

BTW, I do have a college degree, but I decided I prefer an active, hands-on job over a desk job. I'm not here because I couldn't get anything ""better"".
I work from home for a health insurance company by day and I'm a filthy DoorDash whore by night.
I’m a wine buyer/sommelier. My spouse (also enby) is an art director for a global fashion brand.
I have a Master’s degree and work as a cancer biology researcher. I’m not personally out at work, but generally speaking, the field is pretty queer-friendly and if I was a more confident person I would feel pretty safe being open about my identity.
I'm a web developer.
I'm a secondary school teacher with three degrees, currently managing an outdoor education centre. I'm out at work and have been for a long time. 

Education in my country does tend to be fairly progressive, but I've also learned that I would rather miss out on jobs that I would be miserable at, rather than hiding myself to fit in with other people.
Parks and Rec. I've been a naturalist and rec educator for 25 years.
I’m an engineer in the US, but I’m not very out at work. It’s a very conservative field.
I’m a transportation planner at a shared mobility non profit. I have a Master of Urban and Regional
Planning. Out of the 25 or so people in my org, about 90% of us are some flavor of queer, trans, gay, etc. it’s quite lovely but now I feel like I can never leave because I know I’ll likely never find it again.  I do find that it’s easier to work as an out non binary person living in a large Metro area with a pretty progressive mindset.
Im a financial analyst.  Buuuuut I'm not out at work yet and idk how that's going to go.  Might have to yeeet myself outta there once the dysphoria gets unbearable.
I teach at a community college
I’m a college history professor with a PhD. Doctor and Professor are gender neutral titles!
I work as a program coordinator at a university. My career is going well.
I have a Ph.D. and work as a Materials Scientist for a large international company.
Video producer.  
Unless you are presenting as a drug addiction or something I don't think yr appearance should affect yr job.
I'm a Quality Control Analyst in critical natural gas infrastructure focusing on leak survey and reporting, as well as patrol management. I've been with the company for 7 years, have come out to a few people in management, and still receive respect. In fact, it was the supervisors in my company that allowed me to feel comfortable with coming out because they added their pronouns to their email signatures even though they're cis. Do what you love and love who you are. There are no limits.
I'm a lab tech/instructional assistant for a community college. Openly queer and polyam. For the most part my experiences have been positive. I do have a colleague who is just a miserable (misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, bigoted) human being (who I, unfortunately, have to work directly with) but my Dean and the rest of my division are absolutely lovely (and jump to my defense if needed).
2 professional non binary artists that your mum can Google are Shakti Kroopkin and Nayland Blake.
And I'm in event production, I've worked for and with newspapers as a writer and specialist, I'm an educator, and a performance and visual artist. Also co-progenitor of a drag house that produces events, education, music and new media art. I consider myself a Professional Julian.
We don't really have a job but we're trying to build a career in music, mostly using vocal synthetizers like UTAU, DeepVocal and will likely end up buying Vocaloid mobile in the near future. I personally like to use androgynous voicebanks like Namine Ritsu, Aino Erufu and plan on getting Vflower once we get Vocaloid mobile. - flower(fictive alter in sour patch kids system)
I worked as a park ranger's assistant for a while, and now I'm a receptionist.  That's what a literature degree gets you, lol.  But also there are so many nonbinary people in academia that the suggestion you ""can't get a job that requires a college degree"" is laughable to me.
EMT, going to school for nursing. But to be fair, I get misgendered almost 100% of the time by my coworkers and patients with the small exception of a couple partners who know & respect me as an enby.
currently work part time at a thrift store and also a bakery. was asked my pronouns during the interviews or the intake for both jobs (may not have been professional courtesy, i have a gender presentation and fashion sense that sounds the trans alarms in most cis peoples heads lol) and the managers and most staff use them correctly. previously was an assistant manager at a fast food chain and actually had a fair bit of the upper management using my pronouns correctly. i refuse to educate people i work with about transness/pronouns if im not getting paid for it so i never actually brought it up at that last job. some people just noticed my pronouns in my email signature and took it upon themselves to start using them (what a weirdly decent and humane thing to do, imagine that). no college degree but i got offered store manager/salaried position at that last job so careers wise it was an option.
I'm a graphic designer, and I've never had an issue regarding my appearance/presentation (I'm AFAB and switch back and forth between masc/fem presenting, including binding sometimes). That being said, I've never put my pronouns on a resume/job application or formally come out at work, so there's that.
 I’m a career coach. I literally help other people *get* jobs.
currently working part time as a server at a local restaurant, still in school closing in on my diploma, and im learning music theory/guitar along with photography and editing in my free time.

some weeks i dont have time for all of it, and thats okay. as long as i have an income when i need it and im enjoying what i do, then i say thats success.

edit: also, i didnt include my gender identity when applying for my first job because i was scared it might be an issue, but i take that back. if it is an issue for them, fuck em, they dont deserve your awesomeness anyways.
Registered nurse. My workplace is pretty blase about gender thankfully : )
I’m a software engineer. I use they/them pronouns at work, and have somehow ended up in the trans awareness committee. That said, my gender presentation is very cis, and I work from home. I believe things would be different if I worked in-office and didn’t present as a Dad.
I have a bachelor's degree in political science (plans to go to graduate school one day). But currently I work as a barista. Have worked at various nonprofits in the past as well.
Accountant at a university. I would receive greater discrimination if I worked in the corporate/private sector. 

If I denied who I was and pretended to be cis I would be terribly unhappy. So there are many professional opportunities but you just might have to modify where you choose work to avoid a toxic and cruel environment.  However, if you deny who you are and pretend to be cis it will probably lead to significant mental strain for mental illness over time.
I'm a lawyer in working in-house for a large tech company. Granted I came out in the middle of my career -- but I'm still here and I'm supported by my company. Yes there is discrimination and I come across people who don't ""get"" gender neutral pronouns -- but corporate culture (especially in tech) is evolving faster than a lot of sectors.
I have a postgrad degree in ecology and was an ecologist in the past, but am currently working in an unrelated industry in a 'it pays the bills' situation. I enjoy it though and my workplace is pretty inclusive so I think I'm ultimately happier than I was in my 'professional' job haha.

Although I don't think your mum's fears are totally unfounded (there is lgbt+ discrimination after all), I don't think I've ever come away from a job rejection where I felt my gender or presentation has been **the** reason I was rejected (things like my inability to relocate, lack of transport in the past, and applying for competitive positions have been).

I have no idea what field you're interested in, but maybe show your mum something like [ISBNS](https://isnbs.org)? Plenty of non-binary professionals. :)
Right now I work as an in store shopper but I’m studying to become an electrical engineer. Unfortunately, like another commenter in this thread said, I’m in the US so it’s still a pretty conservative field.
I own a small video game and hobbyist store.board games, anime, video games, pokemon and MTG, etc.
I'm the lead lab technician testing samples for local clinics in my area. I'm also starting a masters program to become a licensed therapist to help support trans people during their transition.
Executive Assistant at a small non-profit advocates for foster kids throughout the life of their case. My title sounds fancier than it is. I'm essentially the office manager and pa for our director.
Software engineer. I'm not out at work (I only started coming out about 4 months ago) and I work from home mostly. But I always carry my water bottle covered in enby and queer stickers when I do go into the office and I'm fairly certain a couple people have noticed.

How do you deal with being visibly queer?	"Hi all,

So I’m a femboy/transperson 5 months into my transition. Back when I was presenting as a straight-passing gay guy, I could go about my day without worrying what others thought of me. Now that I’m visibly queer, I feel a lot more exposed whenever I’m out in public.

Today, I went for a quick coffee run, and I got stuck at a crosswalk with a guy walking his dog. I noticed he noticed me, but I didn’t really pay him much attention, because I’ve been trying really hard to not care about how other people might react to me. As soon as the light turned green, I started walking and made it to other side before him (I’m a fast walker, lol). That’s when I heard him chuckle. I didn’t see a phone in his hand, so I don’t think he was laughing at a meme or anything. I think he was probably laughing at my backside, since my butt and waist are a little too curvy for a cisguy now.

Anyway, I got my coffee and went about my day. However, I can’t stop thinking about this incident. It’s not that I care what this guy thinks. It’s just that being visibly queer is such a new experience to me, I’m not sure how to deal with these kind of situations yet.

How do you guys do it? Do you guys just learn to live with the stares? My mentality so far has been *”these bitches ain’t paying my bills, so I should pay them no mind!”* and *“okay, but did I die??! no, I didn’t. I’m fine.”*"	"Ok so YMMV but I spent my formative years hanging out with (and being) absolute weirdos. I got so used to strangers barking at us because my girlfriend was wearing a costume tail that nothing phases me anymore. I don't even notice what strangers are doing around me unless they're directly addressing me. And sometimes not even then.
Made me think of the ""gays walk fast"" memes, could be that's what he was laughing about
I own it. I don't currently have coloured hair because covid (and I'm aiming for a viking braid look which I don't think I want to do with bleaching), but I used to have a short coloured mohawk, and I still have a denim jacket covered in pins, many of which are pride based. I have rainbow plugs in my ears, my t-shirts are often pride themed, and I often wear colourful patterned leggings to finish it all off.

So if someone laughs at me, y'know, big deal. I'm wearing armour.
Honestly, that last one is the one I use the most for survival. But there's also a similar option of ""what's the big deal to them anyway? I'm just being me, any problems they have are in their own head."" And from that I can lean into it to actually enjoy it or I can pull back to relax a bit
Devil's advocate: he could have been chuckling in surprised enjoyment of how curvy your backside looked.  I know I've checked people out from one side or the other covertly and then been startled into a quick giggle if they turn and the other side is just as attractive.  Maybe try to focus on the idea, ""That's right, check my ass out!  I worked hard to make my body how I like it and you should enjoy it!""
I try to ignore them. Or go as many places as possible with other people. Or wear headphones. After getting threatened a few times, sometimes unprompted and sometimes after I told them off, I don’t say anything back. I moved, though so aside from a couple times being told I’m in the wrong restroom people are chill. 🤷

Edit: I found it very hard to deal with the constant stares and intermittent harassment where I was. I am super fortunate to have been able to leave.
When I was young and an egg, I was always outed and bullied for being the weird one. It hurt! Though my family is full of weirdos, so they told me it was good to be weird. I never understood until recently! I realized how much I love to see people out in the world, just killing it, wearing whatever they want! I love seeing people be extra as hell! So now I strive to be like them, wear whatever the i want and rock it. I dream that one day, someone will see me and think, ""they're so cool, I wish I had that confidence!"" and hopefully it'll click with them too :) I never did anything to get bullied before, might as well ignore it and be happy instead. End rant. Good luck!!
I completely understand, for me most of the time I usually forget how I'm dressed and just accept it as a part of me but other times I'll realise how bright and flashy I look and want to curl into a ball when I realize people are looking. My suggestion? Say ""fuck it, this is me, this is always going to be me."" You don't owe anyone a toned down version of yourself, do what you love! Own it!
Honestly I’ve been through so much that I just don’t give a shit
that's so bad ass!!

You see, I did the opposite, lol. I spent my formative years avoiding the weirdos, because in my head, the worst thing you could be was weird. Little did I know, you guys had it right all along. You guys are the ones that give the least fucks about other people's opinion and are happier because of it! I hope to one day live my life as unbothered as you do!
Lol, I walk fast, because my father instilled it in me. He absolutely hates slow walkers. Growing up, he would give me and my brothers shit for walking slow, and now it's physically impossible for me to walk slower than 25 mph, 15 mph near a school zone.
That meme is so funny and had no idea that was a universal gay thing hahahahahaaha i always drive very fast and reckless which i hear is common too lmao
Ah, I remember being outside in fairly crowed areas weaving between people like I was trying to run from the cops but not make it too obvious... Now I hardly go out.
This was my first thought honestly, like damn ok! you just walkin around out here with all that cake??
I'm sorry to hear that you were threatened. If you don't mind me asking, where were you living and where did you move to? I live in LA, so queer people are super common here and being openly homophobic/transphobic is a big no-no.
One day you too will be awarded a costume tail, and on that day the legend will be passed on anew
I used to live in rural Michigan but now I live in Philadelphia.

Also the shock of being mildly street harassed wears off. I’m afab and started transitioning like 2 years ago so I was used to being harassed as a woman. Being constantly stared at though was what got me. I love being aggressively ignored now. The east coast aloofness is fine in that regard. Lol"	lz9mbj	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-03-06 19:52:54

Being Out at Work in a Small Business?	"I'm sorting out the details for top surgery and I've realized that with my post-op presentation change and time off needed there will probably be questions from my coworkers. 

I work as an administrator for a small specialty insurance agency/broker. Pretty much I do paperwork and billing. I really like my job and my coworkers. It's the first work where I actually care about it. 

We're kind of ""refugees"" from the corporate sphere here. Everyone has family or passions outside of work so having a chill, balanced day is our priority. Overall, I'd say we're pretty liberal, and the owners daughter who works with me is pretty GNC/alternative.  There's one conservative-ish Christian guy that I share an office/room with along with a super sweet cis girl (who might already suspect I'm in the LGBTIA+ community). We're a very small company, 12 people including myself and no HR at all. 

When I started here a year ago I told myself that I'd tell them and come out if a similar subject ever came up... And it never did. In a very sweet way, I get to exist mostly without having gender brought up very often. 

I live in WA state so I have some protections on my side. I don't foresee bathrooms being an issue in our building. I don't really care about pronouns either, she/her surprises me but in a sense of ""Oh yeah that's one of the options"".

What advise do you have about being out at work? How did you raise the subject with your coworkers?"		cp28ep	NonBinary	11	1.0	2019-08-11 20:54:46
Friend said I may be NB. Thoughts?	"I was scrolling through r/egg_irl, which I found from a post in r/196, which is a shitposting sub whose community and posts usually show support for trans individuals. During my meme consumption, I was noticing that a lot of the memes were resonating with me, but I've never felt a strong sense of dysphoria with my assigned gender (AMAB).

I decided to talk to my trans friend about it because I needed an outlet and perhaps some advice. I've never felt trans, but I've never felt strongly masculine either. My friend asked if I ever felt dysphoric and I answered no. I recalled a story wherein I wore a kilt, which I was excited to do, but didn't feel anything. I neither felt embarrassed (for wearing something ""feminine"") or excited. I also expressed that I've been interested in wearing panties but cite a concern over functionality for for reason I never have, instead of the fact that they're ""for women."" Although I've always wished I was born a girl, I'm okay with who I am and my body. The parts of me I dont like are unrelated to gender. With all this information, my friend told me I'm probably non binary.

I sought this sub out because I figured if anyone would know, it would be yall. So my question is: does it sound like I fit the bill? Obviously I know that how I choose to identify is my own decision, but I also have to admit that I don't fully understand what it means to be non binary, hence my decision to ask.

Thanks for reading!"	"Gender identity doesn’t mean you have to have a checklist of things you do to sit in a certain category. You don’t need to be androgynous to be non-binary, or fem or masc even, just yourself. It’s hard to describe how gender identity feels for me personally, I just know that being non-binary for me is just *right*. 
Of course, figuring out what your gender is can be a confusing battle for some (it certainly was for me). I wouldn’t settle into a label just yet, my advice is try to explore yourself and your identity a bit further, try new things that maybe you haven’t tried before (different clothes, maybe experiment with makeup, finding ways to present yourself). Take it slow. 
See how the water feels as you go deeper I guess—if it feels comfortable keep going, if it doesn’t feel right it’s okay to take a few steps back and go another direction. Once you’re ready, you’ll be able to swim. 
I hope none of that was confusing? Hopefully it helped :,) I’m not the best with words lol
Non binary isn't so much something to ""be"", as much as it is something you're not. Not-binary; not a man, nor a woman. 
I relate to not really feeling super dysphoric about my gender, but I'm definitely not a ""man"", and I don't feel like a ""woman"" either, and I think you some amount I'm still figuring out what I am. But reminding myself that I don't have to fit into whatever the gender norm is helps me to feel good with doing my own thing 🙂
Dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans, although some still claim it. Knowing this earlier would have helped me a lot, so here you go :)
I'm NB, and I personally don't identify as trans. I'm AFAB, and I still present female (albeit butch) and use she/they pronouns. I will admit I think part of it is internalized transphobia(?) because I ""don't feel trans enough""...? My preferred way to explain my gender identity is cisn't. All I know for sure is that I'm not 100% female.



Long story short, if you vibe with the enby label, go for it. You might find it doesn't quite fit, or you might find something that fits better down the line. Gender doesn't have to be this rigid, unchanging thing. If it's safe to do so, maybe experiment with your gender expression and see how that makes you feel.
This sounds a lot like me. I never really thought I was uncomfortable with being male, but I've often thought I'd rather be female. Looking back, I can notice a lot of dysphoria that I hadn't identified as such when it happened.

Also, you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans and/or non-binary - your experience can be driven solely by gender euphoria, and that's completely valid too.

I found [this site](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) pretty helpful, it has some descriptions of various types of gender dysphoria, which might help to notice some things you might have missed.
No one can say or assign you a gender. Only you know your gender
That was perfectly cohesive. Thank you for sharing your advice. :)

Like I said, I know that how I identify is ultimately up to me, but I mostly wanted a more solid grasp on what it means to be non binary. This post was a bit of a vent and a question at the same time, I think, and I'm not in any rush to apply a label to myself either
Thanks for sharing! I understand and appreciate your framing of NB as an indicator of something you're not rather than something you are. I also resonate strongly with what you said: I don't feel masculine or feminine, either.
Tl;DR: I appreciate your input! I've already spent a number of years open to the possibility that I'm trans, and I just don't think that's me.

I read that, too, and I appreciate the knowledge. During my reading, I saw people talk about this and cite euphoria as an alternative indicator. I experience tinges of euphoria when I imagine myself as a woman, but only sometimes. It's like I have to be in the right (or wrong, I guess?) mindset. For instance, last night I was trying to imagine it, and I didn't feel much of anything.

For me personally, I think wishing a circumstance of my birth had been different is not the same as being trans, if that makes sense. Like, I would have appreciated being born to millionaire parents, right, but that doesn't mean I want to replace my actual parents. Similarly, I would have appreciated being born female, but I'm comfortable in my body.
Sure, of course. I acknowledge this as well, that gender doesn't have to be rigid.

I just mentioned this in a different reply, but this was as much a fact finding mission as it was a personal vent lol. I think I had my first gender crisis last night, and I just wanted to put some of my thoughts into words, as well as find out what NB means. I appreciate your input. Thank you for taking the time to respond :)

I know there's been bad news recently (when has there not?) so I figured I would let you know that my home state of Illinois is one signature away from a bill that will massively improve experiences with changing one's legal gender.	"It's called Illinois House Bill 9.

Nonbinary Blues	"Tonight, like a lot of nights recently, has been very hard for me. And it's one if those evenings where I wish I could just be . . . Normal. Cidgendered, straight, typical. Especially with this wave of anti trans bills in my country and the lack of support I've had from my cis-straight spouse, I feel very, very low. Everything is harder when you are trans. It's a joyous thing to know who you really are, and it an awful fate to have to endure the consequences of being invisible, or visible to the exact wrong people. Romance, body image issues, staying in the closet, coming out of the closet to underwhelming or bad results, jobs, friendships, where you can travel, what shop you can get your hair cut in, pronouns: it's all so much more complicated now and painful now.
But when I thought I was cis I can't say that I was happy either.
Really it's all just one big mess navigating all of these things in my daily life, and the loneliness gets to me. I know exactly what I want my life to be like, and know who and what I am, who and what I want to become (regardless of what SOME people may say). But the journey seems impossible. It's an insurmountable task. It's an arduous process with little results. And sometimes I just want to delete myself. Game over.
I said I wanted to be normal as the straights define it, but I'm never going to be that. I'll never be what they want me to be, and I can't go back. Hell, I'm not even neurotypical. I'm mentally ill as fuck. None of that's gonna change for me. And I don't want to change -not for myself.
And so I'm laying here venting on my couch at 2am, listening to Transgender blues and feeling unlovable.
I dunno, this all sounds really dramatic, but I'm a writer and naturally flamboyant so this is just how I express things I guess.
Everything hurts all the same.
Well. That's the end my rant. It does feel therapeutic to get it out somewhere atleast. I know I'll make it through.
 Thanks for listening."	"Maybe it makes you feel a little bit better to know that I feel exactly the same way you do, and I couldn’t have put it into words better.

The only thing I can add is… try to be thankful for at least knowing what is going on with you. I have wasted decades thinking I could somehow make myself feel ok with my assigned gender. But I never recognized it for what it is until recently.
I may be young, but I learned that being different can be very dangerous...i myself have to carefully chose who I tell what I am, how I am different or when I can even allow myself to reveil what I am. If I'm not careful I could end up in a ditch, attacked for being different...what helped me was to surround me with people that didn't care I was different, that allowed me to be who I wanted to be and loved me for it.

Sometimes I cry myself to sleep still, frustrated I will never truly be safe being different, but I have accepted it and I use every oportunity to show my true colors.

I'm certain there will be somebody you can rely on that doesn't matter in what way you are different, that you will find a place you belong and don't have to worry about your differences...I believe in you, it'll get better :)
I know what you mean. Being both trans and mentally ill and neurodivergent just adds so many extra stressors to life, but it really is worth it to be your true self once you’re in a good environment for it. You can make it through, im wishing you the best 💛

[ask] I'm an older person navigating gender things. I'm not out. What the heck do I do with these pronouns?	"I don't know if this is the right place, and I'm an anxiety riddled human on the best of days.  


So, hi. I feel like I may fit somewhere into the non-binary side of life, though most specifically I feel like I'm in a gender fluid category. The term demi-girl/demi-woman has made the most sense to me, but unfortunately it's not a widely known or understood term and I've had people be very critical of the classification, so I struggle to say it out loud. I'm afab and to some degree feel rooted in that, but I have full on periods of time where I feel like it doesn't fit quite right, and I get pretty notable gender dysphoria in women's spaces (but that said, I don't feel comfortable in men's spaces, I'm just not a masc person really). I feel solidarity with women, and yet, I feel like I don't fully fit the bill. Like some days it's fine, but so much of the time I feel like I'm in a woman-shaped suit and just going through the motions. I sometimes get a bit dysphoric about my body too, like I don't feel like it's womanly enough to be a real woman... but generally, I like and cherish my body. In the last year maybe, when people ask for my pronouns, I truthfully say that I mostly use she/her, but I also use they/them. I'm still MOST comfortable with she/her, but it feels strange to admit that, because I almost feel like I'm not actually gender dysphoric if I prefer those pronouns. I like they/them as well, and they do fit, they just don't fit quite as well. I don't know. I apologize if this is word vomit. I'm able to articulate so many things about myself and my life, but this has existed for as long as I can remember, longer than I even had words to describe it with, and I still fumble horribly.  


Part of me has just stomached all this for years, specifically because of the pronoun thing. When people refer to me as she/her, it's totally fine! When they call me a woman or girl or any other feminine-noun, it's also fine I guess, but these things aren't specifically 'right' so much as they're not wrong. They/them doesn't necessarily fit better, but sometimes, some days, maybe even in just some specific sentences, I need it for myself. But I feel incredible GUILT, because I'm just here passing through life as female, and it's not incorrect but it's also not the full story.  


I guess if I can boil this down, do any other enby/genderqueer/flux/fluid people still default to she pronouns? Am I just trying to classify myself as something that I'm not, and is that harmful to other non-binary people?  


I really hope I'm not off base by asking all this. I don't really have people in my life who I know how to talk to these things about."	"I'm certainly not a professional by any means, but from my own experience and research, this definitely sounds like gender dysphoria and you are completely valid. Some people will try to gatekeep but I'm here to tell you, you can use any pronouns that you feel the most comfortable with and you are still valid, regardless of how you define (nonbinary, demi, trans, gender fluid..). Do what feels right and comfy to you and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

If you don't feel completely like a woman then you don't feel completely like a woman. It can be a long journey figuring out what that means as everyone's experience is unique but I commend you on writing about it and doing some soul searching.
Sounds fairly demigirlesque to me. I mod a sub called r/demigirl_irl, if you would like to check it out please do, you can use us all as a sounding board and maybe get a bit closer to getting a firmer hold on things? Or not if you don't feel ready of course, but you'd be very welcome. Or you can always chat to me, what you've said is very familiar."	h16xb6	NonBinary	11	1.0	2020-06-11 20:08:02
AZ Bill for Non-binary Driver's Licenses Died Without Being Considered	"For the second year in a row, the Arizona legislature introduced a bill that would grant non-binary driver's licenses. This year, the Speaker of the House wouldn't even give it a First Read, so [it died](https://www.undeniableruth.com/2019/02/26/my-bill-died/) without having a chance to be considered. 

It's so frustrating when people in power are closed-minded. When the government doesn't acknowledge that we exist, it says we don't deserve the same rights and acknowledgement as everyone else. 

We're still making progress. So far, 6 states will issue non-binary driver's licenses (including Arkansas of all places!) and it looks like another 4 could join the ranks later this year.

I'm taking my 5 minutes to figuratively cry in the corner, and then the fight continues. As someone who has a non-binary birth certificate, I feel I have an obligation to use it to raise awareness. We exist!"	"Which states will issue NB licenses?
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, and Oregon.

Washington D.C. does too.

New Jersey, New York, Utah, and Washington have each issued at least one NB driver's license.

Ugh	I'm tired, I finally came out and I'm super happy. Im just so tired, keeping my mental and physical has proven to be harder than it looked. I'm broke, my house is broke, and I'm working myself to the bone trying to keep my head above water. Being an enby makes me a Target or people all over my small town and nobody will hire me. I'm trying to focus on school (I'm in highschool) keep my relationship going strong, and pay the bills and not starve me or my animals. I only just turned 18 and I'm already hating adulthood.

This is a thing that happened to me about 4 years ago now. I think it’s a pretty funny story, so why not post it here? Just for context, all of this happened before I identified as LGBT+, but I knew the terms and was supportive of the community. I was also born female (becomes relevant later).  

There was this girl who used to live in my neighborhood, and she and my sister were in the same grade, so naturally they became good friends (our moms became friends too). I’m a year above the both of them, so while not particularly close, I still hung out with the girl. I never really liked her, but because she lived really close and my mom was friends with the girl’s mom, I was forced to hang out with her a lot. 
The girl and I got into arguments a lot (mainly because we were both stubborn little brats). The girl also grew up in a very Christian home. Her dad played piano in the church band and once they took my sister and I to an anti-abortion rally. Naturally, this girl is now very homophobic and transphobic due to her upbringing. (Example: she loves Panic! At The Disco, but refuses to listen to Girls/Girls/Boys because it’s pro-LGBT+.)
Anyways, one day my sister and I were over at her house playing a tabletop game called “The Game of Life.” The girl, my sister, the girl’s brother, and I were playing. (Explication of game at the end of this post!) The game pieces are shaped like tiny cars and they have slots for you to place blue or pink pegs in. The pegs are colored that way because they’re supposed to represent the genders of who is in the car, however, the colors of the pegs are more of a novelty, and don’t impact the game at all. 
To start, everyone has to put a peg in their car that represents them. Ever since the age of 7, I’ve had issues with the color pink, so I put a blue peg in the car. When the girl realized what I had done she began screaming at me, saying that I was playing the game wrong, and I had to be pink because I was a girl. She claimed that I would forever be known as transgender in that game because I didn’t like pink. (Btw, my sister and the girl’s brother didn’t care what color I was, they just wanted to play.) I don’t remember if I changed colors or not, I just remember being both very angry and confused. I wanted to get back at her, but her brother beat me to it.

The girl’s brother is about three or four years younger than her (five or six younger than me), and they can’t get along with each other for more than an hour. Therefore, our mutual hatred for the girl meant that her brother and I are good friends despite the huge age gap. 

Anyways, back to the game.
There are some events in The Game of Life that you can’t skip over, and one of them is getting married. To get back at the girl for yelling at me, her brother (who was in second grade at the time), placed a second blue peg in his car, claiming that he was in a gay relationship. This made the girl frecking explode. She ran to her mom to tattle that her brother married a guy in the board game. Her mom was just annoyed by the girl’s behavior though and brushed it off. 

To my knowledge, the brother never got in trouble for doing that, and I’m glad he didn’t. 

This memory still brings me joy for two reasons:
1) A homophobe called me out for being trans, long before I knew I was.
2) A homophobic, transphobic, most-likely-to-become-a-Karen, girl got got by a second grader who just barely knew what bearing gay meant. 


What is this game I mentioned:
For those of you who don’t know what The Game of Life is, you spin a spinner to move forward; the goal is to get to a retirement home and have as much money as possible. You land on various life events (such as a tree falling on your house, having a child, getting married, etc.). Some events force you to pay or earn money, but you also have to pay bills and can even invest in the stock market. Also some events like getting married are unskipable. Overall though, it’s a pretty fun family game. 

TL;DR
I chose to be a blue game piece instead of a pink one, and this girl flips out. Her younger brother then got gay married in the game in order to get back at her.

Some mussings	"So I've been watching this sub for a few days and it's prompted some random thoughts. Hopefully getting them off my chest will help a bit.

First off, I was AMAB and I'm old compared to a lot of the people posting here. I'm 35 and, while that feels like a lifetime apart, it's amazing to see people in their teens thinking about these things. I only learnt what nonbinary was in my early 30s, only came out to myself at 32 and to my parents a few weeks ago. It was hugely damaging to me not knowing why I felt the way I did and it's wonderful to know that other people won't have to grow up in that same world.

I recently changed my name - I now go by Dorian Crane after years of \*hating\* my previous name. It's taking a while for people to get used to it (but that's fine, they are trying and that's all that matters). I'm lucky to live in a liberal enclave and have lots of trans friends, so I'm not doing anything unusual in my circle - we are aggressively queer and it's wonderful. Again, I didn't have that growing up and until I found it I didn't know how much I needed it.

My parents have been.... mixed. My dad was amazing, when I emailed him his reply was perfect and made me cry a lot. My mum less so. She objects to singular they, she doesn't understand why I'd want to make a fuss about it and I think she's taken my name change pretty badly. Luckily they live several hours away and I don't really see them very often. And my sisters, who are the best, have adopted the cause of winning her round. She I guess I'm pretty lucky as far as it goes - while my mum hasn't been the best, she's trying and isn't a huge factor in my life (I've never been close to my parents).

Another thing that it took me a long time to come to terms with is  that I started losing my hair in my late twenties. It used to be shoulder length, then I cut it short to avoid looking like Bill Bailey, then over the summer started shaving it off entirely. It's hard to explain why it bothered me so much - it gave me massive dysmorphia because balding is such a male coded experience and I hated that I couldn't go anything about it. Luckily bald heads can be really queer coded and I have a head shape that suits it. I'm going to try and attach a photo to this - probably as a comment? I'm new to Reddit and still figuring it out.

I'm not sure where I'm going with a lot of this. Mostly that I'm old and I'm still very confused by all of this but I'm brute forcing my way through it. I wouldn't have had the confidence to do this a few years ago but getting out of a horribly toxic relationship and into a new friendship circle of hella queer folks helped massively. I'd like to be able to help other people with this journey but don't really know how - any suggestions on how to get into activism online would be much appreciated.

Just... look after each other and try not to spend decades not being yourselves I guess. Don't be like me.

You are not alone in not being a teenager; I'm 32 and going through the process of coming out, and one of my partners is also NB and they came out last year, they're 31.
Here is another maturing one, 48yo now, afab. I only figured the appropriate term nb about 3 yrs ago. Came out to a few friends who are the closest. I don't feel the need to change anything more than that, but it is reflected in the choice of a partner. All is well 😁👍
I don't know much about on line activism, more about face to face 😁
That's good to know. It feels quite lonely sometimes, especially as the typical image of an NB person isn't something I've ever looked like."	f8d5jc	NonBinary	8	1.0	2020-02-23 18:07:42
Iowans, we need to do something.	Today I learned governor of Iowa Kim Reynolds is considering a bill to remove trans people from any sort or protection. House Bill 2164 would make it legal to fire people, deny housing, etc. for simply being trans. We need to stop this. We need to contact her and say trans people deserve the same human rights as anyone. Her number can be found through Google. I'm not sure what I'd do, as I'd definitely lose my job if it became legal to fire me for my identity. I have friends who'd be unable to find a place to live. I'm hoping if enough of us call, maybe she'll at least consider not supporting it. I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, I didn't see anything in the rules against it, but we'll see. I figured if there's anywhere to search for support in fighting this injustice, it would be Reddit.		evs7lp	NonBinary	8	1.0	2020-01-29 19:59:32
How to help someone with learning difficulties learn they/them pronouns?	"Hey frands, I am writing with a somewhat stressful and serious issue.

Recently, my friends (without getting into specifics, we are part of a relatively close-knit and vulnerable community within the broader LGBTQ/trans and non-binary community) and I have made friends with a binary trans woman. I do not claim to know her entire history; however, she has had a lot of difficulty comprehending and using common concepts/practices within our community like sensitivity to trauma and triggers, stating our boundaries, asking not assuming, etc. that goes *far* beyond just being new to a space where these are the norm. She is also more or less completely oblivious when myself and others, either verbally or non-verbally, indicate that we are uncomfortable with her behaviour.

Among one of the things we are struggling to help our new friend with is they/them pronouns. We've tried correcting her, we've tried modelling by example, we've had a friend who used to do gender workshops in schools take her aside and amicably yet thoroughly explain what they/them pronouns signify and how to use them in terms intended for a cisgender middle school audience. Each time she either blows right past the correction or sort of brushes it off.

e.g.  
**Her:** ""So I asked Bill if I could come see him.""  
**Us:** ""Oh hey, [name], do you remember how we explained what they/them pronouns are?""  
**Her:** (*unhesitatingly*) ""Yeah!""  
**Us:** ""Bill uses they/them instead of he/him, because Bill doesn't identify as male or female but as non-binary.""  
**Her:** ""Yeah, I know. That's why I just said his name, Bill. I asked if I could see him--""  
**Us:** ""So instead of 'if I could see him,' we say 'if I could see them.'""  
**Her:** ""Yeah, that's what I said. So I asked him...""

I truly want to be sensitive to the fact that my friend clearly has some barrier to learning they/them pronouns and that she means no harm, but on the same token, she is consistently misgendering most of the people in our circle (and gendering them by their gender assigned at birth - e.g. defaulting to he/him for femme AMAB non-binary folks, even though she herself is transfemme and uses she/her), and no matter how we try, she apparently cannot understand that she is doing anything wrong.

It is getting to the point where I find it stressful and dysphoric to be around her or even to know that she is talking about me, and I know I'm not the only one who feels that way. I don't want to drop her as a friend over this, but I also don't want to hang around someone who can't or won't respect my/my friends' needs around pronouns. Is there anything else I can do to help her learn and use they/them consistently?"	"I'm really generalizing here, I know it's not across the board but from my experience, sometimes binary transfolks are worse than cis people when it comes to understanding trans experiences that don't look like their own. 

I don't have any advice per se, just that after having been as patient as y'all have seemed to be, I'd probably start to get very stern and eventually I'd lose my shit on that person. At a certain point it's just not worth it anymore, yaknow? Do what you can and if that doesn't work, ya might have to cut your losses. 

I hope others give better advice and that your friend figures it out soon.
Since she's trans herself, what's her understanding of these concepts like as they apply to herself? Maybe you can help her understand by extrapolating from that. Like, ""you wouldn't like being misgendered, right? Neither do we!""

That sounds like a really difficult situation though. Good luck resolving it.

Hey, thanks for your response. Part of the sort of common courtesy of our community is that we try really hard to refrain from ""losing our shit"" unless it is truly warranted, and I feel bad being stern with her because again, she clearly neither intends nor recognizes any wrongdoing. You're probably right though - there comes a point where I'm gonna have to be more assertive for my own well-being. :/
Good idea. Maybe I'll wait for a time when I can sensitively open up that conversation (over coffee or something?) and try that route. Thanks!"	98974s	NonBinary	7	0.89	2018-08-18 04:59:20
They spelled my legal/deadname wrong on medical stuff	"Ugh. I had to call to get the spelling of my deadname changed on my medical stuff for billing and records purposes. At least it was relatively painless but I hate having to do that. Of course, everyone has always spelled it wrong anyway. :/ Fun... I actually did just get it changed and without it effecting my proper name on my charts but I still feel like I shouldn't have had to because they even made a copy of my id which has the name I don't go by on it.

Everyone tends to spell it wrong though. I've lost track of how many times I've had to correct the spelling over my near 31 years of life. People always wanna spell it with a z. It's especially annoying since it's not even what my real name is just the one I was given. I should probably go forward with the legal change tbh."		9rryhd	NonBinary	6	0.88	2018-10-27 05:34:20
Top surgery without coming out to family?	"hi folks! so, exciting news, I’ve been approved for top surgery (ok technically it’s getting billed as a radical reduction but who cares). I’m navigating how to tell my friends and get time off from work, but one thing I’m still stuck on is how to tell my family. Right now my gender presentation is def more on the side of “tomboy” for convenience/comfort, but top surgery will be a pretty drastic change to my appearance. I’m not out to my family at all, and am generally low contact/information diet with them. 

here’s kind of what I’m struggling with in terms of whether I should come out to my family about my identity and getting top surgery:

PROS:
- don’t have to figure out a lie about why my chest has suddenly disappeared 
- gives them the opportunity to be emergency contacts for the surgeon in case something were to go wrong
- there’s a small possibility they will be supportive, and may want to help me out with recovery, which would lessen the burden on my partner

CONS:
- they will probably not be supportive and will try to talk me out of it
- general “but you’re our little girl” dysphoria inducing comments
- have to do the work of explaining gender to them, likely a bunch of times
- tiny possibility they will do something drastic like show up at my house to try and prevent me from getting surgery


so yeah, would love advice from folks in a similar situation to me — did you tell your fam before or after? how did you get around the obvious physical change? was it generally a good experience? thanks so much in advance for your time and emotional energy, it means a lot ❤️"	"From my experience, which may be totally different, its easier to explain post ok as the new you they have to accept. You don't need their permission, and if an emergency does happen then they can find out that way :p
I have a family Im low contact with because they are toxic and phobic. They will not know about my identity or chest until its all removed and too late to go back. And thats if one day I go to a reunion and my flat chest is apparent and forces conversation. The burden is entirely on my partner and I and Ive accepted this.
As the saying goes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. If there's any chance they may try to talk you out of it or shame you, save it for after you've recovered. You have enough to deal with right now and don't need additional stress on top of your recovery.
If it's being billed as a radical reduction, could you present it as that to them?
Agreed. Seems like it isn't worth it to me. If you need any additional support maybe reach out to good friends. Organize a [meal train](https://www.mealtrain.com/) for food. Outsource some care, does your insurance (assuming US) cover any kind of in-home nursing? Give them a ring and ask. Some insurances also cover so many days of meal delivery. Hire a maid service to do some of the cleaning if that's in your budget, or ask friends for help if it's not. There are resources out there so you don't overburden your partner if that's your concern."	fcnblf	NonBinary	7	1.0	2020-03-03 02:02:49

Using a new name at a new job help?	"I'm working on becoming an Apprentice Plumber, and at the aptitude test next week I'll get a chance to meet the other Hopefuls and maybe some of the Union people.

I'm kinda thinking play it off as a nickname, like Bill or Will for William or D-ck for Richard since the first initial is the same. But I've usually gone by my legal name & I'm worried I'll be wierd about it or something.

Gender questioning and thankful for this space!	Hi all! I am about 2 months into my gender questioning journey and am currently working on my own preconceived notions about what a non-binary person is “supposed to” look/be/sound like. I am so thankful for the badass-ery of all of your posts and am learning so much about myself through them. I’m afraid of revealing my they/them pronouns in my social circles, especially since I am femme and am worried I don’t “fit the bill”, but y’all give me so much joy and hope and courage! Just wanted to give a little thanks!	"Thats amazing! I hope you know that how you look doesn't have to reflect your gender identity \^\^ <3

&#x200B;

If you are non binary; then you are non binary! no matter what you wear, no matter the day of the week, or what you ate for breakfast haha. Your identity is your identity and youre well within your rights to ask to be referred to as your correct pronouns, or want a new name etc!! xx

&#x200B;

Im nb amab... but personally I wear all fem clothes/make up etc because it helps with the dysphoria, but on the days were I just roll out of bed and chuck on a hoodie and jeans I dont let that change anything!
Thank you for this!! I am working on letting this truth seep down into my bones, and this was so so helpful to hear. Thank you for the encouragement and wisdom!
No problem beautiful! hope you feel a little better about it all soon xxx \^\^"	lbos8q	NonBinary	6	1.0	2021-02-03 14:33:38
Educational books for cis family members, including kids?	"Crossposting to /r/asktransgender and /r/TransyTalk 

So, I'm not attending my family's Christmas celebration this year due to several family members expressing discomfort with my refusal to present exclusively masculine.  I came out to them around this time last year and wore a nice dress to the gathering and everyone seemed fine with it then.  Over time it seems that the realization this isn't a phase is setting in, especially since I've started HRT, and since I've grown confident in wearing silicone breastforms a lot of the time.

I'd like to put together an educational package for them with a handful of books that will help my conservative Christian family understand what I'm going through, how to cope with the shattering of their world views, how to be a good ally, etc.  The target audience here would include adult cis males and females in their 30s and 60s, cis male and female children in early adolescence, and one cis female kid around 7-10.  

This package will also include a card explaining that I love them and want to be comfortable around them and want them to be comfortable around me, and that hopefully the contents of the package will be a start towards that goal.  My one sister so far has been very supportive and eager to learn and understand throughout all this, so I'll designate her to deliver the package.

Does anyone have any recommendations on books that would be good to include?  I'm looking on Amazon right now and see some that might fit the bill, but it would be nice to hear from anyone else who has given books to family members for a similar reason.

TL;DR:  Got any book recommendations for gifting to Christian conservative family members (adults and children) to broaden their understanding of gender?

**Update:**  I went ahead and ordered several copies of a bunch of books and PFLAG publications.  I'll be arranging them into 3 individual boxes for each household, with cash hidden in the pages.  These 3 boxes will be wrapped and then placed into a larger wrapped box filled with candy and other little gifts.  At the very top, first thing they see after opening the main box, will be an envelope with a label instructing to read before opening the other boxes.  The envelope will contain the card I mentioned before with my personal message/letter, and at the end of it I'll mention that there's X amount of cash per person hidden throughout the pages of the books.  That way they have to at least pick them up and flip through the pages, and maybe something will catch their eye even if they weren't planning to read any of it.

Anyone else find it hard to come out, even when you know the person will be accepting of you?	"My partner is enby, and they've told me in the past that they don't care what my gender is and that they love me for me. I know *for a fact* that they will still want to be with me when I tell them, but why is it so hard to just tell them? My partner is the most accepting person I've ever met, and we're together for the long haul.

My partner coming out to me actually kind of kick started my realization that I might be non-binary too. Like, I wanted to understand what it's like after they came out to me, so I went online and started reading about it and watching videos by other enbies explaining how they knew they were enby. It was like ""Haha, that's kind of funny, I've experienced that feeling too... And that one... And that one... And that one... Ah shit.""

I don't know. Some days I feel more or less like a man. But then on other days, I don't really feel like anything. I know I'm not a trans woman, but I don't think I'm entirely a man either. A lot of the time, I just feel like a human consciousness crammed into a meat suit against my will that just happens to have a dick. I *want* my partner to know, but I can't find the words. I keep trying to tell them in person, but I always get too nervous. Not because I'm scared of how they'll react, but like saying it out loud makes it real. But at the same time, I want to come out in general. I want my partner to be the first person I tell, then I want to tell my friends (who I know also won't give a shit about my gender either), then I want to change my email signature at work to say ""he/they"" at the end. I want to paint my nails and wear skirts to work, but my parents would see when I pick up my dog after work, and they definitely aren't accepting. It is what it is though. I'm an adult. I don't live with them. I pay my own rent and my own bills. What can they do? Ground me?"	"[deleted]
Why won't you read or show this to your partner? This is perfectly understandable explanation of your situation. You don't have to be ""ready"" or fully figure out your gender when you talk about it to close and trusted people. Your gender already is as real as you are and your partner can support you to find the next steps in your process.
That's a good idea! My partner is really into makeup, so maybe I'll ask if they can do mine"	wlgr96	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-08-11 03:08:07
Nervous about new job, gendering and all that nonsense	"(agender AFAB on HRT-T 12mos, they/it pronouns, 26y.o.

welp, i reenter the general public next tuesday. I quit my job at a bank a few months back to get my mental health right, and ive been living just going to school online and working just enough work study hours (generally just backroom filing work) to pay my bills and eat.

I start working graveyard at a local 7/11 tuesday night and Im... nervous, to say the least. I just passed my year anniversary on T and that sparked a little reminder I set that ""allowed"" me to really check my progress. Ive changed a LOT and I fucking LOVE IT.... so I really hate how nervous my ""obvious trans-ness"" makes me feel about interacting with the general public. I have facial hair now (which I love!), and my voice is still figuring itself out in a very PUBESCENT way.

I live in the Pacific NW, so it IS fairly liberal but I mean... we do be livin in a society :/ I already got prodded by my hiring manager; she was trying to be subtle about it, she might even say friendly, but... idk, the weird combo of odd phrasing, her tone, and the long pauses she would leave after I would answer her weird questions e.g. ""Oh, you have such a unique name, are there *other women* in your family with the name, or???""
and like, i leave my house often enough for groceries or whatnot to have still encountered more than a few people who's ""curious attention"" turns up a little more in aggressiveness or intensity.

I would very much like to be a constantly blurry figure in the vague shape of a humanoid. I would rather just be a physical manifestation of the concept ""midnight snack cravings"". I wish I was a tree.
I do not want to be referred to. F in the chat for my mental stability, Im gonna need it."	"F

Anyone have experience with getting non binary top surgery covered by insurance in New York?	"Hi all,

My insurance company (Empire Blue Cross) does cover transgender surgeries if your surgeon is in network.  Pre auth is required and must include why the surgery is medically necessary.  I guess there are many different ways you can deem this kind of surgery to be medically necessary.  New York state also mandates that insurance cover transgender surgeries.

Since I'm not FtM, I'm not sure how this is going to play out.  I've met with the surgeon about the procedure and his billing specialist who will call insurance once I get my letter from my therapist.  

I didn't know if anyone has had experience with this or has had top surgery covered by insurance being a transmasculine/gender nonconforming person.  Any insight/advice is appreciated."	"Im in NY and got mine covered by insurance. I never told the therapist I saw either way, not that I was nonbinary NOR that I was a binary guy. I just talked about gender dysphoria and how long I’ve been on T. She just wrote the letter as if I was binary; not sure if it was assumptions or what.  I do use he/him pronouns though.

 If you don’t want to do T and use they/them, I think it should be fine if you use an experienced therapist who can just specify your gender dysphoria diagnosis, social transition, and maybe not use pronouns for you. 

WPATH says people should be able to have top surgery to their target gender without hormones, so surgeons should be fine and hopefully insurance will be too. You can call your insurance and have them send you the specific part of your specific policy that covers gender affirming care and make sure your letter or letters hit all the required points. 
I have no insight, but I have blue choice option (the low-income version of blue Cross) and am curious about the same thing for down the road a bit. Thanks for asking, looking forward to reading responses.
My partner is still identifies as female (occasionally toys with non-binary), and is getting top surgery next month covered by insurance. She met with a therapist, who focused more on the gender dysphoria, that she has been binding for years and it was covered by Blue Cross.
She is not on T and uses she/her pronouns.
Her surgeon also had suggestions about what should be included in the letter. Since they deal with insurance all the time it's worth asking them.
Thank you!  That's what I'm hoping for too that if I cross all my T's in terms of documentation and really emphasis what the WPATH standards say, they should have no issues denying it.  My next plan is to call the pre-authorization line myself to ask basically what do you need and what should this letter say so it doesn't get denied?  Did you send anything else to insurance besides a letter from a therapist?  I don't have a primary care doctor and don't plan on using T.  I really appreciate your insight!
Hey there, I'm also looking forward to and hoping (fingers-crossed) that others share their experience.  It just gets so tricky navigating the mess that insurance can be.
Thanks for contributing to this post!  I am actually 5 weeks post op now :) - I'm hoping other NB/trans folk looking for surgery see this.  I also have Blue Cross and just needed to edit my letter.  Best of luck with her surgery!  It feels amazing!
You should not try to send your letter to your insurance or get pre-authorization yourself.  The surgeon you decide on will send in your letter and get the preauthorization.  The insurance company will want to get this from the providing doctor (surgeon) with appropriate codes and cost estimates.  My surgeon did this and it didn't take that long.  

You really should just try to get your insurance company to mail/email you your written policy.  The section on transgender coverage will specify, generally in great detail, what is required for coverage.  Getting this in written form is probably easiest.
I also have Empire BCBS and am wondering how you edited your letter? I don't want to be on HRT but I do want to be completely flat chested. I feel like I'm being put into a box I didn't ask to be in with all their requirements.
Thank you so much for the information!
I do want to add that this was almost over 4 years ago now and I'm sure the [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/) Standards of Care have changed since then, and most likely for the better - meaning making it more easier and less rigid for those seeking trans-related healthcare.

At the time that I got top surgery,  I was not on T, had no plans to be on T was still sort of figuring out my gender and just knew that most of my dysphoria came from my chest.

The WPATH Standards of Care is what influences the policies and procedures that the insurance companies use to determine whether or not they'll cover hormones, top surgery, etc.  At the time, Empire BCBS was very specific with the language that needed to be in my letter from my therapist recommending me for top surgery.  Like for example, I think my therapist wrote I had been out as nonbinary for 2 years (I wasn't lol) I just said I was - but Empire BCBS needed it to specifically say I had been living in my preferred gender as non-binary/transmasculine for 2 years and needed a date I think.

So, there were a couple examples of the like above just about needing to tweak language for them to cover the surgery.  It was dumb and tedious - but easy to fix enough and my therapist was very much on board and editing it to make it say what it needed to.

As I was saying above, I think now things are a little more relaxed, especially to include nonbinary people so ideally there should be less obstacles for you.  You can usually google your insurance name and then top surgery to review the procedure/policy and what you would need exactly for them to approve it.  

\*Edited to add that it does also depend on what state you're in."	8bj80v	NonBinary	5	0.86	2018-04-11 18:09:32
Advice on how to come out to family?	"Hi everyone! I could really use some advice on some of the things I've been struggling with lately, namely finishing my transition with a name change!

I'm 23, afab, don't really label myself beyond 'queer' and I'm finally getting into the last stretches of my transition. Earlier this year I had my long awaited breast reduction, which was the only gender affirmation surgery I wanted. I still had to do it under the guise of being a cis woman with disproportionate and irregular chest size, but was lucky in that regard to have one breast be so much bigger than the other that I was eligible for it to be covered by insurance, although I'm still fighting them for them to actually cover my bill. Insurances, am I right?

So now the last thing that is left for me to do is to change my legal name to Luka, which is unisex in my language, so I can change it for the 'small' fee of only about 600€ without having to go through the tedious process of going to a gender clinic that then won't take me seriously because nonbinary identities are SO underrepresented here. Plus, I don't really have body dysphoria, so yeah... impossible. So unisex name and privately paid name change is the only way to go for me, and I'm happy with that.

Now to my real problem. My family is blissfully unaware of my gender, or my name change. They are fundamentalist Christians and would not understand my struggle with gender. I have managed to at least get them to acknowledge intersex bodies, but that's because they can't really argue against biological reality. I'm not worried about them kicking me out or anything, I moved out when I was 19 and am completely financially independent. BUT I have two sisters (12 and 9) who are very important to me. I know that after my name change, I will have to explain it to my family, but I don't know how to do it in a way that will make them accept my decision. I'm not even talking about coming out to them, I will not come out until my sisters are in their teens and able to make their own decisions about accepting me, without being brainwashed by my parents.

Amy advice on how to break the news of my name change to my family in a way that will not make them try and turn my siblings against me is very welcome!

Thank you all for reading!"	"A letter is a great opportunity for you to get everything you need to out in the open, and the recipient isn't on the spot trying to figure out how they feel about it and how to react to you. You can include things like:

- Talk about how they've said they'll always love you no matter what
- Frame it as telling them something wonderful you've learned about yourself that you want to share with them
- Describe who you are using simple terminology, defining any necessary terms
- Explain how you wish to be addressed
- Remind them that you're still the same person you always have been and you'll love them just like you always have
- Offer to provide additional information or answer questions, but avoid overwhelming them by including everything you can think of
Thanks! I'm not planning on coming out to them in regard to my gender, so I don't think there'll be much to explain or share there. I'm just unsure how to break the news that I 'rejected the name they gave me' and switched to the unisex version of the masc name they planned to give amab me.

I tested the waters already with my siblings and they seem very open to just switching what name they use, I'm just worried my parents will tell them that names are fixed or some other bs.

I haven't cared about a good relationship with my parents ever since I moved out beyond what is needed to keep in touch with my sisters until I can be open about my identity with them.

Besides, I already did the worst thing imaginable in my parents eyes, and that was leaving the church and being vocal about it."	nvdn31	NonBinary	5	0.86	2021-06-08 20:31:31

If you could shapeshift into any ONE thing, what would it be? Why and what would you do as that one thing?	Ill go first! I would choose to shapeshift into a Bill Cipher form. I wouldnt even want any crazy powers as long as i could float around and glow. I would honestly just sit in a dark room with nothing but myself as a light source for hours on end	"A dragon, because I wanna live for centuries, have a hoard of gold, be able to breathe fire, fly, and be covered in beautiful shining scales.

Or, how I see myself in my head, so (if all goes to plan), me in a few years after I get HRT
If it could only be one thing then I would pick a shapeshifting being that could shapeshift into anything 😊 haxx
I would keep my shapeshift in reserve and go on hormones for the next year. If I didn't like the result, I'd shapeshift back into my original pre-HRT form (maybe with a few cool extras like solid platinum tips to my fingernails and healthier lungs and joints). And if I wanted to keep the effects of HRT, I'd have in reserve the ability to heal from a mortal wound or reverse decades of my own aging for when I eventually needed one of those.
I would love to be a big winged panther. A cat who can fly, perfection!
Probably a wolf with wings. I like wolves, but I also think it'd be cool to fly.

If nonhuman entities are not an option, I'd choose to look how I envision myself in my head. So, muscular, AFAB, with no chesticles, lol. Short hair, too.
Being a giant frog would be sick, or the new ooze race in d&d that I can't remember the name of.
A fantasy owl with healing powers
Dragon. Shiny, fire-breathing, flying, and powerful. Also, completely genderless. Everyone loves dragons.
I'd morph into a creature that can shapeshift every day. Easy.
Logically speaking, I would turn into a very good looking girl ,Precisly My Best Friends Crush, then,i would go to his house late at midnight,i think you can guess where this is going...  
then when hes about to blow it, i turn back into myself and act like i dont know where i am and what is happening, Leaving him completely dumbfounded,and also kinda Gay.

I Think I Might Non-Binary?	I’m 16M (going on 17 in the next weeks). For the most part, my family (mostly women) would refer to me as the “man of the house” and as a “man”, I should pay bills, playing girls hearts, be manly, etc. Idk the terms “boy” or “man” never really sat right with me. I feel disgusted when I call myself a man or if I’m being compared with other boys about subjects (especially strength). I know that I’m not a girl nor a woman because I like my male parts. I’m kinda tired of it but my family is quite homophobic and transphobic. So yeah, idk if I’m non binary. I feel comfortable with he/him pronouns but I’m not comfortable being called a man, boy, girl, or woman. I’m just..me yk? Idk if that’s ok, or?	"That's a perfectly valid way to be. If you think that non-binary will adequately describe that experience, you're free to use it. It's up to you to decide if it's accurate or not.
Absolutely! For one thing, gender ≠ pronouns, but also... it sound's like you're in a situation where you don't really have the space to explore who you really are because of the pressures put on you to conform. Hopefully you'll have that opportunity soon to be able to hear your own voice, because whoever it is in there, they're worth it!

Saving Up For Top Surgery. Any Tips?	"I've (18 y/o transmasc.) finally gotten to a place where I can start saving up for top surgery. My goal is to get it done in 2022 no matter what. At the moment, with a combination of benefits and a part-time job I'll make just over £8k a year, which isn't much at all considering I've got bills to pay and I have to take care of myself as I live alone with no support. 


My plan is to get the surgery done in Poland (if covid permits by next year). I'll need £3500-£4000 for the trip. At the moment I have about £450 saved, and I want to put most of my paycheck away. Later on in the year I'll have more money to put aside, but any tips to sticking to that plan on a low income?"	"Check out r/personalfinance, r/UKpersonalfinance, and r/povertyfinance. Mention that you’re in the UK, and the other financial details here. If you don’t want to share what you’re saving for, just how much, that’s fine too. r/personalfinance has a bunch of info in the community info / wiki, including how to save for big goals, and a flowchart on how to prioritize spending. 

Meanwhile, are you living at home, or does this income also have to go to living expenses? 

Are your parents supportive? If not, make sure you have an individual bank account with a bank company that they don’t have any accounts at themselves. Use this account to save the money. You don’t want any chance of them being able to steal your money.
That is tight. I think the first step is to figure out what your actual minimal-possible obligations are (so don't just say ""utilities are £100' unless you have a contract that says that's what you have to pay, because you can probably find ways to use less water/gas/electricity each month), and then work on trimming all the fat off of everything else. My biggest tip is to convince yourself that there truly *isn't* any money besides what you've budgeted. Usually that's most easily achieved by moving what you want to save into a separate account before you even see it (as in, if you have a job with automatic deposits, have a certain amount of your pay just put there instead of it all going to your main account). It won't be a fun time, but you have an excellent goal to help you stay the course.

Eta: another tip is to find a no-minimum ""high-yield savings account"" to get a bit of interest on your savings. It won't be much at the moment, but it's an extra incentive to keep all the money you possibly can in that savings account.
I live alone in a hostel, not in contact with family, so my money does go towards my living expenses too. 
I've posted on r/UKpersonalfinance, though I totally forgot about r/povertyfinance. Thanks!
Thanks! At the moment I have some money I can save after looking at my expenditure and drawing up a budget. I'll have more once I've finished paying for my student bus pass (£80 a month) which will be a nice boost. 

Right now I'm playing around with what I can get away with cutting down. I think that if I could possibly switch from testogel (£40) to sustanon (£5) that would be another good way to have some more money to put towards top. But yeah, it's definitely tight.

slightly self-deprecating rant	"to be perfectly honest….I would NEVER in a million years believe that nonbinary genders were a thing if I myself were not very much nonbinary. I still struggle to believe it, despite having been aware of my gender for years now. 

I’m transmasculine. I identify very strongly with the “demiboy” label and see myself as somewhere in the realm of 75% to 85% male. And it honestly just sounds batshit crazy in my head, let alone when I try to explain it out loud to some hapless cis person in my social circle. I can see the disbelief in their faces, and honest to god, who can blame them. 75% male?? What the fuck does that even mean?? And yet I know with absolute certainty that it is correct, and have for years now - years that were, for the most part, NOT spent on the internet in a Reddit rabbit hole, as many transphobes claim. I was a relatively normal person with bills and a job who just happened to believe that I was 75% male, 25% agender, and 0% female (despite being assigned female at birth).

It just sounds insane. And if I myself struggle to believe it, I can’t imagine what goes through the average cisgender person’s head. Actually, yes I can - it’s “this person needs to delete Tumblr and go outside.” 

Idk man. Some days I just wish I was binary trans. Or binary cis. Really anything that doesn’t make me feel like a middle schooler with an overactive imagination. It’s exhausting."	"Yeah, I feel you. I've been working through coming out as bi for a while but still keep being nb pretty close to my chest. Like really only my partner and a few close friends know, and I'm not sure why? But I think it's this. Being harder to explain I mean.

I wonder if it's because to understand you need to to know about gender, gender roles, gender expression, how generally society assumes they're all the same... idk. It feels like trying to explain a nuance in a language they don't speak, almost.
Doesn't sound weird to me at all. Correct me if I'm wrong but humans do all kinds of absurd shit. There being non-binary genders and us having them is the least weird stuff I can think of. I was raised super conservative but tbh never gave a shit about the binary and got a lot of flak for it. But here I am years later, still not giving a shit about it. You're 75% male, 25% agender and 0% female? Perfect, wouldn't want it to be any other way for you unless you want that. I think I find it way more likely that there are non-binary genders than that there are eg. races among humans. There is evidence for the former but NONE for the latter, yet the latter idea was popularized and has extremely harmful consequences to this day. Non-binary genders, however? Benign manifestations of human variation wrt gender. People living their best lives in peace. And that is denied and rejected constantly? Sometimes I run out of absurd jokes in the face of how bizarre and off-putting that is."	p42qft	NonBinary	5	1.0	2021-08-14 06:15:03
How tf did you come up with your names?	"Hey y'all I am questioning my gender and I probably already know I am some flavour of nonbinary but not ready to fully come out to even myself or others. If I decide to I would love a new name at least my friends could call me.

But I am having SUCH a hard time finding one. I know I can try out names and change later but if I tell more than just one person, I'd hate to have to tell them again I am changing it (I already feel like I am being way to extra asking anyone to change what they call me, let alone ask them a second time)

I know I want a name that's can be male or female, but people mostly think is male (think something like Alex or Chris - mostly male but could be a female name, too) (so basically like myself, neutral, but leaning masc)
At the same time, I don't want one of the more typical nonbinary names even though they would fit the bill (Elliott, Finn or Luke) - I already know more than one of each name who is trans and I don't want to complicate it even more in my circle.
Plus, there is often really nice names but they are ""English"" (Think Jamie or Billie) - I am German and I kind of always cringe when parents give their children ""cool"" American sounding names and I wouldn't want to do that to myself either. But there is almost no neutral German names.
Billie would be a great candidate but my girlfriends grandpa was called Billy and he recently died. I also have roller derby name (that I picked almost with the same criteria as now) that I thought I could go by. I asked my girlfriend to call me that, but it feels very odd when she does.

So I am curious: How did you come up with your name? How did you know it was right? What name did you want, and what did you end up taking? Also did you post your picture and ask for name suggestions? Was that helpful? I kind of feel like I don't deserve to ask on here for names if I haven't even come out/am unsure. Any other advice you can give me on how to come up with a name?"	"I... Meditated, tbh. It just... Came to me, I felt in my heart it was the right one. But what helped me maybe doesn't help you.

Did you think about it in a place you feel absolutely safe and calm? Maybe that helps, too
I stole my name, Emmanuel, from a cartoon that comforted me during my days of questioning. I went with it because it's androgynous to the ear, kinda connects to my Arabic heritage and it's a powerful name \(which was important to me when I felt very powerless. In fact, choosing a name was my way of reclaiming the power I felt I lost\). It felt good to go by that name

Don't be afraid of taking a name from a piece of media that you like and connect to
for me I came up with a name that really resonated with me personally. My name is Grey, and I chose the name bc I cant be boxed into a black or white category, I am always in the grey area. the first couple of weeks or so it was wierd hearing a name that was different to what my birth name was, but I got used to it and it turned out to feel way better. you gotta really look for a name that you feel like resonates with you, it should feel like the name you always should have had. at least in my opinion
I always liked my birth name, but it was an extremely feminine names and didn’t suit me. I wanted to keep the original meaning, “victory”, so I just became Victor. I got to keep the meaning, keep my initials, and now people don’t get the wrong impression when they learn my name before meeting me.

I also kind of love the idea that I went from “abstract concept of victory” to “one who is victorious”. Went from an aspiration to an accomplishment, which feels symbolic.
I'm Beck. It's a nickname of Rebekah and I think it might be an actual boy's name(?) but very uncommon. It might be helpful for you to go to a baby name website and look at a list of unisex names; that's what I would have done if I didn't have Beck as a natural go-to. 

You 100% deserve to post your picture and ask on here if you think that would help you. It is okay to be unsure. I would rather somebody who feels questioning or unsure gets to explore all the options
I looked over countless lists of names and ran them by friends and family and strangers on here. I took the names suggested and that people though sounded like they fit me and got Quinn and a few others. I enjoyed Quinn and slowly came to fall in love with it after recognizing how many characters in fiction that I loved had it as some part of their name. Like Callie from The Fosters, Quinn from Glee, and Harley Quinn. Just felt right
[deleted]
When I was younger I used to have a list with names for my hypothetic son, later I realized I was my hypotetic son and all of those names were names for myself, names from who I wanted to be. So I just chosed one (the last and the one that didn't implies change my initials), taking advantage of my weird middle name so it doesn't sounded out of place. My name is Adlet and I stole it from an anime that isn't even in my favorites.
It helps to have a vague idea of what you're looking for, so you're already on the right track with narrowing it down to something that can be gender neutral but leans more masculine. I was looking for something very similar when I decided to change my name, and I googled gender neutral names and looked over a few lists. 

I already knew what my middle and last names were going to be, and keeping to the theme I had going I zeroed in on the M names. One jumped out at me, and I started trying it out with friends on a fandom Discord server. I loved it when people used it in reference to me or addressed me as my chosen name directly. It was the first time I *recognized* the feeling of gender euphoria.

I adjusted the spelling at one point to be more visually appealing to me, but the pronunciation was exactly the same. I didn't realize it until later, but it also happened to be the name of a character I really loved in one of my favorite animes. I've since gone through a legal name change, and I can't tell you how affirming it is to see my name on official documents. Good luck in your search! I hope you find something you love as much as I love mine.
My partner at the time was questioning their name and after i started questioning my name so we just sorta helped each other
My marching band tech kept mistaking me for another kid he teched for from another school and I thought it was a cool name. It was for a guy that apparently looked exactly like me so I thought it would fit well in that way. I like it and ive been using it for like 3 years now so it feels normal. I wonder sometimes if another name would fit better but I usually go back to liking it.
Taking mine from a show :) not legally changed yet. Even my surname is gonna be from the show... my middle name is too but that's on accident because I'd already changed that 6 years ago 😅 happy accident that all 3 will be from the same show
I went with a name that's masculine in the region/dialect my family is from, but usually read as feminine in the rest of the country. Bonus is that it's already my (AFAB) first name, since our dialect's traditional women's names are super old-fashioned and my parents didn't like them. So I just dropped the diminutive that made my given name feminine in dialect (or rather, am in the process of doing so). I'm from the Netherlands, so maybe there are similar things in Germany?
Thanks for your answer :) I am looking for that ""feels right"" feeling. I don't think I ever feel absolutely safe and calm, but it's a good idea to think about the name maybe after working out or during the weekend.
It was similar for me, my first name just kind of bubbled up to the top of my mind, after I'd spent a bit of time pondering names. The middle name came later, for a while it was going to be Moxie (hence my username :D ) but a couple months before I was going to get my legal name change done, another named bubbled up out of nowhere that just felt right.

&#x200B;

I use my first name in private situations, with friends, family, etc, and my middle name at work, when making food orders, talking to strangers, etc.
Will think about that, thanks :)
I share your opinion :) just worried maybe it doesn't exist 😅 how did you get over the first couple of weeks?
Love that for you, too :) I love symbols and things having meaning!
Someone really close to me is named Beck/Bex, pretty much the same story as you!
Thanks for the encouragement :)
Quinn is a great name :) it's also Tegan and Sara's last name (minus an n) I've been looking to fiction for inspo, but find it hard to find characters that resonate with me who also have names that work for me. But who know's maybe I'll read or watch something soon that will.
Omg Callie, yes! One of my choices was gonna be Callista (from another show), but was gonna use Callie as a shortened nickname, and because I liked her name in The Fosters too! 

Ended up choosing a different name though
So you use 2 names? How does that work?

Jens is exclusively used for male children in Germany and quite a common name, so It wouldn't help. I want people to hear my name and assume ""male"" but when they meet me to be able to think ""or maybe not?"". If I was Jens they'd probably go ""oh, but he MUST be male""
Also, neutral pronouns in German don't exist - _- which makes it harder to kind of stay in the middle. Thanks for the suggestion tho I appreciate it :)
That is such a cool story!
Thanks for the affirmation :) funnily enough, I am not against an ""M"" name, too haha, my birth initial is M :D but because I already have so many things I want the name to be, I am willing to not have an ""M"" - sometimes looking for the name feels like looking for a partner and having standards that are too high to actually find someone
Yeah maybe I need to start including my girlfriend. She knows I am questioning and is willing to change how she addresses me, so we might as well bounce ideas off of each other.
Damn, you sound like the chilliest person ever :D
Do people mention the show when you introduce yourself? Like is it obvious where your name is from?
Funnily enough my given name is germanised Dutch name but as far as I am aware if I dropped the diminutive, it isn't a name anymore...?
it was just kinda disorienting hearing the name I should have had all along when I had been called by birth name the whole time, but I reminded myself that this is my name and this is right.
You're welcome ❤️ I'm trying to be the person I needed when I was all confused and unsure
Thanks! I hope you find your right name, keep in mind it's always feels strange being called in a different way and search for ""gender neutral german names"" maybe you find something you like.
Lol thanks. Chance was pretty close to a name I was already thinking about and ive always been a fan of puns which the name kind of invites so I think it turned out well. For testing out new names theres always the ordering coffee thing. If you want to test it out personally for longer than an order you could switch an online account nickname so you'll see it when logging in somewhere. That way you don't have to worry about intoducing it till you've tested it out and get accustomed to it. Just a thought. Hope you find a name that's comfy!
I havent yet (is a new choice I finally decided this last couple weeks... but I don't really get many introductions anyways... I'm mostly just known as ""the security guard"" lol, people doing the refit work don't often need to ask my name I suppose?)  

But hypothetically thinking? I would think only fans of the show would mention that specifically, since I've not actually met many people who even know the show when I've mentioned it. Named most of my tarantulas after characters/things in the show and people often look stumped (it's Trollhunters/the Tales of Arcadia series) 

But I definitely know people would ask ""where's that name from?"" Since googling it, only results that come up are the character so it's obvious it's not a ""regular"" name
The diminutive thing is specifically Northern Netherlands as far as I'm aware, feel free to dm me if you want to discuss names without posting them here."	oz497d	NonBinary	5	0.79	2021-08-06 10:50:22
Just need to vent...	"I finally got enough funds to purchase a binder from GC2B and make all my bill payments in February. After tax and shipping it was 55.40$CAD. I signed up for text alerts so i would know where the package was and when it would be delivered. I got the first text that said it had shipped. All was good.


But then I heard nothing about it for weeks. I checked the tracker on March 15th only to find that it said delivered on March 13th. I got no text. No missed delivery slip. I checked with my neighbours to see if they accepted it on my behalf. I checked to see in the post office was holding it because I wasn't there to accept the package. Nothing. Nothing!. I contact GC2B, and they can't do a refund or reship because the package says ""delivered"" I start a dispute with Canada Post to see if it was miserable marked as delivered or lost on a truck or something. They came back and said the spoke with the guy who put it in my mailbox and he confirms he put it there on March 13th.


Which means someone swiped the binder right out of my mailbox. I've never had a package stolen from me. I've never had a bubble envelope left hanging out of my mailbox to get stolen. GC2B said all I can do now is take it up through PayPal for a refund.



I'm just so broken hearted... Someone stole my binder... Probably opened it to see what was in it so they could sell it, probably didn't know what it was... And probably tossed it... My binder brand new is in a landfill.... Surrounding by trash... It makes me want to cry. If I don't get this refund I don't know when I will have enough extra money for a binder. I live pretty much paycheck to paycheck without only dollars to spare that don't go towards bills, rent, medicine, or food.


I don't know what compelled that person to steal. Maybe they really needed money. I like to stay open minded but it was probably someone with an addiction problem. I hope they get help so they don't impact another innocent person with their addiction. Even if they opened it, and didn't know what it was, they could've put it back? I wouldn't mind a package that was all there but open then no package at all...


Its so hard to get binders in Canada..."	"I’ll order you a new one 
Contact Gc2b! They're incredibly nice, and odds are that they'll send you a replacement ❤
In not sure if you're serious or not ;;;; but I super appreciate the offer. I'm gonna see if PayPal can't refund me first however
Thank you, I have contacted them, spoke with a guy named Cameron, and he said unfortunately because the tracker is marked ""Delivered"" they can't do a full refund or send a new one out. They are only responsible for getting the binder out to me, and technically, they did. But some troubled soul stole it from my mailbox. Which they are not responsible for. I'll be honest I'm quite disappointed in their options for me. They offered a coupon towards my next binder but I'm still out 55$ Canadian and nothing to show for it. I had always heard good things about GC2B and their sizes cater to larger folk like myself (I ordered a 4XL). So I'm super bummed about not getting anything out of this transaction.
I’m completely serious, i do giveaways over on my Instagram all the time. PM me and we’ll get you hooked up with a new one! 
Wow, that's not what I'd expect from them tbh. Did you file an official report with the police and report it to USPS?
It was out of USPS's hands when it crossed the border and came to Canada, then it was in Canada Post's. All Canada Post could do was confirm that they really did deliver the package and advised I start a case with Paypal for a refund. Its been an extremely long and frustrating process of people not taking responsibility for the situation. I'm getting tired "	b3slcj	NonBinary	4	1.0	2019-03-21 16:27:13
An Opinion On The Florida Bill That's Not Talked About	"I will keep repeating this

They want us to trust the State of Florida to do the right thing when in the last five years we've had four politicians either arrested or investigating for doing stuff with a minor. And let's not forget letting Jeffrey Epstein run rampant.

Within the last year, just a couple of counties over they had multiple public school and private school teachers for CP, a couple of pediatricians for CP, it was either 2 or 3 police arrested for CP, a veterinarian for CP and ""sexual battery on a dog"".

Just recently they arrested a Hillsborough County high school basketball coach and a Tampa pastor for trying to hook up with underage girls.

And even though he's not from Florida let's not forget Larry Nassar.

And they expect us to trust the state to do the right thing?"		mtrz7m	NonBinary	4	1.0	2021-04-19 03:18:48

Jude's Law....Do I Change My Gender ID or Leave it be?	"I recently moved to Colorado, a state that allows a person to change their gender identity on their State ID or Licence under [Jude's Law](https://one-colorado.org/new/colorado-house-bill-19-1039-judes-law-goes-into-effect/). Tomorrow I go into the DMV to get new identification since I moved to the state last fall. I have a big opportunity here. I can finally have X on my id as my gender like I've wanted for years!....but now I'm worried if there are repercussions to this choice... I was born F and disabled. I have multiple doctors appointments a week for more than 6 health conditions. My gender identity is listed in Other: Gender Nonbinary/Neutral in the health system used by most of my doctors. I haven't faced discrimination for my identity so far, but my identity technically isn't official. I'm not sure what I should do. I realized my true identity July of 2015 and have identified as Gender NonBinary for over 5 years. I don't see that changing and I want to identification to reflect that, but I don't also want to cause trouble for myself....Does anyone have an opinion or words of wisdom you could share with me? I have the rest of tonight to think about it, but tomorrow I have the ability to make this choice, and I want to make sure I'm making the right one for me.

I've been contemplating a similar thing... I moved to CA about a year ago and need to update my ID (to become REAL ID compliant); the nonbinary ""X"" gender marker is an option here for state IDs but it won't match my assigned gender on my MI birth certificate, which would be hard to amend based on MI's current state laws.
Idk if I would. Depends on how much you drive and what city in Colorado you're in.

The vast majority of that state is closed minded libertarians and the cops there freak me the fuck out. 

I wouldn't even trust the cops in Los Angeles to not hassle me for an X marker though so will depend on your paranoia level, haha."	hz7dwn	NonBinary	4	0.84	2020-07-28 03:41:50

Advice on head shaving	"Trigger warning: depression and anxiety

I really want to shave my head because having hair doesn’t feel like it matches my gender identity and because I have depression which makes me not able to muster enough energy to wash it every week but my family member won’t let me and keeps forcing me to get it washed. They told me “I don’t think you’d want that” when I told Them before as if they lives a day in my life. I’m scared of getting in trouble but I want to do this because I want to live life the way I want to and not live how others want me to. It is about 50% the causes of my daily depression episodes and s word thoughts (I’m not gonna do it so please don’t send me the s word hotline number) and anxiety but I told my family member I wanted to shave my head because I didn’t feel like doing it, which should be a valid enough reason you shouldn’t have to do something you don’t want to that’ll not effect your life in anyway your hair doesn’t pay your bills, get you to work everyday or feed your family so why is it so important to some people to force this on them? I know they only does this to me because I’m AFAB and if I was AMAB they’d probably buy me a razor and do it for me. I was thinking of doing it as an impulse one day but I still get anxiety thinking about it doing it and the only razor I have is a shick intuition women’s razor. What should I do? I need this so much."	"If you feel comfortable telling a parent that you are depressed, I would suggest telling them you wanna talk and try having a more serious talk with them and say you really wanna shave your head because your hair is stressing you out and you are having trouble maintaining it and it is making you uncomfortable. Tell them you also want to have short hair and it will help you be more comfortable and happy right now. You can even mention that you have thought about it a lot and you can always grow it back later.

If they still say no after you emphasize how much it would help your mental health, maybe you could just pay to have someone do it cheap at somewhere like great clips if you have a bit of money and would be able to go on your own
The worst that could happen (as far as the hair itself is concerned anyway) is that it takes some time for the hair to grow back out. Maybe you wear a hat for a while.

And hey, you might be able to donate your hair to a charity. I think such donations are subject to some specific rules (not sure exactly what rules, and it might vary), so it'd be worth looking it up if you decide to go that route.

What stood out to me was that *they don't think* you want that. If you want something, you know what you want, that's the way wants work. Admittedly, ten-year-old me didn't know the consequences of eating too damn much sugar, but if your family member can't provide realistic, serious consequences, then that's controlling behavior, intentional or not. What your family member might not yet realize (though I maybe wouldn't voice this; it's more a light at the end of the tunnel), is that there will inevitably come a day when you make your own choices, and there's *nothing* they can do to stop you. But I dunno, I don't like to do pop psychoanalysis of strangers on the internet, so it's really up to you to discover if any of that applies.

Anyway, the more reasons you have that it could be a really good idea, and can't be that bad an idea, the more confident you can be in yourself. I really think you're on much firmer ground than your family member!
Great Read, I recently went bald using Groomie's [Electric Head Shaver](https://www.groomie.club/products/baldiepro-head-shaver-kit) hence I was looking a way to grow my hair back faster and better and found yours blog very useful, would highly recommend it to anyone looking to do the same.

parent tried to leverage my longterm partner against me	"I started HRT for the second time in my transition without telling my mother. Last time she guilt-tripped me so hard, I ended up quitting even though I didn't want to, to appease her and make her feel better. 

Two years later, I asked my doctor to start it again and renewed my old prescription. My mother found out because everything goes through our family insurance and she checks the bills (I was anticipating this and ready for a discussion). 

Since quitting the first time, I got a longterm partner. It's been nine months, he's amazing and supports me, and my parents haven't been weird because he's a cis man and I'm AFAB so in their eyes, this is a ""normal"" relationship. But when talking to my mother about my HRT and transition goals, she tried to leverage my partner against me *twice*. 

First, she asked what he thought about me being masculine and I told her that he supports me in all ways, because he does. Later in the same conversation, she asked if I knew what HRT would do to my fertility and what if my partner wants kids someday? We haven't even been dating a year or talked about marriage or anything like that yet, and I told her that, as well as the very real ideas that *if* I want children (I'm 26 and haven't fully decided one way or the other), I could always adopt/foster or use a surrogate/donated eggs if my own fertility is an issue. 

I'm angry and annoyed that she would try to use him to find an excuse to convince me to quit HRT again. I could tell by her body language and words that she was fishing for some hesitation on his part. Luckily he's a very supportive partner and I was able to dismiss her, but the implications she tried to make still hurt. 

There's no ""answer"" to this situation. I just needed to rant and mentally roll my eyes at how obvious and terrible of a tactic this was."		naeqid	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-05-12 02:51:36

Advice and help requested..?	"Vent followed by please help:

I'm trying to get my chest removed completely. Simple as that. I've wanted this since I was 15, before I even knew what trans/NB were, and before I'd even considered I might be trans/NB. 

""Valid"" reasons other than MY BODY MY CHOICE:

1) They're heavy, and a strong contributed to my scholiosis (two 30°+ curves in my spine). For reference, I'm a 28I/J. I'm also 5'4 and 120lbs. This is a large chest for a small frame. Doesn't feel good. 

2) I can't breathe properly without an outside force (pillow, desk, etc) holding up my chest and taking the strain off my body. 

3) General neck/back pain. 

4) Cancer concerns (runs in the family, mostly in large breasted afab people, and a doctor, when doing a check up, informed me i either have large cysts or cancer, and never further explored that with me).

Also, not valid in the eyes of America in any way thus far for me, but IM TRANS/NB. Top makes unhappy. 

I'm a broke person making scraps, can't afford bills, no health insurance, can't work more hours cause I'll be bed ridden in pain, can't work less hours cause the few bills I can afford NEED to be paid. 


QUESTION:


Would anyone with more experience be able to help me in finding an affordable way to get top surgery? I keep doing research, but it just keeps bringing me back to ""expensive"" and ""very bad reviews (especially for LGBT peeps)"". 

I'm TRYING to get insurance through my job, it requires more hours though, which Im struggling to do due to pain, and I was denied state healthcare because ""you make too much"" (I make ~800-1k/mo working more hours than I physically can without pain).

Texas resident if that is of any help."	I wish I could say there's a way to get get it done but the healthcare system (and every other system) in this country is trash. Your best bet is probably gonna be to find a better job with decent insurance. I know it sucks and it's much easier said than done (I've been waiting for 20 years). With all your physical issues, you'd probably only have to pay the deductible and you could most likely get it  done for the medically necessary reasons (possibly fewer hoops to jump through although Texas might cause a problem because Texas). I'm getting mine done through the target insurance and it's very good. They don't pay great and it *is* retail but they do offer insurance to part time workers as well.

How Can I Help?!?	Hello! I am nonbinary and in the United States. There is currently a lot of shit happening with anti- trans bills in the United States and I would like ways to help. I am a minor and can't vote for anything. I don't know how to help other then to spread the message of what is happening but I still want to do more. Help, please? (:	"Don't know about the us but in the county I live in theres a bunch of anarchist/trans feminist groups. Joining one of them can give you a lot of empowerment and also save spaces for others. Might be an idea for you :)
You can still write to your government officials and express your displeasure. Just because you’re not eligible to vote now doesn’t mean you won’t vote in the future, and you’re still their constituent.

A lot of this trans/enby hate is focused on students and youth athletics. Is there something you could do to petition your local school board for protections?
you can make calls or emails to specific officials pushing the bills to let them know of community dissent. the aclu website has information on who to contact, as well as forms that help you figure out what to say. you can always make donations to organizations like aclu, the trevor project, sylvia rivera law project, or your city's lgbtq+ center. if there's a gsa / queer alliance at your school, you can brainstorm ideas with the members. if there's not, creating one is something that will have a huge impact on your school even after you graduate! I hope for your sake you don't go to a super conservative school, but odds are you know at least one supportive teacher who would try to help you create the alliance. giving kids a safe place to vent their frustrations and learn about lgbtq+ history and culture is one of the most important things to do when the conservative agenda is so determined to push us into the shadows.
Try to post to your social media, or share some posts about LGBTQI rights?

Getting a haircut?	What do you all do? I’m AFAB and nonbinary. I had long hair for sometime but cut it all off plenty of years ago. I don’t get pixies, and keep it more punk rock/messy/undercut/masculine looking. Salons, more often for women, are so overpriced (because for some reason women, even with short hair, just have to have more W expensive haircuts! Seriously, my father and I with about the same length hair would get the same treatment at a salon and my bill would be 15$ more just for being labelled “female” smh) and I get feminine haircuts, and I get weird looks at barbershops and frankly never get my hair the way I want it. So where you get your haircut? How did you find your barber or any hair advice for a short haired NB?	"I'm not out yet, but there's a trans barbershop that has accessible pricing in my city that I'm planning on going to when I get the chance to do that. 
Another suggestion would be salon schools or community colleges that give that sort of training. They normally have cheap pricing (around $10) for people to get their haircut by the students as a way of practicing. 
I feel you, I’m basically the same. I luckily found a guy I like at Bubbles at my local mall... I was recommended him by a classmate who is gay, and apparently this stylists has a lot of queer clients haha. I’m not really out as trans/nb tho. I wanted to try a barbershop in the past but I’m too anxious afhkbn
Not sure how helpful this will be but there's a shop in my town that's somewhere between a barbershop and a salon that I've been going to for years, and if/when I want to change my hairstyle to something a bit more androgynous I'm sure the hairdressers there would be totally welcome and able to provide, although I haven't seen that many nb people that I've noticed to be nb. I know a couple friends of mine with nonconforming haircuts (girl with basically a buzz cut and a guy with long hair) who have been going there for a while though and are totally happy with it. It's definitely more of a family place than a one-person-alone place, is the feeling I get.

Previously I've been to a salon once (at a time when the other shop was closed) as a male egg and didn't feel too awkward (probably no more than I would have at any other new hairdresser), and it seemed like a perfectly accepting place... but then again I only went once.

Half of this is probably not helpful (sorry!), but I guess the most important thing is to browse around, ask people and just find the shop where you're the most comfortable with the hairdressers and the people who go there."	85fnxg	NonBinary	3	1.0	2018-03-19 00:53:08

Looking for therapy options	"I have insurance that covers CBT and other in person talk therapy but I’ve stalled out pulling the trigger on getting back into therapy because 1) in person things are tricky but that’s what I really want 2) I don’t know what online options are supportive of non-binary people.

I’m in a mental state right now where if I get hit with a form that asks me whether I’m a man or a woman and won’t let me continue past it without answering, I will just give up and move on to another option. I am so mentally exhausted I cannot take misgendering myself to get medical/mental health treatment anymore.

What online options have other non-binary people used successfully and what were the approximate financial costs? If you had insurance, were you able to bill or not? Was it difficult to find someone supportive of your gender who also didn’t focus on it and let the treatment focus on other issues instead?

Tia, love you all for helping me keep going right now."	"I don't want to stay you away from online therapy if that's what you need right now, but have you looked at LGBT therapists in your area? Even if you don't want to focus on gender at all, a gender or lgbt therapist will probably be better equipped to help you navigate things without ignoring your identity or misgendeirng you. I see my gender therapist for anxiety and autism related reasons, and not so much transitioning anymore. 

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists Pyshcology today has a really good therapist finder. You start by putting in your location, and then narrow it down. You can put your insurance, but then you could narrow by someone in the LGBT community or who covers subjects like Transgender or sexuality topics. Plenty of therapists do online therapy too, so you may even search for someone a but farther from you if they can do online sessions. 

There exists plenty of queer therapists out there, and they don't really try to hide it. You deserve to see someone who understand and respects you, and of course there are ally therapists out there that can do that too, but an LGBT therapist might be a safer bet. 

I've not had great experience with any online therapy platform sadly, so I can't recommend you anything. But PT is how I found my therapist, as well as helped lots of other people find theirs.
Look up pride counseling. They have nonbinary options and will match you up with a therapist that meets your needs. Idk how the insurance works, because I don't have any."	jfhly9	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-10-21 17:39:27

Solution to Binding in Hot Weather	"I found a good solution for being able to bind in the heat. There are sports bras called ""longline bras"" that are very trendy right now. They have a similar look to a binder, but they are not as tight. For me, they relieve chest dysphoria. They are also discreet because they are billed as sports bras and they are modeled by cis women. I got mine at Target, but I'm sure other places would have them too. Just thought I would pass it on."		nnyqac	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-05-29 23:22:15

Does anyone else have very conflicting aesthetics and lifestyles?	"Context. I’m nonbinary and I try to present very androgynous or masculine-leaning in my day to day life. I wear men’s clothes, I have super short hair, I wear binders or trans tape most the time, and I’m literally never without a knit hat or ball cap. No problem, right? Except....my job.

I’m a professional horse trainer. Which, as you might imagine, can be  an industry very set in its beliefs. I own my own business and I’m quite successful for my age and environment. This area of country and my chosen discipline can be exceptionally difficult to make a living off of livestock, and I do well for myself. Not very comfortable, mind, but my bills are paid, my animals are fed, foods on the table, fuel in the truck, and I get by. 

I was recently told by a client of mine (who really did mean well, she just didn’t know what saying this would do to me) that I’d probably get more business if I looked a little more feminine and dressed a little nicer. I just sort of shrugged it off and made a comment about me not being very fashion-inclined, which is 100% true. But now she’s offered to take me shopping for some nicer, more feminine clothes to wear for work. Id hate to hurt her feelings, but I’m not out to any of my clientele and I’m not ready to be out to them yet. 

I highly doubt there’s many enby horse people out there, let alone trainers, but do any of y’all have similar issues between your gender identity + expression and your way of living/jobs? How do you deal with that? Tyia."	"Oof. I've not been around horses for years, but I know the class aesthetic you're talking about.
why don’t you not go shopping with that client? Go by yourself or with a supportive friend. you could get some higher end men’s clothes. Some dapper looks. so that you look more expensive and refined but not feminine. 

her comment, while well meaning, was rude. the idea though, is to elevate your presentation. if you’re financially stable; then just disregard.
Yeah, it’s an interesting world for sure. And honestly, I’ve only ever met one other queer equestrian, let alone someone who looks and identifies similar to myself. It’s a hostile world and while I know staying closeted is safer for me in the long run, it’s hard being completely misgendered everyday and trying to navigate it all.
I guess I just don’t quite know how to tell her that I don’t want to go shopping with her? She offered to take me in order to help me put myself together a bit nicer, I suppose? She wants to help, but I don’t know the right way to tell her that I’m not interested in adding any “feminity” to my wardrobe. Shes 1000% right that I probably shouldn’t be wearing my goodwill checker shirts and tattered trousers day in and day out, but it’s pretty much all I really know how to wear? I work all the time, so I rarely ever get to dress up or anything. So I definitely appreciate her wanting to help me present myself better. I’d love to feel confident in something nicer, I just have no idea how to do that and I don’t really have anyone to help me. 

I really can’t blame her for her comment as I’m not publicly out. I appreciate her kindness and the gesture, but it’s kinda been fucking me up since she said it.
understandable.

You can tell her you’re very grateful for her generous offer, but have to politely decline. Thank her for the great advice. 

no big deal! 

also; you work with animals, there is a limit to how nice you can dress. try not to worry?"	se9pdy	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-01-27 21:51:00
FtNB struggling with chest surgery options - any experiences with breast reduction/lift (bonus points if you had top surgery after)?	"Hey all! I just had a consult with a surgeon for a breast reduction today and I'm left with a lot of questions. Two things she said really cause me concern, and I figure my fellow enby redditors may have some experience with them.

1. She said it would be very risky to go down as much as I want (from a 36G US size to around an A or B, using ABTF's calculator). She basically said that not only would insurance not cover it in my situation (leaving me with a $21.5k bill), but the risk of nipple loss and health complications are very high, and that it just isn't possible to go down to an A or B from my size. Has anyone here done a reduction like that? Or a reduction at all from a large size? What was your experience like? Did it help with your dysphoria?
2. I'm not currently looking to have top surgery, but I like having the option open. She said that I should really try to decide before getting any surgery, because a reduction/lift could interfere with the procedure and healing of a top surgery later. Has anyone done this? Did you have any issues?

Thank you so much to anyone who answers! I really appreciate it."	"First, I think you should seek out another surgeons opinion if possible.

I thought about getting a reduction years before I considered top surgery, I had a 30 H/I chest.. but I didn't end up going through with it at the time. Now I am 5 week post op from top surgery, I didnt keep my nips. I am very happy.

I've done some searching and I think you should read this! https://www.drsanders.com/how-small-can-i-go-with-a-breast-reduction/
At that size, nipple grafts are usually the only option (according to the consult I had last week). Nipples are finicky and there's pretty much always the risk of rejection. Depending on your insurance top surgery might be a cheaper option and you can ask for fuller masculine contouring. I've seen it done where they leave a bit so that might be something to ask about.
Congrats on your top surgery! I do want to keep the nipples but it's not the end of the world if my only option is to have them removed and grafted/tattooed back on. It's really nice to see that there are more options if you aren't worried about keeping them!
My surgeon didn't even offer the option of grafts, which was a bit frustrating. She basically said going very small isn't possible for me. Looking into radical reduction with grafts really eased my mind, although I know it has its own risks (especially where top surgery later is concerned).

I want to go for small enough to be able to feel feminine when I want, and masculine when I want, in terms of how I feel in my body and clothes. Being able to look close to flat in baggy clothes, but still look femme and cute in lingerie, that kind of thing. I wish I felt totally one way about how I want my body, but I feel like I just can't settle u_u"	z899d5	NonBinary	1	1.0	2022-11-29 23:04:08
I dont know if I'm non binary.	"So for the past few years I've struggled alot with accepting my body, im 5'0"" with a rectangular boyish figure and am a A cup, I really have a hard time feeling feminine because of how my body looks. Recently I started dressing a bit more masculine and cut my hair super short, and pretty much ceased wearing bras (I'm an A cup, not like anyone will notice, also so much more comfortable) while I feel slightly better about myself I still struggle with my body image. Don't feel feminine enough because of my boobs and waist shape, don't feel masculine enough because of my height.

On top of all this I've come to a bit of a conclusion I might be non binary, but I dont really know if I'm 'enough' non binary to call myself that. I still feel like a woman, use she/her pronouns and present feminine about 80% of the time so I don't really know if I fit the bill."	"there's no ""enough"". if you want to be nonbinary you are.
I think the key phrase here is that you ""feel like a woman"" 

Being non binary has nothing to do with how you present yourself or what pronouns you use but how you feel on the inside. 

Ask yourself, ""Am I woman? Am I something different? Am I a woman some of the time and something different at another time? Maybe I'm only partially a woman?""

Depending on your answers to these questions, that can help you determine if you are non binary or not. It may take days or even months to know what you are on the inside. Your answer might even change as time progresses and that's okay. Nevertheless, I wish you luck on your gender identity journey.
Thats the thing I have a problem with, like that 20% where I want to present as a dude, if I put on a skirt or even a feminine cut shirt I just feel... idk just not right like I guess how a Cis dude would typically feel putting on a dress or skirt."	k96mn4	NonBinary	1	1.0	2020-12-08 15:51:24

Came out to my wife, in a way. Still somewhat confused. Non-conformity, sexuality, label confusion, and self-acceptance	"Covid lockdown has been a wild ride. I’m 27M (assigned male at birth), married to a wonderful (cis) woman who I’ve been with since high school. I have always self-identified and presented as a man my entire life. From the outside, things probably look about as “ideal” and “normal” as they can be, as far as societal norms go. We both have solid careers going, we have a house, we have a baby on the way, we’re about as fortunate and privileged as you can be at our age and I feel so lucky to be where I am in life with her by my side. I wanted to lay out this background because my story deals with societal norms and expectations, and I think this background context is an important part of where I’m coming from. Now, I want to write out a sort of journey I’ve recently undergone on a much more internal level, so here goes:

Starting a few years ago, I started to develop certain kinks that maybe hinted at some suppressed urges I had, but they were overall relatively tame and I didn’t really think too much about them when I wasn’t actively engaging in these kinks. (Really this was just limited to some light cross-dressing, wearing panties, and experimenting with penetration). I would always do these things in private, not involving my wife, because I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I had to literally force myself to admit to my wife that I ordered myself a toy because I figured she’d likely see the credit card bill or find it eventually. It was so hard to admit it to her but I eventually did, and she was very neutral about it. Very much a “do what you want, I don’t care” kind of vibe.

My wife and I have an incredible sex life, but as I’m sure is true of most relationships, there are some challenges that we’re working through together. She has a good deal of anxiety when it comes to initiating sex, and puts pressure on herself to perform, no matter how much I tell her I just want her to feel comfortable and that I crave intimacy, not sexual gratification. When we do break through that initial barrier, our sex is passionate and incredible. I would definitely call it somewhat “vanilla” in the grand scheme of things, but it feels really good, and we connect with each other emotionally in a way that I know I absolutely crave. Like, in the heat of the moment, I almost start to disassociate from myself, and instead start feeling like she and I are merging into one. It’s really hard to describe, but I absolutely love it, and I’m mentioning it here because I want to refer back to it a little later on.

Now, let me change gears to my more private, personal sexuality. My wife works long night shifts, which means that for a couple days of the week, she’s at work when I’m at home alone for a good 6-8 hours before I go to sleep. On some occasions, I take advantage of this alone time to really engage in what I’d call an “altered sexuality”. I feel differently about myself when I put on my wife’s lingerie than when I do when she is around. I still identify as the same person, with the same personality, but there’s a freedom to do what I want with no judgement that is thrilling. This thrill is very tightly coupled with arousal, which is why I’m describing this as an “altered sexuality” specifically. When I “finish up”, without getting too graphic, I put the lingerie away, I put on my normal clothes, I go back to my usual activities and way of thinking and feeling. I liked that it could be discrete, that I could hide all of the evidence before my wife got home, and nobody had to know about this embarrassing part of my sexuality.

So this pattern continued over the course of several years. With covid, the frequency increased, since I’m all locked down and working from home, but my wife is an essential worker who is still going out for her night shift job several times a week. Over the last week or so, the intensity of this sexuality felt like it increased, or maybe I was paying more attention to it, or letting it be more free or something. One evening about a week ago, while my wife was at work, I had a sudden, crazy idea - “what if I just shaved my legs?”. After all, it’s covid, nobody is going to see my uncovered legs for weeks, it sounds really exciting, why shouldn’t I? I knew I obviously couldn’t hide such a thing from my wife, so I texted her and said something along the lines of “for some reason, I want to try shaving my legs, I don’t know why but I think I’m gonna do it”. 

Her response was basically what I expected - similar to when I told her about ordering myself that toy, she basically said “ok, do whatever you want, doesn’t bother me”. So, I did it. As soon as I started, I felt the same kind of thrill that I felt the very first time I ever put on panties. It was this incredible sexual excitement and arousal. This felt like the next level of this ‘altered sexuality’ pattern that I’ve been engaging in. The only difference was that this time, I couldn’t hide all of the evidence when I was done. I couldn’t just put everything away and go back to my “normal self”, because my legs were still shaved! I had to live with them, and the crazy thing was, I liked that idea.

I started to look at and appreciate my legs in a non-sexual context. I liked how they looked and felt, not because it made me feel naughty and sexual, but because it made me feel like me, and I could actually look at part of my body and be proud of how it looked. This definitely felt like a revelation of sorts, but it was also scary too. I didn’t know what this was. Could I still call myself and think of myself as a man if I preferred my legs to be smooth and silky? What would my friends and family think of me if they found out I did this and liked it? I decided I had to do some research on reddit, since that’s what I’m often inclined to do when I want to know more about something new.

Now, I’m still not really sure if going to reddit right away was a good idea. I stumbled across subreddits like this one and was seeing an entire world of people, terms, and ideas that I didn’t understand. I’ve always identified as an “ally”, I’ve always tried very hard to stay educated and accepting of all types of people, but I admit I wasn’t aware that there was so much variety and terminology. I really wanted to find a ‘diagnosis’ for what I was going through. I came across some post or description of the term “genderfluid” and thought that maybe that’s what I was dealing with. After all, the word itself sounded like it could fit since I was sort of sliding into femininity with shaving my legs. But, after deciding that maybe I was genderfluid, I read another post that described genderfluid people as non-cis, and that if you aren’t cis, then you’re trans, by definition.

To be fully honest, this kinda terrified me. I don’t want to be trans, it doesn’t feel right to think of myself in that way. I think trans people are incredible, I think they’re some of the bravest, most courageous people on this planet, but I can’t think of myself in that group, or with that label. I know about other trans people who have described the trans experience, and I just don’t connect with what they’ve described at all. I don’t suffer from dysphoria, I’ve never wanted different pronouns or a different name than the masculine ones I use today, I don’t want to be a wife instead of a husband -- I am excited to be a father and a dad. But, I’m such a sucker for definitions and diagnosis that I thought “well shit, if liking my shaved legs makes me genderfluid, and being genderfluid makes me trans, then I guess that’s what I am even if it feels wrong to think of myself in that way”.

Another day or two went by and I was still grappling with this stuff in my mind. My wife, meanwhile, knew about the shaven legs, seemed totally fine with it, if not super excited by it. I started to work on a letter, in the mornings when she was still sleeping, because I knew that no matter what I was going through, I wanted to find a way to tell her. I wanted her help in figuring out what this was. So I worked on this letter over two different mornings, basically going over everything in this post so far, including my self-diagnosis of being genderfluid and the fact that this might mean I’m trans, even if I didn’t want to be.

My wife went to work another night shift. I distracted myself from the internal gender identity crisis I was going through by letting myself fall into that ‘altered sexuality’ mindset again. Instead of worrying about labels and diagnosis, I was once again focused on loving my body and the thrill of my new legs. I reshaved them to get rid of the stubble, and felt a sudden urge to paint my toenails. I decided to just do it, throwing caution to the wind. When I was finished, I of course loved how my feet looked, they looked pretty and sexy to me, and since I’m so unaccustomed to thinking of myself as being ‘attractive’ at all, this felt like even more evidence that yep, I guess I really am genderfluid. So, while my wife was at work, I sent her the letter, telling her that if she had some downtime, I wanted her to read it and let me know what she thought. 

I think the letter kind of scared her. My usage of the label ‘trans’ in the letter definitely made her uncomfortable, and I think she interpreted the letter as evidence that I might want to become a woman at some point in the future. She said that she was confused and couldn’t really tell what I wanted. She told me she was really worried that I would someday want to change myself with hormones, or change my body with implants, or change my voice, and that idea made her afraid, I think because doing those things would change who I am to her and of course that’s a scary idea. She wants to be in love with me for the rest of my life, she knows that she is in love with who I am right now, but what if she fell out of love if I completely changed as a person? I totally get it, and I know I’d grapple with the same type of struggle if the roles were reversed and she decided she wanted to transition to being a man. 

Anyways, her overall reaction to the letter definitely gave me a confusing mixture of feelings. On one hand, she seemed totally fine with me having a “feminine side”. She was excited to help me paint my nails, or try different hairstyles, or eventually do some ‘girly things’ together after covid like a spa day. That part of her reaction is awesome, and validating, and great. 

But on the other hand, she was definitely hung up about my self-diagnosis of genderfluid. I don’t know if she fully believes me when I say that I don’t want to become a woman, possibly because I was “okay” with using the term “trans” in my letter even if I didn’t feel that I can identify with it. 

I think the part that makes me feel a little bit bad about her reaction to my “coming out” letter is that now I have this lingering feeling, like, ok she might accept me for who I am today, but what if she ends up being right? What if 10 years from now I decide that I do need to transition or something? And what if I were to do that and she wasn’t able to completely accept me? I think she would try her absolute hardest but at the end of the day, it would be such a massive change in both of our lives that I wouldn’t blame her for not being able to do it. I try to tell myself that this is a silly line of thought though, that I shouldn’t worry about a version of myself that doesn’t currently exist. But it’s hard to completely ignore that tiny bit of worry. 

I think this is maybe a problem with trying to grab labels, terms, and definitions as diagnoses, especially so early into the process of questioning who or what you are. I’m not as educated as I can be on these issues, and neither is my wife. I feel like I had enough knowledge and awareness of gender issues to support that community as a cis straight man, but now that I’m questioning my cis-ness (and to be honest, also my straightness), it feels pretty overwhelming to try to find a label that matches my mindset, especially when that mindset is evolving and changing day by day. 

So anyways, back to the story: The next day, while my wife was asleep, I did a bit more reading, and came across a term I hadn’t seen before. This term was “gender non-conforming”, and it immediately resonated with me, I think because it seemed to describe actions instead of identity. Me shaving my legs is 100% a non-conforming action to take as a cis-man, and I know that I liked taking that action. I knew that I wanted to do more things that are non-conforming in the future, with my wife, and it felt right to want those things. I feel like identifying with this label gave me the freedom to want these new things without changing who I am fundamentally. I think this is what I thought gender fluidity was, but now that I have some understanding of both labels, I like ‘gender non-conforming’ a lot more.

It also gives me a feeling of empowerment: gender roles suck, I’ve always thought so (and so does my wife). By refusing to conform with some traditional aspects of masculinity, I’m demonstrating my displeasure with these societal roles, and I like how that feels.

When my wife woke up, we talked a lot more, and I think this conversation made us both feel better. I showed her what I read about “gender non-conforming”, and she agreed that that term made her feel more comfortable too. At the very least, it gives me something to think about myself that doesn’t scare me or my wife at all, which creates the freedom I need to explore this more.

We had sex that night, and it was incredible to get to feel open about myself. I took on a more submissive role than I ever have before, I unashamedly rubbed my smooth legs against hers, and kept thinking about how sexy my feet looked. It was incredible, and I also realized that the entire time, I wasn’t worried about whether I was having sex as a ‘man’ or as a ‘woman’. I was having sex as myself, fully and without any filter. If my body wanted to assume a submissive, feminine pose, I let it. If my body wanted to moan or make noises, I let it. If I wanted to grab her and switch to a more masculine position, I did so. It was a freedom I had only ever felt in my private, ‘altered sexuality’ sessions, but this time it was with the person I love and I wasn’t ashamed at all.

Remember way earlier when I mentioned feeling like my wife and I were almost merging into one entity when our sex was really good? In a way, I almost feel like this is happening on a broader, more permanent level. By freeing myself of all worry about my role and expectation based on my gender, it feels like I’m closer to her now than I ever have been, both sexually and non-sexually. 

For example, since shaving my legs, I’ve started to dislike a lot of my super masculine boxer-style underwear, and I asked my wife to help me shop for some new ones. I found a website that sells underwear purely by style and not by men/women categories, and it was such a great feeling to shop with my wife in a completely genderless mindset. We ended up each getting something with the same style (just different sizes), and it was somehow such a good feeling that she and I weren’t categorizing ourselves differently. I also picked out a thong for myself and just the fact that she was sitting there with me, helping me pick it out was so reassuring and affirming. 

I’ve learned so much about myself over the last week, and I know that I still have more self-discovery ahead of me. I wanted to share this because writing it all out helps me reflect on it, but also because I think there’s something to be said for the danger of reaching for labels and diagnosis, especially so early into a ‘questioning’ phase. When I finally let go of finding the perfect label or perfect term, and just focused on doing what I want to do, regardless of what that might define me as, I started finally feeling happy and able to share my full self with my wife.

Some day, I think it’d be awesome if I could build up the courage to show off this feminine side of me more publicly. But for now, especially when this is so new and different, I’m perfectly content to just be myself around my wife. I love her so much and I’m so glad I opened up to her. If you made it all the way through this, wow, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my experience.

And while letting go of labels and terms was helpful for me to keep exploring myself, if I said anything that is incorrect, or problematic in any way, especially about the terms and labels I described, please let me know! (Especially if I accidentally said anything that could be transphobic). I’m always looking to broaden my understanding of myself and other people. If anyone reads this story and feels like there actually is a term that fits very close to what I’ve described, I definitely would love to hear it. If anything, knowing which topics and labels I should read more about will only improve my understanding, as long as I’m not so eager to immediately apply them to myself. In general, I still feel like I’m actively “questioning” who I am, so if you feel like you have some insight after reading this, please do share it. Thank you so much!"

Mystery bill after gender affirming surgery?		"Assuming you're in the US, welcome to our healthcare system. Just because you paid x dollars for your surgery doesn't mean that other people involved in the process don't also get to charge you, even though those costs were never explained to you and you had no choice of who was involved or what they did. For example, the anesthesiologist who put you under for the surgery may bill you independently, or a post-op icu specialist. It is incredibly fucked up.

My suggestion is to find out what specific entity is issuing that bill, and connect that entity with your insurance company. Hospitals also have entire departments dedicated to fixing issues like this, where they can often forgive about 90% of the amount and leave you with something that won't be financially devastating. Your situation is unfortunately far from unique, and isn't even trans-specific. There are a ton of great resources out there for helping you through the process.

I'm sorry for this shitty situation my friend. Wishing you all the best on your recovery and your fight against the horrors of healthcare in this country.

This all started today when I put on some makeup/eyeshadow on my face to make myself look like I have shaved facial hair (copium copium i am not allowed hrt OR EVEN A BINDER and no I cannot get it myself, fuck american suburbs and car centric fucking infrastructure fuck fucking fuck why can't I just walk 20 feet to an informed consent clinic that gives me free instant socialismpilled male-fat-distribution-inducing testosterone and finasteride + instant booby removal). My mom noticed and I cant rememebr what she specifically said but she called me disgusting or something else. She told me I am not a guy (I am partially guy, partially girl). I am fucking sick of being in my miserable estrogenized body and constantly in doubt and I have ocd and I have a fear of detransing into a cishet terf woman (womanhood 🤮🤢🤢💀💀). I wish I could have a genderless/slightly more masculine body with MALE FAT DISTRIBUTION and not these disgusting milk tumors. I also want t and finasteride because I hope I'll lose my sex drive (I am asexual and I want to quit my stupid fucking sex drive and never have to masturbate that disgusting moldy discharge forced-pregnancy-causing flesh piece estrogen ovary again) and I'll be period free and I want to get top surgery and I hope testosterone will work to get rid of my female fat distribution and big ugly butt and I hate pointless female puberty too. I wish my parents were supportive (and ACTUALLY supportive and not just supportive of specifically neurotypical LGBs and sex-positive blackstripe aces and 100% pure-distilled-refined binary manly-man 7-weeks-gestationpilled trans people) and not Bill Maherian centrist gender=sexualitypilleds. No you are not libleft for hating Trumo, goofy ahh centrists Christian-respecters ""against hate speech"" enlightened centrist POS. Also my mom triggers my straight OCD and cis OCD on purpose and I hear her talk about me like that to my dad. My sister is against me too (TikTok terminal addict high on cisgender heterosexuality and crushes on her generic classmates she ALWAYS talks about 24/7). I do not have anywhere to go and I have no social skills and I DON'T EVEN GO TO SCHOOL IN PERSON. I also constantly have thoughts that I am fembrained and will detrans and not like the effects of testosterone and eventually take the cishetmonogamypill (🤢🤢🤮) (Agamy > cishet 20-year-agedifferencepilled monogamy). Incel (Cishetmonogamy/sex=genderpilledwoman hater aroace, not relationship wanter)/4chan language is my copium (feeling less female) and so is hating cis het AuthRight terf/tradwife females. Maybe I will be happier if I am not subjected to the torture that is female puberty (estrogen and uterus is grimdark) 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😡😡😡😡😡 fuck the ""democrat"" cishets that are my parents, fuck all fake progressives I hope they get deported to a sandbar so all fake progressives will be away from the rest of society. I hate everyone who supports LGB drop the T or truscum transmed ideology. Fuck bill maher that transphobic POS I hope testosterone won't just make my feet grow and keep my disugsting female curvy butt"	"Weak troll + you fell off + ratio

How do I tell my bio dad that I no longer go by my deadname (which is his name) and that I now go by Dragon?	"Hello everyone! 
My name’s Dragon, and as the title says, I’m meeting my Dad today and struggling with how to tell him. 

For background, my dad has always made homophobic/transphobic/xenophobic comments throughout my upbringing and we’ve never been close. I don’t live with him and I’ve been away at college the past few years. I haven’t talked to him since a funeral a while ago. He’s tends to always act like an emotional egotistical stubborn bull. 

Anyways, I want to change my name legally so I don’t have to deal with as much deadnaming but he pays for college so I would need him to know or else he’ll be like wtf, who’s Dragon when it comes time to pay the bill. I plan on changing my first and last name. I’m considering “Dragon Solstice” so lmk what y’all think 👀. but I only plan on telling him I’m changing my first name to avoid any more drama or emotional mess. Also he doesn’t know i’m non-binary and i’m actually starting HRT next Friday but again he’s transphobic so I’m not gonna mention it. May mention that I’m non-binary still but not gonna tell him about my transitioning out of fear he’ll remove me from his health insurance. For those wondering why I’m telling him that I’m non-binary despite him being transphobic, it’s because I can’t really explain to him I’m changing my name because I’ve found my true identity without explaining that ya know. 

But yea, you can see why I’m struggling with this lol. Any advice is welcome and thank you all!!"	"Honestly, and this is going to sound really shitty so I’m sorry in advance for being hurtful, why even get a degree if your legal name is going to be Dragon Solstice. Idk about your area but I live near Seattle which is extremely accepting, and I can’t see someone named dragon solstice getting hired for anything besides like retail or similar. They’ve done studies on different names on resumes and even an ethnic or poc sounding name will make you significantly less likely to be hired. That’s messed up and I hope that changes but people naturally will always have bias.

It would be great if we could just live our lives without worrying about what others think, but sadly that is not the world we live in. People are much more accepting of trans people now but they’re still extremely wary of those they perceive as the “bad” trans people or “SJW”. You will probably not be taken seriously in your career if you choose that name, so much so that your degree may not even matter at that point.

Sorry again. Just trying to offer a different perspective that I think is important to consider.
That is a great point. I’ve already been able to get a manager position using my first name but I can see how the last name wouldn’t be professional to others. I liked the ring of Mx. Solstice but I see your point. In terms of career I do a lot of non-profit work but I can see how that can hold me back in other industries especially so thank you for that perspective.

edit: also i understand you weren’t trying to be rude but i would next time not include “why get a degree if you’re going to change your name to __”. i’d instead say something like be mindful of how others in a professional setting may perceive your name. i think the original wording is abrasive and truth doesn’t have to be mean."	129r2xf	NonBinary	0	0.25	2023-04-02 17:00:20
