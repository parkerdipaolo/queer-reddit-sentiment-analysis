You look so beautiful my friend! I hope you have a great prom. As someone who never got to experience this, I’m sending lots of good vibes and excitement your way! 🖤
You look amazing! The color and drape of that dress is sooo nice. Is it okay to ask the circumstances of prom in July? I’m guessing I’m just ignorant of school schedules outside what I grew up with (northeast USA).
Wow that dress looks amazing on you!
You look so beautiful!! It fits you so lovely. Have a blast at prom!
oh my god that dress was made for you! chef's kiss!

Also I hope you have a ton of fun!
Omg it looks awesome! Are you adding some accessories? I could see you looking really ethereal with a little tiara or small wispy flower crown.
OMG YES
😍😍😍
beautiful!
It looks very elegant
That dress looks amazing on you. The color is great on your skin tone. It also compliments your shape and your arms perfectly. Very flattering. Have a great prom!

You look gorgeous ☺ 📷
OMG YOU LOOK SO WONDERFUL IN IT!
wow you look so good😍
Oh god it looks amazing on you! 

Your skin and hair really amplifies the deepness of the red colour, so it gets a hue which seems more like the deep red of an an aged kriek lambic than the sparkling red of a red wine.
so pretty 🥺🥺🥺🥺 hope u feel comfortable and happy on your prom day!
that suits you so perfectly!

i’ll never look feminine in terms of body/face/etc to pull off a look like that tho
you look amazing
You look amazing!! 💖💖💖💖
You look lovely 💕

Im sobbing! My heartttttt
AMAzing😍😍😍💝💝💝
Cowl neck dresses and box cut dresses are super flattering imo
You look great!!! If you end up wearing heals bring socks to change into when your feet eventually start hurting. Better then walking around completely barefoot haha
Looking lovely!!!
Yes yes yes I love this so much, the colour looks great on you! What’s the shoe situation?!
You look great
this would look so amazing with a corset oh my god (no pressure, you already look great!)
its really pretty, i suggest wearing gold heels and a gold necklace to match your nails and keep your dress from getting dirty \^\_\^
Shoulders back, and spine straight! Confidence will bring out the stunning elegance
Omg! You look amazing!!!!

MY SCHOOL’S HOMECOMING IS SOON. GIVE ME TIPS ON HOW TO LOOK THIS FLAWLESS
thank you :)
thank you :)
Prom is next Friday, so more pictures will follow after that
thank you :)
Prom is next Friday, so more pictures will follow after that
I'm sure that one day you will. Half a year ago I didn't even had the confidence to go to school with painted nails and you see at what a point I am now, you just need time for that :)
thank you :)
I'm living in Germany and our sommer holidays begin later than yours and our final exams have been delays by 4 weeks due to Corona, so thats why we have Prom in july
i wish i was brave enough to do this
Keep on bro
I'm glad you made so much progress! I'm going to need a lot longer than you did tho. I'll get there eventually
Thanks, TIL! I hope your prom is everything you want it to be.
one day you'll be too, you just need time for that. Half a year ago I didn't even had the confidence to wear painted nails in school and now I'm here with my dress and ready to rock the prom and so will you one day :)
Just take your time, it only matters that you'll be there one day, not how much time it needed. Tbh I'm pretty sure I would have needed way more time, if my family and friends hadn't been that supportive
It's sad when a random reddit stranger is more supportive than my family. Thank you, kind person
I'm sorry to hear that, do you have at least any friend that support you (if you already told them)? Because it really helped me a lot to talk about all that stuff with my best friend
Very few, but they're good friends. The problem is when my best friend makes me feel like I can do anything, my family brings my confidence right back down. 2 steps forward, 1 step back. I'll get there soon enough. For now, I'll just focus on making a beautiful dress I can rock at my graduation in a couple years
ok that's at least something, I really can't imagine how hard that must be, but I'm glad to hear that you still make progress, you really can be proud of yourself for that. I'm sure you will be the most beautiful person at your graduation, you'll rock that :)"	ohfytl	NonBinary	5497	1.0	2021-07-10 10:01:56
Sooo yesterday was my bday, and a rarely ever dress up, but these pictures gave me the biggest wave of gender euphoria. Heckin im so happy		"Your hair is absolutely amazing!
First off I love your hair. Second you look absolutely amazing in these pictures. And third there is just this sense of euphoria that I got from these pictures just looking at them before reading your title (the first one I saw before I read it but then looked through them) that I just wanted to give you a big celebratory hug for the happiness you were giving off. It always makes me so happy to see others happy to be themselves. Happy birthday. I hope you’re able to have more days of this gender euphoria.
Hey so I saw a thing asking how I did my hair, so I used artic fox dye first. I used electric paradise, ultra violet, poseidon, and aquamarine. And just added each to a part of my hair and kinda mixed it together with my hands. Thank you all for being so kind and loving its made the feeling even better.
Happy birthday!
Happy belated birthday!! You look amazing! I love your outfit and hair!
You BELONG in a bow tie, skirt, and thigh high socks, my friend. What a look!
For the Alliance.

What I'd give to have hair like yours! Not only does it look so fluffy but the colors are amazing!! I wish my workplace allowed unnatural hair dye colors so I can rep the bi pride too with my hair! One day though, I'll convince them one day!

I did it! For the first time I legitimately, confidently came out to someone today. I told them my name, I told them my pronouns, I didn't back down, and I didn't doubt myself. Finn the Human is one happy enby rn!		"Finn is such a great name! And your hair! And your smile! Aaah, everything is so great in the picture it just makes me smile, thanks for that
 What are your pronouns? I’m still struggling with this
OMG I LOVE ADVENTRUE TIME
PRETTY ENBY PRETTY ENBY
Yessss. Well done!! I'm so proud of you
you are really adorable (no romo). and the name Finn really suits you :)
Hi Finn! Well done! :D
Yes!! Good job!!
:D
Get a dog and name it jake
Finn you are so rad
For a minute, my brain blanked and I tried long-pressing the ⬆️ because I was trying to make it into a ♥️! You look so happy and I am 100% Here For This Joy.
Did you choose Finn because of the NB child from She-ra?
Well I’m proud of you, Finn! 
Stick up for yourself, you deserve it ☺️
You look like Shane from The L word! I had such a crush on her 🤣💓
Heck yeah!
Good 👍
Congrats Finn!
Congratulations! It’s really liberating to do so, and helps build real connection with people in my experience. Good for you! 😊
Love the name! And congrats so much!
so happy for you!! your hair and your smile are magnificent, and the name finn really suits you.
Congrats! Also, our names rhyme. Finn and Quinn!!! :)
Hell yeah, Finn! Welcome to the club ❤️
You're so pretty :D
This is awesome. Way to go Finn!! ✨✨✨✨
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Proud of you!! Please reach out if you need anything :)
I remember when that happened to me for the first time. I didn’t even know that much serotonin was possible
Good job Finn!
So proud of you, you go Finn!!
Congratulations! Let me just say that you look so happy, that it makes me smile too.
whoa congrats :) very proud of you :) also Finn is a really cool name :D
Congrats!  I know the feeling. My work recently updated their policy on pronouns. Like just the proper way to put them in emails/for your Zoom name.

I hadn't really told anyone at work I'm non-binary. But visibility matters. So I changed both my email signature and Zoom name to include (They/Them). 

It seems like such a small thing to some. But it felt really confirming to me!
Sorry, I'm a bit late to this post... I saw it on my notifications and clicked so I can look at it later but didn't get a chance yesterday. When I saw this pop up in my notifications I knew I just had to see it and congratulate you! So congratulations! It takes so much courage to do that, something I'm still struggling with. I've only come out to one person, my best friend, so far and I haven't even told them the name I'm thinking of. So I really admire and look up to people like you. Thank you for sharing this to Reddit, seeing this has given me the confidence boost I needed. Have a great day Finn the Human, and good luck with coming out to more people. <3
You're an inspiration ✨
Hiii fellow Finn! 
You have a great taste in choosing names. 

-another enby Finn
Congrats Finn! The first time is always the hardest, you did really well 💜
WAIT UR SO PRETTY XIFJGJGJSHCJXHDH V
Just to make sure. your name is Finn, right?
you're radiant! I'm so happy for you!!
🎵The fun that never ends🎶
I had to correct my pronouns to my dentist when I was under sleepy gas right before an operation probably the weirdest coming out story so far 😅
ahhhhh you're so cute uwu
Finn is absolutely my favorite name of all time!
Never seen someone with irl anime hair
Hi Finn the human!! I'm so proud of you!! Great job on coming out! Many more years of happy non-binary-ing to you, my friend!

Love, Finn*ly* the human
Yesss!!! I’m so proud of you, Finn! Nice to meet you, I’m Kai!💕
Oh my god, you look fricking awesome! Can u tell me some tips on how to be enby and look this way?
Did you come out to ""Jake the Dog?"" by any chance?
Or a vampire lady?
Named after a Cartoon Network character but sort of look like a Disney channel character

I’m so confused

Also opinions on Finn in learning with pibby?
No, thank *you* :)
I prefer they/them but I'm chill with the occasional she/her. I would just say she/they, but when I do that people just ignore the they part haha.
Haha me too! That's not the reason I chose Finn but I gotta say I'm really happy about being Finn the Human
💛🤍💜🖤
Thank you!! :D
Thank you! And that's the first time I've ever seen ""no Romo"" and I love it haha :)
Thank you 😊
Thanks!! :)
Definitely thought about it haha
Haha thanks 😎👉👉
Thank you haha!! 💜🥰
No, I actually don't know that one! I just felt a strong connection to Finley (the meaning felt significant to me and it just felt right y'know?), and I enjoy the whole ""Finn the Human"" thing since I was a big Adventure Time fan haha.
Thanks! I'm so glad I did! ☺️
Haha thank you 😘
Ha, so did I!! 🤘🤘
Thank you! :)
Thank you so much! I do feel so much lighter having finally gotten it out there. I also feel much more seen and understood, it rocks :)
Thank you!!
Aw, thank you so much! ☺️
Oooh I love it!! Finn the Human and Quinn the Person? Just spit-balling, haha.
Thanks! My fav club yet :)
Thank you!! 💛🤍💜🖤
Thanks!!! 🥰
💃🕺💃🕺
You look so wonderfully happy and so beautiful!
Will do 💜
Right?! My brain is sparkling
Thank you!! :)
Aw! I'm so glad :)
Thank you! I like it quite a bit :)
That's huge, I'm so proud of you! Seriously, congratulations on asserting your identity, no matter how big it small the gesture it's a big deal every time!
Aw!! Thank you 🥺
Hey Finn! I love your name, you must be very cool.

-Finn
Thank you so much! It's a big weight off my chest :)
💛🤍💜🖤
Haha yep it is :)
Thanks ☺️
Lol yeah it's still gonna be a long run but hey. First steps are the hardest right? (I hope so lol)
Hahahah I love that! I can see it like a scene in a hilarious enby coming-of-age film. Glorious
Really?? That's awesome! I gotta say, it's definitely one of my favs now too haha
Haha thank you? Maybe?
Hey Kai, nice tie meet you too ☺️
Sure!

I used the angle of the pic to hide me chest, otherwise I wear a binder a lot and am looking into top surgery.

I use Pinterest a lot to pin pictures of hair cut/color inspirations to share with my hair dresser, now she just knows what I like so I always get a cool cut. She loves when I tell her that people say I have ""anime hair"" lol!!

I wear whatever makeup I feel like wearing, usually some eyeliner, because I've always loved makeup and I'm naturally a blonde so without makeup my eyebrows and lashes kind of disappear haha!

I color my hair at home with Arctic Fox (I use Ritual and/or Virgin Pink, but there are tons of awesome colors!) It works well for me since, again, I'm blonde, but if you have darker hair you may want to visit a salon to get it lightened up a couple levels so the color shows up (my natural is only a medium-dark blonde, so it's not like I started with platinum or anything).

And as for clothes, I get almost all my clothes from Target! Their men's section is like, enby heaven, and their women's section has great stuff too! If you dig enough into my profile you'll find tons of pics of outfits I've gotten from there. I also have sensory issues and overall I prefer things that are just simple and basic but have nice colors. Solid color or color blocked tees and hoodies are my fav! 

And that's the story of how I built my ""enby look"" lol!
[deleted]
I just don’t want to be ‘it’. The last time I said to people I was non binary, they just used my biological pronouns anyway. It was pointless.
that’s so cool go Finn the human!! my names ren and it’s from a video game lol
Well, you look just like her! 🤣💓
YES ! I love that!!!
*finger guns*

So do you :) you're probably cool af
YESS I LOVE YOUR HAIR
Well, good for you Finn!
Yes thank you. It was a compliment lmao it looks really good on you
Right?? Just femby problems haha
Yeah I've come across that a lot and I'm sure I'm going to continue to. But for now at least I've got one person making the effort haha
I love that name!!
What video game?
I'm not OP. ☺️
😎👉👉
Thank you!! ☺️
Aw well thanks that's really sweet of you to say ☺️
[deleted]
aw ty! i love ur name!!

happy last day of disability pride month from this disabled n-b trans guy		"I love your style!!
I like how your clothes match your chair! 

... bit of an odd compliment, but I also think your hands are very hand-some :P
[deleted]
if anyone’s interested, I wrote a long post on my relationship with disabled pride on [my instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/yes.ellis/) and there’s also several T updates on there (I’m 10 months on T currently). always looking for more nonbinary & trans folks to follow!
You look awesome! I love how you look.
The fit is great! 

And your hands should be illegal, dude
I love your outfit!
Cutie. Your style is poppin
You've got a coding at 3am vibe
YOooo I love your style!! Where did you get your hoodie shirt thing? (Where do you shop in general-)
Yay another queercrip in the wild

😮😮😮😮 wow you look incredible!
Damn, you're handsome !

How are you so freaking hot? Serious question
I know people keep saying this but adding one more ""goddamn I love your style"" to the pile

r/streetwear wya 👀✨
I am absolutely so in love with your entire outfit!
Happy disablity pride
Dame you look bad ass! I kind of remind me ove the game watchdogs. I think you would fit in there very well
Damn dude what a LOOK. I am obsessed! 🖤🖤🖤
You look like the guy version of Vennessa from Phineas and Ferb and i think that might be the highest compliment out there.
A fellow nb wheelchair user who also likes plants... Legit I would love to befriend you. Pm me if you feel the same. 

Either way, you keep being you, you bamf!
He’s soooo hot I’m!!!
Awe amazing
you’re so hecking cute damn
Oh gosh you're so handsome. The kind of handsome where if I tried to talk to you irl I'd get tongue tied and say something that wasn't a real word or something and then shuffle away awkwardly.
You are beauty personified
U look so cute and cool <3
Ain't nobody got business looking this good
You look so good!
hi fuck ur pretty & i love ur plamt
HOLY HELL 😳💞
U really cute
I didn't realize there was a disability pride month! I'll have to start prepping now for our 2 months of pride next year.
Hottie 😍
Out here lookin like a 

FULL COURSE

FIVE STAR

MEAL

Platonically tho mid me with that romo shit
Love the fit and your vibe! Hope you had a great and gay last day of disability pride month!!
🔥🔥🔥
I just want to say that you pass really well! Also, I LOVE that outfit
You slayyyy! 😍
I haven't read your instagram post, but thank you for posting. I am starting to have to use a cane for my disability (lupus and fibromyalgia). I've had these disabilities and pain for a long time, but I am finally taking the plunge to use a cane.

I'm 26, and people love to tell me I can't be sick. I know it will get worse when I get the cane. People will be telling me I can walk fine, etc. I am trying to mentally prepare for hearing that twice as much. 

I am grateful for this post. I feel less alone.
You look awesome and are kinda goals! Btw I love your clothing style
YES ✨
Nice, I got the same sweater, love it!
Queer cripples are the best cripples and your boots are amazing.
If you’d like to join us, r/DisabledPride is now open!
you are an inspiration
I'm I disabled in peoples minds? I got shot through the brain and the military is paying me for the rest of my life, but I'm going to college and getting decent grades and can pretty much move fine.
aesthetic af
We stan!!!!!
thank you!
haha thank you! my hands have really transformed on testosterone and I’m loving the change
aw thank you!
It's a little crazy seeing another nonbinary trans dude with a chronic illness. It's hard dealing with two issues people sometimes see as ""attention-seeking""
Just followed you. I’m always looking for other trans/non-binary disabled folks to follow!
aw thanks! I love how I look too thanks to 10 months of testosterone! it’s a good feeling
hahah thank you! be gay, do crime (like having hot hands??)
thank you!
aw thank you!
alas, I cannot code, but I’m glad I give off such a vibe
thanks! this entire outfit is from bershka lol, most of my clothes are from there + asos. bershka in particular is great as a tiny trans dude because their trousers are unusually short legged and their XS shirts fit me nicely
there’s loads of us!
aw thank you!
ah thanks!
cheers!
hahah the secret is being very vain and taking lots of photos of yourself. that + slouching a lot lol
aw thanks! the whole outfit is from bershka actually
thanks!
thanks!
aw thank you!
thank you! glad to have taught you about it’s existence!
happy to hear that!
love + solidarity to u!
well now you know!
aw thank you! the sides are due a shave but considering I haven’t been able to go to the barbers since lockdown started I think it’s looking pretty good
wow I’m honoured 💞
thanks!
hahah a combination of genetics, testosterone, confidence & good lighting I reckon?
hahah well it’s a compliment I’ll never tire of, especially since I had basically no sense of personal style pre-transition so it’s nice to have finally found what works for me and feels good
hey thanks!
pride is never ending!
hahah I’m too disabled and too trans to post over there but I do browse there from time to time, my style is definitely very streetwear influenced
aw thanks!
thanks!
I haven’t played it but I googled it and that definitely feels like a compliment so thank you!
aw cheers!
hahaha I love this
aw yes please feel free to dm me on here or IG!
hahah thank you!
hahah well that’s the kinda shit I find very cute so it’d be all good. thank you!
this is very cute thank you
*oh shit i don’t know if ur ok with being called pretty i’m sorry ur very attractive. 
i’m disabled too i have service dog & not wheelchair & i think ur style & look r swell & i hope i look something like u someday lol.
yeah I got ill at 16 so I’ve heard a lot of that. people do get a different kind of weird about it once your disability is very visible because you use a mobility aid, but you get used to it and learn to tune it out for the most part. I really hope your cane is a helpful and liberating addition to your life!
we are the best <3 thank you!
hahah how so?
yea speaking of, is this one pullover sewed together or is it a shirt beneath a pullover?
I had never seen anybody talk about hands changing, and I was so fascinated by watching my partner's hands change.
of course! and if you ever doubt it for a second my DMs are open lmao
yeah I feel you, it can be a complicated combination of things to be. my dms are open if you even wanna talk to someone who gets it!
Right there with you. I'm non binary/genderqueer and have chronic illness...we feel rare, haha. Nice to see fellow people. Especially young ones, as we get judged so much for ""faking it"".

💜 all my love to my fellow spoonies!
Ooh I'm gonna go check it out, thank you!!
definitely growing out nicely! i’m glad i started growing my hair out before lockdown, i can’t imagine how annoying the length would feel if i was trying to keep it short. i feel for all of you
Hehe fuck em. A good fit is a good fit, even they couldnt deny 😤✨
Yey awesome! I will drop you a pm here!
You’re welcome 💜
I’m cool with any kind of compliment & like to think of myself as a pretty boy so that works for me! and thank you!
your confidence radiates through this picture. I think a lot of people in your shoes or similar would be inspired. I know I am
two separate tops!
this is so cute wow
Right!
yeah it’s not ideal! it had gotten ridiculously long and was getting quite annoying because it was covering my eyes lol but my partner cut it for me a few weeks ago and it’s now a much more manageable length
thanks, i was just wonder. 
u look awesome by the way ; )
i’m glad you’ve got someone to help maintain it in the meantime! i bet a lot of us are gonna come out of this with some level of hair cutting skill haha"	i1d2tj	NonBinary	3491	1.0	2020-07-31 18:45:35

Omg, you're so pretty! You go shine (the netrual term for queen, if that exist?)
Thank you! 😊
Thank you 😇
🥺 Dankeeeee, ja wenns wieder safe ist menschen zu sehen komm vorbei auf ein tattoo haha 👉👈
Thats so cool! Can you display it somewhere?
This is way too sweet thank you 😭🖤
💛🤍💜🖤
Uhm its still a little wet in the picture because i washed it 😅 it has a life on its own and does... Strange stuff 😂🤣 so i cant give you any advice
Thank youuu 🥰🥰
Thank you so much 😊 it feels great to have my flag here and be out and proud!

That's the artists instagram 🥰
Thank you, to you to 💛🤍💜🖤🥰
I really like the term ""you magnificent what the fuck"" hahaha
Thank you so much! 🥰🥰🥰
Yesss!! I checked your profile and love your tattoos btw!
Oh wow danke für das Angebot, aber dafür müsste ich mich eh erstmal für was entscheiden 😅 (abseits davon, dass ich erstmal so oder Kontakte wegen Corona und allem zurückgeschraubt habe und mich erstmal dran gewöhnen muss, Menschen zu treffen)
Sadly no
A shit tonne of hair gel and hairspray will do it, it would be a trial and error depending on your hair type, density and thickness what products will work best. But stay away from wet look gels regardless it won't look right. If your hair is thin I'd also suggest adding a volumising foam so it doesn't look flat
Oh that’s cool, thanks for sharing!

I don’t suppose you know if they sell the print somewhere online?

I looked at the insta they linked and saw their talented work, but didn’t see any merch like this (I may just be blind though, lol)
Then, you're a magnificent specimen with a stunning haircut
👉👈 Oh wow thank you so much! 😊
I checked your profile and got gender envy 😅
Verstehe ich absolut, und no pressure 🥰 hab ich auch so halb im spaß gesagt haha
I'm sorry to hear, hugs to you
My hair is thin so I appreciate the foam tip!
Thank you for your tips, i am still on the seemlessly never ending quest of getting my hair to behave...
Puh i bought it in person at my local tattoo shop, maybe you can send him a message and ask if he would send you a print? I dont think he has a online merch store rightnow...
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💕
Aww thank youss!
if you can get hold of the giovanni 2chic ultra volume mousse it's one of the cheapest high quality products around it was a game changer for me in terms of volume. The other ones are like a minimum of double the price
It took me a long time to figure out how to look after my hair. Hair is confusing and eternally stubborn in behaving how it wants to rather than how you want it to.  Dont worry there are many people in the same boat

wearing pride flags at school 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ happy pride fellow enbys!!! - me and my friend		"I'm 27 and the fact that kids can do this at school now is just insane to me. It's beautiful, but younger-me is very jealous
I’m just sorry you guys still have school :(
Happy pride. I’m so glad you guys can be out about yourself like this. When I was a kiddo, it was definitely not like this. Glad to see my baby gays and queers living their best life ❤️
Even if school was still going I wouldn’t do that I’m not trying to get hate crimed.  I shall continue to be a kinda sneaky person.
reason #936238 of why going to a small school in a small town where there are no other LGBTQ+ people sucks and makes me feel really lonely:   
I can't do this
two people did that in my school today too
Whatever Hogwarts school this is I want in!!!!
Happy pride! You both look awesome
The dude in the back is drinking like he can't handle the queerness or is questioning his sexuality
Awesome! I did that as well with my enby flag. I was fully expecting negative reactions, but I didn't hear a single negative comment!
WOOO, Lets goo!!


~~also is homie in the back drinkin apple juice?~~
Y'all got some main character energy
spending my k-12 in rural arkansas, i would have jumped for joy at the sight of such proud, loving comrades. i’m a teacher now and wow! what inspiring students yall are. thank you both for being you and shining your light on everything you love 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 solidarity from colorado
I am not in school anymore, didn't even know who I was at that point, dunno what people would say about me, so hope everybody respects you for who you are!
Look at you little Qtees!! Good for you. 👏
Lmao do all classrooms have that exact same cupboard? Straight up thought this was my school but the roof is different lol
Ygs look great!! :0 Happy pride 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Eyyyy! Happy pride y’all!!! I love both of ur hair sm, absolutely killing it! Glad ur school/area is supportive :3
You both look amazing!!
Hell yeah! You rock that shit!
Woooooow I didn't even have the guts to wear a pride pin in HS 0\_0

Congrats!
:O this is amazing
DM me (or have your parents do it!) And I'll crochet you guys some rainbow shawls! So you don't have to hold that thing up all day! 😊
Damn my best friend and I were closeted all throughout high school 😔 you two are absolutely rocking those flags
i’d do this every frikin day but i don’t want to have to iron my flag again lmao
You enbys are adorable!
So AMAZING! I wish my school would let us do that- we tried and apparently it’s “inappropriate”. I’m so happy you guys get to show your colours.
I'm 20; my experience was that you'd definitely catch some shit for being flamboyant, but any open homophobia would get somebody shunned. There was definitely still the ""ram it down"" sentiment, though.

It's great if you're in school and you find yourself a queer group of friends (or if you find a group of friends before any of you know, and then it turns out that queer magnetism just happened)
Same age! I’m so proud of all the teens openly expressing themselves. When we were younger that would’ve been a big no. I’m also a bit jealous haha
I'm 44  and this is mind blowing to me. I'm very excited for these new gays and such, they can be and assert what they want. It's so amazing.
I'm 35 and my fucking jaw dropped seeing this. This is incredible and would have helped me accept myself much earlier in life. So happy these kids have an environment and friends that allow them to be so expressive!
me too we get out next week tho
we’re lucky we live in a supportive area
Mood. I was already bullied for because I'm autistic and ""acting weird"" in my small town, also for having an eating disorder so yeah would have never taken that risk. I'm presenting as GNC now and that's probably the furthest I'll go before moving away but yeah would have never done that when I was in school and would have had to talk to people.
yea lmao
i didnt iron mine kdjsjs
lmao it really is like this, every kid i sat with in high school was “straight” and now we’re all queer
Oh yeah indeed, I'm 19 and still friends with the queer peeps I made in HS
Same
I'm autistic, too~

(@TheyRiddleMe on ig)
Thank you!! 🖤
Isn’t it great?? It makes me so happy how much more I’ve seen nonbinary identities being accepted! I really want to get myself out there more so we can normalize these identities!
Thank you so much, I’m so excited!!
If u wanna DM me I can send you details about it!
Aw thank you so much!!🖤
Genuine question - why do some people refer to us as NB folx rather than NB folks? Folks is gender neutral on its own, I don't see what the X adds? (I am NB for reference, I just genuinely don't know why uwu)
Of course!! I’m really hoping to get myself out there more in the future to help normalize nonbinary identities while doing what I love!
Heck yeah mullet gang ftw!!
yes i want to run a business and encourage ppl who are being hated because of their identity to make it as we can do this
It's a dogwhistle. By going out of one's way to use language ""targeted at"" minorities, you're telling those minorities that you support them, usually in a way that might go unnoticed by the general public.
Ummm I’ve seen some ppl say that using “folx” is a direct not to genderqueer identities, personally as an enby I use folx cuz I like the spelling uwu
Having only heard of dogwhistling in the context of neo-nazis, it's a trip finding out I'm the target for a change.
Yes ""folks"" itself is not necessarily excluding anyone, but the spelling of ""folx"" is to include minorities, particularly POC and trans people.
There are all kinds of dogwhistles. Any kind of language which would ""catch the ear"" of a particular group in a surreptitious way can be called a ""dogwistle.""
but like how is folks not already inclusive of them?
By definition it's not excluding anyone, but for minorities our inclusion is never guaranteed. For example, there are TERFs who say folks when addressing an audience, but they are definitely not including trans women. Using ""folx"" is a very small way to purposefully include minority communities.
wow thanks a lot yeah that actually makes sense
So it would be similar to the difference between the rainbow pride flag and the one with the trans chevron and poc stripes?
Yes that's a great analogy! I believe that is called the progress pride flag."	k3e4fk	NonBinary	2845	1.0	2020-11-29 18:11:16

I wish you so much courage and fortune on this next step! And know that you can always stop if it turns out to not be for you.
Good luck! It must be scary but the only way you find out what you want is by taking a leap. I hope you find it as helpful as many others do :) Your style is so epic by the way. I'm missing my blue hair anyway and you just made it look ten times better!
Omg your T day is gonna be the day after enby day, that's amazing! 


You got this. 


It's a rough ride but the feelings of relief start immediately. Will you be doing the weekly shots, or something else? 


Been on T close to a decade, please feel free to PM me if there's anything I can help with.
I started HRT about 45 days ago. Already been a ride. It’s fine to be a bit scared. You should be more worried if it didn’t make you feel things. Make sure to pat yourself on the back for making it this far. Good luck. And a happy transition!
HELL YEAH, I LOVE YOUR LOOK SM! GOOD LUCK:)))

The same for non-binary people, you don’t need dysphoria! Happy pride month!		"That’s what said to myself. And that’s how it all started for me. Then I came out to my wife. Hello dysphoria. Come out to a couple friends. Oh what’s this, yes even more dysphoria. As I become more comfortable accepting I am a woman, I am less and leas comfortable with my body or social mentioning of maleness. I hate being called sir!  Right now I am not out of the world so the sir thing happens all the time and it hurts every time. I never expected that at all.
Also, keep in mind that many trans people don’t experience dysphoria until AFTER their eggs crack. Just because you don’t experience dysphoria now does not mean that you won’t. Also, chances are high that you have experienced dysphoria and you haven't even realized it. This twitter thread lists some common ways people experience dysphoria without knowing it: https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215740224325783553
You hear that, Dysphoria? I don't need you, go away!
You know, I presented this idea to an ex of mine (who is trans), and she completely shot me down with 'no, your not trans' and stopped answering my questions or even acknowledging that I was talking, so I really needed to hear this op. Thank you. Enjoy my first paid award :)
Personally, I've never felt any gender euphoria. I just know of it, but that's it. I've only ever felt dysphoria. 

I'm happy for people who feel gender euphoria, but it's not like one is a better indicator than the other. They're just two sides of the same coin.
An important lesson I have learned is that ‘gender dysphoria’ doesn’t always indicate that you want to undergo physical transition. For many folks, dysphoria is about the separation of their perception of themself from that of the outside world, which can often be addressed with a change in pronouns or presentation, or even simply having their identity acknowledged. 

There is a misconception that dysphoria means “wants bottom surgery,” or “wants to fully transition,” but like trans identity itself, dysphoria is a spectrum. 

For example, I don’t personally want to medically transition, but I do feel deep dysphoria over the way my body is perceived and the social and cultural expectations that are placed on me as a result.
I didn't start getting dysphoria until recently when I cracked the nonbinary egg and now I feel it with my deadname, sometimes top dysphoria, in my experience it's like a lancing feeling in my chest and it hurts like hell.  I wish I had a more feminine body but like with broad shoulders?  I dunno that makes no sense.
I have no euphoria or dysphoria I'm just so indifferent / neutral either way but know assigned gender fits less than being non-binary.

No one way of being!
This! It never occurred to me that I might be trans, I just always considered myself a ""tomboy"" until the first time I did masc makeup for a cosplay and was like:

This is me. This is who I want to see when I look in the mirror. Look at how handsome I am!
you also don't need euphoria to be trans. (btw, if ur trans u innately have dysphoria. it may not be physical dysphoria and it may not be very strong, but its obviously there otherwise u wouldnt go through all the tough stuff that is included with being trans. for example, if a set of pronouns make u feel icky, thats dysphoria)
euphoria made me realise I was non-binary too!
I think this is kind of a misunderstanding of dysphoria/euphoria. It’s both the same coin, just two sides of it. I think any trans person means with dysphoria basically you feel different than your AGAB, if that isn’t the case, why ID as trans/enby
It depends what you see as euphoria because for me is really rare to be hyper happy I never had the magical aha moment for the topical things . I can be happy to wear binder for example but I never had the revelation moment
I have a lot of dysphoria with the male sex... I don't know if I am a trans girl or just am non-binary... I can only say that this makes me feel suicidal... It's been long 17 years of depression :(
I didn't have dysphoria when I first realised. I was happy for months! Then my mum found out that I was non-binary, and gave me so much dysphoria that last night I almost cried after realising that I can't move out yet. :)
Euphoria really helped me realise that I'm non binary. (With the pronouns he/they) and since I am not out at home I have people in the internet call me my preferred pronouns and name(moss) and it gives me so much euphoria that it helps combat the dysphoria that I don't have to deal with alot. And if I ever get questioned ""it's just an oc for roleplay(cause I'm in that community)"" or ""it's just a fake online name"".
Exactly! We shouldn’t define people by how much pain they’re in.
One of my earliest memories of feeling like I wasn't the gender I was assigned was when I was 8 and had my hair cut into a short pixie. I wore cargo shorts and baggy tshirts and I was ecstatic whenever anyone mistook me for a boy. And now as I live my life as a nonbinary person, if anything I feel dysphoric only because I know I won't be seen as anything other than a woman by society unless I medically transition, which I don't really want to do anyway. I guess that's more like social dysphoria...?
Exactly, why should we base our transness on suffering instead of joy?
Aaa this is so validating, thank you!! I get tons of euphoria from wearing a binder and thinking about getting top surgery one day (I’m AFAB), but I don’t feel dysphoria from the way I am now!
also this is a little reminder that gender dysphoria doesn't make you trans/not cis ! nobody can tell you if your identity is valid or not, only you can know who you truly are !
Is euphoria not an indicator of dysphoria? Genuine question. And even if you don’t need dysphoria to be trans, do you need gender incongruence? Thanks.
I’m having some conflicting things going on with trying to understand myself. I’m not sure if it’s jut the fact people have been using my name more often but I feel a deep sorta “cringe” whenever I hear someone say it. My non binary name is silly though so I don’t want to make people use it
One of the things that helped me realise I was nonbinary was recognising that I experience gender euphoria. I do get dysphoria sometimes, but that’s more to do with socialising and being perceived in a way I’m not always comfortable with, which then starts the feelings towards my body. I don’t want to be treated as a cis woman because I’m not, and that can be so draining and painful because it makes me doubt myself.

Working out what sparks *euphoria* instead in me and trying to encourage that as much as possible has absolutely turned my life around. I feel like for the first time since puberty really I’m comfortable in my own skin, I’m not confused about who I am anymore, I’m taking everything each day at a time but I just feel so much happier and lighter.
Someone really needs to explain this to my doctor. ""I am here to help PeOpLe WhO AcTouLy NeEd It"".
Euphoria figured it out for me. Dysphoria came after when I realised what I'd been suppressing for 25 years. So eggs, follow the euphoria.
I haven’t ever felt euphoria yet though because after 5 years I still can’t transition at all…
That's great to know! \^ \^I would have experienced Euphoria from the sports bra I ordered... if it wasn't so small for me🙃
Ahh screams, yes! You dont even need to want to change your body to be trans, just be you 💞 you're amazing, if yera trans dude but atill wanna rock this tibbies? Frikennrock those tibbies you look fantastic ! If yer a trans women but dont wanna part with yer epic peepee? Then don't ! Keep the shlong, it makes you happy so who cares what others think?
Hecc even if you tuly identify as an airplane or tree, go ahead ! Just recognize you are in a human body and don't hurt yourself and others! I love you all bishes.
I always feel so happy for people who don’t experience dysphoria but also a little jealous. I wish I only had euphoria but instead it’s a rare experience 😔
I have an amazing little skip in my chest every time someone addresses me as ""they"". It's a great indicator indeed.
I'm not sure if it's considered having dysphoria, but I had the longest time this obsession to be ""normal"". Then realized that my normal is being nonbinary asexual and wow! The euphoria just keeps overflowing. 😄✌️
For me, I didn’t necessarily feel dysphoric when presenting fully masculine (i.e. suits are swag as hell) but my distress stemmed from feeling unable to express my femininity.

I still consider myself to have dysphoria, but I suppose it may be more accurate to say I hate the limitations that maleness placed on acceptable sources of euphoria.
I made a whole podcast episode about this and why my partner (a trans woman) and I (enby, genderfluid) think this should be the norm!! I'll link incase you want to listen, but I couldn't agree more with what you're saying!!

https://pca.st/episode/d2306512-9924-4b53-afbb-51ba4af8c913
I love this! Each individual's story is unique and personal to them. You do not have to check off any specific box to be who you are! This is a wonderfully positive message :)

For anyone who does struggle with dysphoria and is needing some help, I just finished reading this and it was quite an excellent little short read!

I'm asking myself if I can get a mastectomy, even if I don't feel that strong disphoria. It would just feel better...

Bro why would anyone put themself through the stress of dealing with doctors and insurance and becoming broke and coming out to family and going through medical treatment if they weren’t experiencing dysphoria?
[removed]
Is there some symbolism with the lack of neck stitching stuff on the 4th panel, like them feeling more connected to themself and their body by having the confidence and will to determine their own identity, or was it just an accident? Either way, death of the author. Good touch.
I am not trying to attack anyone but if you don't have gender dysphoria and you're happy with your gender why promote change?
I sadly know exactly what you mean…. I feel the same even tho an a much less big scale, i wish you best of luck that it soon gets better and you can feel more comfortable!
Same! I spent 30 years either not noticing or not experiencing dysphoria, and it's only as I began to experience gender euphoria that the dysphoria has started to rear up.
I’ve been feeling like I might be a man for years, but the dysphoria hurt so much when I started actually exploring my gender, that I just started suppressing it by going back to being a “woman” for a couple years. It’s coming back though and now I don’t know what to do because I can’t tell if I’m male or nonbinary. I’d prefer living as a man and identifying as such but I can’t find a way to tell if I actually *am* one.
Same here! Figured out I'm nonbinary and didn't think I'd have to change pronouns but the longer time goes and the more I peel back the layers that were covering up, well, me, the more I began to really have a distain toward things that hadn't bothered me.
I'd always hated my chest but thought that's because they're H at this point and that's freaking ridiculous... never really thought of that as disphoria but shit I guess it might be.. excuse me while I spiral for a bit
Me to my therapist: “Well, I don’t really experience dysphoria. I just feel like the way I see myself and my gender and the way society sees me don’t match up and it’s really frustrating.”

My therapist: “Well, that is gender dysphoria.”

Me: “Ohhhhh...”
Damn while I knew on some level that my extensive depersonalization was related to my immense dysphoria, I never gave it any thought as I didn't see the point. This was an interesting read to say the least.
Thank you so much for sharing this! I was positive I was going to read that thread and not relate to any of the experiences that were talked about but almost every single one hit me like a freight train. Things I was doing since I was a CHILD were mentioned there as signs of possibly being trans and I think I'm starting to question how much of myself is identifying as nonbinary but might actually be full on trans. Its extremely scared on one hand. I cannot possibly ever get the necessary help I need if I am, I am financially broke and I do not live in a location surrounded by people who would be supportive, and I fear I never will anytime soon. But on the other, I'm finally beginning to understand myself, and all I want in life is to find out who I am and love myself for it.
Thank you so much for this. I'm not crying. Okay I'm crying.
Just say no your dysphoria can’t legally harm you without consent! Just threaten it with a lawyer!
Thank God it's an ""Ex""
Yes that is totally right, there is no one indicator that everyone needs to have
Social dysphoria is where most of my dysphoria comes from, too. Being perceived as a woman based on the body I have seriously fucks with me. My new name and pronouns helped a *lot*, and I’ve had my hair short for like 8 years, even before I truly cracked and came out lol
Exactly. I’m a trans man and I recently decided I won’t be medically transitioning with hormones. I’ll get top surgery for my own comfort but I’m technically choosing to go back in the closet for future interactions even though I’ve been out socially for over five years.

My decision has been a drastically odd one in my community - I am going to stick out like a sore thumb. And I don’t care.

My dysphoria is still present, but I personally have learned I would rather manage it with a combination of good mental health practices and exercise than be visibly trans. My reasons are inherently selfish but that’s my prerogative. I don’t want to be a target, I want to travel all over the world with no issues, and I don’t want to be beholden to hormones for my entire life.

Dysphoria is so varied and how it is managed is varied too. I was convinced for 5 years the only way to treat my dysphoria was to medically transition. I still think for the vast majority of binary trans people that is the best option. But not for me. 

I wish I had realised I don’t need to tell everyone about my gender earlier. I felt for so long that I was being dishonest by not telling people I was trans, so I forced myself out of the closet way before I was ready.

Now I am going back in, and I’m staying there except for with a few close friends and family. I don’t feel everyone is entitled to know my gender just by looking at me. It’s private. They can address me as a woman and she/her and it won’t change who I am. 

I’m happy to be at this point but I know everyone’s dysphoria tolerance level is different and so I would never offer this up as a prescriptive “quick fix”. 

I hope people learn that dysphoria is hugely varied and what it means to an individual is just that - individual and wholly unique.
I get that people keep saying ""dysphoria is diverse"" which is true ofc but let people say how they feel in the ways they want to.
Exactly this! You don’t have to feel horrible about who you are right now to know that you would be much happier Beeing someone else! Happy for you that you found out who you really are!
Yeah, this is why the phrasing of ""you don't need dysphoria"" can be confusing. 

You need either dysphoria or euphoria to be trans. Most people experience both in some capacity. However, either one may go unnoticed or unrecognized. Therefore, if you do not notice dysphoria for any reason, but do notice euphoria, you may be trans. If you notice dysphoria, but don't notice euphoria for any reason, you may be trans. If you don't have either, you're probably not trans.
For the first time I hear someone saying you don't need euphoria too. I doubt a lot and lack of prominent burst of happiness euphoria and clear dysphoria makes it so hard for me
I never understood this, but as it's recently been explained to me:

All trans people experience dysphoria in some form, however, dysphoria is sometimes undetectable. The person might not recognize what it is, it might be covered up or meshed in with other body image issues, or it might not be noticeable when compared to other emotional/mental health problems. Therefore, while dysphoria can be an indicator that you are trans, it is not the only indicator, nor the most reliable one.

For me, my dysphoria has been very obvious to me since I was a child, even before I had the vocabulary or knowledge to describe what being transgender meant. I've also experienced very few emotional/mental health trials outside of experiences related to being trans. So I never understood how someone could ""not have"" dysphoria.
I think people use the term gender incongruence for that, but i may be wrong. Not my first language sorry
It also depends what you see as feeling bad enough to be real dysphoria,I often spiral into doubt and avoid saying thst I have dysphoria same with euphoria I can be happy for something but because it isn't the big big happiness I feel like it isn't what it is supposed to be
Sending love 💕
Screw this imma come out
Update: I'm still closted, my mom didn't understand it and if she does then she's ignoring it
You don’t have to feel horrible in you body to know that you feel better as someone with another sex so you can be just ok with your body but wanting to have the body of a boy instead
Oh how I hate medical staff who are like this…. If you don’t want to help people who suffer you should have picked a different job….
I think if there is norm people will spiral in doubt no matter the norm. Not having euphoria also can make you doubt especially if you expect the magical I know it /this is right moment and it never comes
It depends, I see myself as trans and non binary what is with the definition of the word completely right but not every non binary person wants to see themself as trans
Medical transition doesn't equal being nonbinary or trans. This post is about the identity, not the process of transition. They are not synonymous and you can be nonbinary or binary trans without medically transitioning.
Nah this isn't it
Don’t having dysphoria don’t mean beeing happy with your gender
Because while wearing a burlap sack is ok, wearing a cotton outfit is infinitely better
Wow another late comer. I’m 40 and am just figuring it out. It’s a mindfuck. Of course you add everything up and can’t believe that you can’t see it. No CIs males don’t fantasy they are a woman every night with a name and picture in their mind all their lives just to fall asleep. No boys don’t think about how an accident could happen to their genitalia that would force a doctor to make them a girl. It’s like 2+2=4 not 7. And I’ve been saying it’s 7 all my life and if you said it wasn’t then I was going to change my behavior whether conscious or unconscious to conform. Society fucks us up big time.
The beauty of this life, if you're safe to do so, you can explore! Try the pronouns on for size around safe and trusted people in your life. We can always change our minds, exploring your gender doesn't always need confidence to jumping from one side to the other, though that is also a ok if it feels right to you:) 
I just want to repeat, we can change our minds and there is no shame or harm in that. 
What was it that hurt about exploring your gender in the past? Feel free to msg
Me too!
[deleted]
woah thank you for this. I've been dancing around exactly that thought for weeks now. Reading this made me surprisingly burst into tears. Thanks :)
I feel this way but my imposter syndrome says that all cis women feel this way because of misogny or whatever. I don't actually think I feel this way because of that, my social dysphoria is about being straight up seen as a woman at all because I'm agender and hate being seen as gendered in any way. It's distressing to even see people suggest 'female' has to equal woman or to group me with women. But of course my brain is like 'But! But! But!'. Tiring. It's like my brain can accept every other trans person's identification of their own experiences as dysphoria, but with me, it *has* to be something else, it *can't* be dysphoria, it's almost like it's not allowed to be. Very frustrating. I'm tired of my brain.
Good idea! Lemme teach that fucker a lesson!
Ace Attorney: the Dysphoric Turnabout
In fact, I dumped her before that week ended. After that non-discussion, we ended up getting in a huge fight a few days later over something unrelated and I decided to walk away.
“Social dysphoria” is a great way to describe it. I feel fine with my body, but not the way my body lines up with my socialization. 

And just to be totally clear, there’s no WRONG way to be trans or nonbinary and no wrong way to find that identity! No one is more or less valid based on their reasons for their identity or presentation!
Reading this actually made me feel a bit better because I live in a context where I can't be out and likely can't medically transition even if I wanted to. Seeing other options that still involve me being who I am and sharing that with the people that are important but also managing my dysphoria and identity in other ways is very helpful. I used to think the only choice I had was deny my identity entirely.

I also think this is helpful for nonbinary folks with dysphoria that can't be helped by medical transition (because most transition makes you masculine or feminine, and if that isn't your identity, then what? I'm agender, there are no surgeries to make me pass as agender). And also enbies who will never be correctly gendered by strangers because they can't 'pass' as not a man or woman (most people don't even knowing being nonbinary exists, so there is no passing for most of us, especially those of us who aren't transfemme or transmasc and wouldn't be happy passing as binary genders). I wish this was talked about more. I need to learn to cope with social dysphoria because I'm never going to pass as my actual gender. I understand the trans communities focus on medical transition because it's what most trans people need, but there need to be discussions about others ways to cope for those of us whom transition won't work for.
I think your final statement sums it all up. Our identities are a spectrum, and our needs and expressions related to our identities evolve over time. The only thing we HAVE to be is ourselves, however we wish to do so, whatever that means for each person.

I stated this in another comment, but what is important to me most of all is that trans people deserve access to any kind of identity affirming care we need, be it medical transition, HRT, legal transition, trans-affirming counseling, down to safe and independent housing, as a matter of human rights.

Which aspects of that we all need and wish to take part in comes down to the individual, but the access to care ought to be universal.
mhm! and if u notice one, u definitely Have the other as well even if u can't recognize it.
It's also prescriptive to say ""all trans people experience dysphoria"". Even if true in whatever way, people should be able to express their own experiences in their own way. I don't have dysphoria even if people say ""I have to"" and explain whatever I'm feeling as dysphoria. It doesn't bother me but I know it does bother others, if that makes sense.
No you’re right, people do use that word for that. What I meant to say is when people say dysphoria, they usually mean gender incongruence
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ proud of you
That is totally fair!! I just think euphoria is a more widely held experience among the trans/gender expansive community, and just a less medicalized & less painful metric to focus on if we have to focus on something. However, I absolutely agree with you - at the end of the day, a person is trans if they identity as trans regardless of ANY other metrics :)

I have had some sort of facial hair for a large part of my adult life. At this point however, I want to claw any hint of shadow out of my face. It's weird, but I actually feel a direction now, and I care about myself so much more.
> Of course you add everything up and can’t believe that you can’t see it.

Just want to note for the benefit anyone questioning that this is not always the case.
Sometimes you don't have memories that provide clues that you're trans.
Definitely an egg cracking moment for me lmfao. 

I would sit there thinking “Wow it seems so freeing to be nonbinary, that just makes so much sense and I really relate to how nonbinary people seem to feel. Too bad I am cis!” without just... taking that one step of realization.
I believe if you are seeking medical transition or hormone therapy, the focus will be on physical dysphoria for which HRT or medical transition is an effective and appropriate treatment, so if that is why you were visiting that psychologist, that may be why they focused specifically on parsing whether you experience dysphoria for which HRT or medical transition is an effective treatment.

If not, it could be the case that, because you are seeking a medical waiver of some kind, the doctor is employing a much stricter view of the concept of “dysphoria” in order to limit the number of medical waivers granted for these reasons.

Or they could just be a doctor with a particularly limited view of what it means to be trans or nonbinary based on transmedicalist ideas. 

Either way, social dysphoria (as someone in another comment aptly referred to it) is very real, and doesn’t always overlap with physical dysphoria. But it also may be treated through methods other than HRT or medical transition, which may not be an appropriate treatment for people experiencing social dysphoria.

That said, I believe people know what they want, and who they want to be, and I trust any trans person’s view of themself and their needs.

eta: why would I be downvoted? I don’t know this person’s experience or story, which is why I spoke in general terms about why we may have had different experiences with different doctors, and why different doctors may take differing views, which seemed like what was in question.
I hope they are relieved or happy tears! I had a similar moment when I got this message. I hope the next steps of your journey are beautiful and affirming!
The idea of “imposter syndrome” is totally relatable to me. I had this thought process like, “Yes, I am dissatisfied with the perception of my gender by society, and I feel distress over the implications and expectations my gendered socialization has placed on me because of my body, but I would KNOW if I was trans and nonbinary, so because I’m only questioning, that can’t be me.”

Of course, the idea that trans and nonbinary people inherently know their identity and don’t go through long, always evolving periods of questioning is totally a fallacy on my part, a thought I gave myself to compartmentalize the challenges I knew I would (and have) face in confronting the part of me that had been questioning for so long.

I feel very thankful that I have a therapist that I got comfortable with through treating my anxiety and other stuff that I was eventually able to bring it up and work through it in a positive, trans-affirming way. I know most folks don’t have access to resources like that but I wish so bad that everyone did.
my trans phoenix headcanon is quaking
I totally get you and have solidarity with you. A big part of my decision was feeling distanced from cis men, and that my identity as a man wasn’t the same as theirs. It’s why I’m in this sub and have even told some people I’m nonbinary to make it easier for them to “deal with me”. 

Gender is so complex. I can’t fully ever imagine being able to look and be recognised as who I am in my mind. So I am settling for something simpler. 

There is a rhetoric of bravery regarding medical transition and visible transness in our communities and whilst I think that narrative is useful, it’s not prescriptive and we can’t all be beholden to it. I’m not less brave because I chose not to transition with testosterone. I’m not less trans because I don’t come out. 

I know much of our discourse is, as you said, centred around progression and ensuring trans healthcare is even available in its most basic sense. But I wish we could talk as a community more openly about other options without being shot down, or even worse shoved into the same corner as terfs. 

Like, dude. I’m from the UK. It’s basically TERF island. I know my view on “accepting my body” is drastically more complex than the average “adult female human” believes it to be. 

I want my voice and others like mine amplified too, so these people don’t end up painting trans people in two camps - medically transitioned and “detransitioned because they got it wrong.” 

It’s not the case. Our choices and experiences are so complex.
Yeah definitely depends on who youre talking to. But i agree :)
Thank you! My mom just said ""thanks"" lol
I have big problem with that both sides I overanalyze them and spiral into medicalist thinking
What do you mean it makes cis people get dysphoria? GNC people who are transitioning aren't cis by definition (unless they choose to identify that way which is also ok) but are also entitled to hormonal therapy? Policing someone's gender/gender expression is the dangerous thing here.
I can relate to this *so* much.

I, too, wore a beard from adolescence until the end of last year. I hated my chin, and the beard helped hide it. Nevermind that it made me look **more** masculine, I just didn't care enough to shave it and doing nothing was easy. 

Before allowing myself to come to terms with the notion that I'm trans, I just sort of... Coasted through life, doing the bare minimum, playing it safe. Since my egg cracked, I've been paying so much attention to my health - I'm dieting (properly), taking care of my skin and hair, and cut out alcohol abuse. Working on quitting smoking next. 

Discovering who you are gives you a purpose and the resolve to meet your destiny head-on, and I couldn't be more excited.
I get this!  Shave it. You will feel better. I did this weekend.
This makes me think of the way Daniel Lavery has written about the time before he started to transition, which really hit home for me: “I wish I were trans, then I could transition! But since I’m not, I guess I’ll just have to keep THINKING about transition all the time, without actually doing anything.” y’all: if you think all the time that you’d really love to be trans, nonbinary, etc. — congrats, you can be, and very likely already are!
I had my first gender-affirming therapy Appt last week, he said “well you seem really all over the place, and I haven’t heard you just SAY that you’re non-binary. If you could just take away all the guilt and external factors, how would you like to present?” 
And I’m like “uhhhh... like this. I’m still having a hard time understanding it myself, I can’t think of any other way to be.”
Big think lol
I think im having a realization
[deleted]
BTW, I should have clarified that there is a big issue with medical professionals not trusting trans people to know what our own needs are and what care will alleviate our dysphoria/activate our euphoria. 

I believe trans people are our own best judges of the care we need, and I believe HRT, medical transition, legal transition, trans-affirming counseling, and all other resources people need to live as themselves down to safe housing, should be available to everyone as a matter of human rights.
>I had this thought process like, “Yes, I am dissatisfied with the perception of my gender by society, and I feel distress over the implications and expectations my gendered socialization has placed on me because of my body, but I would KNOW if I was trans and nonbinary, so because I’m only questioning, that can’t be me.”

This is spot on how I feel. Like exactly.

And yeah, I really wish had a trans friendly therapist to work through this with. I have what I'm pretty sure is depression, or *some* other mental fuckery that makes me pretty nonfunctional, but I'm not sure I can get it treated any time soon. There's also gender stuff tangled up in there but there are no gender therapists in my country to my knowledge, and I don't know if I'd ever find a trans friendly one. Even gender euphoria is hard to feel in a prolonged way because ~depression~. Saps the joy out of you and all that. But I'm glad at least some people have access to that and to some kind of understanding and validation.
Yeah that can be so tough :( We deal with so much medicalist thinking from the outside, especially as many (but not all) trans & gender expansive folx HAVE to interact with the medical system (ie to medically transition). So we hear all of this medicalized diagnosing and gatekeeping and judging and UGH, it can absolutely become internalized. I'm sorry you struggle with spiraling into that, and I'm extra sorry our stupid society put it in your head in the first place. Again, all that is required to be trans is to identify as such - you are so valid!! ❤️
[removed]
I already have, plus more. Once HRT starts the hair will hopefully get finer and reduce the effort needed.
Ahhh, that is so relatable! 

The number one thing therapy has helped me with is understanding that there is no “right” way to be nonbinary or trans, and that many nonbinary and trans people go through evolutions of identity and terminology as we discover ourselves, and that’s totally valid and ok! Being tied to one identity or concept of identity that can never evolve or change is a cis thing. By understanding we are not cis, we free ourselves of those rigid structures and make room to experiment, experience things, and discover our true identities.

I hope your journey is fulfilling and affirming, even when it is hard!!!
Yes, a definite brain genius moment on my part : )

Tbh I really had to have someone help me answer the questions I had to know if I was REALLY feeling the things I felt and not like imagining them, as weird as that sounds!
Right on. I hope my language was clear that I wasn’t assuming where you are at or want to go in your transition : )

I hope you’re able to get the care you’re seeking through the VA!
I am sorry that the care that would help you is so out of reach. 

I am absolutely not any kind of therapist or counselor, but if you ever just need someone to talk to or commiserate with that has been on the same journey, please feel free to DM me. The least I can do is lend an ear : )
Can we chat ? You sound like so nice person
That sounds like you're talking about ""detransitioning"" which is an argument made by anti-trans people in order to delegitimize trans people. People don't transition for the heck of it, they do so because they want to. 

Your arguments are just garbage at this point so I'm disengaging.
Ahh further along then me. HRT is likely a ways off. But who know. It’s all moved so fast in my mind since coming out to my wife and a couple friends. I don’t really like this skin I wear either.
Absolutely! I'm always happy to chat :)
[removed]
Bold of you to assume I'm downvoting when you have multiple downvotes lmao.

I am non-binary and well versed in transphobic arguments, this being one. It also perpetuating truscum discourse, which is gatekeeping grossness.

If anybody is trying to make tomboys and GNC people transition against their will, that too is oppressive, but you're getting mad at the wrong crowd for the wrong reasons. Maybe try and reflect on why your comments are getting downvoted. There isn't one way to be trans. ""Cis people transitioning"" and ""regretting it"" is like, such a prominent transphobic argument so it's sickening you're trying to use it here 

I said I was done before but this is just gross discourse you're using now"	nu7pf4	NonBinary	2692	0.99	2021-06-07 08:49:14

The sword piercing is really fuckin' cool.
I love this so much ❤️ How long has this been a thing? I don’t remember it in past years….but then again this is the first year I’ve identified or recognized that I am non binary (I think anyway. Gender is confusing)…

Happy Belated NB Day To You Too, And To Everyone Reading This!

Yep! 14th of July, right in the middle of Non-Binary Awareness Week 👌
Thank you! Yeah I have an Instagram: _even_sketches_ 👌
Non-Binary People’s Day is on the 14th July!
It was first celebrated in 2012, so it seems like it's actually been going for a while! But, I too only found out this year, and only the day after, at that, which is disappointing, oh well."	okpwd4	NonBinary	2679	1.0	2021-07-15 10:12:58

Cute!
Question: my first thought seeing this was ""you looking cute gurl"" but I'm not so sure how you feel about being called gurl. I'm coming up blank on substitutions for gurl. Any recommendations?

Edit: just realized I posted this in r/nonbinary (I followed from the popular tab), and I'm sure there's recommendations all over this sub. I'm going to peruse a bit to find some.
Gawd you have an amazing look 😍

Gotcha. The ""remove before flight"" keychain is what got me asking. I usually only see those with people who ride motorcycles, typically sports bikes. I have the same keychain, and I do ride. You should get into it, it's really fun!
mine too lol, the eyelet separating from the fabric right?

Serious Howl energy!
I should mention: I use they/them pronouns! 
I enjoy all the endearing comments, though I prefer being called “handsome” “beautiful” or “attractive” more than “cute” and “pretty”
(It’s okay if you use the terms cute or pretty, I just don’t prefer them is all! Ty)
Oh my gaaaaahd, howl from howl's moving castle vibes~~~

How did you do your eye brows?

An elven wizard 🧐 I like the sound of that💖
I came here to say they're def channeling the OG nonbinary wizard Howl
That makes me very happy, thank u 🥰
Only in my wildest dreams 😂 I do grow a few herbs and read tarot though so I’m getting close
Aaah tyty🥺
I actually made them myself🌙☀️! They’re sculpted from polymer clay, painted with acrylic paints and coated in a thin layer of resin and glitter :,) 
They took forever to make but I really like them 😂
I didn’t say I *wasn’t* 🥴🧙
I remember that!! Ty for the advice on earring choice btw!! 🥺💖 ur awesome
Thank you!! :) perhaps I’ll try to find a cool colorful coat to wear over my shoulders to add to the look 🥴💖
I’m 👌🏻 this close to making my own hat and robe 😌🌟
Thank you!! I made that ring out of an old spoon lol :)💖
I made them myself! They’re polymer clay, painted with acrylics and sealed with a thin coat of resin! :)💖
Your comment put the goofiest smile on my face💕 you’re too kind!! 🥺
literally tempting me to change my entire ass aesthetic
Tyty🥺 I hope your doing well🌙
I made them out of polymer clay! :)🌙☀️
I just use an eyeshadow that’s similar to my hair color :,) I only apply it from the middle to the tail. I try to barely touch on the front of the brow.
Hopefully that makes sense? There’s a lot of videos online that might do a better job explaining:,,)
Elves make the best wizards. Or at least they are in the Elder Scrolls universe.
Oh yeah? Name every spell
You are the one I should be thanking for helping me find a presentation goal for myself. Enby wizards unite!
Ooh that’s cool

First of all: that's awesome, I'm so happy to hear you feel more comfortable now! ☺️ 
The binder is actually more comfortable than I anticipated. I did take it off after about 1-2 hours though. I usually don't wear a bra or anything, so I'm not used to the restriction.
Wishing you all the very best and hoping your dreams will come true as soon as possible 💙🧡💚🧚
Thank you so much!! 😭💜💙

I’m not very educated on binders. I did have my dad help measure me before we ordered one on Amazon but all I know about it is it’s in plus size, it’s black (I’m goth, couldn’t help myself) & has hook & loop closure on one side.
from a younger enby to another, much love ❤️
Thank you so much!!🤗💕💞
Remember self care😘 no more than eight hours and hand wash it. Love yourself, you are worth everything

You are stunning!!! With the jewlery matching the top and everything i love it
Hello, darling! You are looking lovely today ❤️
I have some beads like the ones on your necklace laying around! I think one is being used as a fake ruby in a display in my room. 

Edit: The ones I have are more faceted though.
You look so fabulous! I love that term “gender explorers” lol
You look both delighted and delightful!
You have such a delightfully devious look here. Love the jewelry!
That outfit is absolutely gorgeous! I aspire to that level of style!
I really love that shirt!!
Your eyebrows are EVERYTHING.
You make me think of Jason Isaacs. I think it's the smile. You look smashing!
You look fierce!!!
The necklace really ties the whole look together.
Thanks! I like me a chunky necklace (this one was pinched from Mrs peaceful ferret 😁)
Thanks....I liked it so much I pinched it off my other half 😆
Thank you! Amazing actual science fact: it takes more muscles to run a marathon than it does to smile. So just smile, and don't run a marathon.
Thanks so much! It's nice to make us feel more adventurous. Someone on here coined 'gender spelunkers' which is awesome, with the bonus of sounding rude even though it isn't. 😁
Thanks so much!
Thanks so much! I haven't had them done for a while as we are in lockdown in the UK. I've been trying to tend them myself like a big boy. 🤣
Amazing, I'm using that!
Oh, thank you! It felt like a reddy pink kind of day 😁

Thanks a lot Donald, I hope you are enjoying your retirement, even though melania is about to divorce you 😁
Well, that's very kind...have a lovely day xx
He has pinched my necklace. He is very naughty. But we don't really mind because we all love him. He is a beautiful person and a super kind soul with a lovely smile
Shock and awe, baby 🤣
You are spot on, I am very devious! 🤣
Well, thank you so much!
Thanks so much! I'm not telling where its from, but if you follow drag race uk, ru's explosion at joe black will give you a clue! If that's over your head, I'm sorry 😁
Thanks so much....I wish you could have seen the old bushy version for comparison!
Thats very kind! Malfoy 😆
Grrrrrrrr. Thanks!
Thanks so much, it's nice to have an other half you can pinch from!
Mission accomplished. Excellent arch!
A monobrow is definitely a statement 😂

You too! x
Hear that! My partner is a master lacquerista (since quarantine at least). Helps me stay pretty vs. my heavy hands.
A tribrow if you will...but those days are gone!
Whaaat? I was so sure Trump would spend his post twitter days browsing trans and non binary sub reddits, posting kind words of peace and understanding.  He always seems such a kind and gentle soul 🤣
Brilliant! The couple that manicures together, stays together 😁

Happy Juneteenth!		"Dirty European here, I've heard about juneteenth from Americans and from what I know it's about celebrating freedom from slavery, specifically honouring the date of announcement that people formerly kept as slaves in Texas were made free, but if it's alright I'd love some more info or some resources I can use to educate myself more. Ik it may be an america-specific holiday, but it's still important and I can always learn more! 

Happy Juneteenth, my American friends <3

Tiny rant	"Bella Ramsey came out as enbi, right?

They said any pronoun is fine and it might be just me being stupid, but this article written by the Independent keeps referring to them as she/her throughout the ENTIRE article like dudes dudettes persons come on.

Can you not erase something that you literally mention in your headline?"	"Locked due to a profusion of rule-breaking comments. 

Yes, any pronoun is acceptable for people who use ""any pronouns"". But that's different from using multiple pronouns. For people who do either of those, their preference should be respected. (And when folk who use multiples say that the binary ones get used almost exclusively, don't argue with them about it?)

It's definitely some kind of dogwhistle to *only* ever use she or he for people who've expressed that they use a variety. 

For what little it's worth: If you expect people to switch it around, *you are almost certainly going to have to tell people precisely that*. ""Any pronoun"" will often lead to people just finding one that it seems like you're okay with, and using the same one for you going forth. If using any single pronoun consistently is something you're NOT okay with, though, you'll have to communicate that. The thing is, media outlets have a responsibility in journalism to ask you things like that in a way that any random person meeting you does not, so even if this celebrity didn't clearly state that they prefer rotation in pronouns, the interviewer should have clarified.
The articles second paragraph says they explicitly opted for she/her in the original interview
It is not erasure to use she/her for someone that uses any pronouns, that is not what those words mean.
The responses here are interesting to me because at least when someone has he/they or she/they pronouns, I take that to mean they'd be happiest with the use of both those pronouns in conversation: ""This is my friend Taylor, and she's nonbinary. They are really into rock climbing.""

I am she/they, and this is how I feel. But the majority of the time, I just get she/her unless in company with my other queer friends, and it can be annoying. I could speak up more, sure, but I've also dealt with people mispronouncing my name my whole life. It's tiresome.
I am also an any pronouns kind of enby, but what I have found is that the only way to get a real mix of pronouns is to look androgenous and request they/them.
I can understand where you're coming from. But it sounds to me like it's more important for you that the Independent use they/them than for Bella Ramsey?
As someone who prefers any pronouns too its honestly dehumanizing seeing another nonbinary person like bella only be referred to as ""they"" by other trans people. The insistence that bella use ""they"" now really invalidates nonbinary people that use gendered pronouns. If there was a mix of he/she/they that would be cool, but from what I've seen trans and nb people refuse to use any but ""they"" and act like you're misgendering to use she.
I thought they were gender fluid
I don't necessarily trust the Independent myself.
Non-binary. My parents, boyfriend, and his family still call me by my birth name and I’m 100% okay with it. I go by any pronouns, but I mostly get she/her as an AFAB, and I’m also 100% okay with that. 

Bella said to use she/her in the interview. Pronouns =/= gender
r/facepalm
Can't edit the post anymore so I'd just like to add:

Cesus Jhrist people, please for the love of shim (if you know, you know) be civil to each other. Hate on me for all I care if you don't just want to say I'm wrong and move on, but for the love of everything be civil.

Thank you.

Edit because I keep forgetting things I actually want to add: One of the commenters already corrected my mistake several hours ago. I thanked the user and acknowledged my mistake. End of story.
I had this discussion with my mom. I just had her read Kaleidoscopic Grangers. In it there is an NB who uses any pronouns, and the author switches their pronouns every time they are referred to. Even for me it was quite jarring and tough to get used to. However this is how I learned how to switch pronouns up for people with multiple pronouns. It is also what gave me the courage to accept multiple pronouns myself.

My mom just finished the book. So I asked her how she felt about it. She went on too explain that it was jarring and difficult to keep track of who was being talked about, while maintaining she/her pronouns for it.  Which was my initial thought, when discussing multiple subjects, it can be difficult to track who is being spoken of.  

I explained to her that the most respectful way to refer to someone with multiple pronouns is to regularly switch which ones you use.  That it can cause discomfort to even here a pronoun you identify with if it is to the exclusion of others as well. I told her that the over use of she/her for me was making me consider dropping it from my list of preferred, even if it is still ok.

I think to binary gendered people this concept is difficult. They struggle with the idea of multiple pronouns. So they choose one to use throughout to to keep things clear, so they think.  Though since they also struggle with neutral pronouns they just get stuck on using binary one, and will default to AGAB.  I don't think it was malicious, but it is a good learnable moment. If say, Ramsey, the subject of the article where to reach out to them. An update to the article could explain/teach that any pronoun doesn't mean free reign on how you refer to someone.
I think what OP is trying to express is that the article went out of their way to explicitly use the pronouns identified with the participants AGAB which can be quite frustrating at times, even if someone uses all pronouns as to me, even just throwing in a they or he at some point or expressing their use of said pronouns is more respectful than simply using the pronouns societal construct would deem fit. Unless the participant has specifically asked for those pronouns of course, whatever they are most comfortable with.
It's fine if it were just the headline. if he uses any pronouns, using she once in a while is hardly an issue. But if they truly used only ""she/ her""for her the entire interview, then that's not using ""any pronouns"". That's just she/ her.  I say this as someone who is never gendered with varied pronouns, but desperately wants to be.
“Meet my friend, she’s non-binary” vibes
if, what the poster say is true: ... this is as sad as allways.
[deleted]
Bella Ramsey is genderfluid. It’s a nonbinary identity, but mostly like cis? Like, only sometimes nb. She uses both she/her and they/them, so it’s not erasure.
Bella seems like a smart person so I think they made the choice to accept any pronouns because she is a famous actor and kinda of a rolemodel too. Like some people are confused about Non-Binary and gnc identities and might use a assumed pronoun on accident or purpose.

Like I have to be in boy-mode in public so I kinda have to accept that people assume that I am a man and might use masculine pronouns about me.
Hijacking top comment to point out that listing multiple pronouns doesn't tell people how you want those pronouns used. If someone says they go by He/They, they could mean:

* I prefer He, but They is okay
* Either He or They are fine, and I don't care if you stick to 1
* I prefer a mix of He and They, and I care if you stick to 1

Unless you specify, people aren't going to know what you want.
Then I can't comprehend English anymore or missed that part, welp. Thank you for clarification!
Also it makes sense to keep with one set of pronouns, so people don't think they're talking about multiple different people.
Thank you for pointing this out. I didn't notice it either.
I mean, ehh. I use He/They, but rarely anyone uses the second one, unprompted. Many, even the more inclusive folks, just see ""He"" and ""She"" as defaults, anything else is white noise to them. So, I've noticed that unless a person strictly uses They/Them, many people will opt to use the other two (""He"" or ""She""), like when referring to me.

Obviously, this is just anecdotal evidence by me, but I think you get my general point. And while I personally don't mind either pronoun, it is a little annoying that the people who know I'm NB default to the masculine one. So, in a way, it does erase stuff, just a bit, because they're ignoring the bit of me that doesn't fully identify with being a guy. Which is the reason why I'm Non Binary in the first place.

Just for the record, I will say that I don't generally bring this up in person. Or even online. I'm don't really a ""wave maker"", in that regard. And I'm really only bringing it up here, because it seems to be relevant to the topic, so I'm just sharing my experience with it.
It can be? Depends on the person honestly and specific situation, but for me personally, I use any/all pronouns with preference to she/he/they and some people Im out to always just use she and fem terms for me. I dont necessarily mind the pronoun or those terms, but it kind of feels like they are completely ignoring the fact that Im nb and use all pronouns.
Any pronouns generally means to use a mix of all pronouns. If you are consistently only gendering someone with one set of pronouns, that’s not cool. If she wanted to be referred to with only she/her, they would’ve kept their pronouns as that. It’s not that using those pronouns is a problem in isolation— it’s only problematic when it’s the literal only one used. 

The issue is mainly that some people choose to interpret someone saying that they’re okay with all pronouns to mean that they don’t have to change the way they think about or refer to that person’s gender. 

It does vary by person though, so this specific situation is very dependent on whether or not they agreed on the pronouns used in the article beforehand. It wouldn’t be problematic as long as Bella Ramsey explicitly said it would be okay to only use she/her. If they told the reporter to use “any pronouns” and THEN the reporter just used she/her, it would be.
Yeah, as someone who uses any pronouns, any does mean any to me (as long as it's not something bad of course), mostly because I don't really care so would rather go with what others find simple so if someone only ever referred to me using he/him or she/her that would be fine and probably expected.
Fair enough, especially in that case where the person of interest is okay with it, but like, we know what they're doing by sticking to one set of binary pronouns that happen to coincide with the binary gender the nonbinary person in question is mostly perceived as and presented as before coming out. We know why nonbinary celebrities who don't require the public to change anything about the way they talk are the most visible, and we know why any nonbinary celebrity might want to publicly state that they use any pronouns even if they might not actually be that comfortable with that, because if they don't they'll be misgendered anyway. 

I'm not saying it's abominable exorsexism and we shout riot, but even though we can't point at one specific instance and call it erasure, as a whole that's what it is. That's what the word means. It's super convenient to sweep nonbinary people's nonbinarity under the rug so they're just kinda cool lefteist vaguely GNC people that we don't have to use icky complicated pronouns for.
i disagree. it’s not misgendering, but it is erasure, because it’s basically ignoring the other pronouns that the person also goes by, especially if you’re only using their AGAB pronoun. using only one set of pronouns instead of all of them at different times was a deliberate choice by the author, and can definitely be seen as disrespectful.
I've seen articles on them before and the authors usually switch around pronouns. This is what annoyed me, Independent sticking to only one.
yes it can be??
I think it changes based on the individual. I'd rather someone stick to the same pronoun in a conversation for myself
Exactly, all this. Jesus fucking Christ, someone finally gets it. Thank you!

Also, the top part, my ex understood that after one conversation, and I didn't even phrase it like you did or flat out say it (mainly, because I didn't think to, at the time).

So, I came here, trying to bring up the same thing you did, and holy shit did piss rain from the sky. You swear I was speaking in a Martian language to some of these people. And then they come at me with their bs, when all I'm just trying to do is give my perspective on all this. Holy fuck.

**Either way, just thank you for the comment. I appreciate it. Greatly. Like, seriously.**
So true 😔
I'm living the any pronouns dream of getting a consistent mix of they, she, and he, the only issue is my pronouns are they/them and ze/zim 🫠
well, we can’t really say for sure how bella would feel about this so that’s not necessarily true. as someone who uses more than one set of pronouns, if this happened to me i would be annoyed. it’s very possible that bella would be too
Gender fluid is under the NB umbrella
They are
You know non-binary people can still go by she/her pronouns right?
Except Bella uses any pronouns, so this sentence is completely accurate and non-offensive in this context.
Bella is much more promsing than either of them, at this point so I'd say no for now.
His career is DEFINITELY not stagnant
Well, shit. Seems I was incorrect about this. Sorry, everyone.
honestly that’s a great way to phrase that. thanks for the tip :)

i always try to ask people i’m just meeting how they feel about their pronouns if they have multiple sets of pronouns
* I prefer They, but I'm used to He so w/e
For me, it means “you see it on my profile as multiple pronouns. I have left a default because it is not a particular form of dysphoria for me and I have more fear for keeping my job than taking the energy to enforce my identity, but if you get it, you’ll probably invite the conversation.”
That's exactly why I've switched my listed pronouns on everything from he/they to they/he even though I think the former sounds nicer, hopefully indicating that I prefer they/them pronouns over he/they, but still like to be referred to with masculine language, without needing to type all that
I always consider the first in the list to be more important. That is how it is for me. though I suppose some could have them at equal prominence.  


I prefer Fae. She is acceptable. I dropped they after a few months testing. It won't bother me if it is used, but it also isn't preferably.
Thats a great point thanks for hijacking :)
yeah like my friend uses he/they/she and doesn’t care if people stick to one but most people use she for him because it fits their perceptions of his gender identity
And there is yet another option. I use they/she but I’m only comfortable with close friends and family using she/her pronouns. So I just tell everyone to use they/them and don’t get upset when certain people slip and use she/her.
As someone who watches streamers who goes by multiple set of pronouns, I can say that generally, the fans balance out the pronoun usage fairly well (it's also a thing for fans to ONLY use they/them, but that's a whole other can of worms), however, it should be noted that the majority of said streamer's fanbase ARE LGBTQ+ themselves, so that probably explains a lot.
I get this. To me, saying They/He doesn't mean either works, it means I like both pronouns, but people default to what is most comfortable for them
I feel you. But I also feel the difficulty in the language. 

I remember when I first had a close friend come out as trans. Switching from he to she was practically insurmountable. It didn't matter to me, it's just... How I was used to talking about my friend.

Then I had my first nonbinary friend who was explicitly they/them, and it's even *harder.* It just doesn't feel easy to do singular they when you are referring to a specific person without putting intentional effort.

So in both cases... I put in intentional effort. It's totally a pain in the ass, but I feel like it's totally worth it. In my case, I think it's because I realized I'm agender. My sex/body is just a chassis for the consciousness within. Pronouns are just words. I genuinely do not care. But other people do, so I show that I care about *them* by putting effort into their words. 

*That's* why it hurts. Everyone who doesn't at least try to put in the effort is showing that they don't care enough as we cared to learn to use the language that makes us and our loved ones more comfortable. It's not that they hate us or don't want to be friends or they're bad people, there's just a tangible, undeniable disparity between who cares and who doesn't.
I guess it depends who. I notice people use they for me often because I don’t look entirely masculine to them and they “aren’t sure” but some ppl use he/ and some switch it up and use both in one sentence. That’s my favorite
It sounds like you're not actually comfortable with the ""he"" pronoun, and you would prefer ""they."" If you tell people your preferred pronouns are he/they, and then they refer to as ""he"" because it's easier for them, why would you be mad? They're listening to what *you* told them. 

No one is ""defaulting"" or ""erasing"" by using one of your preferred pronouns. If you're not comfortable being called ""he,"" then make that clear and *then* you can start to be mad at people for calling you ""he.""

If I go by a new name, but I tell people I'm also comfortable being called by my old name, I don't get to be mad at people when they use my old name. I told them they could use it.
All of this. All of it. 

I appreciate comments like yours, it makes me feel like I'm not losing my sanity, here. Thank you.
Yeah, any pronouns usually means a mix of pronouns, switching it up from time to time. And while that can work while you’re hanging out with a friend, or whatever, this is a *written article*. It would make for awkward and confusing reading of the writers kept switching around pronouns for the same person. 

And yes, as someone else mentions, the article itself references the fact that Bella has actively elected to use she/her pronouns, and she doesn’t care what other people refer to her as. So OP getting upset about Independent using the pronouns Bella WANTS people to use is just weird, misplaced anger, and seems more like they’re projecting their own issues onto this article.
I think you need to stop policing the pronouns of fellow trans people. She uses any pronouns. Calling her ""she"" and ""her"" is non-offensive to both her and other non-binary folk who use any pronouns. This is not the fight anyone needs to be focused on and it only serves to create division in the community.

Being queer is about free expression. Its not about weird, arbitrary rules you want to put on the way *other people* identify themselves.
It *could* be, but isn't inherently so. Especially when the person in question greenlights it.

I can feel that. But that's you. From what I can find about Bella from Bella, Bella feels different.

>Ramsey identifies as non-binary and is indifferent to which pronouns are used for her, telling The New York Times, ""I'm very much just a person. Being gendered isn't something that I particularly like, but in terms of pronouns, I really couldn't care less.""

Earlier NYT interview via [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey#Personal_life)
Yea think the meme was ""No thats wrong, she uses they/them pronouns"" or something along those lines when clueless allies correct eachother etc.
Oh I do, it just rubs me the wrong way when someone seemingly assumes she/her for a fem-presenting nb. It gives the “spicy woman” vibes. But I guess people clarified that Bella goes by she/her pronouns, so my spidey-senses tickled incorrectly
I really hope so. I just tend to be skeptical of celebrities coming out. A lot of the time it just seems disingenuous and for brownie points with Enbies and Trans folks..
Right, and I mean, if you/people in general are only going to use one, what's the point of me even listing two or more, you know?

**EDIT**

It kind of feels like one of those questions where someone goes:

""If you could only have one kind of soda for the rest of your life, what would you pick?""

And, I'm just over here like:

""Well, I enjoy more than just one, so why do I have to pick just one?""

Because when I do the He/They thing, that's what it feels like I'm doing. I'm not doing it in my own head, but others seem to perceive it that way, like you've mentioned.
i use they/she and completely relate on how peeps use my pronouns. 

if it’s safe, i’m going to clarify that i like a mix of she/her AND they/them. hopefully it helps. best of luck <3
""I'm comfortable using a mix of X and Y"" is a different sentence than ""I'm comfortable using either X or Y""
1. I told you what I use, don't assume things for me
2. ""Easier"" is subjective. This stuff is really only as hard as people make it
3. I don't remember saying I was ""mad"" about this. I even looked over my comment again to make sure, and all I said was a bit annoyed. Two different things. Don't put words in my mouth.
4. I really only brought this stuff up as I thought my feelings on the matter were relevant to the conversation. I even made a note in my post saying as such. So, I don't understand why you're making it sounds like I'm getting bent out of shape over this, when I'm merely just expressing my thoughts and experiences with it.
5. I will grant you one point, I don't push the ""They"" thing that much. So, you could argue some of this is on me. That's fair.
6. All in all, though, I really don't know how to take your comment. If you're being genuine, or some type of a troll. Because, most of what you said is you either: making assumptions about me, twisting my words, or making shit up. So, it's really not a good look for you. But, hey, I had some free time to kill, so here we are.

Have the day you deserve 👍
Look that that, someone who actually gets it.
These complaints remind me of the age-old dialogue:

Person 1: What do you want for dinner?
Person 2: Maybe pizza or a burger.

*P1 gets pizza*

P2: Oh, I don’t want this :/

In both cases, Person 2 should just ask for what they *actually* want if they’re going to be upset/bothered by any other choice. DON’T GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS YOU DON’T WANT THEM TO CHOOSE!!
As I said above, it’s not a problem if she explicitly said that was fine. That information wasn’t included in the comment I was replying to. 

I don’t think the confusion thing is a great argument though. I used two different pronouns to refer to Bella in my comment in a way that wasn’t unclear. 

You can swap between she and they no problem. If you’re using he, just make it explicit in the sentence. You can do that quite easily by referring to Bella directly before swapping to an explicitly gendered pronoun. It may sound *jarring* to someone who isn’t used to it, but it would not impact a reader’s ability to infer who the pronoun refers to. 

Eg. “Bella Ramsey has just announced that he is non-binary. They have elected to use all pronouns, and have indicated that they do not have a preference for one particular pronoun. When asked, Bella said that she doesn’t care, and elected to use she/her for this interview.”
That’s kinda hypocritical of you to say after putting words in someone else’s mouth on how they identify on another comment.

Edit: ok block
It isn't inherently so, but it is true a lot of people tend to opt exclusively for agab pronouns when talking about someone who uses all pronouns in ways that feel almost misgendery, so I'm not surprised it rubs some people the wrong way. I don't think talking about how something makes us slightly uncomfortable should be seen as trying to establish a general rule.
I’m sorry, are we not allowed to prefer a mix of pronouns rather than just one set? We HAVE to choose?
You're getting downvoted for trying to make a valid point.

Reddit, man, it's something else.

*Sigh*
Sounds like an opportunity to be more explicit when introducing your pronouns to new people.  ""Please mix the use of he and they in reference to me"" may be more awkward, but it doesn't leave as much room for others to make their own assumptions.
Then one should specify. A ""/"" in pronouns or the phrase ""any"" doesn't imply preference.
Basically I think you're just saying that it would be nice if some people selected they/them when you give them a choice between that and he/him. Like if 10-20% referred to you with they/them completely on their own, it would feel like a breath of fresh air, as if more of your identity is being recognized instead of just the masculine part.
Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
[removed]
My post was more like: 

Person 1: ""What kind of pizza would you like me to get you?""

Person 2: ""Well, I like Pepperoni pizza as well as Sausage pizza. So, either is fine, in general""

P1: *Gets Pepperoni pizza. Every. Single. Time*

P2: ""Hey, you know, I like Sausage as well, right? Maybe you could get that some time?""

P1: *uncomfortable silence and awkward stares*

But, sure, just whip up some bullshit to make yourself look good, I guess. 🤷
>As I said above, it’s not a problem if she explicitly said that was fine. That information wasn’t included in the comment I was replying to.

True, that’s why I’m clarifying that Bella chose those pronouns. Just thought it would help understand where the differing opinion stems from. 

>I don’t think the confusion thing is a great argument though. I used two different pronouns to refer to Bella in my comment in a way that wasn’t unclear…. It may sound jarring to someone who isn’t used to it, but it would not impact a reader’s ability to infer who the pronoun refers to.

That’s a good point. “Confusion” may not have been the best word to use, jarring is better. But we also have to consider that not everyone who reads this article is going to be caught up on all the details inherent with talking about a gender-nonconforming person. It’s already hard enough getting the general public to accept us, so I think it’s easy to alienate them by switching pronouns around like that. You know how they like to complain.

>Eg. “Bella Ramsey has just announced that he is non-binary. They have elected to use all pronouns, and have indicated that they do not have a preference for one particular pronoun. When asked, Bella said that she doesn’t care, and elected to use she/her for this interview.”

Yes, this totally makes sense, and it could absolutely be done, but why would they do that? Why switch around between all options before finally saying “but she wants this one, though”? If she’s already chosen her preferred pronoun, then just use that from the beginning. Writing it as you did just seems like extra steps to really drive home the point that she’s non-binary, but that’s what the article is for. That’s where Bella refers to her younger self as a “little dude” and stating that when it comes to her pronouns she “couldn’t care less.” So my (rhetorical) question is: why does OP care?

P.S. Thank you for replying with your differing point of view in a relaxed, conversational manner rather than making insinuations and insults. It’s so refreshing to have an actual adult conversation on the internet for once. Even if we still don’t agree with each other at the end, this has been a nice interaction. Have a great rest of your day :)
This. This is exactly what I was trying to say. Granted I only use two of the ""main"" ones.
You’re allowed to prefer whatever you want, but you need to vocalize that. Don’t tell someone “my pronouns are she/they” And then when they refer to you as “she”, say that its upsetting. That just makes your claim sound false. Seems like “She” is not a pronoun you care to be referred to as if its sparked a negative feeling. Instead, why not just tell people “I prefer a mix of she/her and they/them”?
Nah, I don’t think I was, I saw “non-binary” and “her” in one sentence and my fight-or-flight kicked in, completely unnecessarily
Doesn't specify the opposite either. In fact I would argue that a slash would usually imply more ""both"" than ""either"" based on other usages. You hear whatever you want to hear, don't complain when people specify.
Essentially, yeah.

To try and put it like I did in the other comment, it's kind of like when you enjoy two different flavors of something. Let's say, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, for example.

Well, whenever someone gets you ice cream, if they always get you vanilla, sometimes youre just like: 

""you know, I like chocolate as well, right?""

And when it seems like people don't actively care about it, or acknowledge it, or do anything about it, it kind of sucks. I sometimes just get sick of vanilla all the time, you know?

And sure, I guess I could ""push"" for chocolate more. But, that doesn't feel great either. Because it can come off like I'm pressuring the other person, nor do I want them to think I want chocolate all the time, etc.

So, it kind of puts me between a rock and a hard place with the whole thing. Even with people that are generally more inclusive and nice about the whole thing.
""get over yourself""

Dude, you're the one that replied to my comment, unprompted, saying inaccurate shit about me. But somehow I'm the bad guy? What the fuck?
The parent comment of this comment thread does specify that she prefers a mix though. Like, they LITERALLY say that in the initial comment, and the comment you responded to is agreeing, implying that the second person also prefers a mix. Considering they’re both willing to indicate their preferences on the internet, I’d assume they’ve both also specified their preferences in real life, which makes it come off like you’re trying to police people’s pronouns. Being upset that people only use one pronoun set for you when you’ve specified that you prefer a mix is perfectly valid. It doesn’t mean they don’t like that particular pronoun, it just means they don’t like ONLY that pronoun.
Even implying ""both"" or ""either"" isn't what we're talking about. This specific situation is that a person would like their pronouns interchanged as often as every other, if not the same sentence. That's fine and all, but that's not how people speak and, beyond that, is incredibly confusing. Because of that fact, you'll have to specify to people that you want that.
That's a perfect way to describe it
[removed]
They’re saying here that they prefer a mix, but also stated that they don’t vocalize the issue they have when people do only refer to them as one. With that information, i don’t think they are taking the time to announce to people that they want a mix of both and feels more likely that they just say she/they.

I’m not trying to police anything. I was asking a question. My question apparently made you feel some kinda way. Yall can prefer and go by whatever you want, but since you are looking to be understood by others in conversation, maybe you want to specify things to those that don’t get wrapped up in pronoun conversations as much as you do. Y’all frequent these pronoun conversations, most of the world does not. This is why you find yourself having to correct people in the first place. 

My feelings are not hurt or affected by being called any pronoun. They just don’t mean much to me, but for someone that does(this original comment), i was just asking a question that maybe they could enlighten me and have a conversation more on instead of assuming I’m trying to police them and getting annoyed by it. But that’s fine. You’re right, I’m wrong. Carry on with your day.
Saying ""I use he/they"" is specifying it though. I've sincerely never met a nonbinary person who uses multiple pronouns and doesn't want them to be somewhat mixed up who doesn't either 1. introduces themselves with different unique sets to different people or places so that the separation happens by itself, or 2. make it abundantly clear from the get go what their preferences are. Not saying they don't exist but so far most people I know would assume multiple pronouns separated by a slash to mean ""all of these mixed up regularly"".

Plus we all know that when cis people pick the binary pronoun and stick with it 100% of the time it's not out of a deep desire to respect nonbinary people's identity.
I already made my points known about why I disliked your original reply. Take it or leave it. But, I'm not doing this with you, anymore. Go bother someone else.
Literally neither of the top two comments in this comment thread specify that they’ve never clarified their pronoun preferences. The initial commenter states that she assumes most people with multiple pronoun sets share their preference, but does NOT state that she isn’t clear with others about their preference. The second states that they didn’t have to clarify with their ex, not that they never clarify for anyone.

“Sounds like you don’t actually like she/her pronouns. Have you considered switching to just they/them?” Isn’t a question, it is unsolicited advice. It comes off as condescending (“I know your identity better than you do” vibes). I don’t know if you truely intended to have a conversation, but your original (now deleted) comment was not conducive to conversation. Your continued assumption that people using mixed pronoun don’t communicate this fact with others also does not make it seem like you want a conversation. It just makes it sound like you look down on us. Also, to clarify, I said you were coming off like you were policing others pronouns, not that you definitely were.

I answered your question earlier, but I’ll rephrase it here in more detail: the problem with being referred to by one pronoun set when you prefer multiple to be mixed is that people are ignoring your preference, and it is just as misgendering as being called “she” or “he” when you only use “they”. Switching to just “they/them” when you prefer a mix feels just as wrong as people referring to you as just “she/her” or “he/him,” and some people do that AFTER clear explanations about pronoun preferences. We are allowed to be upset by that.
Then what are we talking about here? If we're talking about a situation where someone has made their preference abundantly clear, like the situation you describe, and someone doesn't respect that, of course, that's shitty. 

My point is that if someone uses ""any pronouns"" and doesn't otherwise state that have a specific combination they'd prefer, I take that to mean, any pronoun I'm comfortable with is cool with them. If they secretly don't want you to use one of those pronouns or only want it used in tandom with others but they don't express that to you, I don't think its your fault for not knowing that. Using explicitly one pronoun or another doesn't define someone's gender. 

We are literally setting the rules on how we're spoken to and about. We don't get to be upset when other people respect that, but not in the way we secretly hope. If we're already in the position of explaining our identity to others, why not give the full picture? And if there's a reason not to give the full picture, it's hard to hold someone else accountable for not getting it right. They're not working with all the info. Kind of a NAH situation.

I understand the nuance of ""when cis people or even other queer people exclusively use one pronoun versus the others you also prefer, it can be with conscious or subconscious transphobia,"" but that wasn't the point I was trying to argue against. I dont really see the point in worrying what cis people think of me, subconsciously or otherwise. I decide my identity, not them.

Edit: also /NM. Just autistic.
I haven’t deleted any of my comments, so idk where you’re getting that from. My original and the 2 replies i made are all still here. Either way… You’re right, I’m wrong. Have a great day
Because it's not a secret hope. Saying ""I use he/they"" is already saying ""I use he and they"" and strongly implying if no other info that they should be mixed up to some extent. Not necessarily as far as twice a sentence, but it doesn't mean ""pick one and stick to it, some other people will pick the other probably"" unless it is explicitely said. Because if I want some people to only use he/him when talking about me, I tell them ""Hey I use he/him pronouns"", and I tell the people I want to use they/them with ""hey I use they/them pronouns"". 

There's kind of a social context to the way we share our pronouns, and just because you might happen to not hear it, which is fine, that can be talked out easily, doesn't mean it's not there for many people.

The thing with cis people who stick to the he of he/they or the she of she/they is that we know why they're doing it. Whether it's malicious or just because they picked the already beaten path to make the least effort possible, it's still a symptom of how nonbinary identities are seen. It's not exactly the same but kinda similar to a trans person using one set of binary pronouns and a new name. If a cis person suspiciously only ever uses the name and avoids pronouns, or on the contrary, avoids any name and uses only pronouns and pointing and ""the one over there"", we can see that there is some transphobia at play, however malicious or well-intended. 

I agree that as trans people, and especially nonbinary people, there is no choice but to be patient and slowly teach both people in our lives and the general public how we talk among ourselves. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't hold people accountable or be sad when, for example, the reason not to give someone the full picture is that they would be very exorsexist to our faces when we specify. Or that we shouldn't be sad that we have to dumb down and accept concessions made to our identity because people can't follow. It's inevitable but it's a pretty sad reality for many people. 

/nm either, I just like debating. Though I think we're missing each other's point here, it feels like you're responding to something to the left of what I've said, and I can only assume vice-versa. 

To clarify, my point is that he/they or she/they communicates the use of both pronouns equally, and that everyone should use both, not necessarily every sentence, but at least every once in a while. It's usually people who use multiple sets deviating from this tendency who specify so, or who just take matter into their hands and introduce themselves as different single sets in different places (for example, he/him at home, they/them at work, he/she/they with friends). Specifying is cool, but that's already what saying ""I use he/they"" is doing. 

Additionally, I agree that other people, especially cis people, aren't always gonna know what's the communication standards in the nonbinary community are, and misunderstanding can still happen. However, we have to recognize that it's not a coincidence that so many people default to using solely the binary pronouns despite both being cited. It's a result of ambiant exorsexism (once again, not necessarily malicious). We're allowed to be sad to be misunderstood and have a whole part of our identity sweeped under the rug because someone is too lazy to make the slightest change to their habits. We're allowed to be mad in the privacy of our own heads when soemone willfully misinterprets our words. Especially when we can't specify further because bothering them would push them to be exorsexist. Especially when generally when you come out with new pronouns to cis people and you're mildly safe, you don't say ""he/they now lol"", you have a normal conversation with words that say, for example, ""I use both he and they"", or ""If you could start using he and they for me I would appreciate it"".

And yeah, I mean, you can't really blame people for not wanting to fight about being nonbinary every living second of every day. You do that because you don't care what cis people think about you, some just don't do that because it's exhausting. Exorsexism is everywhere and it sucks, you can't blame people for being sad and mad in the privacy of their own heads about it.

A whole year since my last Enby post lol, Happy Non-Binary People’s Day!!		"my only goal is to look just like this drawing before enby day next year
Why is this the exact outfit I'm wearing today and the exact haircut I got today?? I'm such a stereotype lmaooo

Very nice artworks though, and happy international non-binary day to you too! :)
So sad enby day is exactly one day after my birthday.

On another note, the 2022 hoodie kinda fucks
wait. why can’t these be the actual shades for each color on the flag? much more satisfying imo 😌 it’s giving halloween but cozy
Happy 🐝 day!
Your horns came in nicely ☺️
I feel called out cuz my OC character has horns like that too--

That's it, I'm claiming horns as a NB thing
incredible the vibes are imaculate! do you have an Instagram??
Love it for them how their horns, ears and tail grew out! But also I want to get some food in them, because they look like they went from skinny to even skinnier. 😅
i love this
Two words: gender envy and happy nonbinary day. Ok more like six words 😅
No way I became a demon too 😳
you have become cooler and more gender. sick.
I love these. I want to look like the top one.
Love this!
slay!!!!!
okay but i want to *be* this character
It's also Nonbinary Awareness Week!
This is going to be my new PC wallpaper
You too!
holy crap this is very cool

i want to be the art from the first one
We are here for this enby tiefling!
I don’t know who this is but they are an entire vibe and I love them. This is exactly what I envision myself being like a couple years from now.
I love your art style, can I take some parts and add it to mine?
What pride flag is this? Inam confused by the two violet shades
I mainly want the horns... I'm not happy with the horns offered Amazon. They are either too short or require a headband... I want something decently sized and just the right size to make use of my widow's peaks. lol
same,,,, I think it’s mostly the flat chest god I need a binder
Awh man so close! Still during Non-binary awareness week tho, pretty cool. Also thank u! If only it were real
Why thank you ☺️
I do! even_sketches 👍
Ur more than welcome to take inspiration from my art! Just don’t copy it lol (not that you would but just in case)
This is the non binary flag, although I had to edit the colours a bit to look more pleasing to the eye
I really wanted horns for a cosplay and I ended making them myself using some cosplay books I got from humble bundle, they turned out quite well actually
oh heck yes ty
I just like the way you exaggerate the bones under the skin while still making the characters look alive
Yeah, I might have to design something using my 3D modeling skills and then use that to make what I want into SFX horn appliances. Steep learning curve but it would definitely be worth it.
Go for it!
The method I used was foam sculpting, basically you print out shapes that form the horn, trace then onto EVA foam, contact cement the pieces together and it'll form the 3d shape, then you can heat up the foam and apply this spray on rubber stuff to seal it, then you can paint it or whatever, painting it is super fun cause it comes together quite nicely, plus I think there's a way to design your own 3d models and have them split up into 2d parts so you can do that as well"	vz67eu	NonBinary	2312	1.0	2022-07-14 20:57:41

You look AMAZING! :D
This is the single most fabulous person I've ever seen. It's done, we can all go home now. They get the first place prize.
DAMN, everyone here looks amazing. I’ve only been on this sub for a few weeks but y’alls sense of fashion is such an inspiration :)
The Canadian tuxedo!
But...but I wanna be you, please 🔥🔥🔥
I audibly gasped, you look amazing
OMG YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS I JUST CANT BELIEVE THIS PICTURE 💕💕

I avoided shaving my head for years bc of the little man that lives in my brain. “What if you’re not attractive to men/femme-seeking women anymore and no one ever loves you?” Anyway, turns out I’m actually happy now and look how I do in my head?? Who would’ve thought		"The buzz looks amazing, suits you so well!
I don't know how else to describe it but you look more alive in the second picture. It's a good thing I swear! The buzzcut looks really great on you and I'm happy that you're staying true to yourself!!
Total envy of your facial bone structure, it's perfect for a shaved head! Incredible, both handsome and beautiful ❤️
You can do whatever the fuck you want with your hair. With your cheekbones, you can't *not* be attractive. 

Anyone who disagrees can fight me.
You look like you belong to yourself in the second picture, cheers to the chop
I did the buzz in March and it honestly solidified my gender placement (or lack there of) it stopped men from staring at me like I was a little fairy and near enough fear me which so empowering somehow. Also great that my confidence was the highest it had been in years 🙌 honestly thinking of going back to it, makes me feel so good!
u are very cute I love your freckles
You look awesome with a shaved head.  Your head shape is perfect.  I have always been scared to but am also considering it.  It looks really really good on you!
You are so GORGEOUS. The buzz definitely suits you, you look like a model!!
You’re an absolute hunk!
You look amazing and you are very attractive!
Damn, very good looking
I find it very hard to imagine that *anyone* would find you unattractive
You are absolutely gorgeous 🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful with and beautiful without.
You look awesome! Remember, the most important thing is to be YOU. That dissonance in your head will be gone, and you will to be able to find a partner who loves you for who you really are—not someone who hides behind a femme mask.

And I totally get the pressure to keep long hair. I debated whether I should keep mine before chopping it off—and it was so liberating!
You are stunning. 😲
You look amazing 💖
I think you look way cooler! Go you!
You really rock that haircut!
you look amazing!!!! i hate the little man in my head :(
Yes!! You look lovely. Take that, little man inside all our heads!
Omg I love your shaved head 🥰
Wow, this is goals
you look so good omg
Enby you gorgeous
Tell Bruno to shut up. Also you look fine as hell. This is the reason i always support anyone who wants to shave their head.
Awesome!
You look amazing both ways but the buzz really brings out your features!
the buzz suits you so well, you looks awesome!!!
You look fly as hell! Glad you took the leap.
It looks so good! You look more you in a sense-
You look freaking awesome and lovely.
You look absolutely STUNNING! ✨ In both pictures! Though the right one is big dick energy for suuurreeee
You look absurdly good with shaved hair!
I love the look! So aesthetic
Nothing more attractive than a person who feels good in their skin. <3
You look amazing!!!
Absolute power. You look stunning!
You look super good either way! I don't know who said you weren't attractive but I want to beat them into the next couple centuries👊😡👊
🥰🥰🥰🥰
The buzz looks so good on you
You look more at peace with your head shaved
Ohhhh my god you’re stunning 😳🥺
Omfg you look amazing!! I'm so happy for you!! I'm gonna get my first rlly short haircut a week from now, and I hope mine turns out as well as yours did!
Do you know what guard you’re hairstylist cut your hair with?
You look amazing!
You look awesome. I have a short cut myself and I felt like a huge weight was lifted after cutting it. 😎
You look amazing both ways!!! I love it!!
You look fantastic! No need to worry. :)
You have the best face/head structure for this. It really looks so badass on you!
You have a very nice facial structure, could pull off all kinds of looks.

I recently did something similar. Didn’t get rid of all of it since my more masculine feeling moments I wish it was around shoulder length (and ether in a ponytail, or curly as heck in almost puppy boy style. I don’t think that’s a look, but it’s the descriptor that comes to mind when imagining it) 

Anyways Everyone “I like the long hair on you” “I’m attracted to GiRLs with long hair” finally did it on thanksgiving, and love it. Makes all my facets happy. Especially when I just get it dry from the shower and it makes the puppy boy curl style. (Curly Emo kinda works I guess??)

Anyways I think it’s important we listen to our hearts. Always seems to make people happier, and others usually end up agreeing because they see it lets the real us shine through. Those who don’t never liked us anyways.
NOICEEEEEE <3
I was so scared to shave my head for years because I was so attached to my hair, I thought it made me look more feminine, and I didn’t want to be seen as unattractive. I started gradually balding in high school with a receding hairline and by 22, my bangs were walking a very thin line to becoming a combover. I finally buzzed my head because my hair was restricting instead of empowering, and now I feel more myself than ever and like how I look more. It didn’t negatively alter how I feel about my identity or gender, it empowered it.

So glad to hear it has empowered you as well!! You look fantastic! (Also, did anyone else think their shaved head would be way bigger than it is?? 😂)
You look good in this ! I used to shave my head due to psoriasis but because of aging hair and thinning I’ve left the top longer
Suits you perfectly.
You are hott af. I love your freckles. You have great features and you don’t have to have any particular gender to be very attractive to anyone with eyes. Their binary brains might be tripping over it, but I doubt they would disagree. 

You are just tragically gorgeous 🤷🏽‍♀️
absolutely stunningly georgeous
My Wife Cathy IsBaldbBy Choice
And you could still rock a more femme aesthetic if you're worried about that. You look great either way :>
More alive and at the same time chiller, like you can really see the comfort they now have in their body. 

Also buzzcuts are fucking dope as fuck and I think those like OP's confer a certain je ne sais quoi badassery.
Righttt like I understand this some much. Like they look more free/liberated. Like their glowing
Yes I’m so glad I didn’t find out I have a weird shaped head hahaha thank you sm!
wow I could cry 😭 thank you
Wow. This brought me back in time and is really making me want to buzz my hair again.

But I'm also experimenting with funky colours and cuts lately and it takes so damn long to grow back so now I'm torn.

I've been doing balayage, but with colour. So my hair's still it's natural brown but it goes gradient into whatever colour throughout and as the colour fades it gradients into this kinda pastel thing too.

Last time I did it ear-length with a reddish purple and it went brown/purple gradient to brown/purple/pale pink.

This time I did it chin-length with a royal blue and it's currently going brown/blue/silver as it fades out.
I find that dangly earrings and/or a necklace are both great ways to look femme with super short hair.
Yup.
I didn't even start about your eyes yet. Don't ever doubt your looks. My mum always says ""nothing can deface a beautiful human"" (Einen schönen Menschen kann nichts verunstalten) and she's right about that.

Haircuts, scars, weight, a big fat bruise after a nasty fall - if the foundation is solid, none of that shit matters.

So whatever you do, however you choose to present, and even if someone punches you, you'll STILL look amazing.

The man in your brain can shut his nasty mouth because he's talking nonsense.

Also while I'm a sucker for long hair, I can honestly say everything that shows off your face more is a good thing and your buzzed hair looks like velvet (which is a good thing in case that wasn't clear. Velvet is amazing).
And makeup! I don’t normally wear makeup, like, ever, but I’ll still wear makeup for Big Events and it definitely makes me look more feminine when I do

My enby ass is very happy about that		"I look quite feminine and don’t know how to look more masculine, but a few weeks ago someone in our dorm group chat met me IRL for the first time and said they thought I was a guy from my name and the tiny profile picture of me with my dog. It made me very happy
Urban dictionary  thinks its mainly feminine.  Characters with the name tend to be masculine.  Some sources say it doesnt  have a gender. Good. They can be confused about it (My name is Phoenix)
Based in mine I am often presumed to be a Scandinavian man or a Japanese woman, and I'm okay with that.
My name is just like that outside of my country of birth :P  Unfortunately in Finland male and female names need to be distinct by law... So in Finland my name is a straight up giveaway of assigned sex.

So as long as I am not in Finland, I'm good hahha!
I’ve considered going by Bee, just so I can say that I’m an en*bee*. Plus, I could just use the excuse that it’s a nickname, since my name ends with a ‘bee’ sound.
Same! My first name (not Alastair) is so rare I get people confused as to whether I'm a girl or a guy. It's funnier when they still don't know when they meet me in person
A Very Nice Thing Indeed.

~~To Be Fair That's Only The Case Because My Parents Named Me After Someone's Surname Out Of Pettiness, But Shh It Still Counts.~~
My birth name is French and not gendered (changes spelling M/F like a lot of French words). I was tickled not to have to change it. I just changed the spelling and added an accent mark to be fancy.
This happened to me with my chosen name!! :D
Aebyss gang (probably no one) rise up!
Funny story, a trans guy in Spain wanted to change his gender on the state ID, but not change his name because of this reason, and the cops at the ID renewal station would not allow this because the name was listed as a female name ([sauce](https://www.atlantico.net/articulo/vigo/nombre-impide-chico-trans-cambiar-dni/20220115233050887838.html), sorry, could not find it in English).

There is also a case of the opposite, the cops refusing to change the ID to the preferred name because it was ""too masculine and it would lead to problems in identification"", and to go for a more neutral one ([sauce](https://www.eldiario.es/aragon/sociedad/deniegan-cambio-transexual-inequivocamente-masculino_1_1908651.html), again, sorry for language)

This meme just reminded me of this.
My name is so common that it's not gendered
My name outside of Ireland is genderless, but here it's masculine :(
That is rare. I tend to look up names for laughs. One of the strangest gendered names I saw was Welcome
Anyone else here in 'named after a fictional character known for their eschewment of gender norms' gang? 

My name is technically gendered, but for that reason it still feels nonbinary in my heart and I feel no need to change it.
It’s even better when your name is from a long extinct language, so in the current day there isn’t any gender connotations except with those who study it.
My name is uncommon but not unheard of where I am. It's gender neutral so people get very confused about my gender.
Literally the only other people I’ve met with the name “Kit” or some variation have been non-binary 😂
i’m named after an entire ass goddess ;-; (which tbf does sound very cool when u say it like that but… no… lemme be like a genderless god instead please sfjskj)
Jealous. Mine is ridiculously common and always feminine.
my deadname was biblically male :/
some nonbinary person's name has to be like buttermilk  


(dw im n.b)
my name is literally ethan lol
It is definitely a win, lmao.. I have everyone tell me they thought I was a male after seeing my name on paper.. makes my little heart happy
There are some common names that are also not gendered, like Avery
Sasquatch
Yeah as someone with a rare name it’s pretty rad that to 99% of the people I meet the precedent with what a (insert name here) should be just doesn’t exist. I’ve only heard of people also having my name but I’ve yet to meet someone with the same name as me.
Without fail, every time I introduce myself, I either get ""Oh, I know someone whose dog is named that!""

Thanks... /s
does tetra sound fem?
Someone asked my name today and I said 'Bee' and they said 'yeah what's your name' and it went on like that for some time
Tohru gang
Zander, vaguely masculine but also quite strange. Just like me
My birth name was heavily gendered and very popular in my generation. I changed it to the earlier, root name that was originally masculine. Fortunately, it's from a dead language, so it feels very neutral. My middle name is just one letter. I like making up random words whenever people ask me what it stands for. :D

&nbsp;

Fun story,  my best friend and platonic soulmate is the one who first gave me my real name as a nickname many years ago. We knew too many people with my deadname, and she said it didn't fit me anyways. The nickname stuck and always felt more ""right"" than the trendy garbage my parents saddled me with.
Only if I reduce my very gendered first and middle name to nicknames can they be gender neutral names. I'm sooooooo tempted to ask my family to call me Ace, but I can't bring myself to 🥲 step by step.
Yess. I chose my name, Storm, for this reason
My name is quite rare but people still assume a gender upon seeing it which is odd to me. The only famous person with this name was a male mystery writer. But yeah ok, assume it's female. 🙄
it's a good feeling.
Amab and my name is from a language that's not native to my home country, where it gets taken for a woman's name :)
The next move is even better, en passant
My name is MORE masculine but I feel more masculine so it seems appropriate
Same!
This is precisely why I made up my name.
Damn, I wish! My name isn’t the most common where I’m from, but my parents apparently named me after a princess from their country. If doesn’t sound too feminine at all, but just knowing where the name came from was enough for me to not like it and want to change it.
The name I wanna change to is a very femm name but idc lmao
I chose a masculine name to try and make it any gendered. Nicolas. 

That way my gender fluid ass can feel good about my name. No matter what gender I get smacked with.
same here! only person around with this name lol
My name is literally a verb lmao
My chosen name (Silas) is rare, gendered and cool as f-ck!
sometimes i wish i would have the name of my brother because its not masculine nor feminine
I’d recommend using mens clothing and going for something particularly baggy, if you want to hide your figure and aren’t wearing a binder. Mens clothing has a different stitching — not sure on the specifics.

I also find that wearing a face mask, even when fully vaccinated and there’s few people around, helps make me feel more comfortable by hiding my rounder face. I wear it anyway, but it’s a nice little bonus. Especially since darker ones blend in with my hair and hide the shape pretty well.

I hope this advice helps even a little.
I hear that name and don't associate a gender with it at all
That's a cool ass name and yeah that's not gender coded at all! 💜
Hugo?

Edit: checked your username so I'm guessing Miika maybe?
[deleted]
How do they name intersex people? Is that a separate registry?
That law was changed a few years ago btw, you can now even change your name to an ""opposite gender's"" one without getting a legal sex change. One of the only improvements we've had to trans rights in 20 years though 🙈
Oh my god. I GO BY BEE AND IM ENBYY LMAO
Damn that's my goal!  
I want to be a walking confusion machine too!
Opposite strategy, same result xD
I am. My name is pulled from 1st millennium mythology, it is 5 letters long and not extravagant, has both men and women named it in an even split, and hasn't been used as a personal name in the last 300+ years enough to even make it onto name registries. Nobody can definitively guess a gender on me based on the name.
LMAO MY NAME IS ACTUALLY A LANGUAGE!

And a specific one, that's why I made that meme x)
Chaos is the only deity I wish to get my name from
Same here. My best friend of 18 years gave me my name as a nickname when we were 14. I started using it more and more often and I plan to change it legally this summer.
i do all this and wear a binder and am never mistaken for a man. idk what i’m doing wrong
i need advice on how to look feminine with acne and being fat lol
I think of Jean Grey, or Harry Potter
Thats awesome
Thank you!!
my bet is on it being yuri
Apparently, the current tradition is to allow a name to be chosen for a given gender, if at least five living people of the same gender hold that name in Finland. New names must be specifically approved by the national Nimilautakunta (transl. name board) to add to the name pool. Unsure if this is still true but - iirc - the new name would then be ""registered"" as a female or male name depending on the assigned sex of the applicant for that name...

Ultimately, it seems to still stand so that you cannot give the name of the ""opposite gender"" to your newborn child. This rule seems to be slightly less strict in the case of a person of or over the age of 15 seeking to change their name, though ;0

Coin flip (joke)
Not a clue... Guess in our 5 million population intersex people don't statistically exist, so we don't care. /j
Oh heck that's VERY useful to know! But does this apply to newborns as well? That you could call your female child a ""male name"", for example?

Struggling to find sources...
If you were bisexual you would be and enby bee bi
That's great! Congrats! Friends like that are the most incredible gifts life can offer us.
Same here. But it does at least make me feel better about myself, even if others don’t see it.

Honestly, I’d rather be mistaken for a man then for a woman. My brother made a comment about others calling me ‘sir’ when I got my binder, and I felt somewhat euphoric. A they/them, yes, but I do kind of like being called ‘Mr.’ and ‘Sir.’
Not really sure on advice other than makeup and feminine clothing. I’ve never really tried to look feminine. Masks can help in this instance as well, since they can hide acne. But if you don’t clean the mask or your face after use, it can also make acne worse.
Doing your hair helps! I don’t do makeup much (cuz I suck at it and hate washing my face). When I want to look more feminine I try and do something with my hair, even just a simple clip or something.
Some people associate me with Phoenix Wright
And the coin lands on the side.
That I don't know actually, I just know that the ""nimilautakunta"" or whatever the body's name was doesn't care about gender when approving name changes
I love this
I'M THE SAME WAY!! I'm a transmasc enby, and while I feel like my gender is more akin to an arcade carpet than a guy, I still love when people see me as a guy! I think its cuz I just really really never wanna be seen as a chick
Ohhhh shit that’s that meme! I never knew what that came from that’s cool
Saaaame!  
Can't tell you how euphoric it made me being called ""Miss"" at the shop.

&#x200B;

ND Stevenson talks about this and his transition/gender very well! I encourage you to read their blog!

Happy Pride :)		"i am looking respectfully 😳
You are beautiful!  That is a gorgeous beard and you are absolutely rocking it. Thanks so much for sharing!  🌈Happy Pride!
Looking good! Hope you have sunscreen 👍🏼
Fuck yeah ✊
Took me a while to realize the right half of your beard isn’t reeeeeeally long
Woah, boobs and beard? How? Tell me your secrets!
You look GLORIOUS, friend! :D
You look absolutely amazing!!!
Yes
Beard jealousy is a real thing, y’all!

Happy pride month, I hope your whole year feels you with euphoria!
Fucking stylish!!
That’s AWESOME❤️!! I have a lil crop of chin hairs, let them grow to see if they’d turn into anything worth having, but alas. Not enough rows of hair(sob)!!
Beards really aren't my thing, but shit this makes me want one all of a sudden
Love that joy on your face 😍
I've been blessed
That's almost identical to my own beard. Looks great!
Mutton chops and ponytail, what an asthetic!
You give me so much serotonin!! You look amazing! Happy pride!
I want to be you
Enjoy your day! N happy Pride 💘
Looking fantastic!
BEAUTIFUL. Queen slay. You are amazing
😍😍😍😍😍 You are magnificent. Happy and Powerful Pride to you!

Your beard is majestic, you look awesome
Definitely looking respectfully
I’m not sure about OP, but I have PCOS and a symptom of it is hirsutism. I literally could grow a beard but I shave it because I’m too scared. OP is so confident, I’m honestly inspired. It looks so great!!
i know some folks can achieve this by HRT (testosterone gives you the beard, and you keep the already existing chest)
For some, prior to going on T, they use Minoxidil (aka Rogaine) on the areas they want hair.    

I'm going to try it on my brows. As I was around and plucking my brows in the 90's. Aka the period of time when pencil line brows were in. So we'll see how well it works.
I have a bit of patchy growth too, and I suspect PCOS because of my general tendency toward heavy periods. But it just won't grow long enough to be a proper beard. I've tried--it stays patchy like a thirteen-year-old's. Very annoying. I wish it would go one way or the other, either a proper beard and stache or nothing at all. But nope, nature forces me to shave, like it or not. At least I can complain about it here and not be thought of as ridiculous... I wonder if low-dose T would give me a proper beard? With my luck it would probably just give me more hair on my butt. :(
Ooh, yeah, I guess for AFAB people it might not be too hard. For AMAB people, maybe going on E, growing boobs, then going off it would result in this?
Just an idea, you could look into the minoxbeards subreddit
E doesn't get rid of pre-existing facial/body hair (otherwise transfem folk wouldn't be putting so much effort into hair removal). You could look like this doing puberty twice in either order. I think OP specifically is AFAB with hirsuitism though.

That's a full power aesthetic right there.
You look awesome and are total gender goals!!!! Happy new year!!!!
As a fellow fat enbie, are there any brands of pants/jeans you reccommend? I've had several breakdowns (in and out of stores) trying to find something that fits.
When I saw your ""Don't get me started on girls!'-Tattoo, I felt that 🥺💕
Why is your hair colour so beautiful, I’m so jealous I’m gonna die

The tats are wonderful happy new year!!
Happy new year back from another green-haired, fat and happy trans!

thank you 🥰
thank you 🤧🤧❤️❤️
ahhh thank you !!! :))
Sorry, this is an aside, but how on earth did ""gender"" become a positive word in this community!? I hate gender and want nothing to do with it - it is never a positive word to me. I realize this is the non-binary subreddit, not specifically agender, but there have got to be a bunch of us here who would take offense to bring called ""gender"".


Anyway sorry for interjecting; op is obviously not offended and they look great!
thank you!!!
good i hope it ruins their night

you’re perfect just the way u are
thank you :)
i don’t really care if you get it or not
because being fat is hot and cool
Sorry, I didn't even consider that. Will be more careful using that sort of compliment in the future, thank you for taking the time to educate me! /gen
Amen to that

Could I get your pronouns so I can properly refer to you in the comments on cringe btw
I love your hair color so much <3
Thank you!!
OMG THATS SO CUTE 😭💕
Thank you!
Wish other people thought so
[removed]
People are really okay with the celebration of trans bodies so long as they aren’t fat, completely ignoring the circumstances that fat, trans people go through and how it adds another layer of how they’re affected in society. And then they’ll ask if it’s satire when you call them fatphobic because they can’t fathom extending the same respect to fat trans people they would want others to extend to them.

In the most respectful, but gay way possible, you look amazing op.
Why is being fat cool?
[removed]
Oh, i didn't mean you criticize you; I've seen this a bunch around here and it's just been confusing the heck out of me and i was curious if you knew where it came from or why it's suddenly being used this way.


Also those ""slash"" things you're using - where did you learn about those and what the heck do they mean?

I'm probably just getting old and out of touch. Slang and new ways of talking are outpacing me...
they/he!
thank you!! it’s ion permanent brights in purple :)
🙂🙂🙂
I don't get why are you embracing the ana part of you??
i really do hope you recover. in the meantime though maybe don’t shit on other people’s bodies. it’s really weird behavior tbh
thank you!! yeah the great thing about navigating the world as a fat, trans adult is that you don’t really care what literal children say about you on an app. i have bigger problems to worry about and lots of confidence and happiness to enjoy.
more room for tattoos
LMAO see i’m glad you commented because i’ve been dying for your opinion!
Oh okay haha, I took that as a rhetorical question. I have no idea where it came from, I've just seen some people using it (outside this sub, I'm not active on here often enough to pick up slang lol), and hearing it for myself makes me happy (I'm genderqueer though, and identify as just...Something, so to me personally hearing that, is like the most validating compliment I could get)

They're tone indicators!! The ""/pos"" means positive tone, and ""/gen"" means I was being genuine! They're to help be clearer in your messages, since tone is something that can far too easily be misinterpreted in writing. They're not particularly new but recently, people have started using them more, I guess since neurodiversity (which I think these originally were for) awareness is spreading? I'm not sure though, I highly suggest looking them up! Even if it's just to learn the meanings of a few :)
Thank you
I might have to try that UωU
[removed]
Oh hell yeah. I like the way you think
[removed]
Tone indicators sound super helpful! I have often wished for exactly that (especially in writing but also in down communication 😬)

I've also seen them around lately but they have confused me because i didn't know what they were and didn't know how to Google for them without a name.

I just read about them and they are so excellent! Now i wish everybody used them! /gen


Actually i knew about and have used ""/s"" for a long long time but had no idea there were others or that it was called a tone indicator! Thank you for educating me!! /gen

I usually just resort to bring overly verbose and explicit in how i talk. Thank you for giving me another tool! /gen
oh WAIT in that pic i have in Sea Witch by Unicorn Hair!! i was thinking of what i have in right now
from… anorexia? it can.. kill you :/
😌
nothing you’ve said so far is a fact, just a lot of hate spewing under a post where i clearly love myself for who i am. it’s sad you’re wasting time shitting on other people’s joy. hope u find some better shit to do in 2022
I know right!! I was super happy when I found out about them, too! Seeing others use them around me really helps my anxiety, as overthinking tone is something that makes me spiral rather frequently. So yeah, I also wish everyone used them!

No problem! I'm really glad we could have such a nice and educational exchange :) /gen /pos

Me, too! And then I feel bad for using so many words 😅 /lh
Okiii ty lol I will try that after my hair grows out a little bit

God this is sending me. I’m trying to loose weight and you’ve made my day.

I hate skirts on me, but I have this one thrifted dancing skirt… it has so many deep pleats that when I spin it goes straight out 😍 I wouldn’t ever wear it casually bc I hate the shape on me, but god, twirling in it give me euphoria
Love the feedback. Definitely looking into eye makeup to slightly feminize. And I’ve got some colored shirts on the way!

Happy Tuesday from a fellow enby (they/them)		"You look like someone who could change the world.
I think we found the protagonist y'all
Where did you get that shirt
Every time I see this top I wonder why they didn't put the ace flag on the letter a. Still cute, though
you look amazing! happy tuesday to you as well :) 

(also that shirt is awesome, where did you get it?)
you look really great but that shirt always disturbed me.. because they missed a perfect chance to make A the asexual flag.
Happy Tuesday to you too!!
A happy Tuesday to you as well!
Oh my, what lovely hair! Happy Tuesday!
Holy shit we have the same shirt and I’m wearing it right now.
Fancy Pride Tuesday
\#gOALS you look amazing. when i grow up i want to be you. (okay this sounds creepy but i promise i don't mean it creepily)
I want that shirt so bad, and you re cute.
So what if I'm not human?
Yoooo! I have that shirt!
That shirt and pose is everything!
You have absolutely stunning eyes
Pretty symmetrical face
Thank you for that, I'd love to change the world!

I borrowed my brother's shirt and it made me surprisingly happy ☀️ definitely considering a binder, though		"The shirt looks gorgeous on you. It really compliments your skin tone and your eyes.
Very strong NB milo from Atlantis vibes
I don't know you but I'm real thrilled for you!
Love this look 😊. A look I'd like to try for myself if I could 😅
I love your hat! It makes me want to actually wear the million hats I have but never wear. The shirt fits you perfectly in every sense too.
you look cool in that shirt

&#x200B;

also i think i just realized why i basically only wear men's shirts
Oh my gosh, I thought that was a wizard hat at first, with the top drooping back or whatever. You look rad in any case!

&#x200B;

You could totally rock a wizard hat though, just saying.
ugh u look great!!
Great shirt, hat and glasses!
Also lovely hat pairing
That’s the exact dark green polo uniform shirt my private school made us wear for 12 years
You look great! 

My polo shirts are one of my greatest sources of euphoria. I found that out by accident when I had to borrow one of my dads for a work thing. I definitely immediately went and bought 3 of my own after I gave my dad his shirt back.
Congratulations
I love your vibe, also, that colour really does you a number ^^
You look amazing
You're very pretty 🤗
[deleted]
Terry Pratchett brim for the win  ❤️
You look great. Keep that hat! It rocks!
You look fantabulous! I love your glasses :)
Cutie :3 *huggles*
holy crap! that shirt really brings out your eyes! looking amazing friend
oooo you look super coolll
I mean this in the best way possible, you have like, nice teacher vibes lol >•<
Thanks, it's not a color I gravitate towards normally but it does look nice om me :)
😂😂 love it!!
Yeah first post here 😅 guess I've always known I'm NB but only realised it a few weeks ago. Came out to my bf but otherwise still closeted. Scared, but indeed also thrilled
Thanks! I always thought hats looked awful on me, until I found this one. I'm sure you'd look amazing!
Totally do it! Hats are awesome!! Yeah my brother is way taller but we basically have the same posture; thin and broad shoulders 😂 thanks!!
Thanks!

XD tell me!
Hahaha, amazing 😂 thanks!!
😊😊❤
Thanks! \^\^
Thanks! I love hats, always thought they didnt look hood on me till I found this one 😌
Haha oh nooo!
I am so gonna buy myself some polo's soon! 😄
Thanks!
Aw thanks! \^\^
Thanks 😊
Thanks! ☺
Mainly trying to not burn from the sun 😄
Oohh I like that! 😍
Thank you so much! Definitely will ☀️
Thanks😊
❤❤
I must say my eyes look more green due to the green reflection of my glasses, in reality they are blue/gray 😅 thanks!!
Thanks ☺☺
😂 appreciate it!
This is wonderful!

Also, you might wanna ask your brother if you can keep the shirt, if it makes you that happy
No u! 😊
True that 😂

Happy (end of) Pride Month!! 🌈		"When you're getting gender envy from all of them: *anxious sweating ,but dying of cuteness*
fuck i wish i had horns...
I love the art!!
Pride month never ends! (I'm extending pride forever)
low how all of them are just normal very gay humans but the asexual is just like fuck you i am tiefling
June's over, back into the closet with us. /s
I'm sad I couldn't celebrate it properly :(

i wish i could be out with the rest of everyone
The bisexual person’s phone isn’t clearly on 3% and I find that outrageous.
I ship it. All of it
Hi, I'm OP. I've never actually posted on Reddit before despite having this account for almost 6 years lol. I really didn't think this would get much attention, so I was surprised when I woke up this morning and saw the notifications. I wanna thank everyone for upvoting and commenting and the awards. I'm glad you all liked this piece as much as I do! :D

These fools my OCs, and they are all siblings. From left to right their names are: Dimitri, Juno, Eros, Theodore, & Lilia. There's actually one more of them, but he's cishet. His name is Apollo, and [he's the one taking the picture lol](https://twitter.com/trashprince8/status/1408550978740133890). We love a supportive family!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

I'm not good at plugging myself, but um... if you want to see more of my art, you can find me on Twitter @ TrashPrince8 and Instagram @ Sinklair8

Anyway, thanks again, everyone. I hope you all had a happy and safe pride 🌈✨✨

*Edit: I forgot to say something lol*
*i'm in this picture and i like it so much*
Time for wrath month!
I feel like with these things you just can't not look for your flag
Are they original characters love the style
Their expressions are great.
Good, we can still be proud and the companies aren’t all “consume our product, homosexual.”
Omg I want Enby's skirt and Pan lmao
As an ace person I can confirm we have horns /j
They're so cuteeee!!! Omg! I'm part Juno and part Lilia 💗
RIGHT this is ridiculously cute and I wish I were any of them
same 😭😭😭😭 transition goal: tiefling
Same
In a perfect world I would be a satyr
Thank you!! <3
His name is Eros and he’s a special one for sure😔
I’m not fully out myself, so I understand the feeling of loneliness. But don’t worry. There will be other prides. Who knows? Maybe this time next you year you’ll be celebrating out and openly :>
Even the aro enby?
They are actually a queer band of siblings ^^
theyre all poly and in love.
Thank you very much!! <3 And yes! They are my original characters :D
No joke 😩 all the enbies wanna be Creatures
Transition goal: dragon. 
Heck I love dragons. ╥﹏╥
The ace is named Eros. That’s amazing lmao
aromantic people can still desire and be in relationships

Hey all, it's been a while hasn't it? During that time I had been questioning my gender identity....again, and I've figured out that I'm actually a trans girl! So I guess I'll be moving over to r/trans. But I will be sticking around here because I love seeing all of y'all being happy!		"Yaaaaay! So happy for you! Stop by again any old time!
I guess I won’t be moving to r/trans alone ☺️

Well done! Don't forget that you can question and change your gender to whatever, whenever you like- Enjoy being female!
I hope this doesn't come across as wrong but since you look young, please for the love of all that is holy, enjoy your gorgeous body to the full! 

Once upon a time, I had a lovely young body but stupid me did not enjoy it & now I look at old photos & think WTF WAS WRONG WITH ME?!? I still look good & try to enjoy my body more now, but I wish someone had said to me, ""You look damn fine! Enjoy your sexy youth in whatever way makes *you* happy!"" So now I'm saying it to you. Sexy older adult is real too but I don't want anyone to have the regrets I do.

You look beautiful!
That's so great! 💖 Also you look magnificent in that and I'm jelly 😚
So happy you found yourself! Congrats!
holy moly you’re gorgeous!

Indeed!!!
Oh hello young genderful being! Please come hang out with me and others navigating genderfulness in my twitch stream: https://linktr.ee/dungeon_meowster

Short answer? Talk to your person. When my wife (!!!) and I first met, I was not quite ready to date yet. When she expressed her love initially, I had to tell her I wasn’t ready yet. Her intentions were clear and she decided I was worth waiting to have a relationship together. (She was too!).  I got over my heartbreak, got to know her, and honestly going slow in the beginning and setting up good agreements and boundaries (no yelling, always kindness, assume positive intent, no sarcasm, own your part - especially when you’re wrong, don’t hold things over each other to beat the other up with). So communication is how you establish all of that. Speak your desire - it might be met! But also make sure you do it in a private space where both of you can process without interruption or weird pressure. And if she says no or not right now, graciously accept the no. You never know what might shift later!
Thank you!
Yep! It’s a dress. :-)
Thank you! Happy to share the smiles back.
Thaaaank you! I love them too. I asked her which I should wear and she said both.
We are pretty diverse beings and wanted to share the love with everyone.
I’m confused by the “same sex” comment. I’m AFAB and she is AMAB and we are both on genderful journeys. It’s a bit more complex than “same sex”. But we are definitely happy!
Well, good luck on your journey into being Married Humans! Love each other, support each other, always pack snacks.

Hugs (if you want 'em)!

Give em an extra kick in the ribs for me.
I WAS going to go as a clown-cowboy so I could say YEE-HONK but that is also a good idea.
thank you so much 🥺
Thank you 🥺 They're not gonna know what hit them, mostly because they'll be flattened after I hit them with my car.
Always looking for more good music, thanks 🥰
Ooh it's got Body by Mother Mother! I'm following 😄
All u have to do is believe in urself 😎✨🥰
Thank you so much that means a lot 😭
I will! I haven't been powerlifting for 2 years for NOTHING. This is what I was meant for.
My pronouns are they/them! Sorry for the confusion!
Sorry dawg but I have one singular brain cell that dings around my skull like a DVD logo and sadly it's yet to hit a corner
I suppose but you should find a better deity
LET US COMMENCE THE BURNING OF THE TRUE WITCHES.

Cursed, but respectable. Wield this power with honor
This is probably the best comment I'll see all November
Thanks.
hell yeah!
Lol, no confusion, just making a cheeky comment on you looking great regardless of gender/pronouns :P

Do whatever makes you happy!		"I'm in this picture and I kinda like it
That's so lovely I'm so true. Embracing who and what we are so important and finding a way to be happy with with that is also super super important
If someone told me my first outfit made me look “great” and my second one made me look “happy” I’d assume they were politely pointing me towards the first outfit
Appreciate this.
Dresses are so cute, I can't deny I want one. But they don't fit how I want to look. But I enjoyed my kilt... so as I build solarpunk themed outfit, maybe a skirt to swap in on demand
Uhm also you look great in that too :p
Love this. Still struggling to find the right balance.
Me in a dress
I like kilts because anyone can wear it and not get odd looks
am i the only one who also wants to look happy and people to think i look great too.
   
this felt like “well if you are gonna be ugly be happy about it”
I think the most gender-neuteral clothing ever is a cream coloured hoodie and dark jeans... 

Change my mind
“You look great” usually sounds to me like a sort of generic compliment just to make someone feel a little better. But “you look happy” is so much more genuine and sweet and emphasizes that it doesn’t matter what other people think, what you’re wearing makes you look like you love it and that’s what makes it pretty.
I was thinking the same thing as well. I was annoyed that that the 2nd outfit wasn't great as well or even better or amazing or at least something complementary you know. Saying happy was a polite way to not compliment outfit really saying I don't like the outfit but like that you look happy.
I suppose the fact is to most of the cis population a boy in a dress does not look great or attractive but they swap that for being happy. It’s a shame we have to choose being thought of as looking ridiculous but happy - or looking attractive and ‘great’ unhappy, but right now it seems to be that way
From what I understand from my sister and mom, women struggle with dresses fitting just  right too…
Yes exactly, me too! I do see a lot of TW in clothes that highlight all their flaws and guise all their good points. Crop tops and mini skirts when you’re in your 40’s and battling middle aged spread look good in no woman
Nah brah when you right you right
Definitely the most boring clothing choice ever.
I’d be more down with this interpretation if not for the fact that it’s “you look…happy” rather than “you look happy,” you know?
Fuck that, boys in dresses look confident and awesome. Every bit as cute as girls and enbies in dresses. Dresses are rad and everyone deserves to look great in them.
<3 Its less about it physically fitting me, more about it fitting me as an aesthetic. I have found I look good doing corporate/professional leaning aesthetics, or relaxed ""hippie"" styles. I have a very sausage body, and I feel it doesnt lend itself to form fitting stuff, and while I might enjoy a sundress... I also wont like how it looks on me.  


Thus the fun of finding something that feels right AND makes me happy to see myself in.
No this is a shit take. Its still definitely about building people up not telling someone what they should or shouldn't wear.     
    
I'm saying if someone responded like they did in the comic I would know they thought I was ugly. That's not someone I need to talk to about fashion EVER again, And neither are you. I really hope you don't talk to friends like this.
Everyone might deserve to, but not everyone does. I want to know I look good when I go out as an enby but I know I don’t look good in a dress and by good I mean attractive. It’s s horrible feeling but u can’t deny if you’re AMAB and u put on your favourite dress and walk down the high street you will hear most people smirking or laughing. St the very least, just staring. There is nothing good about that feeling, it is depressing and makes me want to self harm
Ah I see, that’s true too finding a style that fits your personality
You hope I don’t talk to my friends like what? Being honest with them if an item of clothing is inappropriate or doesn’t flatter them.. why?
I’d rather be honest than lie to make them feel better and let them feel bad when u see cis people mocking them behind their back. I don’t want to see my friends hurt. Obviously this is only if my advice is asked for as there are some amazing friends who don’t give a shit if they look ridiculous and get laughed at which I think is Amazing. Everyone should have the confidence in themselves to be that person, but not all are there yet.
Nah still a shit opinion.
And that is your opinion."	y1qbfs	NonBinary	1815	1.0	2022-10-12 01:24:55
Happy Pride! r/NB, take some LGBT-Visors Mandos!		"this is the way.
If you wanna add more, try the lesbian and gay men flags!
Holy fuck this is so cool!
You have something I want.
Fun fact, all mandos are canonically non-binary as their traditional language mando’a has no pronouns or gendered language. For example Buir meant both ""mother"" and ""father"", just as ""son"" and ""daughter"" were both represented by the word ad. When it was necessary to specify gender, the adjectives of jagyc or dalyc—male and female, respectively—would be added.
What're the bottom 2?
Do you plan to sell stickers of these??
How can u include gender queer but not lesbian that's ridiculous
[deleted]
r/transclones
Awesome!!
This is the way
I must move to mandalore immediately
The yellow flag with the purple ring is the Intersex flag and the purple, green & white flag is the genderqueer flag
I post more often to twitter then anywhere else but youre welcome to download and print yourself
3-4 colour flag easy, multitone colour flag = new to make a new helmet for it to look nice
/j?
That's cuz they're complimentary colours. They look good together.
as always?
this is the way!
Cool! thanks!
I mean, like as a color scheme, I do personally find it to be really pleasing, arguably more than any of the other. Blue, pink and purple just go really well together

David Tennant on This Morning	Just incase anyone didn't see it David Tennant wore a nonbinary pin on this morning yesterday! He supportiveeeeee. I almost happy cried, I gathered he'd have nothing against it but it feels great to be supported by an actor I grew up watching :)	"[removed]
When he has normal hair he doesn't even look like an actor. He looks like a kindygarten teacher who calls raisins ""nature's candy"" and forgets the lyrics to the wheels on the bus. Basically Flanders.
Love that he walked off and immediately started eating the pudding they had.
If you haven’t seen it, Staged is a great comedy show, it stars DT and Michael Sheen, and their families, and was filmed over lockdown.
Considering how many British media personalities have revealed themselves to be terfs lately, it's a huge relief to me that I was right about David Tennant because that one would have crushed me.
I love him. He's always such a warm and wholesome presence!
God I knew there was a reason I was obsessed with him as a teen.
I didn't even question why this was on this sub. I just assumed everybody liked David Tennant.
God I absolutely love David Tennant
I got a photo with him at a comic con once on my birthday and he wished me happy birthday and it was the greatest moment of my life
I always knew he was the best doctor
Yay! My favourite Doctor loves us!!
I saw this on tumblr the other day and *my heart*.

I wasn’t even particularly familiar with him until a few months ago when I decided to watch the tv adaptation of Good Omens (yes, I do live under a rock), and it took 0.0001 seconds for me to respect the guy. He seems lovely, in as much as I can say that about someone I’ve never met.
Unrelated but he looks so cozy
Awwww 😭
chad shit
And I thought I didn't love him enough 😭
oh no i love him
I love this man
My favorite doctor 🥺❤️
love this fella
this makes me so happy, hes the best doctor
Kinda sad I missed this... stopped watching This Morning because Philip Schofield has become intolerably annoying 

Also I'm not usually awake when it's on, but when I have been, it's because of him 

To the subject at hand: that's pretty cool!
DAVID TENNANT IS NONBINARY??
Brilliant, Molto Bene!
David is one of my favourite actors.. And this solidifies my love for the man!
I heard his kid is.
Well, he *was* a Time Lord…
lol i had the same thought, ""is *he* non-binary?"" and then laughed at myself
r/oddlyspecific
Him playing the nanny in Good Omens basically
>nature's candy

those are blueberries, not raisins lol
Well they're actors

They're supposed to look like anything
Yessss 😂
pudding is good!
I keep seeing clips on tiktok but I really need to watch the whole thing
I feel you! God that would have been too much. This whole comment section is warming my heart too
You stopped at teens? 

*oh wait I’m still technically a teen for another year. Ah.*
I thought I was on either Doctor Who, Good Omens, or David Tennant sub before I saw the comment. Ugh I love him so much.
I got a photo with him too and he was so nice. I’m hoping to meet him again next year and get another photo and an auto. He’s a truly amazing person.
No I think he's just doing it to show support
Not as far as I know, but he does play an agender character in Good Omens! He's not human, tbf, and presents masculine with he/him pronouns most (but not all) of the time. But Neil Gaiman is great about inclusivity so I highly recommend his works.
pardon my slow reply but ICYMI, Tennant has a nonbinary kid! 🥺💕
[removed]
which one of the dozen? lol (kiddin)
>!He *is* a time lord according to google insisting on giving me spoilers.!<
Once a timelord, always a timelord
nonbinary people can use he/him pronouns though?

Disagree.
all 3 seasons are on dailymotion :) that's where I'm watching s3 since I'm languishing in the US, cut off from the BBC
I love the 
IM DOCTOR WHO
NOT ANYMORE BABY
argument between david and micheal
Same! And when I saw that it wasn't I was like ""valid"" and upvoted anyway lol.
he did have that beautiful hair during quarantine? with the headband? i don't think he cares too much to flag masculine.
Neil Gaiman and David Tennat are some of the most wholesome famous British people (honourable mention to Sir Attenborough too)
Yeah it's really heartwarming.
I heard it was Wilfred but can't find any info on it, idk
it's all that wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff. 

He is a great human (Time Lord)!
This comment in itself is spoilers
Spoiler veil please, for those who still don't know!
sure, and i realized i was making an assumption
I literally will accept any pronouns (except neo)
Hold up, there's a THIRD season?!
I can't find the post but on georgia's ig she once wrote ""(...) so happy you came out to me (...)"" under Wilfred's birthday cake but as far as i know its the only ""proof"" we've got so its not really confirmed
Indeed it is and yes he’s pretty great
How do I do that? I would have done to begin with if I knew how but also it’s plastered across every social media too including Reddit ads unfortunately.
What’s wrong with neopronouns?
Yes, just released recently
Put > ! and ! < on both sides of text you want to hide (without spaces)
Nothings wrong with them, I'm just not personally comfortable with them being used for me
Nothing is wrong with them. Nikki just doesn’t use ‘em
Thank you!
Ohhh, I misread what you said earlier"	zh01wa	NonBinary	1786	1.0	2022-12-09 15:22:46
"I just got recognised as nonbinary in a coffee shop. I had the sweetest conversation with the person who served me, who came over to apologise for calling me ""sir"". He'd noticed my nail polish and wanted to make sure he called me the right thing next time. So I told him my name. Happy, happy days."		"I love this!! I was doing a return at Abercrombie about two weeks ago and the person helping me kept calling me They/Them. They didnt know those were my preferred pronouns but I thanked them for it cause it really made my day!
That's such a nice little story and I'm hapoy for you! *But* I'm really confused rn - is there some secret nail polish code I'm unaware of??
I try to never gender my customers if I don't know them already, however there's a weird pressure to (especially in the South with the whole sir ma'am thing)
Are barristas the new bar people.
How do you recognise non-binary.
i think using sir/maam should just be discouraged altogether
🥰🥰🥰 YAY!!!
This made my heart glow
That’s amazing!
Umm. I have the exact same polish on! 💕
I mean having nail polish doesn't have anything to do with gender so to quote a meme, ""He a little confused, but he got the spirit.""
I've noticed some people just do this as a blanket policy now. Matt Parker of the YouTube channel StandUpMaths for example just uses they/them for every single person he (or should I say they?) talks about.
Apparently so... though it may be a secret only known to baristas!
I thought the same :) 
I might just try it out
Also in the south, so I ""lean into it"" by using, ""folks"" whenever necessary, and ""fine/good folk"" when respect (as in authority) is required. Doesn't always work, but I've had happy trans people enough times to make it *so* worth it.
Mir / saarm
They could be any one of us!
I do that specially on tiktok cus I am afraid of the video getting lost if I go check the pronouns so I just use it as a blanket policy
Baristas were the only people to correctly gender me before I started T. Them and old men who were losing their vision.
That's good to know. What *kind* of nail polish do I need to wear to subtly signify I'm nb?
(Just starting off with I'm assuming this is a suggestion for a sir/ma'am replacement to use for my customers, but if I'm wrong please correct me) 

I think those could work in some spaces, but if I'm honest those aren't really that common as far as I know. A lot of my customers that would even expect a sir/ma'am are older, conservative, Christian southern/Midwestern folks. Some customers don't speak English that well or it isn't their native language to have that familiarity. I'm young and in queer spaces a lot and nonbinary myself but not only would I not really care for being called Mir or saarm (I would personally just prefer sir honestly but both seem like a play off of sir and ma'am anyway so it still feel a bit gendered) but until it was mentioned I never heard of it. I think it's a good suggestion in theory but honestly there's this nonbianry educator on Instagram (and I'm sure other spaces) and they mentioned how it's probably just best to avoid the usage of those unnecessarily gendered terms altogether. I mean honestly unless someone specifically asks to be called sir or ma'am then I still can avoid it. Not to mention not using sir/ma'am typically stirrs up less controversy than using neo terms too (they're fine though if someone wants them ofc).
A crowd of kids in school uniforms and one person two feet taller than everyone else wearing five colors and a physics defying hat? There's no way we'll find the stand user.
I think it's the glitter topcoat that sets us apart as fabulous
It was a joke suggestion, but I enjoyed your analysis.
Are you implying that nonbinary people are stand users? 🤔
Great thanks for educating me :D
The little white dots probably help, very cute
Good thing i'm obsessed with glitter topcoats😂
Lol, called out!

u/StellarSzintillation in case you were serious, I'm currently wearing el cheapo baby blue from Dollar Tree over Barielle ridge filler, LA Colors Jewel Tone glitter-in-clear, and a top coat.  The only thing that was pricy at all was the ridge filler.  Sure, I have some fancier brands because they had nice colors, but they don't dry faster or last longer.  3-4 days either way.  Unless you're looking for something specific (I love the Go Ginza pale lavender from essie!  Target and Walgreens.) there's no reason to spend more than $1, $2, or maybe $3.
Ah sorry about that, I'm generally just bad at noticing jokes and such
Take a gander at the selfies on the front page any day.
Me too!
I was sort of serious :D thank you
We know. You already said you’re nonbinary
I wish I could disagree, but can't.
Everytime I do my nails I either put a holo taco or a chunky glitter top coat. They go with everything
HOLO TACO! I love Simply! I have her line of pink and blue and its the trans pride flag!
AH SOMEONE CAUGHT THE REFERENCE!!! I need to buy one of her other sets. I have the unicorn one 🦄
Cool! I love her “what do you think” meme; I wish she’d still use it in videos."	oztuw3	NonBinary	1792	1.0	2021-08-07 14:04:51
Best teacher I have ever had!		"For me it was just not receiving flowers from school. Still got presents from family and classmates but hey free food basically. 

And i told absolutely no one that I'm not cis (still gender questioning but i know I'm not cis lol)
Wie süß...mein lehrer ist gefühlt so das gegenteil hahah
Du hast die deutschen Enbies heraufbeschworen
Ugh, ich hasse es dass hier zum Frauentag gratuliert wird. Das ist eigentlich ein Tag für Feminismus und Gleichberechtigung, und wegen seinem Geschlecht Glückwünsche zu kriegen, finde ich so bescheuert.
Awww nice! :D I wished my mom happy woman's day and she didn't wish it back, that made me really happy too. Now I'm crossing my fingers she'll wish me happy nonbinary day on international nonbinary day :) (July 14)
That happy feeling of being included by being excluded lol 😂🥰
As somebody who’s only understanding of German comes from 2 years of it in highschool I am trying SO hard to understand the majority of these comments but boy am I struggling 😭
I mean eigentlich FLINTA*-Kampftag. Aber trotzdem süß.
Mega nett von ihm :) 
Bei uns nennt man den Tag Feministischer Kampftag und da sind Alle Flinta* Personen einbezogen (weil nicht nur Frauen von Sexismus, struktureller Benachrichtigung etc. betroffen sind) . Also wünsch ich dir anlässlich dazu nen guten Feministischen Kampftag :)
I struggle with these women's day congratulations every year so this post made not only yours but also my day better :)
What a great teacher!

(also unrelated but international enbies day when)
I wish people online were more inclusive like this teacher. I had to explain why organ does not equal gender yesterday.
just as the day was over i thought that i should have replied to every men that congratulated me ""for you too!"" and smile
Ew for ""happy women's day"", but still a step in the right direction
Naja abgesehen von nem anderen der würd das glaun ich auch machen wenn wir frauen in der klasse hätten
>gefühlt

Deutsch ist nicht mein 1. Sprache. Was meinst du hier? Mein besten Übersetzung ist ""My teacher is felt, so the opposite"". Das stimmt nicht genau?
Kann dieser Tag noch besser werden? 🥹
Ich meine, es feiert Frauen und lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit mehr auf sie. Ich finde das ist schon feministisch.
I just gave up
Was ist Flinta*? Also wofür steht das Akronym?
Anmerkung: Flinta bedeutet Frauen, Lesben, Internet, Nicht-Binäre, Trans und Agender Personen.
I will never understand how people can be so stupid and stubborn to think it matters at all what's ""in your pants""
We shouldn't get rid of the women's day imo, but we should make an international non-binary day ^^
It is slang, I would translate it to ""I feel my teacher is the opposite""
Der Ursprung ist ein Frauenkampftag, an dem für Wahlrecht und Gleichberechtigung demonstriert wurde. In anderen Ländern kriegen Frauen frei, um Seminare zu besuchen.

Währenddessen kommen im Kaff in Deutschland männliche Politiker um die Ecke und verteilen Rosen.

Frauentag an sich finde ich gut, aber das wird hier abgefertigt als wäre es so was wie Valentinstag.

Ich hab heute ernsthaft Werbung per Mail gekriegt, dass ein Shop für Therapiedecken jetzt einen Deckenbezug in Altrosa einführt, als *Symbol für alle Frauen*. 

Ein rosa Deckenbezug. 

Und das zieht sich SO durch die Deutsche Kultur, dass es sich echt anfühlt wie von oben herab. ""Statt gleichem Lohn gibt es am Weltfrauentag eine Rose von einem Kerl, Grußkarten von diversen Leuten, und einen rosa Deckenbezug.""

Vielleicht ist das in weniger ländlichen Gegenden ja anders, aber hier krieg ich das Kotzen.
Frauen,  Lesben, Inter, Nichtbinär, Trans, Agender
I had someone tell me that a uterus was a symbol that a lot of women use and that I should essentially get over it.
we actually have an entire week
https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/when-is-non-binary-awareness-week-2023

:)
We have a non binary people’s day!
Oh nono, that's not my issue with it. The point is that today is international women's *rights* day.
Ye...what they said is right, thx :)
Danke schön!
Ja, hab heute auch schon mit den Augen gerollt als ein paar Boomer wieder Frauenwitze brachten. 
Ich stimme dir in allen Punkten vollkommen zu!
I know, I celebrate that too
But unfortunately cis people don't even know it exists and you never hear something about it on the radio or in the media like you have with women's or men's day.
we do?? wHEN IS IT /gen

edit: swapped “is” and “it”
No it’s not? It’s international women’s day today. Not women’s rights day
Ah, I see
Where are you? At least in Germany and Austria it's called ""International Women's Day"".
Meine Mutter hat sich grade voll über Weltbild Rabatt zum Frauentag gefreut - gilt natürlich nicht auf Bücher. Gott bewahre, dass die Weiber auch noch lesen können 🙄😂
July 14 iirc?
>International Women's Day (IWD) is a global holiday celebrated annually on March 8 as a focal point in the women's rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, and violence and abuse against women.

Seems like english speaking countries don't call it ""women's rights day"", but point still stands. People keep treating it like a simple ""happy"" holiday, rather than a commemoration and a day of protest against injustice.
Yeah but it just isn't the case ""rights"" is in the name in many countries that implemented it. I agree rights are the main focus of it, or actually (outside a school, I'd say) *it is the fucking point*. Still it is not a common indicator, in English and  in German it also doesn't include ""rights"". (I'm from the Netherlands and its also just without 'rights'.) Maybe you are right it is watered down, I can appreciate the burnout of commodification and capitalist-consumerism bs around many holiday. But I can also see its some good camouflage in some places to get it through by appearing ever so slightly de-politicised.

Anyway this is a highschool(?) classroom i'm not really sure what to do besides pointing out that the day exists and have a short talk about why it was made a holiday. You can't really put female students on the spot and have them voice something for themselves they struggle with rights wise, unless the students approached the teacher first? If these powerpoint files get published or saved it also makes sense to me to kind of have them be (politically-)ambiguous even if you are willing to have a much more intense discussion as a teacher. Parents will give shit for the dumbest of things. If you don't teach history its hard to justify why you add more details. Like damn, you probably have about all of 3 minutes if you need to teach a different subject right after bringin it up.

I think you might be more likely to see the choice between having a socially relevant discussion and a faux happy holliday, while many others feel like they are facing a faux happy holliday mention, vs not even acknowledging it exists. (Neither are a nice dichotomy.) I agree it would be better if we all took the time out of our day to educate about rights, but I also see how people come to different choices when they are in a different situation than me."	11lrm7a	NonBinary	1725	1.0	2023-03-08 09:15:34

Why isn't ""sweet bean"" a thing? It's cute and relates to chocolate. 😅🥰

My partner calls me jellybean so I love this 😍 They call me a good bean all the time and it's magic
OMG I WANT SOMEONE TO CALL ME GOOD BEAN
I love this! Being Enby myself, my wife calls me: kitten as a neutral endearment. But bean is cool! 

Funnily enough that's what I call my black cat, my little bean. 🤣
Straight up me
Can you call me good bean? 👉👈
This is so cute. Where did bean come from? Kinda new to being enby
Am bean
\>\*remembers im non binary\*

\>\*realises i get to be called both\*
You see, I don't want to be a 'people'. 'Girl' hits okay for that spot but 'woman' is deeply repulsive. I want to be a 'fairy'. But that sounds *fucking insane* to people in the every-day sent. I just want people to be like 'fae're the kind of fairy who would do that' and there the gender itch is scratched. But you can't explain that to people. Bean is such a cute one. You are a good bean. :)
I practically always say good bean 💙 it is so cute and makes my non binary friends very happy
Huh? You can be nonbinary and still be the goodest boy or softest girl.

Nicknames =/= Identity

I want to be a good bean! 🥺
Something about being called a ""bean"" is so cute and I don't know why, also this is a real cute comic design.
personally i like a mix of good girl, good boy, and good baby
It's fun because then 

Girl → girlie

Bean → beanie


I'm so sorry I'm very much sleep deprived- lmao

Good tater! :DD
Awwe :33
HAHA I LOVE THAT
:DD
Awe :))
Bean :)
It does! :D
Ty! Also np :))
OMG THAT'S ADORABLE?? JSJSHF I LOVE THAT-
YOU ARE A GOOD BEAN <33
Awwe, that's super sweet! I usually call my cat ""Little Man"" or ""Mate"", haha! :))
You are a very good bean! The goodest of beans! <33
Ty! Honestly not sure, someone called me it in a thread and I was very happy though :)))
You're a good fairy! :))
I know, but I feel uncomfortable being called a boy/girl, and even ""good boi"" doesn't really feel right (I'm agender/nonbinary). No disrespect to people who don't mind those terms, though! They just aren't something I enjoy being called :))
Tysm! I realised my traditional art style was a bit hard to do digitally + wouldn't fit the vibe I was going for, but I honestly really like the beans that I went with!

Also it really is, haha!
Fr! Also thank you! :DD

Good girl kinda makes me feel gender af, and I'm still very much non-binary
good bean
Good tater💜
Bean
Bean :>
YAYYY YOU ARE ALSO A GOOD BEAN <33
🥺😘
...that hit as maximum gender and I sort of started crying. Thank you. That means a lot to me.
I'd probably word it differently myself than it ""doesn't fit"" your identity, then, because many of us share that identity. Just not your experience of it.
Hell yeah. Nothing makes me go harder when topping my spouse than a well placed “good girl” 😊
YAYAYAYAYA THANK YOU!!! <333
No worries! Glad it made you happy, good fairy! <33
The ways we all experience being non-binary are different. Non-binary is an umbrella term for anyone that doesn't fit the man/woman binary. No two non-binary people have the same experiences and genders.
Apologies, I'll be more considerate in future, it was mainly just something to share my happiness about finding a terms that was right for me (initially posted it on r/Egg_Irl for this purpose, but added it here as well)
You were fine. That person was being weirdly gatekeepy. All non-binary experiences are different and all are valid and worth talking about!

Just recently switched from they/them to he/they pronouns, and it feels really good. Happy Sunday!		"Nice bronouns 👉👉
love this look! where did you get that shirt? 👀
Congratulations! Really considering changing mine but we'll see

Edit: I haven't commented for ages and apparently my flair said she/they demigirl. Wow I've come a long way in the last year!
Wish I looked like you
Wow, I'm so proud of you man!
Yayyyy congrats!!! Also this shirt is fantastic
Love your look!  Rolled up sleeves with Ray-Bans and the Kleins peeking out ;;)
Nice shirt
yo i did the same thing a few weeks ago! we can be pronoun buddies lmao
Lol my brain read that as hoy boy 

Which i guess could make sense still... either way hell ya on the new pronouns
Oh wow, you look so cool!
yooo congrats! You are super valid
Is that a typo? Did you mean you went from they/them to he/***him***?

If you do mean he/they, how does that work in a sentence?

*""He is my friend, therefore I lent they my playstation controller?""*
That ominous look on your face
Congrats my dude!! Considering doing the same someday
Mans is handsome as hell🥺🥺
Thank you!! I actually just made it this morning 😊
Hi! It's not a typo, I just put my preferred pronoun first. Instead of typing out he/him and they/them, I say he/they so that it's clear I'm okay with either sets of pronouns. Basically what I'm saying is that I'd prefer to be refered to as he/him, but if they/them is used, that is okay as well.
that’s awesome!!!
omg if u ever make any to sell I would 100% purchase one!! so cute!!

Happy Wednesday. Have this accidental Bert cosplay from last month.		"AHHHH, I love this!!! 😭 You look so cool!!! 💚🌼🌼🌈
What a role model! I always end up looking more like Gonzo somehow...
This is wonderful thank you :D
Legendary 🌈
Absolutely love the sweater!
Love the look (and muppets)
I love it omg
It’s uncanny
the part that's sending me is that this was accidental !!
hot!!!!
Glorious!
you look dope! this is too spot on lol
Never before have I had reason to consider a puppet's outfit sexy.
Stunning + definitely overshadowing Bert! 🙌🏾🌷🌸
Can I be the Ernie to your Bert??
Ahh amazing!! 10/10 outfit
This is absolutely divine 😭😭😭
Hey you look great!
i can't help but love a bert flex
I love this SO much.
Two snazzy lookin pals here
Lemme guess, Ernie's at the Crematorium again? 😂
I love this so much. I got yarn to make an ernie sweater, I really need to start it!
this is too cute💖
It does look really good though!

I especially love your hair. As someone with an awkward half there curl pattern, I always get super hyped up when I see someone with curls that are actually gorgeous.

That said, I never knew Bert had style.
ok but u make a v good looking Bert teehee
Thank you! ✨💜
Ooooh. Gonzo is my favorite! Iconic!
I kid you not, I was really feeling this fit like all day. Came home from running errands and sat down to toke and about 10 minutes in realized I was dressed as Bert from Sesame Street. Lol. Happy accidents.
Yes pleeeease ✨💜
You could knit an entire sweater? Amazing. If you do it, I’d love to see it.

as someone who is afab and wanting testosterone, what does hrt do to you? im aware of what testosterone does, but ive never seen what hrt does- sorry,,im just curious,,,
gotta ask, is that a Jim Dunlop Jazz III XL in the 3rd pic? best pick i’ve used by far
Holy fuck this resonates with me deeply
The real question is, bass or guitar, which do u prefer?
[deleted]
HI MARCELINE!
Oh Marceliiiine
You look awesome, what kind of music do you play?
Cute!! happy 6 months!! you're awesome
Is that a Dunlop Jazz 3? Let’s start a band!
A fellow enby bassist!!! Rock on, friend!! 💛🤍💜🖤
I love the bra!! Looking good!

Yeah me too! I've only had her for a year but she's treated me really well!
Congratulations!!!!
Hell yeah! These are the best! Very comfy and very gender
I think that’s a mirrored photo ..... still way cool thou 🤘🤘
Aww, thanks
Don't worry, you're all good! I love to answer a good natured questions from fellow cisn't people! (And plus and procrastinating on coursework) My personal HRT experience is that over the last couple months I have gained:
-lil boobies
-soft, smooth skin
-10lbs
-stronger emotions, especially things like empathy 
-fangs
-hips and more feminine body proportions
-less body/facial hair
This isn't exhaustive but I hope it's informative!
Yes! But the not XL version. I accidentally bought 10 12-packs when I thought I was buying 10 picks! So now theyre my general purpose picks
Drumset :) but I can't take that to college! But out of the two of them I definitely prefer bass!
Maybe I'll post the Marceline costume I didn't get wear yesterday on here sometime
Ideally I'd love to be in a punk band of some kind, but for the moment I'm solo. I make a lot of things described as videogamey but I'm also working on a folk punkish album. Check out my sound cloud for some stuff I've been working on, it's all a bit of a WIP as I'm still honing my ableton skills

I tried but they just gave me a kazoo
Fuck it's been 7 years for me, what am I doing wrong?
Yeah it's a mirrored picture, I couldn't take a normal selfie to to save my life!
Also I think I shrank about an inch somehow?
Fuck yeah. Bass for me all the way
Hell yeah! Punk is one of my favorite genres
That's what I thought about Savannah!
As with all other things trans, if it's not happening naturally, store-bought is fine
I swear my hands and feet got slightly bigger on T, even though that's not supposed to happen with older patients.
Any recommendations for intermediate songs for me to learn by any chance?
Was it correct? Never been to the south.
Vampire, some assembly required.
Idk about my hands, but my shoes are starting to get a bit to big!
I'm old fashioned so mostly into stuff like the misfits, the clash, sex pistols, the damned, dead kennedys, offspring... Older punk rock stuff. I also love crossover genres like KMFDM. 


If you're up for some classic punk, try learning Spanish Bombs by The Clash.
Not exactly, everyone's mostly just staying in their dorms for the most part so it's really hard to meet people. This is my second year here, but my first being out as myself
That's coincidentally one of my favorites! Most of that album was bangers, Ill try to learn it next
Well, they're doing that here now as well because of the plague, so location probably doesn't matter much at the moment. But when all that gets back to some semblance of normal, check out the Pacific Northwest if you can. Especially the cities in Washington and Oregon.
Are you fuckin serious? Yeah, post it when you learn it, that song is awesome. 


Different song but have you watched the video for Rock the Casbah? One of my all time fave music vids

bathroom sign at my local coffee shop	this made me so happy, so i thought y’all would appreciate it	"Honestly just give us a sign that says 'shit here'
This doesn't feel supportive, but makes me feel like the butt of a joke. What's so hard about just a ""gender neutral"" restroom sign.
I get that maybe I'm being too cynical, but I can't see this without remembering countless transphobic jokes.  

 'I self identify as an apache helicopter."" ""I'm a ghost wolf turtle hybrid, respect my pronouns."" ""I'm assigned human at birth, but..."" 

I can't imagine being around whoever hung this up without them snarkily asking if they can transition into a Chinese person or saying ""I could care less how you want to dress, but I happen to think biology is real.""

This was hung on a single user bathroom with the intent for cis people to laugh at.
This is actually just a trap meant to obtain proof of Bigfoot's existence....
I'm my apartment blocks local cryptid,  i like this.
I also really don’t appreciate how awkward the shoulders look on the third figure. Dresses don’t make my shoulders look like that. My anxiety does.
Not great, but there were good intentions and its appreciated
personally hate these
bigfoot might be one of my favoritg genders

I hate these type of signs. well intentioned, but deeply cringey and unhelpful
It truly horrifies me how many people don't wash their hands...
i hate these signs lol it equates enbys to mythical creatures
This feels very passive agressive.
Ehhhh. I'm not fond of NBs being compared to mythical creatures like some sort of ""ooky kooky craaaaazy gender creatures!""
Very ""attack helicopter"" vibes and some people miss the point completely and go ""yeah but what if someone DOES identify as an attack helicopter? See, it's allyship!""

I'm not one to get easily offended at all, but I don't think the creator of this sign had actual love for nonbinary people in mind.
I feel like a message like “all welcome” or something would have felt better tone-wise. At the same time, I love my monsters and mythical beings (voidpunk is my thing) so I’m not necessarily opposed to the images haha
I think there's some controversy over how this could compare the validity of trans identities to cryptids, something that's not real and that can in turn be really invalidating. Some transphobes I've encountered do this, like comparing different genders to ""astrology"" or whatever. I know they meant this to be inclusive but I understand why people are getting bothered by it.
To me it feels a bit offensive. It sort of describes the behaviour of a lot of people that invalidate the non binary spectrum - at first it looks fine, almost like 'I don't understand, but I don't need to understand to be respectful', but then it feels like my identity is a joke to them. For sure you'd give a pair of bollocks if a bloody alien walked in through the door...
These signs always feel dehumanizing and othering to me
I can't say I'm a fan of the sign but I'm glad it made you happy
I've always found these signs cringe, and thats coming from someone with a bumper sticker that says I ❤️ BIGFOOT lol why can't they just use a sign that says ""Bathroom"" or ""Toilet""
Thank you. I hate it.
Sigh
I hate these
In some places it could work if there’s already a cryptid theme or something. Otherwise it just feels kinda weird and a little insulting. Would it be so hard for them to just put a sign that says “restroom” without any weird jokes?
Is it not that hard to get a sign that just says “restroom” without all that unnecessary stuff
I highly id as a goblin and I fucking hate these signs. If you really didn't care and weren't just virtue signaling you'd just mark them as restrooms or say which one has urinals if they're different.

No one gets to call me a cryptid but me
I hate these. Putting us next to sasquatch and a martian basically says we don't exist.
missingthepoint.gif
tbh this is not as inclusive as they think it is. This equates us non-binary people with cryptids and aliens.
Squatches and aliens welcome? Finally a bathroom that accurately matches my gender LOL
personally i love this! but i can see how it can come off as dehumanizing :(
Can't wait for Tucker Carlson to blow this out of proportion.
I don’t know about you, but I find it really fun and goofy. It’s also a nice change in pace from the usual gendered single stalls
Honestly I like the other creatures being there. To me it puts pressure off of it being a designated space for certain people, it seems more a designated space for just passing waste. Which is something all animals (including humans) need to do. I can also see these signs being popular at events where people cosplay.
Today I learned that Bigfoot is a nonbinary icon
Ye we had a similar sign at our school
The bathrooms were still gendered regardless
Personally i don't like my actual gender that exists being compared to things like bigfoot
It's a little bit silly, including the Sasquatch and the alien, but I suppose their hearts are in the right place.

I'd like it to be completely unremarkable that I'm enby. Someday maybe it will be.
this sign would be perfect if they just removed bigfoot and the alien
I love it. We can nitpick all we want about ""perfect representation"" but in the end, this is just a cute sign that makes it clear we're welcome in the restroom. 

Or are jokes not allowed anymore?
Its ok..could have been worse
Breaking news, my gender is bigfoot

I remember transphobe helicopter era jokes and I understand some people are really sensitive on this type joke. And It’s totally valid. 

BUT I fucking LOVE those silly sign , It nice to see a funny sign in a coffee shop. It’s not a school or an hospital. Toilette sign are usually jokes in bar and restaurant why the gender neutral bathroom should not have a silly, funny sign ?
this definitely seems like it’s meant to be offensive but jokes on them i am literally a cryptid. A Creature. a little Critter if you will.
I saw you can buy this sign on Amazon. It's called 'funny bathroom sign'. I almost bought one myself!
I Don't Like How The Three People On The Left Are Heavily Stylised, But Then The Bigfoot And The Alien Are Fairly Detailed, Just Kinda Looks Off Tbh.
bigfootgender😩😩😩
See also: /r/voidpunk
god i hate neoliberals
cute but snarky
An up vote just for including big foot 😂
Cool sighn I won’t judge
I love this!!!
Just to let y’all know, this sign fits the vibes of the coffee shop completely. When you first enter, there is a werewolf halloween decoration that is Always on display just right there. They have an alien arcade machine smack in the middle of the coffee shop. They have a bunch of vintage board games, and they are always playing some show with some geeky/retro vibes or something in the back of the common area. I’m not 100% sure, but I think the coffee shop is also run by queer people. It’s a vibe, I love it.
This is the only bathroom I want to use-
These are always funny to me
i approve this (im the wall)
[removed]
yay :D
[removed]
That's outrageous! Deal.
I would prefer if the sign just said “Restroom”
  I can every so often drink a 4 cups of Robusta throughout the day
...right outside the bathroom, just like Gran used to do
The real LPT is always in the comments.
You’d definitely get some people trying to shit on the sign
Yeah I actually hate these signs tbh. Feels super condescending and misses the point.
Same

Ah yes i am the same as Bigfoot or a literal alien, thanks
Yeah… I get where you’re coming from. I didn’t see it that way at first, especially since the entrance to the coffee shop as a werewolf halloween decoration displayed 24/7 and the shop has a rather queer vibe, but I still see what you are saying. I’m sure whoever designed the sign didn’t think that much about it, they almost definitely meant it to be lighthearted. Although, no matter the original meaning, people still have their own interpretations. It does really suck to feel othered as a non-binary person, we have been the butt of many jokes, and that sucks. I personally kinda like the sign because it is goofy and dumb, and I really like cryptids. That, and it was really nice to see somewhere in my tiny ass half trump-supporter town had a gender neutral bathroom in a popular coffee shop.
I've always hated these signs too. The options are:
- man
- woman
- a weird half and half creature
- fictitious

This is the shit that groups reclaiming dehumanisation of minority groups (most well known is currently called Voidpunk) try to fight.

Edit: format
I don’t think you’re being too cynical, I hate companies who act like having gender neutral SINGLE USE bathrooms makes them progressive in any way. They’re just opportunistic IMO.
I think it’s kind of clever because of the inside joke. Plenty of fashionly creative NB people identify as Cryptids or Aliens. This sign doesn’t care about gender. Neither do most of us technically. It’s cynical in a funny way and it involves the desire for a good habit (washing your hands). I think an NB person made this sign. It’s too clever for a Cis person to understand.
Non-binary is when only half your body is crippled by anxiety
I say this every time, these types of signs only work at DND shops or tourist spots for mythical creature sightings. 

Everywhere else it makes me feel uncomfy and slightly othered.
It's not great, it's excellent.
Or their asses
I love these signs. They equate enbys to mythical creatures
Wait, we’re not?
yes and not supportive of non-binary, just treating us as something weird to grudgingly put up with
But what if I AM an ooky kooky craaaaazy gender creature?  😢
Yeah, I Mean I Feel Like It's Fine When Actual NBs Do It, And I'll Allow It When It's Tehir Friends Referring To A Specific Person, But When Binary Folks Just Do It For NB Folks In General It Definitely Comes Off As Atleast A Bit Offensive. Like In This Case It Kinda Feels Like Someone Said They Should Put A Marker For NB Folk On The Door And They Were Just Like ""Pfft, Yeah, And Let's Add One For Bigfoot And Aliens Too!"". While It Could've Been Made With Good Intentions, It Definitely Doesn't Feel Right, I'd Much Prefer If It Just Said ""Bathroom"".
personally i think the sign kinda fits the vibe of the coffee shop, bc that’s the coffee shops whole vibe. they have a werewolf statue in the entrance and played stranger things on a projector
While I'm Not The Biggest Fan Of It ~~Partially Just Because Of Aesthetic Issues~~, I'll Definitely Admit It's Better Than Gendered Single-Person Bathrooms, Those Are The Worst. Like Literally All Gendering Them Does Is Inconvenience People.
I think at an event like that this sign would be great. But at a coffee shop where people would look weirdly at someone in full cosplay bc they’re out of context, it just reminds me that if I present outside accepted norms for my AGAB people are going to look at me that weird way as if I’m in a silly costume.
As a fan of cryptids, I personally disagree, but I 100% get where you are coming from. If a cis person made this design, it would definitely be kinda uncomfy
Oh well thank the gods we’ve been “allowed” to shit
The problem with this joke, is it treads the line between ‘laughing with’ and ‘laughing at,’ mostly because it’s unclear who’s making the joke. And cis people reading the sign and laughing at it turns it into cis people laughing at the concept of other genders as absurd myths.
“Divergent opinion detected”? Nah people just think what you said was shit. When people downvote you that doesn’t mean you’re some sort of edgy rebel going against the system, it usually just means people think you’re being an ass.

There’s also a difference between when enbies use xenogenders or joke about being eldritch creatures, and when cis people eqate being nonbinary to fictional creatures like bigfoot. This is just the attack helicopter joke rebranded.
Imagine victim blaming people for being reasonably upset at something. Grow up.
I definitely understand that. In my own opinion, it's just too much like the transphobic ""I identify as ___"" jokes.
Hi there, non binary person who you could say identifies with the cryptid/alien enby culture here. This sign is just an “attack helicopter” joke.
though it’s not a dnd shop, it has the vibes of one. this sign is definitely not out of place. immediately in the entrance is a werewolf halloween decoration that is there 24/7, they have an arcade machine in the middle of the common area with at least one alien themed game, and are always playing some slightly geeky show on a projector near the back of the common room, yesterday they were playing the batman cartoon.
Not really. It’s equating nonbinary people to imaginary things like bigfoot. It’s basically the attack helicopter joke all over again
*horrified expression*
I mean some people identify with mythical or eldritch creatures or the void and that's completely valid and I understand it's a common theme enough to be a meme some of the time, but when someone is complaining about ""non-binary"" as a whole being equated to non humans, it's clear that no it's not something that applies to all of us and you shouldn't repeat the same thing they said they hate. I'm very much a ""just a person"" type of non-binary and it's exhausting when random people (including other non-binary people) think I'm cool with dehumanization because of stereotypes
I was gonna say the same 😂
Ayyy!
True! Zero need to gender a single stall bathroom. 
Also, I personally like the aesthetic, but I completely understand if you don’t. Everyone has their own aesthetic and that’s part of the reason why I love the nonbinary community so much, because everyone is so different, yet accepting.
honestly, if you came into this coffee shop in full cosplay, people would probably just compliment it if anything. it’s very vibey

Oh do you personally know the person who made this sign? Please tell me about their history of hateful background. Please site your sources if you’re going to insist something as fact rather than single sided speculation. Also where is this helicopter you speak of in the above image?
Bigfoot is real
Yeah I get that, I was just trying to make a quick funny ha-ha. If I said something that was dehumanizing in anyway though I apologize
Tbh As Someone Who (Kinda) *Does* Identify With Myhtical Creatures I Don't Like This, Like I Can Say I'm An Eldritch Horror Or Somethin', An' Am Cool With My Friends Doing It, But Don't Want Some Random I Ain't Never Met Doin' It, That Just Feels Weird And Assumptive.
I may or may not describe my gender to my friends like this...
Well The Main Problem I Have With It Isn't Any Particular Aesthetic, But Rather That The Bigfoot And Alien Are Depicted In A Completely Different Style From The 3 People, It Just Makes Them Look Out Of Place. (If You Can Find My Other Comment, I Gave Like 2 More Words Of Detail About That Lol.)
Maybe you’re right. I hope so. And I hope a non-binary person was at least consulted before designing this sign. 

But also nobody is campaigning in force against these signs, and most aren’t getting aggressively offended or anything. But when they’re posted in a sub like this the overwhelming response is ‘yeah I don’t prefer it.’ Maybe that should be a clue that there’s probably a better way of de-gendering bathrooms.
Exactly! Beautifully put.
Did you not read what I said? I specifically wrote “usually” because there are fucked up communities like that.

And no I’m not fucking intolerant of you enjoying a joke because I and most other people here find it dehumanizing. That’s not what intolerance is. You’re being an asshole here and that’s why you’re getting downvoted, again.

Also nice touch with the “are you insane?” totally not an over reaction or ableist on your part.

Edit: Oh, no wonder you responded the way you did. Hardly surprised you’re a truscum.
Oh, you’re right. I should have said “intentionally or unintentionally.”
Are you being sarcastic or serious? I’m very bad at sarcasm irl, not to mention online.
Off topic question, but why are the first letters of every word in caps?
I just say I'm a whatever.
Absolutely, the consensus in this comment section does seem to be that while it's not wildly offensive, most people aren't super comfortable with it.  That should definitely be taken into account!  

I guess all I'm trying to express is that I think we have to be happy with any attempts at inclusion we're getting.  Honestly, I *am* happy about every attempt, no matter how poorly executed or poorly intentioned it is.  Progress is slow, but it's being made.  I feel like all we can do is appreciate every little bit of progress and inclusion as we wait for change to take its time, as it does.

In my ideal world, the norm is to have a single gender-neutral bathroom setup, in which each stall has actual ceiling to floor walls & an actual door.  Y'know, *privacy*.  My ideal world is a long ways away.  What I want in the meantime is for people to understand that I'm going to pick one of those binary-gendered restrooms, I'm going to pee in it, and everyone will leave me alone about it and not make it weird.
What’s your authority on the subject? How does it pertain to you?
Check his profile. Probably a sockpuppet account just to write dumb stuff against the ""libs"".
[removed]
Good Question. I'll Be Sure To Let You Know If I Figure It Out.
I agree about how bathrooms should be designed. I want privacy from others regardless of their gender, lol. 

But also I’m not going to just ‘be happy with whatever I get,’ especially if they’re not well intentioned. Begrudging and half-assed inclusion isn’t inclusion, and if we act happy with it that’s all we’ll ever get. Raising the bar and holding people accountable when they’re off-base is the real road to inclusion. If I get labeled as nit-picky and sensitive that’s not on me.
What’s yours? You make broad interpretive statements about the sign maker’s intent in your comment as well. However, people seem to disagree with you. As do I.
I checked too. Definitely a disingenuous account
Okay then…

happy little goblin		"I've been able to settle into my identity more recently and I feel really comfortable. I'm a femme they/them that identifies a lot with being a fem boy, or a more androgynous, boyish person.
I used to be really stressed about my identity because i don't identify as a woman, but i only liked feminine fashion and it gave me a lot of impostor syndrome. 
now I'm able to be happy with my face and my body and i know that the way i dress doesn't change who i am or make me less of an enbie.
lots of love 💙
Its so awesome that you're comfortable and happy with yourself!! ❤️❤️❤️ Btw I LOVE your look! Hair, makeup and cute stars are all on point!! 😊❤️

“Happy 1st Non-binary Birthday!” Cake I made for my spouse 🖤💜🤍💛		"Spouse here, can confirm that it is delicious and that I love it
That’s so sweet! I made a similar cake for my girlfriend last year, except transgender flag colors. She loved it so much she still talks about it. I bet your spouse will too!
Made me tear up a little bit. The support, the care, the beauty of a healthy relationship! They're lucky to have you! Also that is a beautiful cake. I am sure it was very tasty as well.
I wasn't expecting the inner layers. Very nice execution, looks deliciously moist.
How did it taste
🖤💜🤍💛
Beautiful! I hope it was tasty and you had a wonderful day together! 💜
This makes me happy :).
That is SO CUTEEEE

Oh my goodness thank you so much that means a lot 😭
Really good! Homemade vanilla cake and homemade vanilla buttercream babyee!
Delicious
Happy cake day!
You're so welcome. I am sure I speak for several folks out there who haven't had such supportive partners. Things like this mean the world and make being non-binary so much easier. You rock!

I (22) came out to my boyfriend (24) as afab non-binary and he was fine with dating me until I told him I want to get a chest binder. (I also have no idea what flair to put for this post)	"First off, we’ve been together for a month. 

And I’ve explained to him that me having a female chest is causing major gender dysphoria and his response was “if you turn into a guy then that’s a deal breaker.” My bf obviously likes my chest while I hate it. EDIT to add: he also said “no don’t do that. I like your chest.” 

I may delete this post because I know the answer is obvious. I should break up with him if he doesn’t accept me. I’ve given him the weekend to process everything since I’ll be out of town. 

I just need advice.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the advice. I just need to find a way to break up with him nicely. I’m sure I’ll find another partner eventually that accepts the real me.

EDIT 2: I was straightforward about why I broke up with him and he hasn’t responded. Which I expected. Even though I’m upset that I’m not in a relationship, I’m also happy because it wasn’t a good relationship in the first place. Again, thank you all for the help ❤️"	"Yeah, in your situation there isn't much else to do I believe. The guy is into women, and you are not a woman after some reflection, so it's understandable that it wouldn't fit together. Try and break up as amicably as you can -- you can probably stay friends. If that's any reassurance I'm certain you'll find another partner later who will take you as you are. I wish you well and I hope this goes as well as possible.
you're right on the money babe. find someone who likes you for *you* not the made up version of you they have in their head. if he's only ""fine with it"" if he can pretend you're cis, he's not actually fine with it at all (and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)
The deal breaker comment alone would be enough to dump him for me. I get that people have their preferences,  but ""turn into a guy"" is a poor choice of words.
You absolutely can find folks who don’t just “tolerate” you and who don’t put themselves between you and what you want to do with your gender expression.

As for breaking up gently, I’m sure you’ve got this. Advice abounds, but just be clear about how you’re not willing to put him before your needs. This isn’t happening because you’re interested in binding or because you’re not a woman, it’s because you two don’t mesh and your boundaries are clashing.
you are who you are and you can't/shouldn't have to change it for a partner, but he's straight and into women, that's also nothing he can or should change. 

this is a situation where neither of you are right/wrong or anything, you just don't seem to be a good fit as a couple.
i’m sorry this happened to you. but i’m glad you’re taking care of yourself and ending it. in terms of doing it nicely, i would say just be straightforward and honest. “i like you, but i need to do what is best for me. if this is a dealbreaker for you, then i’m sorry, but this relationship isn’t right for me.” it sounds like he also doesn’t respect your terms/pronouns, if he insists on calling you his gf, so if you do want to maintain a friendship you might want to have a serious conversation about that. even if he doesn’t fully understand your gender identity, he needs to respect you. i also hope you can start binding to help with your dysphoria! i struggle with the same, binding helps a lot. ❤️
There's a lot of great responses here, but there's a couple of things I wanted to touch on and emphasize as someone who has been in a similar situation. You sound like you have things really figured out on your end, but in case anyone else needs this:

There's two things at play here:

1 - your boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

2 - his boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

The way I see it, people in relationships (regardless of romantic or not) negotiate these boundaries and preferences through communication, particularly ""I"" statements. We can't control what the other person does or wants, but we can state what we need to continue this voluntary relationship, and leave if these aren't met.

You did this - you trusted him with important, relevant information about who you are and how he can best respect you (terms like ""partner"" for instance).

What he did, from an outsider's perspective, is respond - not with ""I"" statements that communicated his boundaries in a respectful way - but with ""you"" statements and ultimatums, while ignoring your needs. IMHO, relationships shouldn't come down to ""do this or I'll leave."" It's much more like, ""This is what I need, and I'll be adult enough to communicate to you if this will no longer work for me.""

The difference is this:

""If you express your gender in this way, that's a deal-breaker.""

VS

""I like you a lot, but I only see myself in romantic relationships with people whose gender identity and expression matches that of a feminine woman. I am sorry that our needs and preferences no longer match up.""

Your gender identity, your expression, isn't the problem and should never be made to seem that way by a partner. The issue is that your have different wants and needs that no longer line up.

All of this is to say -- I'm sorry that you had to try to read the tea leaves of his thoughts and preferences and make this decision for him (though of course it's for you as well). This breakup should've probably come from him, with him communicating what he needed in response to your own communication, not him blasting past your needs, disrespecting your identity, to try to keep the relationship the same.

Anywho, that's my 2 cents as an internet stranger.
Dump his ass
You’re not transitioning to male just from wearing a chest binder lol wtf? Lots of nonbinary people wear binders without being full on FTM. 

I wear a binder during the day, and I enjoy my partner playing with my chest during sex (it feels good to me!) It’s a win-win arrangement for us. I think your bf is being unreasonable. I could see him drawing a line with top surgery, that seems reasonable, but a binder is literally just clothing.
I agree. Being with someone who doesn't accept the true you is worse then being alone. Just be safe and be honest, that's the best way to do it. Good luck 😌
I’m so very glad you broke up with this person (friendly internet hugs or high five) I was about to comment how it’s a serious red flag and he has a stipulation on who you are or are not “allowed” to be- but then re-read the edits :) I’m so so glad you found that out a month in and didn’t waste anymore time.

Especially where chests are involved. I like plastic surgery/conformation surgeries specifically and hate when people mod their chests due to what someone else likes or dislikes. Like you have to live with it and all the pros/cons it comes with
He was fine with your gender as long as je could ignore it. He wasn't fine with dating you, he was fine with imagining you were a cis woman then ignoring who you were entirely and using corrective measures to get you to conform to his vision. You aren't woman-lite. Glad you stood up for yourself and dropped him
Get rid! My partner met me when I identified as a trans man. I wasn’t transitioning any time soon and so was really distrustful of him even being with me (he was previously only with girls). 

He has stayed with me the whole time, only ever respected me, used he/him pronouns without question behind my back and to my face, and always called me boyfriend or partner on my request. I now realise I’m non-binary and he’s adjusted everything accordingly. The right partner is out there for you. 

You can’t really blame your partner for being straight - I can understand where he’s coming from. He didn’t sign up for you to not be a cis woman really. But then he isn’t the best person for you. Glad to read your update and I wish you all the best in the future! The right person for you is out there! Xx
Hi, I'm also afab nonbinary, just wanting to share my experiences with this. 

Due to my transphobic and homophobic fathers side of the family, I was very fearful of my identity and never tried to figure myself out. So I've always been nonbinary, but after a huge wave of dysphoria a few months ago I actually identified as enby and came out to one person, my boyfriend. 

He and I were together for 3 years before this, but it was still nerve wracking especially because he swore he was straight. I was scared shitless coming out to him, but after I did he accepted me. I told him I'm comfortable with any pronouns but mostly they/them. I cut my hair ""boy short"" and have been experimenting with it ever since. He refers to me in whichever ways I feel most comfortable and will say different terms for me that make me happy. He's since said that he's pan (but really is only attracted to me) and has made a lot of validating and progressive comments. 

So, I promise you there is (yes, even men) that will accept you and love you for who you are. I also want to start binding even though my chest is already ""small,"" and I just want you to know I understand. You are loved and you will continue to be loved more than ever. Best of luck, friend!
Just commenting to let you know that there are guys out there who will love you for you. I’m 23 afab non-binary and I came out to my cishet boyfriend about 6 months ago and he has been nothing but supportive. He uses my pronouns correctly and corrects other people (and myself even) when they use the wrong pronouns. He’s helped me find more masc clothing and given me advice on what mens-style clothing looks best on me. I can tell that he still really loves me deeply and supports me and my gender identity. So there is hope out there! You will find someone so stay positive!
Yeah, I think you made the right choice. He didn't love you, he loved your chest
Hi pal. I am afab non binary and married to a woman. My wife has always identified as gay and is not attracted to men in any way shape or form. I have always had severe gender dysphoria surrounding my chest as well. My wife is actually the person who first started talking to me about being non binary. I had no idea what it was until then. She suggested top surgery to me. I never thought about that before either. Due to finances, I can’t get top surgery very soon so she ordered me a chest binder. I’ve asked my wife how she feels about me being non binary and not being feminine at all, and she always says that I’m her person. She doesn’t care what gender I am. My point to you is, you WILL find your person too. Get the chest binder, you will not regret it.
If He's going to get upset about a binder he's clearly got more problems going on.
I broke up with my bf not long ago, but he was a huge boobs guy. I hate my chest, and I got a breast reduction a few years ago. Before I told him about the reduction, he always said that he liked me for who I was. BUT after he found out that I had a reduction, he couldn't let it go. He was obsessed, saying that if we have been together he would have tried to talk me out of it. He would fantasize over my old pictures, and make me feel terrible about myself even though I'm much more happy now. 
I honestly don't believe it's worth it. I gave him a chance, and I told him how much it hurt my feelings when he would say hurtful things like this. But eventually it got to be too much
Much love OP ❤️
Glad to read you put him in the bin where he belongs!!
if they don’t accept you for who you are and how you want to present yourself, then they’re not worth your time. you did the right thing, i wish u good luck on your journey👾
I get it. I (35 AFAB) am dating a man. Luckily he has no idea what being Agender means. But there are other issues to the relationship.    

I plan to leave and go on my own when I can. I have to save up first.
So I want to be clear about something.  While your Ex-BF may have not been nice about it, neither of you are wrong.  He doesn't have to be in a relationship with you if you're not what he likes/wants either physically or mentally.  AT the same time, you have a right to find someone who will love and respect you for who you are.  It was best that you ended things with him.
You're going to find someone who loves and celebrates you in all your enby glory! I'm glad you made room for it.

💛🤍🖤💜
OP people should love their partner no matter how they look. Think of it like this; he wouldn’t like you if you had to get them removed because of a medical reason. Even if that reason was your own peace of mind. He can’t even comprehend you doing the nonperminent solution, so that tells you how things would play out in the future if that is something you want.
Awww! I’m really impressed with you! You identified something that was not ok with you, identified when he said something that was essentially a red flag for controlling your identity, and then you found a way to exit that felt ok for you. I feel like I sucked at making any of those statements because I didn’t want to summarize anything in a way that didn’t feel authentic, but I also want to honor what you did because it’s really hard.

You deserve to be in relationships where your identity is cherished and supported. I would be incredibly sad if I broke up with someone and they didn’t respond too. It’s so hard to move forward with our that closure. 

❤️❤️❤️
A girlfriend I dated had a preference when it came to my hair. She liked that it was long and even though it was sometimes uncomfortable and i thought short hair looked better on me I liked it because she liked it. I cared more about what she liked on me then what I liked on me. I say “what I liked” but because she liked it I didn’t dislike it 🤔.. yuh know. If you care more about what you want different about yourself than what your boyfriend likes about you as you are then that’s cool but is that really the case. Obviously hair is much different so how about this. I’d love to have a vagina (this isn’t hypothetical) but if my girlfriend loves my penis I love the fact and even feel fortunate that I have one. I would think ugh what if I had a vagina then I’d want a penis because I’d know my girlfriend wants that more. Or if your girlfriend thinks you’re an ass wouldn’t you want to not be an ass or would you just be selfish and think “I’m just an asshole this is who I am”. Idk just something to think about 🤷‍♂️ wouldn’t you want to be what your boyfriend wants? Obviously to a certain extent. Like if if he want to be a druggy (hard drugs) and wants you to be one with him then of course but your chest?? I don’t really get what the big deal is and you broke up over it??
P.S. idk maybe I think this way because I’m a very submissive person.
May I commit physical violence?
Hey, I know you already solved the issue but I just want to say as a fellow afab non binary person that I am so proud of you for putting yourself first. Our identify is more important than any partner. You rock.
it’s been a month, break up with him
I think it is really harsh that just because you might wear a binder he would not date you anymore lol. Definitely not one to keep imo, you are not your chest and deserve someone who will like you no matter your chest ey.
All the best, and best wishes going forward.
Really happy to hear you felt safe/comfortable with getting out of a relationship that wasn't working out for you. You put your own happiness and wellbeing first, and that's something to be proud of.
i had a similar situation happen where my friends were dating the male didnt want his significant other to get top surgery. i would say break up with him. sometimes, as accepting as men may seem they may put that and simply use people to get what they want.
I had a similar situation a few months ago where my gf took an interest in a female coworker after I expressed that I was non-binary. She denied everything for months, until we were drunk one night and she said she’d just started identifying as lesbian and didn’t know where I fit into that. Just take your time with yourself and enjoy openly expressing yourself and exploring what makes you happy!
That sucks, but you did the right thing. Better a month wasted on the unworthy than years.
was going to comment then i saw your edits. you did the right thing, i’m around the same age & if someone won’t love you for who you are you don’t need them. i’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself!!
Imo if he presents you with the ultimatum of ""if you become a guy it's a deal breaker"" then he ain't it chief. I get it not everyone's on the spectrum but kinda shitty to be like ""you can't be who you want to be""
break up with him. y’all only been dating a month, not worth it.
I know this has already been dealt with my but I wanted to reinforce that the break up was smart! This exact same thing happened to me when I figured out I was some form of non-binary and started exploring my gender in high school. My at the time boyfriend (now ex) said he supported me but that he couldn’t date me if I ended up being a boy and that he didn’t like when I dressed masculine or even mentioned my dysphoria with my body. Well that ended up being one of the many red flags that I should’ve seen in the early relationship because he became abusive within 3 months of dating and I got stuck with him for a year and 5 months
Best of luck for you to find a better and accepting partner!
Yo this shit why it would take a miracle for me to date a cishet
First, ew. You did the right thing. It’s sad that he said what he did but telling someone that they like them for a part of them that they openly say causes discomfort is just freaking disgusting.

I hope you find people to surround you and affirm your identity. You deserve to present the way you want to, screw presenting to others. You had to do that crap for 16-18 years, you earned the right to be you.
I think breaking up with him was the right choice, but unless you were already digital/ldr then breaking up over message is pretty lame.
I'm glad you broke up with him! Even though he is straight I still think the way he responded wasn't right - you have a right to your own bodily autonomy even if it's something that he personally would rather you do different. I'm straight too and I like boobs more than anyone I've met but if my girlfriend wanted to wear a binder, I wouldn't stop her. It's her choice what to do with her body, just like it's your choice what you do with yours.
my spouse came out as non-binary before i did. i can’t imagine not being supportive of anything they feel, or them not being supportive of anything i feel. if this is causing a problem now, then he’s probably not going to change. find someone who loves you for you, no matter who you are or what you look like.
You've already made the right choice so I'll just say that you cannot hold it against yourself if they don't take it well. Block them if you need to, if it's best for you.
Congrats on the first step of moving on to discover someone who loves you more than the sum of your parts. I wish you all the best, because you deserve someone who can compromise and make concessions for your mental health and wellbeing. You deserve to be reassured and supported, and he wasn't doing that for you. I'm sorry.
Congratulations, and I’m sorry you had to go through that
im so proud of you for making the right decision!! take a biig hug from me (if you want one :3)
Even though the answer is obvious you just got to vent and have people behind your back agreeing with you and makes the situation so much better.
I’m so proud of you for putting your well-being first and not giving in to your ex’s pressure. You will find someone who loves and supports you completely, I guarantee it!!
Oh no after reading this and some of the comments I  just realized I might be in this exact situation right now
good for you for doing that, i know it will have been hard if you cared about him but you’ll be happier when you find someone who loves you the way you are :))
I’ve tried to date straight boys before, it’s not worth it
I can see I'm too late to change your mind and I'm probably going to be the only person with this opinion, but I think you should give your boyfriend some time before going for the nuclear option. I mean, a 1 month relationship isn't that big of a loss (in the scheme of things at least), but coming out as NB is a lot for a romantic partner to process and it's something you may have to do again in the future. When I came out to my wife, she found many different ways to express how repulsed she was by the idea of me being feminine. At one point, I remember complimenting her on a dress and her response was to put on this disgusted look and say, ""did you want to borrow it or something?"" That was about a year ago and, even though she still struggles with my gender identity, she becomes more accepting every day. Yesterday, she freely offered to go out with me in support when I told her I was nervous about wearing a dress to a concert I'm going to. It sounds like this guy may not have been *the one*, but one of these days, you might have someone really great that just needs some time.
You... broke up by text..?
Kinda arrived after the war, but just wanted to say congrats for breaking up. I'm very sorry it had to happen, truly, but I'm impressed you stood for yourself. I really hope it gets better for you!
Thanks. And I will. I’ll figure out a way to break up with him.
Yeah, I’ve thought about that too. Plus he refers  to me as “his girlfriend” and not “partner” like I want him to. And I agree with what you said, I (as many other enby’s) do deserve to have our gender celebrated and not tolerated. I just need to figure out a way to break up with him nicely.
It's not wrong for him to want to be with a woman, because that might just be what his orientation is. But pretending that the OP was a woman after they came out as NB is where he went wrong. If he wasn't okay with a partner who wasn't a woman, then he should have been up front with the OP and said that he didn't swing that way, rather than what he actually did.
>you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

I like this
>(and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

Quote of the century right there.
These are the correct words.
I’ve found people who celebrate my sexuality but tolerate my gender, and people who tolerate my sexuality but celebrate my gender. You’re 100% right, and I hope someday I’ll find (or maybe have found!!!!) the one who does both.
It was for me too. And I know. While I prefer being mistaken as a guy I don’t want to fully transition into a guy. If that makes sense.
I know. 

And I did. I was straightforward about why I broke up with him but in a nice way.
It’s okay and I’m glad I’ve ended it. And thanks! I’m planning on ordering a chest binder this weekend but I’m not sure where to get one from. I’ve heard that GC2B are good ones.
I 100% agree with what you’re saying. It should’ve come from him but he continually misgendered me when I told him multiple times I didn’t like the term “girlfriend” and he wasn’t going to change then I decided enough was enough.
I did
I know. But I eventually want to get top surgery because I want a flat chest.
Thanks :)
Me too! (internet high five) 

And I eventually want to get top surgery but I’m going to wait till I’m financially stable and living on my own since I still live with my parents at the moment.
I’m glad I got rid of him and that’s so cool! I’m happy for you :) and I know.
Hey. And ah, I’m glad everything worked out for you! 

And I know I’ll find someone eventually. I’m also pan so I don’t really care who I date/marry. It just my ex refused to use the pronouns I wanted and stuff. And yeah. I know I’ll find someone eventually
Oh he definitely loved my chest and not me. His other response to me chest binding was “No don’t do that. I like your chest.” And that’s when I knew I needed to break up with him.
For sure. I’m glad I broke up with him.
I wish you luck and hope for you to be free ans independent soon!
I agree. And I eventually want to get them removed once I have enough money to do so.
Lol sure. I actually thought about that too 😂
I’m going to
I know lol
Thanks
I know. When he said that I decided I was going to break up with him. Which I did and I’m so happy I’m not with him anymore.
Yeah for sure. I also should’ve included this in my original text but he also said “No don’t do that. I like your boobs.” So that’s when I knew he liked my chest more than me. 

And I am. Thankfully my dad and siblings and friends accept me for who I am.
I know breaking up thru text is pretty lame. But our relationship was digital.
I’m glad too and yeah that makes sense. Like I get that he likes boobs, heck I’m pansexual, and I like boobs too but just not my own 😂  but the fact that he knew it caused me gender dysphoria and didn’t care was a red flag.
I know. And i did block him.
Thanks and it’s okay. At least I realized it a month and not any time later
Thanks! And I’ll take the hug :)
Oh no! Hope everything turns out alright for you
Yeah.
I don’t think I went for the nuclear option. I came out to him as non-binary before and he was okay with dating me UNTIL I said I’m getting a chest binder. That was the dealbreaker since he didn’t respect my decision and he liked my breasts more than me. So I broke up with him.
Yeah
If you're thinking of breaking up, just straight up tell him something like ""I think we're not compatible anymore, we have different values/views and continuing like this will not benefit either of us."" Preferably *in a public setting* to make sure you're safe. Don't get into a whole ""You hurt my feelings"" thing, it's very tempting but the mature way is the truth, and (based on his comments) the truth is that you guys just aren't compatible. You don't owe him or anyone else an explanation for why you're choosing yourself over a relationship that might not be serving you anymore.

Alternatively, (again in a public setting lol) you could try explaining more about Nonbinary people/the community/casually bring up any Nonbinary role models you have, watch Anthony Padilla's vid on NB people together lol, ect. If this is his first time hearing about all of this he probably has a lot to think about and needs both the information from you and time to himself to think about your relationship. Maybe it's not over, maybe you just need time, patience, and be willing to work together to figure this out as a team (NOT settle!). Again as long as you make sure you're safe, this is an option too.
Even if I’m with a cis person or a binary trans person I still hate the words “girlfriend” and “Boyfriend” partner is jsut the superior term ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
honestly he should know what's coming. you could start calling him your girlfriend until he gets tired of it :3 (this is a bad idea do not do this)
I was in your place a few years ago and I made the wrong choice (stayed with the asshole) out of fear that I couldn't get any better than someone tolerating my transness. Wasted 3 of the best years of my life with someone who treated me poorly.

Anyways, like 3 months after we broke up I met the person of my dreams and every day with him feels like a fairytale, he loves me and is proud to introduce me to his friends and family as his partner, and supports and respects my decisions and bodily autonomy. Been together over a year and a half now, planning on getting a place together in the next few months, depending.

What I'm trying to say is, your person is out there! Life is too short to waste on people that don't appreciate all of you. Don't settle for anything less than exactly what you want in a partner!
I had been with a supposedly young enby and they called me their ""girlfriend"" and it was upsetting. I have learned from dating or knowing many closeted and  not fully open sexual minorities since I have been out that you will only feel bad hiding who you are and as my therapist has said, some relationships do not survive a transition but that is true.
It does :) because you’re non binary. I’m the exact same in that respect. Means we don’t adhere to the binary- which male is. People can be so silly :/
Makes sense to me, I feel that honestly
gc2b binders are very good! i got my first binder from there, but unfortunately i have problems with my shoulders which makes it hard to get on/off, so i can't wear it anymore
My fiance has a couple. The black one fits better than the nude one they got even though they're the same size? It's odd. Just don't be afraid to go up or down a size if the first one isnt just right!
Hell yeah!
Had to comb the comments for this!! I literally cheered ❤️
Yeah. In that case sounds like y’all ultimately won’t be compatible
Aw that’s wonderful! Yeah it’s definitely really expensive. When you’re living on your own too, insurance might cover some of it? Something to look into. I’m so excited for you!!!
Thank you!
Alright! I’ll get me mallet!
Hence why I prefaced it with that lol, I understand in that case. It can’t be helped. You did what was necessary ❤️
Yeah maybe I just understand what it is like because I'm trans lol. I wouldn't want to cause someone that discomfort even if I liked that part of their body before.

I was actually kinda excited to grow boobs at first because that meant I would have a pair of boobs I could play with 24/7 (I was obsessed with boobs even back then) but when it happened I was like ""what the fuck is this"" because they actually caused me great dysphoria lmao.
\*hugg*
Well he broke up with me now so I guess it did turn right
That's... a very last resort thing to do
I agree. I prefer the term “partner” it’s nice to say lol.
I prefer the term joyfriend to partner. Partner is for marriage.
Ok but....lovefriend? Absolutely a lovely term to get called too, just feels SO good lmao~
Lol I thought about doing that. But I didn’t. I blocked him after he responded with “ok have a good life”
Similar boat, I settled for someone because I thought they were the best I could find as a non-binary person. They were asexual, I am not; I wasted almost 1.5 years.

Over 1.5 years later I’ve just found another enby who seems super promising. I really hope this ends up going well!!!
Cool :) and yeah, I know. Heck, my mom is convinced I’m trans when I’ve told her multiple times I’m not :/ my dad and siblings on the other hand are fine with me being non-binary.
Im planning on getting one from there. I need to email the GC2B support people to figure out my size. Since my chest size is bigger than my shoulder width I’m not sure which size to get.
Ah cool, that’s good to know. I’m also going to get the tank binder instead of the half binder, seems like it’ll fit better. And I may get two of two different sizes and see which one fits better.
Yep :) I’m happy and I’m going to order a chest binder this weekend :D
Yeah, hopefully my insurance will cover some of it. And yeah, I’m really looking forward to it :)
Lol I know :) and yeah. Hopefully I’ll find someone better in the future :)
*hugg* thanks :)
They were together a month. Hardly enough to warrant a large break up discussion. Text is very reasonable in this situation.
I'm personally fond of ""datemate""
My husband is absolutely wonderful about gender-neutral terms for me but I think I should have nipped ""snoogywoogums"" in the bud...
Awe that’s such a sweet name 🥺
Spouse is for marriage. I call my boyfriend my partner because we’re past boyfriend/girlfriend/joyfriend, we’ve been living together for years, but we’re not married yet.
Mmmm that’s quite dapper as well
You didnt have to block him.. he was gone. That's what have a good life means.
It’s such a weird thing- that when people learn one definition, they like stick to that a lot of the time, even if it doesn’t fit. It’s such an odd thing to me. Like partially trying to learn and be supportive but half not… 

It’s up to the individual. Like us. Me, I’m non binary and trans. You, you’re afab and non-binary :) both are equally valid. I’m very glad your dad and siblings are on board though, hopefully your mum will be soon too. Don’t see the point in insisting you’re something you’re not
yeah, i had that issue too. i'm fairly sure they recommend going with the larger size, but definitely email them to confirm!
I just want to reassure you they are the friendly staff ever. 

I had a problem thats taken weeks to solve (not their fault, my binder got lost in the Mexican mailing system) and they have offered me the best solutions and with great follow up.

10/10 for gc2b and my binder hasnt even arrived lol
Yeah they have tank ones. Not sure if they're made slightly differently or?
I’m happy for you. I wish you the best
I am so happy for you!!! Good for you for knowing what works and what does not! <3 I also love datemate as a term as someone said. Partner is good IMO bc it is gender neutral but then also I am like yes I am not straight haha.
I respectfully disagree. It leads to exactly this situation, where you aren't sure if they've read your message yet. Text is also a very bad medium for emotional stuff in general. It's cold. It wouldn't be an option to me personally even if we'd been together a week
Datemate is pretty cool! I'm a big fan of ""joyfriend"" personally
My name is Stevonnie.
I meant for me partner seems more serious than joyfriend or datefriend.
I mean he blocked me after he sent that so I did it back lol
So why does it matter?
Yeah I agree. 

And yeah, I know. And like I also want to do low-dose testosterone HRT to look more masculine. Plus It’s such a weird thing to explain to my mom lol.
I'm AMAB Nonbinary and I'm bisexual and polyamorous.
Ah. And yeah, I was planning on getting a size bigger but wanted to confirm with them first.
That’s cool! I emailed them a couple hours ago for advice on what size binder I should get. Should hear a response soon :)
Thank you!
Thanks! And haha yeah datemate is pretty cool too
ooooh I am liking both datemate and joyfriend! I personally ask my partners to call me ""babefriend"" lol
Oh I meant joyfriend, but hi Stevonnie~ I’m willow
Oh yeah, that’s fair!
40% of people like boobs and 40% like twinkies. Why would anyone be mad at anyone for this? Do you like one or the other? Some people like both. That's ok too. But why are you mad at this fella?
Aw that’s awesome!
oh yeah absolutely. good luck and i hope you enjoy your binder when it comes!
That's great! I'm sure they'll help :)
Hoi, Willow!
Partner is for when you're living together but you're not married yet. Two of my coworkers are gay men. Both are very outgoing and energetic guys. One is slightly more feminine than the other one.
Thanks! Whenever it arrives I’ll definitely post a pic here :)
Yeah :) I’ve been wanting to order a chest binder for a while and I’m super excited to finally order one
Hoi~"	p3nopt	NonBinary	1377	0.99	2021-08-13 15:48:33
My first binder!!! It'll take some getting used to, not used to this tightness, but I'm really happy with how I look in it :')		"Aye congrats ! also you have such a wonderful smile :')
Luckyyy! I have a couple but they do, like n o t h i n g for me-

You look great, bro, the tightness will ease up as you wear it more often. In the beginning, make sure not to wear it more than six hours a day, but after you break it in, then you can wear it for about 8 hours before it starts to be hazardous!
the way you look so happy with it on 🥺seeing euphoric trans people makes me euphoric
Love that for you
Look how happy you are!!
<3   
Love it, You look happy and that makes me happy. I hope you can keep this happiness going the rest of your life
You look amazing, my friend! I hope you can grow to enjoy wearing it! Lol
Side note, where did you get that tank top?
Looking awesome!
I love the happiness I can see on ur face 😁😁
Love the smile!!! Congrats!
The difference is extraordinary! 

_Remember not to exercise heavily or swim with it on, and remember to only wear it for a few hours at a time. Do not sleep in it!!! Avoid extreme temperatures and remove it if you experience any rib/chest pain or difficulty breathing._ :)
Congratulations!
You look great! I’m so happy for you!! 💜
You look amazing!
Looks good on you,
And please if you don't want those bumps give them to me 😟
You look fantastic! And also so happy! It's a great look for you ^^
the amount of serotonin i got from seeing ur smile>>>>>
/p
Hell yeah looking good dude !!
I am so happy for you<3
You look amazing! Not post related but I love your hair!
Aww! I remember the euphoria of my first binder! :) Congrats!
You look amazing! And so happy too
Yay! What a difference ☺️
My first binder was second hand, so it wasn't too tight when I got it and was easier to get used to. It will start to feel normal after a couple of weeks 🥰
I want a binder so badly but my bf wont like it.. but id look cool tho
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
you look happy and it makes me happier
Congrats!! You’re beaming!! Honestly the tightness factor is the biggest reason I have yet to get one. As a gender fluid person, some days I truly love that I have boobs. Most days, they get in the way. But I HATE wearing bras because I find them too constricting. So I go braless. But having perky nipples means I get a lot of unwanted attention. Ugh so tough!
Hell yes!  Keep smiling :)
Hecc yeah.
Your infectious smile practically *screams* gender euphoria. I'm really happy for you dude.
do binders hurt as much as ppl say  they do, im non binary and amab
Something I found that helped me get used to it faster: take it off as SOON as your chest starts to hurt. My first few days I could only make it to about 4 hrs. Set a timer for 8 hrs after you put it on. Make sure you're periodically stretching your shoulders. I've started carrying an extra sports bra in my backpack to change out of my binder at my university if I need to. Also, one thing that helped me get used to it, if you have the ones with the snaps that you can adjust the tightness, start it on the loosest one until you can make it the full 8 hrs without chest pain for a few days. Then try it tighter.
Aww I’m so happy for you!! You look great! 💜 I can’t wait to one day get one haha, maybe when I have a debit/credit card or move out or something
Your smile is so contagious!!
Also if this is a popular brand like gc2b and you find the tightness too bad for whatever reason there’s amorbinders which is designed by and for neurodivergent folk and take those of us who can’t stand breath restriction.
You look really happy
awe thanks so much!!
Aw I'm sorry about the bad luck with binding! I heard there's trans tape and other binding options out there, you may have other options!

And thanks so much for the info! I'll def try breaking it in a bit wearing for short periods of time starting off :)
Thanks!! and thank you for the award :'o
Thanks, and I hope so!! I'm sure it'll stretch out a bit over time too :)
Label says it's from H&M! I got it long ago so I'm not sure if they still sell something similar. Might be more likely to find in the summer/spring \^^
Thank you!
Came here to say this, glad someone beat me to it 💜
Thank you for the tips! I'll make sure to wear it in short periods to get used to it :)
Thank you! I cut it short for the first time a couple years ago and been cutting it myself since 😊 It's also fun to dye, might dye it again!
Hi friend, if it's safe for you to get a binder I highly recommend it! I'm not in your situation so take my advice with a grain of salt; I believe one should be happy in yourself without outside judgement (as long as it doesn't seriously hurt someone). If your bf is preventing you or saying they wouldn't like you having a binder, they're preventing you from being more yourself and more happy? I'm not the best at giving advice but I hope things go well for you❤️
Thanks!! and I feel ya, I also wish I could not wear a bra (or just not have a chest entirely personally lol) Have you tried sports bras? I found some looser cheaper ones at walmart that are not super compressing, much comfier than regular bras!
For me it's tight but overall generally comfortable; I think it really depends on the person. They're not supposed to hurt though, if they hurt then the binder doesn't fit properly or the person themselves might have sensory issues. I'm still not sure I'll be able to wear this for a long period of time personally, but a lot of people can wear them for a day and be fine.
Thank you for the advice, I will try these tips! :)
Thank you!❤️ I hope you're able to get one!
Thank you for the recommendation, i'll take a look at those!
Thanks haha, I'm always looking for that style of tanks but they're not ""in style"" much anymore. Hard to find 😂😂
Thank you! I love him, hes just not a fan of me being enby
No prob, and I feel ya, I only have 2 of these and wish I could find more in this style😂
I have a really similar one from LL Bean! Probably a little more expensive than H&M but it's definitely high quality
Thanks for the tip!!"	s5rh26	NonBinary	1370	1.0	2022-01-17 01:36:55

Just a quick psa for you peeps		"In support of the english language, but also myself, please use ""neither he nor she"" to refer to me.
Roses are red,  
Violets are blue,  
Singular they  
Predates singular you.

Seriously. Chaucer used singular they in The Canterbury Tales way back in the 1300s, and it was presumably in use for longer that that. Back in those days, ""you"" was actually strictly plural; it was directed at a specific group of people. If you wanted to refer to a single person directly, you'd say ""thou"". Or ""they"", if you were speaking of an individual to someone else.
They are wrong, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains in https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/. Besides the historical usage, use of singular they for non-binary people has become a part of the evolving language. As the article concludes: “Even people who object to singular *they* as a grammatical error use it themselves when they’re not looking, a sure sign that anyone who objects to singular *they* is, if not a fool or an idiot, at least hopelessly out of date.”
When someone says something like that to me, I say something like this and then sit back and wait for the penny to drop…

I know a teacher like that. They never use the correct pronouns and they always say to me, “if I met a person claiming to be non-binary, I’d never be able to use their correct pronouns because they can’t expect me to use ‘they/them’. They would just have to put up with that because they are wrong - ‘they/them’ are not singular pronouns.”
😂 In junior high people called me ""hesh"" from ""he/she"" (because the teachers had objected to their first choice of ""it"") and I knew it was supposed to be bad but couldn't even mind.
such an annoying non-debate
So many teachers are wrong about this. It's fucking pathetic, honestly. It's terribly sad, too, but it's more infuriating than sad. These people shouldn't be teachers. It is forgivable to be grammatically incorrect sometimes, but those who refuse to look into this particular issue and admit fault are bigots who just want a reason to invalidate non-binary people.
Despite the fact that the rules of grammar are presented as if they were as real and rigid as forge-hardened steel, they are merely *conventions*.  For example, one should never end a sentence in a preposition - or so the rule goes.  And yet one can break this rule by saying ""welcome aboard"".  Aboard *what*, though?  That uncertainty is frail logic supporting the rule.  ""Welcome aboard the ship"" removes this uncertainty.  After all, the function of a preposition is to describe the relationship between a noun and some other word or phrase.  And yet this amended sentence still breaks another rule since it lacks a subject.  ""Welcome aboard the ship, Carl"" resolves that difficulty.

But here's the thing:  if Carl is boarding a ship and steward third-class Aspen looks directly at them and jauntily belts out ""welcome aboard!"", Carl isn't going to be confused at all.  The subject and pesky noun that we're supposed to be yoking that to with a preposition are handily handled by context.  If Aspen instead said ""welcome aboard the ship"", it'd feel a little odd.  What the hell else was Carl boarding?  And to tack Carl's name on the end just makes it *weird*.  Supposing that Carl has never met steward third-class Aspen - a fair guess since we have no reason to suspect that Carl is on the crew of a ship large enough to require *multiple tiers* of stewards - Carl is likely to spend at least a few minutes puzzling over how Aspen knew his name.  

Ignoring the oddity of how Aspen knows Carl's name - something that'd likely occupy Carl's mind for at least a few minutes as he makes his way to his room among the thousands of other people boarding the cruise liner - we find that Aspen actually managed to break yet another rule by using more words than were required to get the idea across.    ""Welcome aboard"" conveys the idea with perfect efficiency. 

Using ""he or she"" is a case of spending three words when a single word would do the trick.  The singular form of they is positively *ancient* after all.  What's more, using ""they"" in place of ""he or she"" covers the most common use case of singular they:  when the singular noun-bearer in question is indeterminate.  ""A person boarded a ship and they were warmly greeted by one of its many stewards,"" is a fine example.  But if I rewrite it as ""A person boarded a ship and he or she was warmly greeted by one of its many stewards,"" you'll likely note that it feels *wrong* somehow.  This is likely you stumbling over that oddly complex ""he or she"".  You are likely to do this *even if you don't know about the rule*. 

And that brings us to the wider point.  Singular they, much like plural they, is so common that it is nearly invisible.  There literally isn't a rule that says ""Sara went to the pier where they boarded a ship"" is incorrect.  A great many readers are inclined to argue otherwise.  The reason is simple enough:  Sara is traditionally a feminine name and so we *expect* a feminine pronoun.  *99% of people named Sara* would want you to use a she in that sentence, much like 99% of people named John would prefer that we use he instead.  Most people prefer to use *gendered language*.  Sara being a they isn't against the rules - we've followed all of them to the letter - but it will still tend to sound *wrong* for no other reason than the fact that it is an uncommon use case.

The rules of writing are built from *convention*, usually with the aim of improving clarity.  Convention is just the common-case.  As such it is really no surprise to me that people argue that using they in the singular and specific case breaks a rule because it is *uncommon* - that is to say that it is *unconventional*.  It will sound *wrong* despite being perfectly, precisely correct given that Sara is *agender*.  And so here is the actual important bit:  language exists to communicate ideas, and sometimes that means that you have to use it in *unconventional* ways.
""He or she"" has TWO WHOLE SYLLABLES more than a singular ""they."" I will not stand for this.
Wow, that’s so much more convenient!
In support of the English language I’m going to say that language is fluid and personal and if somebody tells me that I’m supposed to say something a certain way because that’s the way the English language works, as a person with two English degrees I would tell them to fuck off
[deleted]
BA in Linguistics here and can confirm singular they is not new or grammatically incorrect. And even if it was incorrect, that doesn’t mean it always will be. Language has and always will evolve with time. “Correct/incorrect” language is completely arbitrary. The function of language is to convey meaning. If you’re doing that, then you’re using it correctly.
i just found someones wallet on the floor they must have dropped it ill go put it in the lost and found

THEY MUST HAVE DROPPED ITTT 

TTHHHHEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
These stories always take me back to an afternoon when I was in university. I was walking across campus with my linguistics professor when we encountered a group of people savagely beating a prescriptivist. Alarmed, I cried, “Oh my god, we have to help!”. My professor calmly observed the scene for a few moments before concluding, “Nah, six should be enough.”
As an English Lit student… I’m here for all you lot grammatically correcting the incorrect grammar 😂
This is blatantly not true and *so incredibly easy* to disproved it’s ridiculous. But here’s a gem for y’all: thon.

Linked below:
https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/third-person-gender-neutral-pronoun-thon

“Thon is thought to be a contracted form of ""that one,"" and was coined in 1858 by Charles Crozat Converse. An attorney and composer, Converse invented more than words; he submitted a claim in 1863 to Scientific American that he had designed a new sort of mangle (“a machine for ironing laundry by passing it between heated rollers”). Converse is remembered more these days for his linguistic contributions than for his laundering ones.

The initial reason that thon caught on was that one or more of the editors at Funk and Wagnalls took a shine to the word, and around the turn of the 19th and 20th century it was included in their dictionary.

thon. Pronoun of the 3rd person, common gender, meaning “that one, he she, or it”: a neoterism proposed by Charles Crozat Converse, and apparently complying with the neoteristic canons, since it supplies an antecedent blank, obeys a simple and obvious analogy, and is euphonious.
—Funk and Wagnalls, Supplement to A Standard Dictionary of the English Language, 1903

The word remained in various Funk and Wagnalls publications for much of the 20th century, and also saw inclusion in another dictionary, Merriam-Webster’s Second New International Dictionary (1934), although it was defined slightly less fulsomely (“A proposed genderless pronoun of the third person”). The genderless pronoun sense of thon did not last as long in Merriam-Webster’s dictionaries as it had in Funk and Wagnalls, and the entry was dropped for the third edition of our Unabridged dictionary, published in 1961.” Etc. Etc. Read on!

The whole article is great though, and thon was only dropped from lacking common use. So use it!

I would also like to purpose the formal “ser’am” for addressing people. Sir+ma’am but with an “e”?! I know, brilliant. If this already exists, great. I love it. If not, let me found this word this day!

[https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/third-person-gender-neutral-pronoun-thon](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/third-person-gender-neutral-pronoun-thon)
Please refer to me as [https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they). Yes, if you're going to be a dick about not refering to me by they/them, you might as well use the web address of the Merriam-Webster (yes the DICTIONARY) article on why it's not grammatically incorrect to have basic respect towards me as my pronoun and if you use neither I will find you and shove your foot into your mouth.
There are many words that are used in both a singular and plural ways, so it’s not a contradiction. Example: “You are here today because you want to change your life.” The speaker here could be talking to one person, or an entire room full of people (This is also the case in many other languages). 

Plus, “they” to refer to one person has existed even before Shakespears time, and has been continuously used by many famous authors in later eras.
My lit 90 prof back in community college pulled the same thing. Sucks
This is like when I put two Prefered names I want to be called occasionally on my sign in sheet at my eye doctor and they just call me one name that I was experimenting with and use Wong pronouns like aways
People will state their pronouns then say they don’t use pronouns and think they’re stupid. They will literally use they in the next sentence to describe someone they don’t know the gender of.
""Wow, what a perfectly natural sentence, definitely how people talk in real life!""
Jokes aside, thy professor is an illiterate fool.
As an english teacher they should know that when you don't know someone's gender you generally use they in context. Like with babies people will generally say ""they are so cute"" not ""he or she is so cute"" as at that point you would have just picked/guessed a gender instead of going through the trouble of saying ""he or she""
This is so petty and I love it.
Prof needs to learn that in English, the rules are made up and the points don't matter.
i thought this may have been r/facepalm lol what a clusterfuck of a paragraph
i wish people would just use they/them. getting tired of this cis nonsense
Exactly, what is it with people saying he or she instead of just they? (When referring to someone where the gender is not specified) like, just say they, more inclusive and easier to say.
HAHAHA amazing.
This would be a great conversation to have with the provost and if they are busy perhaps a lawyer, and maybe phrase it as such.
I had a teacher like that in 7th grade, and I stated my point, and later she realized I was right and apologized a few days later.
*ni femme, ni homme*

literally a centuries-old line of French poetry

we're not a ""new phenomenon""
Hello! Today I met a person who goes by MarsicusOrion. Neither he nor she has a wonderful personality. That smile of neither his nor hers makes me happy. I could talk to neither him or her all day, although neither he nor she doesn’t talk about neither himself nor herself much. I wonder if this day of neither his nor hers has been wonderful. I hope so!
Idk how these people put on **a pair of pants** in the morning without having a grammatical meltdown.
Came here to say this.
I knew I'd heard something about singular they predating plural they, but I couldn't remember what it was.
If Chaucers name was a name of one of the houses in my secondary school then he knows what he's doing, if he in old England used they then a teacher nowadays should bloody well use it!
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Respect singular they
Or fuck you.
English degree here. The above is correct. A lot of teachers like to be snotty about this in particular, but they are factually incorrect.
How people can say stuff like this and not realise how stupid it sounds baffles me endlessly
*won't use they/them to respect enbies*

*uses they/them to describe enby*

I really hope that's at least semi verbatim and you argued back that they literally JUST DID THAT lol
Accidentally still not misgendering you even while actively being transphobic… amazing
wake up babe new neopronoun just dropped
It’s also sad because the refusal to accept a simple give and take of personal and positive progress continues to limit others’ thinking and discourage play, killing artistic thoughts before they’ve even had a chance to emerge, not to mention ruling language usage within the basis of keeping things “correct” attacks anyone who learned language differently and forces those people to bend to the will of a predetermined “correctness” rather than communicating in ways that make more sense to them: furthering language in their own ways.
please say this exactly if you ever meet an english teacher thinking singular they is incorrect 'cause that will shut their mouth for sure.
Also can I use this next time my teacher uses ""he or she ""in a sentence?
I don't think comp one is computers

Maybe composition?
Wow that is quite a story
I think they were joking.
Thank you

I can only afford one pant. Times are hard.
They must start sweating whenever anyone talks about deer, sheep, fish, bison, etc.
YES, it was legitimately one of the more affirming things in my life at the time. They were still terrible people but they missed the bullying mark so hard that they actually ended up being kind of supportive.
You are free to use what I've written however you wish.  However, if you want to *maximize* the cattiness, might I suggest handing out a copy of [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X)?  It is an ancient work - more than a hundred years old - and still considered one of the best books ever written on the subject of writing well.  You can read the full text of it [here](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf)

The principle of using fewer words is important and essential enough that it makes an appearance in the *introduction* to the modern imprint:

""Vigorous writing is concise.  A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.  This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.""

This is the 17th element presented in the work.

(I should note that this suggestion is a *joke* and I'd not recommend it.  This 104 year old book is commonly assigned to people seeking degrees in English.  To present it would be seen (quite rightly, I might add) as an indictment that they've no clue what they're talking about.  It'd likely be taken as an insult, and, as a rule, you should avoid insulting people who have the power to make your life miserable.)
I thought it was Baudelaire but it was Swinburne just randomly writing shit in French for no clear reason XDDDDDD
I have it in Songs for the Senses but that's not a real publication, that was a custom issuance, hold on, it might be a baudelaire quote from a letter that swinburne was referencing, they were friends/rivals/possibly lovers/definitely drinking buddies.

Guys i've reached 4 weeks post chest surgery! I'm so happy 😭🖤		"I wanted to do that ever since I was 14! Anyway, patience is key and I'm happy for you (I just can't help being jealous at everyone I see online)
Congratulations on what looks like an excellent recovery so far omg! Looking great!
[deleted]
Looks really clean.  So happy for you
Oof, you look so good! How I wish that were me 😭
Congrats!
Congrats!! Bet you’re so happy
You look great!!!
Awwww congrats on the surgery you look so good!
Congrats!
Congrats! You look amazing! 🤗
Yes yes yes yes i'm happy for you!!
I’m so proud baby uwuwuwu 💕
is that just medical tape over the incisions? that seems like it would  h u r t  coming off
Looks great! Which doctor did you use?
Yayyy!!!! I’m so happy for you!!
Congrats! Do you mind telling me a bit about how the process works? I'm interested in getting top surgery but I'm not 100% sure if I'm able to customize anything or if everything is set to a default procedure.
may i ask who your surgeon was? they did an incredible job!
It looks amazing! Congrats, OP!
And I reached 4 weekes without going out. Im happy for you, tho!
Yes baby to me it was the same, around 14. As soon as they grow i didn't want them, it's been a long way but after saving a lot of money, and living with dysphoria, at my 25 i finally did it. I wish you the best and be patient, i'm sure you'll get yours 🖤
Thank you so much! Now i just have to take care of the scars, it's been a long way, thank you again!
I wish you the best bby, i've been waiting for this for +10 years and sure thing patience is key, but with all my heart i wish that you could do this someday. Virtual hug!
Thank you very much 🖤
Thank you! Hope you get yours soon bby 🖤
🎉🎉 thanks!
Yeeees i feel so relieved too
Thank you!!! 🖤
Thanks a lot 🖤
Thank you! 🖤🖤🖤
Thank youuu! 🖤
Awww thanks! 🖤
Bby thanks for all your support, hope we can see each other soon cause I miss you so much 🖤
Yeah it's medical tape, with days passing they loose a bit and if you take them off in the shower it's not that hurtful. But if that happens 
, after shower i have to put new ones haha
Here in Chile there's a doctor very specialized in this kind of surgery, her name is Montserrat Fontbona. I came to her by a recommendation and she's very good!
Thank youuu so much 🖤
I don't know what you mean by customize, but i'll tell you my process. Sorry if in this writing are some grammatical mistakes, english is not my first language 🙏🏻
First i went to the surgeon in a medical consult to tell her what i wanted, chest surgery, or in other words, masculinization of the chest. She asked me if i wanted a full plain chest or if i wanted more like pecs-looking, and she asked me for some urine and blood tests, also a mammography and a mammary ecography. Just control tests to see if everything was ok before the surgery.
After i got the results of my tests i went to show her and we set a possible date, that i had later confirm with her secretary.
Oh i forgot to tell that in the first medical consult she explained me the different types of chest surgery, I don't remember the exact names but there is one where they keep your nipple and cut around it, that's for small breasts, the other two options are the typical you see with the horizontal scar or an inverted T type of scar. She gets to decide which method is better based in your anatomy.
Tell me what else you want to know, cause the rest was just be there the day of the surgery and they did it.
She left me with a drain in both sides cause after the surgery the body reacts by trying to fill the ""empty space"" with lymphatic liquid.
A week after the surgery i went to see the doctor again and she took off the drains and left me with the sutures which she took of the next week.
Post op care is relative rest, you can walk but have to restrain your arms movements cause if you move them too much lymphatic liquid will appear or you can get an hematoma or some other minor risks.
I feel like i wrote a lot but if you want to know anything else just tell me (:
Montserrat Fontbona was my surgeon, she's a pro here in chile 🖤
Thank youuu so much!
Thanks! Mine started to grow when I was 9, I never wanted them but I also didn't know it was possible to get rid of 'em. Even if it takes a few more years (it definitely will....) it will be okay!
❤️❤️
Np! You look awesome!
Of course!
Of course!
No problem! Heal well! 💜
small price to pay I'm sure though, hope it heals up nicely for you!
Thank you! Yeah, i was just wondering if there were different types of surgeries avaliable. Thank you, that helped a lot
Best of the vibes for you, i hope to see your pic of the rec in a couple years! Be strong until then 🖤
Happy healing!
You're welcome, anything you need tell me, best of luck!"	fx1tk5	NonBinary	1352	1.0	2020-04-08 07:13:25

I was already feeling Euphoric with this outfit, then I saw the flowers and it made my non-binary ass so happy		"i love your overalls they’re really cool !!
Those overalls!!! Where can i get em?♡ your outfit is awesome!!
Big Kaylee Firefly vibes! Love it!
Your outfit is amazing 😍 this whole picture is radiating sunshine and smiles!!
This outfit looks soooo comfy 😍
your smile really says it all! love how happy you look :)
Cool bean is cool! 💜
Okay but your outfit is seriously the best!!

I have loads of overalls. One pieces = strong NB vibes
Those overalls are amazing and you have such a radiant smile!
That outfit is absolutely amazing.
That outfit is amazing, I love the flowers, you look so happy! Everything about this photo is just wonderful 😍
Oh my, I love your overalls ! You look amazing !!
Very cute!
Thank you!!! I wish I could tell you but they were thrifted :(
Thank you so much !! I was having such an amazing day and it definitely showed !! 🥰
It’s so nice! Especially when skateboarding it just flows in the wind!
What a golden find! They look like they might even be handmade.
I'll have to keep an eye out when i shop then :)"	t81efb	NonBinary	1226	1.0	2022-03-06 15:44:27
Even though I’m afab and present feminine 70% of the time, I’m still a proud non-binary!! Also, feeling happy because I bought a cool shirt with sharks from the men’s section and it looks hella good on me (but no pic yet sadly)		"Wow I totally needed to see this right now. I've been struggling with figuring out my gender identity and I think I'm nonbinary, but I present feminine most of the time too. It's nice to see someone else looking cute and girly while also being nonbinary
I’ve been questioning my gender identity a lot recently, and I don’t know why but reading the title and seeing the pic really helped me. I’m afab as well but due to some body-related stuff I haven’t been able to figure out if I can present myself in an androgynous way. However, this one post has helped me realize that I can present myself in a feminine way and still be comfortably non-binary. So I guess this is a really long-winded way of saying thank you!
That's such a cute outfit you look great :O !!
We owe no one androgyny. You're fantastic!
You’re so valid!!!! Nonbinary folx with SEEMINGLY binary presentations and that like binary language are just as nonbinary as the rest :)
This picture look so good I thought it was an ad for coffee or something and almost scrolled right past it! 

Glad I didn't though, you look lovely!
I'm non-binary too, and love to dress femme and play with makeup! I loooove that yellow on you, it looks so nice. :)
Like a few other people here, seeing you be confident in your identity as nonbinary while being afab and presenting femme is just what I needed to see. Sometimes I feel like I have to present a certain way to be nonbinary, so it's always reassuring to see other nonbinary people like me :)
Be as feminine as you want to be - your identity is still valid! Lovely photo!
You are like a 60s pin up pal ❤️💛
Can't wait to see the shark shirt, sounds great! Until then, we have this fantastic photo of you!
You are completely and utterly valid!!!! And anyone else who leans more to one side of the presentation spectrum  than the other is completely and utterly valid!!! 🖤💜🤍💛
I adore that color!  Such a cheerful outfit.
Omg you look so amazing! Rock that outfit, friend!
I always love to see posts like this. While logically I know your can dress however the fuck you want, I do feel semi-conscious pressure to dress more masc, or bind or similar things. But he'll yeah femme/masc enbies!
(Also you're very cute! :D)
ever since i worked out i'm nonbinary last year i've been trying to convince myself i don't have to present a certain way to ""count"". seeing feminine-presenting afab enbies like myself helps. thank you and keep rocking the way you look with no apologies :)
I HAVE A SHIRT WITH SHARKS TOO!! It’s my favorite
Ah, your whole outfit is fantastic and you are lovely. 

Fembies rock <3
Yellow dress is amazing, the cut is fantastic it really accentuates your shoulders in such a lovely way
Omg they look so pretty everything gives off such positive vibes and I love it
Where did you get your glasses? :O They're stunning!
Same here, but AMAB and present and look mostly masculine, and I know most people look at me as pretty ""manly"" even though I don't put effort into that. Just want to be myself without people forcing an identity on me that I never felt comfortable with though. I've settled on it's fine to be yourself, and if other people don't see you for who you are, fuck it
I’m glad I helped you! I used to have similar struggles and sometimes I wonder “am I really enby?”, but really, it’s a spectrum. 

As someone said somewhere (i don’t remember who or where, but I loved it) if being a girl is pink and a guy is blue, there’s a whole spectrum of other colors like yellow and purple. And even if you feel just light-pink, that’s still different from the girls’ pink, so that’s already outside of the binary!
Just a heads up, you don't need to be androgynous in order to be non binary! Not all non binary folks are androgynous!
I’ve been struggling with similar things! I happen to have pretty wide hips and thicc thighs, so it’s hard for me to appear androgynous or masculine when I feel like it (but I’ve learned to manipulate fashion to still appear masc).
I’m glad I was able to help you feel better though!! Sending you lots of love and support!
Thank you!! Yellow just makes me really happy \^^
Yeah!! Thank you!
Louder for the people of the back!!! 😄
Hahaha credit to my mom’s photo skills!

Thank you!
Eyy, I’m sure you look great in it, too!

Thank you!
Yeah!! I’m glad I can help people like this <3
Thank you!
Hahaha thank you! that’s the style of the dress I guess! It looks super good on me!
I’ll post it as soon as I can! Thank you!
Yeah!!
Right!! It just makes you feel so happy and warm inside!
Thank you!!!
You just need to overcome that boundary I’m your mind! It’s not easy, but once you do, you just understand yourself soooo much more!

And thank you^^
You’re doing great so far! ^^ I’m glad I’m able to help fellow binary-presenting enbies feel good!

And thank you <33
AAAA YES!!! Sharks are good!
Thank you!

Yea! Fembies rock!
Hahaha thank you! I think so too!
Thank you!!
Oh man I wish I remembered... I think they’re by Ray-Ban? But they originally had blue lenses, and I replaced them with prescription lenses!
I really needed these comments right now <3
That's a great way of looking at it! Thank you very much for sharing that with me
My sibling is just coming into her nonbinary-ness and being able to show her examples of other folx ok with binary presentation and/or language has been helpful with her finding herself so thanks for sharing with us all :)
Well yes! I do love a good goldenrod~ 🌻
genuinely looking forward to a picture of you in that shirt with sharks on it sometime c:

It was 30c today! Warm weather clothing is weird for gender sometimes but today I felt androgynous and happy <3		"THATS SUCH A COOOL FITTTT. I WANNA DOO THATT. I WANNA DO THE GENDER VIBEY SHIT. But like dammnnnnn androgynous off the wall. 10/10
Oh my goodness 😳
That is some boss ink too, friend.
You got ass for days I got..  to stop trying to rap now...

Wish I had your confidence sib. I got short shorts that ain't seeing the light of day.
Respectfully: love the outfit.

Re - and I can't stress this enough - SPECTFULLY: I WISH I had that kinda dump truck, you're ROCKING it fam.
Love the outfit!
Sorry, I don’t speak water. (Making a joke bc I don’t understand Celsius. Wishing you more lovely weather days!)
Did the tattoo hurt getting it?
You look fucking awesome!
Respectfully whistling at you
You’re right about that.
Your tattoos are so fucking cool!
Super freaking cute !!!
I would like to say I love you. Seriously.
Cute!! 😍😍😍
👍
That outfit is fucking amazing, magazine worthy! You ate and left no crumbs!
Oh my gosh you are stunning, like wow
Ass for days
I love how simple but awesome those tats are!
lord have mercy
I love how you change so much with those glasses. Usually people who wear glasses look weird without them but in this case you don't. Not really the clothes but like the smile and it doesn't seem forced, the euphoria of feeling great and beautiful of yourself
I love your outfit!
Curious since you are using celsius weather instead of fahrenheit you probably live in Canada. Also from the building architecture and things being spread apart unlike Europe where buildings are closer. Your environment gives Ontario vibes but not downtown metropolitan area
happiness looks beautiful on you
Looking fucking fantastic right there.
Right?? I just got new shorts etc, this weather is awesome!
Oh gosh. Sorry I was not expecting to see ass…
Whoa, that's a lot more trunk than it looked from the front 😅
I FOOOOUUUUND you, Mx. New Booty.
i like when i walk down the street and guys dont know if its gay to check me out
Oh my gracious 😳
ty sm i honestly really like my butt its v gender neutral
thank you!!!
nope honestly one of the least painful tats i’ve gotten
thank u! i love funky sunglasses
i’m canadian but i live in the usa
this is so kind!
i am sorry
I personally would check you out. Ur queerness and just outfit is so much to put me in a gay panic state 😂
I would respectfully check you out. And as a genderqueer trans man I wouldn’t have to wonder if it’s gay bc it always is😂
Best vibe. Best.
Would you want the same reaction with girls or just guys? I feel girls do more comparisons rather than guys thinking how to get with someone. I don't know if it's society patterns of cisgender society
Priceless 🤌💋
Oh wow. I planned on getting tattoos too but I chickened out.
Okay fair enough stay safe out there in the wild world
idk i think in life im perceived more femme than masc do i think if girls checked me out theyd def know it was gay? idk tho im just a genderless blob
Holy cow, you look incredible!!!
hehe i have a giant knife to stay safe in these new york streets
Yeah but the average cis person needs a binary label sadly for some reason"	12ldyru	NonBinary	1194	1.0	2023-04-14 01:00:47

What are those things?
Happy Folsom! I had to miss it again this year, hope y'all had fun!
Love the pic! What is Folsom? I'm just not familiar with it
Love the couple in the background, and their shared necklace
Love your necklace!
Happy Folsom to you too. :) Take Pride in who you are & how you love, friend. Never let anyone tell you that you or your expressions don't belong. <3
Fuck yeah floggers!

Love your hair
Your gorgeous and i like your style of kink.
Kinky
Ah- gay panic

Love this but you might want to mark as NSFW, there’s a lot of kids on here.
I joined this subreddit to meet other enbies not watch them go to kink conventions. At the very least you could have marked the post as NSFW...
Happy folsom :)

Folsom Street Fair is a yearly kink/leather event in San Francisco. My friend makes bicycle tube floggers and chainmail jewelry!
If you wouldn't say this about Pride, you shouldn't say this about Folsom. Do your research about the Leather community. (Which, btw, is different from but related to kink.) (Note: it's a subset of the Queer community, started amongst gay & queer men in the 40s and 50s, does A LOT of community service, helped lead the way on HIV/AIDS in the '80s and '90s, etc.)
Oh is that what they are…
Awesome
🤔 I now know what to do with my bicycle tubes.
Difference between this and pride is that pride exists because there are still many places in the world where LGBT+ people don't have the right to be who they are, and this is just whipping eachother to get eachother's berries hard. It's great they do community service but when I browse this subreddit it's not to see people's leather fetish.
They’re floggers.
With all due respect, you couldn't BE more wrong and misinformed. Please, do your research before responding more.

""Difference between this and pride is that pride exists because there are still many places in the world where LGBT+ people don't have the right to be who they are""

Being kinky or a Leatherperson is NOT a protected class. One can still be discriminated against for these things AND it's not uncommon for people to actually be discriminated against for it. Yes, people actually DO lose their jobs, their homes, and their children over this. (It especially gets brought up in custody trials as proof these people are ""unfit parents."") People get imprisoned over this, yes, even in the USA. There are states where it is ILLEGAL to do this stuff, even with full consent of your partner.

In some countries, people are tortured and killed for being kinky or Leather.

So don't say it's different because LGBTQ+ people don't have the right to be who they are. That's EXACTLY why this exists. Because we can't be who we are. Heck, you don't even want us to be who we are here.

""this is just whipping each other""

Not all people are into whipping, or even sadism & masochism. There's a very, VERY wide range of behaviors, love styles, and relationship styles involved in BDSM/kink. For many people, it has a lot more to do with how they love & structure their relationships than with sex or pain. (This is basic BDSM/kink/Leather/Fetish/fetish 101 stuff and can easily be found elsewhere.)

(But, frankly, we shouldn't have to say that, because there's nothing WRONG with pain OR sex when done between consenting adults, and, in fact, that was a major part of what the Gay movement wanted back in the '70s, was that kind of sexual liberation for all.)

""to get each other's berries hard""

There's SO much more to Leather AND kink than simply sex (i.e. ""get their berries hard""), and to say otherwise is an insult to both communities, ESPECIALLY the Leather community. Leather is absolutely not the same as leather fetish, although many in the community have it. (And there's plenty of folks with leather fetishes who aren't Leather.) Notice the capital L. That's not a typo. It's a name for an entire community with values based around ethics, honor, and service. The kinky stuff is one part of said community, and in sub-communities (like the Motorcycle Clubs, which is where Leather started), those involved might not even be into the kinky stuff at all.

In fact, there's many asexuals (inc. sex-repulsed ones) in the kink communities (and some in Leather too), so they're DEFINITELY not there to get their berries hard.

For many people, this IS their orientation. It's more important than gender to them. It's an enduring pattern of attraction and/or desire. For many people, this is part of their Queerness, as much as any other expression of Queerness is. For many people, this is affirming of their gender, too, just like other expressions of gender.

Plus, it's not just ""a little community service,"" back in the early days of HIV/AIDS, they were some of the main people keeping people alive and serving the dying. They did SO much tireless education to try to save lives and SO many fundraisers for anything from education to condoms to AZT for pos folks. Plus sometimes they had to act as nurses, home healthcare workers, etc. when no one else would because of the stigma. They are an inherent and interlinked part of LGBTQ+ history that can not and WILL not be erased.
As someone that's been around the scene for a while, this might be the very best breakdown of the kink and Leather communities I've ever seen. Even among other kinksters I find myself explaining that not everything has to be about sex. Thanks so much for putting this to words, this one is definitely getting shared. :)
Oh, boy, and I wrote this sleep deprived at 3am! :D I've actually done a better job (well, more thorough, with better wording) of writing about this stuff elsewhere.

But thank you!"	xntfz7	NonBinary	1191	0.99	2022-09-25 17:27:16

You sure this isn’t a subtle coming out? 😂
AWWWWW THATS SO CUTE
Love this the cake looks wonderfully good congrats to you!! :)
I think he just used a standard vanilla cake recipe but for the buttercream he used real vanilla he made with vodka and beans
I would certainly believe it if they went for something fancier, but there are Betty Crocker food coloring gels where the purple and yellow come out just like that, so I'm thinking you could do it with 100% box mixes.
I came out a year ago, this was my birthday cake
Awesome, thanks!
I mean ik what food coloring he used because i only moved out recently, but my parents never buy box cakes. But yeah could 100% make it with box vanilla cakes
Yeah, it was pretty obvious... it was a joke.
I’m autistic and have a hard time understanding jokes sorry
No problem. I just found it funny cause hidden pattern cakes are a funny subtle method for trans people to come out lol"	vrlhhq	NonBinary	1186	1.0	2022-07-05 00:34:23

Happy to be able to flex and be who I need to be, both and neither. People in this group give me so much confidence		"Hello, good looking!
You look AWESOME and if I was in public with my grandma she would definitely wonder if you were a male or female (that is a complement sorry if it’s a odd complement)
How did u do that 😭😍
Excellent. Amab nb here. Have you presented this way much in public? What about in a dress if so? I'm trying to figure out my comfort in presentation while in public. Thanks!
I appreciate just how much you rock both of these aesthetics. Goals, seriously. Good on you, friend!
I wanna do something like that when I'm on my own. Partially I wanna mess with homo/transphobes by looking male at 1 time, female at another, and something very odd another time.
U r stunning!
Wow! Definition of “Get you someone who can do both.” Gorgeous!!
Wow - beautiful in both modes!
Thanks!
I have been lucky that I have always been androgynous since I was young
I am afab non-binary. I have presented as both in public. I like being recognized as both or a question mark for people. I get sir’d 80% of the time regardless of what I’m wearing. I just do it for me and let the others catch up ♥️✨
lol you and me both
It was all my pleasure.

Thank you so much. The dress is just so comfortable.
Thanks and welcome to the sub. I'm not precious about pronouns as long as people aren't being offensive. But if I have to choose it would be they/them. Your question is relevant and appreciated and doesn't make me uncomfortable.
Thank you very much.

Thanks. I can't believe how well fitting it is.
Thanks very much.
Thanks
Thanks very much. I love this style.
Thanks very much for your kind comments. I don't often wear a dress but I was so happy wearing this last night.

I’m one year into being out! I identify as transfeminine non-binary now, and I finally feel like myself! Happy pride!		"I love absolutely everything about your outfit and you look really happy which is pretty great. Happy Pride!
Stunning! 💜 Love the parasol
You look like a mix between shaggy and velma. I mean that in the nicest way possible
Congratulations! So happy for you 🎉🎂🎂
Wowowowow you look stunning!
Adorable!
That is amazing !
You look awesome! Where'd you find the parasol?
That is nice. I only need my dad and the reast of my family to be out to the world.
I love your outfit! You look great! Happy pride!!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💞
Love the outift! I wish I had your swag
Mmmm wow soooo sexy
Oh my god Zomg you look amazing! Uh don't mind me asking but uh-- how do you come out as non-binary? I mean my parents fully accept me being lesbian but I don't know how to come out as a non-binary. Have any advice ?
Love the parasol!
That is a VERY cute skirt. I'm jealous. Is it OK to ask if you've been on HRT? I've been for two years...and am taking the steps toward surgical procedures...love the changes--so far. ;  )
How come ""brain-slug?""
This! These are goals!
Awww, thank you! I believe the seller was paperlanternsUSA on Etsy
I fully get it! And in your own time of course. I came out last June to my family, and it was the hardest/best decision to do so for me!
i know it’ll be totally worth it but i’m in the not so fun transitioning phase w my family 🙃 but we’re all worthy of being respected as we truly are much luvvvv 💛💛🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
So! When I came out, I came out hard! lol I’m pansexual, non-binary, and polyamorous. My family is very religious so it was also a bit shocking to them as I had an “atheism kicker” as the icing on the cake.

I had a very supportive sister though who had defended me to my family for me. And that has been incredible.

But when I came out, I made sure that I also gave them resources about pronouns and deadnaming and gender presentation vs. gender identity. And of course, it’s not our responsibility to educate everyone else, but it’s also really meaningful to see if they read what you give them!
At this point, I was on HRT for 6 months. But my testosterone was way out of wack and my estrogen was way under. I didn’t get my T suppressed until a month later.
And thank you!!!

Oh! I also had a hair transplant surgery done about 1.5 years before this photo
It’s a creature from the show futurama! That’s really it other than it being a nickname with gamer friends from a few years ago
Thanks, I'm taking my time. 'Cause my mom need some time to get used to the idea that I'm non-binary. And I'm happy you can be yourself :D
Oh. That's honestly really rad ! :D
Sounds SUPER smart of you!!! I've been ""moving toward the femme,"" too...and now am in a kind of NB place...which you seem to be.
OK. I've been on E and P for two years now..with pretty good results...including essentially B-cup boobs...which I feel VERY good about.  ;  )
I assume to lower your hairline?
The fact that your sister was there for you lol. Thanks !
Oh, things have changed since this post!!! This was back in June! I actually identify as a Trans Woman now… full context: I identified as non binary from 2020 to fall of 2022! But check out my profile for a more up to date pic too! 

At the same time, I really thought I was non-binary. Through much much more self reflection, I finally admitted to myself I was actually just a binary trans woman
Yup! My hairline was receding pretty bad
Thanks for the additional info. I've been moving toward the fem. gender...but have discovered that (for me) that this is more complicated than expected. I still plan my chest augmentation surgery (and other procedures), but have re-grown my mustache... as I've been doing some work at this non-commercial radio station...where they think of me as a male...and I figure that maybe I'll leave it that way until I've been there for awhile...just to keep things simple. There is also the fact that I seem to need to express a ""male-side"" at times...so ""bottom line,"" I suppose I'm NB, but with strong motivation to keep the transition going. Would appreciate your support."	v9ozj3	NonBinary	1155	1.0	2022-06-11 03:43:05
My friend invited me to his school dance and i’m do happy with how my outfit for it turned out :D		"This is a WHOLE MOOD.  and I wish I had this kind of vibe in high school.
Sharp! Reminds me of Eurhythmics’ Annie Lennox.
Literally everyone looks great in a suit and tie. LOVE the shoes you paired with it, it's such a nice aesthetic.
The outfit is fantastic, you look absolutely gorgeous! Hope that you and your date had a great time!
White cat hair on such a good-looking suit, though??

Congrats on rocking this look, fam! But I really hope you had a lint roller on hand.
You look great!
You look very cool!!!
You look so good!!!
You look good in that suit…
You look absolutely amazing!
Fierce 😉😉😉
So fierce the shredder feels intimidated by you!
Very important question... what's the cat's name?  

Also you're lovely
You look absolutely magnificent! Enjoy the dance!
You're further proof that everyone looks good in a nice suit!
You immediately made me think of Desire, the Endless
You look great! The tuxedo really *suits* you! (I’m not funny ik)
You look awesome!
Omg 😭🖤🖤
The suit! The shoes! Immaculate!
thats hot
I love this and you look amazing! Just wanted to let you know that baby’s breathe is mildly toxic to cats tho just in case you didn’t know. I hope you had a great night!
its the matching tie and toenails for me SLAY you look grear
You look so amazing!! I love everything about your look! Especially your eyes and eyeshadow!
Literally came here to say the same lol
I’m totally here for it.
Hell yeah everyone looks good in a suit and tie! Wish it were considered a more casual day to day look tbh..
yee we had plenty of lint rollers around so all was good :D
I believe that one's name is Reeses. If not then it's Twix. They look really similar so it's hard to tell them apart. 

also thank you!
*finger guns*
I love the cats. I would die for them both.

Also you're welcome!"	t3fg9p	NonBinary	1142	1.0	2022-02-28 13:19:34
happy nonbinary day! 💛🤍💜🖤		"Great photo, and happy nonbinary day to you too! Also, is that one of those 80s Casio digital guitars?
I've seen three pictures from you on this sub and every single one of them is aesthetically flawless.  I'm impressed!
i aspire to be like this
I feel like I've seen you on tumblr...
1. Hey~
2. is that a banjo
This is such an amazing picture! Whatever aesthetic this is is great👍
Love your hair! And it's cool that your pfp matches it
I want that top...
I am attracted to so many things in this image.
Omg this photo is amazing, where did u even find a real dg 20?
Yo its one of those things, I have no idea what they're called but I do know its awesome
Damn, that‘s a cool picture.

What exactly does that dg-20 do? Is it like a combo synth or something?
I want to be smooth like that.
It is!! it’s such a weird instrument. I’m trying to get it fixed rn because a little plastic piece broke :(
aw thanks! it’s 100% my partner who tells me how to pose and stuff hahaha
this is likely i am beloved in all places
yes!! i’m not very good lol, i mostly got it so i could learn how to play sufjan songs
;*
my aunt gave it to me like 15 years ago when they were basically valueless! now i guess they’re worth a few hundred, it’s bananas
:) digital guitar! it sounds a little less awesome than it looks haha
So it’s sort of two things: a midi instrument and an accompanying drum machine. The rubber neck has pressure pads that receive where you’re holding down the string, and then where the strings meet the bridge it records vibration so it knows when the string is plucked. The actual string tautness doesn’t matter so they’re all completely out of tune. There are a number of different sounds like guitar, organ, and stuff. 

The drum machine is incredibly goofy sounding but has tempo adjustments and a few different beats, and it can do fills, which is really fun.
Wait what's the name of it?
That does sound pretty fun!
Casio DG-20, commonly called the Digital Guitar! I don’t know of a ton of musicians who use one, I think Flight of the Conchords do
It looks so cool though!!!
ty!!! :3 i thought it worked for this photo’s vibe hehe"	okbjlm	NonBinary	1141	1.0	2021-07-14 19:21:42
Happy International Women’s Day! I am a woman, and also so much more, bringing you strong fem nonbinary power.		"You are gorgeous and I'm p sure you could crush the patriarchy single-handedly, but I'm still down to help.
Um... wow 😍 Also, thank you for showing that even as nb people we can still be proud of our AGAB and femininity 💪🏼
Shit, you're goals AF.
This is my favorite picture on reddit 
holy shit friend you are goals
Power is right. You look like someone who's powerful physically and mentally.

Happy Thursday Full Collapse/War all the Time tour!
I should try this
Thank you, and I'm happy to have you on my team.
We'll hold the line during op's snack break :3
YOU'RE my favorite picture on reddit. <3
Thank you! I'm really glad that comes across. I've Seen Some Shit, and it's made me very resilient. <3
❤️
I do indeed. My routine changes every 6 weeks, but 3 days a week I do 45-90 minutes of full-body circuit training (depending on how much of a hardass my trainer is being when she assigns the new routine) followed by 20-30 minutes of cardio and 30-45 minutes of foam rolling & flexibility work.
Thank you, and IT SURE AS SHIT IS! Almost no one recognizes that tattoo out in the wild. (Happy 40th birthday to Geoff Rickly btw ❤️)
And here I was, under the firm impression that I didn’t have any. 😂
💕
I love you back. 💕
YAAAASSSSS! I flew to Atlanta to see them, since they didn't have anything near Minneapolis, and it was E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!
AAAAAAAA
I just woke up but this made my day 
omg, sweet, I just saw them play Full Collapse in concert not that long ago aliw3uefxjngnWSEJ>Fd IT WAS THE BEST
omg ☺️

 You really are the coolest. Thanks for that and for this incredibly inspiring photo. 😍😍😍
I’m glad you’re here! I don’t often meet other folks like us who know where we came from. Thursday was so important to me growing up, and still are!!!

Love your powerful looks too!! 
I just recently got back from flying to Atlanta to see the back-to-back 20 year reunion shows. Geoff crouched down and sang directly into my face and I nearly raptured right there and then tbh. 
I didn't actually discover Thursday until adulthood, but as soon as I heard them, I knew they were the sound of my heart, and I dove deep and never came back up for air.
amazing :3
Amazing! Love that."	ayqojb	NonBinary	1133	0.99	2019-03-08 14:10:14

😊😊😊
Gahh that's so nice of you 🙈
Thank you! I'll try to work it into more looks 😊
I’ve been trying to motivate myself to work out more, do you mind if I ask what your routine is? :)
I actually have a personal trainer so it's rather customized, but its 80% lifting and 20% running. I work out 5 days a week, but most people only do 3 or 4. I focus on a specific part of the body for each day (biceps and back // Butt // Triceps and shoulders, ect) and then also do a quick jog or HIIT workout after. My insta is cosmicphenomenon - I talk more about my workouts and stuff on there if you wanna check it out.
Thank you!! Will definitely check it out :)

75 days of eating plant based and focusing on just being happy in my own body and here are the results 👊		"Who knew veganism makes you grow hats!
we love a fellow vegan on the gender non-binary spectrum
Can't wait to go from vegetarian to totally plant-based! Congrats on 75 days!
In flexetarian, but I’m trying my best, so I eat meat a little bit. I’m new to it lol
Your skin is glowing!
Straight out of a Blink-182 video (it's a compliment I swear)
Goals!!!!!!!
Honestly, the change is noticeable! Great job, and I’m always thrilled to have more vegan enbys around 🙌🙌
Congratulations!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your face totally just changed shape... I didn't think that was possible. What sorcery is this?!
Good job going vegan the animals thank you :p
Cool! whats the tattoo with the sheet music for
Been drinking green smoothies for over a decade.

Best way too start the day.
Amazing!!
thought this was r/vegan for a sec, lol

You do look amazing tho! congrats!
You look amazing! I love your eyebrows btw.
I’m sure everyone knows that!
You didn't know that?
😂
Vegan enbys unite! 💚💜
Thank you! And that’s what I did. ...well, pescatarianism. I was vegetarian from 2008-2018 and started incorporating fish every once in a while. But the switch was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be. I loved eating eggs but substituted tofu for it! And I don’t even miss the cheese honestly. I feel way better without it. You got this!
That’s awesome! Eating plant based full time for the rest of your life is not sustainable for everyone, so even just reducing meat intake like you’re doing helps the planet out so much!
Is it?? Thank you! 😊
That’s the straightest thing I’ve done all year
Thank you! ☺️ 🌱
Ayeee
The magic of the enby gods 🙌🏻
It’s a song called “Happiness” I listened to a lot during my teen years. I transcribed it myself into Sibelius so that tattoo is my own transcription of the first line of the song
Thanks mate 🤙 You know, I get a lot of compliments on my eyebrows, but I’ve never done anything to them lol. I guess I got lucky!
Me too!🌱
Thanks! I try to save the planet as much as I can and I try to make everybody equal. No matter the gender, religion, sexuality, or race

Tillykke fra Danmark! 🇩🇰🇳🇴🖤❤️
Takk, og gratulerer med dagen!! 🎊🥳🎉
Jeg er godt nok dansk, men jeg støtter mine medskandinavere
Gratulerer med dagen! I need to get my grandmother’s bunad fitted for me. She immigrated to the US after WWII, and was 96 years old when she passed
I want to be a Norwegian enby, lol
Constitution Day 🇳🇴. 👍 Nice
Happy 17th May :D
Whoa! I have like the exact same hair
What's the significance of that necklace? Looks unusual but very cool.
you look enchanting😍
Danke! Und du Kleidung ist schön!
This made my day, gratulere med dagen!!! This was my first 17. May in Bunad as gnc so i was kinda nervous that i was going to dislike wearing it this year but it still feels great :)
I love to see so many Scandinavian and other close neighbors in the comments! Tillykke herfra! 🇧🇻🇩🇰

Gratulerer med dagen🇳🇴🎉🥂🏳️‍🌈 hilsen en annen norsk enby:)
I recently learned that solje means ""shiny"" and it made my crow brain very  happy. Shiny jinglies? Yes, please. Lovely bunad— thank you for sharing! 😊
Awww thank you🥺 I'm glad that it gave you some joy 🧡🧡
Gratulerer med dagen!
Thank you❤️ its a bunad and mine is a trønder bunad
This is my grandmothers bunad that I got 10 years ago after she passed away. Hope you get around to get it fitted.
Eeeey nice 🧡
So all the silver and the bunad is from the same area of Norway. So you can tell where someone is from based on the bunad and the silver they are wearing.
It's my first year as enby in a bunad so I get what you mean. But it was grandma's so I love it forever🧡
Same, it's so nice 🧡
My aunt that used to work in a kindergarten told me that they have books they read to the children about haveing gay or trans parents. Or children being gay or trans. So I do think the youth of Norway are starting to be very woke.
[removed]
I can see that happening in the US. Ppl in Norway are for the most part pretty chill about stuff. You don't really go about voicing your opinions out loud.

Achievement unlocked: Gender Euphoria. Wore a skirt to work, got cold, and literally looked/felt like a gamer goth alt-person and I was so happy.		"That outfit is great on you!!
YAS FELLOW BARISTA BABE ILYSM U LOOK GREAT !!!
This is adorable!!
You look lovely!
ayyyyy i’d know that BOH anywhere!!!! you look great, that skirt seems super comfy!!!
Batwing hem! Too cool!
If you wear some leggings underneath it it won't be so cold and you can still wear the skirt.
I’m not one for skirts but that one goes so good with that jacket and those shoes!!!! Vibes and goals honestly
You look awesome!
such a cool skirt! Love the vibe :)
You look great!!!! :)
Ya look like a star ✨✨love it
You're lovely!
Omg you're so cute
Isn’t gender europhoria the best feeling ever!! I didn’t realise it existed until I started wearing skirts 🥰🥰
i gotta know where you got that skirt! it’s so cute!
Nice! So happy for you!!! <3
YOU LOOK SOO GOOD AND HAPPY THANKS FOR DOING THIS :))
It DO go spinny\~! =D  
<3
Damn cute omg! ❤️❤️❤️
OMG YOU LOOK SO GOOD!!! to not get cold i’d recommending getting some tights and maybe some leg warmers too!! <3
Gamer goth human beans unite!! Honestly though you look great! When I shaved most of my hair and started dressing masculine on some days I felt a lot more freedom than I'd ever felt, like ""I can be femme one day and masc the next? Why did Jo one tell me this..""
Just wish I had friends this end of the country who were also like me. 

Also bonus points for the very adorable pose and peace sign at the end!
You look great!!

If you get cold easy, get some fleece lined tights in a shade that's close to your skintone, or color coordinate. And if you'll be moving a lot, wear some shorts to prevent any skin irritation!"	vhhvtc	NonBinary	1058	1.0	2022-06-21 16:55:23

Happy trans week to all my fellow enbies ♡		"Nice sentiment, but I really don’t consider myself as trans. More power to those who do though!
I love the sentiment here! I didn’t know non-binary, genderfluid, and genderqueer people like me could celebrate being trans.
Thank you!! I really appreciate it.
💓💓💓
This is true but spinel pfp? Cringe
This was nice thanks
Yeye! If nonbinary/genderfluid/etc. etc. people aren't comfy with the label of trans they don't have to use it! Some people are only comfy with their more specific label and not with the broader term that label may fall under and that's totally okay!
I can get that seeing as I'm pan and that's under the bi umbrella but I don't consider myself bi. Personally I don't use trans to define myself but I get that I'm part of the collective.
Agreed! I don't consider myself trans either, but this is lovely to see regardless!
Trans = your gender is not the one you were assigned at birth. Like any other labels, you don't need to use it if you don't want to. Not trying to force language onto people's identities. But it's there for anyone who does.
Why? That just seems really mean spirited of you
Big same, also how do you change your flair for this sub, my options were custom and a whole bunch of blank ones
Nifty! Thanks for telling me!
It was a (admittedly kind of mean) joke but also spinel is an abusive, “mean spirited” character
I'm not getting into this, but she's a victim of intense abandonment and trauma.

She's a grey character, at least to the point someone having her as their PFP is no worse than someone having Steven.
Spinel is a villain. She's meant to be ""mean spirited"". That's the entire point.


But she was also a victim of abuse, and a perfect representation of how ppl continue that cycle. I relate to her in a lot of ways. Lashing out because of said abuse and in the end trying to find ways to heal and move on. She's realistic. Not everyone is good from the start. I think you've missed the entire point of her character. And maybe don't tell ppl their comfort characters or pfp characters are cringe til you know why they chose it?


Even if I'd just chosen it cuz I like her as a character, doesn't give you a right to be rude for literally no reason. 


Plus you probably wouldn't say this about someone with, idk, like a Darth Vader pfp lol
I don’t agree, but that’s ok - I made a mean joke and I understand why people wouldn’t like it. I found her pretty triggering when I watched the movie, but in full seriousness everyone else seems to like her so maybe it’s just me. I don’t literally think someone should be morally scrutinized for having her as a PFP, for what it’s worth.
Sorry, I'm realizing now that this was something I should have kept to myself. Spinel reminded me of my abuser and I'm realizing that not everyone felt that way when they watched the movie. I'm sorry for being rude, and I hope you have a nice night.
I hope you do too and I definitely understand where that comes from. I hope I didn't come across as rude either."	juoanm	NonBinary	986	0.99	2020-11-15 16:12:58
Happy Father’s Day to the man who said “Okay!” when I said I didn’t want to be called “she” anymore and hasn’t messed up once. He even switched to calling me “my oldest child” when introducing me to people.		"PS thanks for the youthful looks, Dad. I’m 28 and he’s 50.

ETA: My father's reaction to this post getting so many upvotes and all of the comments:

""An important part of being a dad is to let my kids be who they are. That's different from having no rules. Your identity isn't mine to dictate.""

Relatable content right there lol. No problem 🌈
You are so very welcome <3
your welcome and thanks! I've also been expressing myself by wearing more ""femme"" stuff. I'm afab, trans and GQ. I've been loving those baggy hippie pants and leggings as of late. It's really empowering to find what fits your style and expression and learning not to give a fuck what other people might think. other someone joking that I was wearing mchammer pants all has been well. now to find underwear that I can comfortably wear with leggings 😅
That what I call mine. Mine are lighter and a bit shorter tho
💛💜🖤
For me i just had to like Start wearing them, it forced me to be ok with wearing them, tbh I’m still a bit dysphoricy about it but I’m pushin through. Hope you get to wear them sooner rather than later all yall <3<3<3<3<3<3
You too!
Yasssssss! Boyshorts and a variety of other cuts after bikini from la senza/ aerie are p darn comfortable, there are also seemless ones. If you wanted to go the more masc underwear root jack &jones boxer briefs are thin and comfy, and p darn cute tho obv a bit more expensive than the la senza and aerie ones since big deal sales on mens underwear are virtually non existent.
Oooh nice I would love to find shorter ones that are my size <3 ty for the info it’ll be easier to search for them :D
Thank you!
thanks so much!

I feel so happy when I can dress as myself! ❤️		"You look stunning!!!
I feel a deep instinctual urge to give you a big happy hug, you look so good!
Oh my fucking god you’re so cute. We have basically the same body type and I’ve been super wary of dresses. They’ve never really been my bag but you’re making me reconsider. If could pull one off like you I’d do it.
Omg you look STUNNING!! That color looks great on you 🖤🖤🖤
You look great!
That is a hekkin dress! And you shine more that it does.
Wow! You look amazing ♥️ I understand that feeling too 🙂
You rock black lipstick! Love it! 🖤
You look stunning!!! 
I wish my grandparents gave me the freedom to dress and look how I want (or be openly Non-Binary) , I live with them and I 
1: Cant have long hair
2: Can’t paint my nails
3: Can’t dye my hair
4: Cant have piercings, not even in the ears.

I’m grateful that they allow me to live with them and give me all my necessities but sometimes I wander why I can’t do these things and it upsets me. I try to express how I feel but they don’t listen and refuse to let me do any of this.

That is an amazing dress, family. Where did you get it?
This look is good as hell!! ""Superhero undercover at a party"" vibes
Looking lovely, love the dress

You are beautiful <3 <3
Sexy xxx
Thank you! ☺️❤️
Lol that's so sweet of you 🙈 Thank you btw!  ❤️
People come in all shapes and sizes. I get it though, I think a ton of us do. Dysphoria is a hell of a drug.

But no one is the harsher judge than ourselves when we look in the mirror. Guarantee other people just see another human and go about their day.
I say just go for it! But look for a dress that you absolutely love and I'm sure you mind will be totally changed! When I started presenting more femme I didn't think I could pull off dresses until I just went all out and found I totally loved it and that I looked kinda decent lol now I genuinely wish I could be in cute dresses all the time!
Thanks! 😊
Gosh! I know I'm in love with this dress! Lol Thank you for the sweet compliment though! 😊❤️
Thank you hun! ❤️ It's such a great feeling right?! 😄
I honestly thought I looked kinda ehhh 🤷🏻‍♀️ with it but gosh thank you so much for saying that! It really means a lot!! ☺️❤️
I'm sorry hun ❤️ I really wish you could express yourself openly. Keep your head up hun! Maybe in the near future things will go your way and you'll be able to be yourself without anyone judging you!
🙈 Thank you! That's so kind of you to say! ❤️
Thank you! ☺️ I actually got it second hand from someone online. Though the brand on the tag says its 'All That Jazz' idk if that helps!
Lol your sweet comment totally made my day 😊❤️
Lmao! Thats so flattering! Mermaids are so pretty! Lol
Thank you hun! 😊 I got them from Amazon the brand is called Top Moda
Thank you! That's so sweet of you to say! 😊❤️
Eh I mean maybe I have some internalized stuff to deal with but even as I’ve recently been coming out and embracing certain aspects of femme presentation I do not feel as though I’ve been denying myself those clothes out of fear, more just that I don’t really feel drawn to them. Please give me all the legwear and cute shoes and hair accessories you have though.
I'll look it up.
Oh okay, it sounded like you weren't drawn to dresses due to body type, so I figured it was something dysphoria related. Guess I'm projecting lol
I mean I don’t know anymore haha"	vnl8rj	NonBinary	950	1.0	2022-06-29 17:28:09
I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: an update!	"Hey! I'm the same person who wrote about questioning their gender and thinking about continue transition while having an openly radfem girlfriend. I have some news that I wanted to share with yall!

First, this week I went to a transgender clinic with a non binary friend. I felt really comfortable, my friend was even surprised! They said I looked so happy while talking about transitioning and that I'm definitely not cis. I agree, while talking about how I feel and my desires I realized I certainly have a more similar experience of what being trans is rather than being cis. However, I still don't feel worthy of calling myself trans or non binary. 

I also talked to my mom about my dysphoria, and gave some ""discreet hints"" about not being cis and she was very okay about it! She was only confused why my dysphoria is back, but I'm feeling the same lol, so no worries. But I'm don't feel safe yet to talk about medical transition, I'll wait until I'm more comfortable and sure about my identity.

Second: yes, I broke up with my (now ex) girlfriend. It was a respectful conversation, where both sides were heard. My questioning wasn't the only thing that made me want to break up, she did some little things that made me upset during our relationship that didn't get better. She also have some personal issues she's working through that were also impacting our relationship. 

During the conversation, I said she didn't treat trans people with decency and that she, from my perception, have a very simplistic idea of what being trans and dysphoric is, and due to that I was afraid of talking about my situation with her. She said that it wouldn't matter if I identify as any label of trans, that ""she even has a non binary friend"", she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman. She also said that the not so good thing she calls trans people are only ""jokes"" but she wouldn't misgender them or anything (even tho she still does that). After breaking up, I felt relieved! I'm exited to discover myself again and meet new people!"	"Congrats 🎉 amazing update it sounds like things are going well and you’re in a good position to grow, explore, and take care of yourself as a unique and special person. I’m so happy for you💜🌈
Congratulations and good luck moving forward
No radfems. Only rad femmes
Oh thank god I’m soo glad you broke it off.
Aww I remember that post. What a fucking victory. Love to see it 🥲
your ex was a little dick. i hope the rest of your journey is much better! my one piece of advice is to take shit from no one
Thank GOD for this update! My friend, I was genuinely worried about you, and now I’m seeing this?! You got yourself to a point where you went to talk about this openly, and felt okay with that. That’s a huge step. I know after my first appointment with a gender specialist i felt a lot more at ease. More accepting of myself and what I may want in the future. 

Medically transitioning isn’t necessary but for a lot of us it’s the only option to get piece of mind in our bodies. I’m currently weighing up the pros and cons of top surgery, it’s a big thing for me, and it’s okay to take the time to consider all the options you have, or don’t have. 

I’m really happy you got out of that relationship, because telling a person “I’ll support you but I won’t ever believe you or accept you as yourself” is NOT supportive or kind or okay. That’s the opposite of support. If it were true, they wouldn’t have  said “but I’ll see you as a woman”. I’m sorry that they couldn’t even for a second out aside their own bullshit for you. Because you sound really cool and super nice, it’s their loss completely. 

So go and thrive, it’s the best way to live your life. We don’t get given a whole lot of time, never waste a minute on doubting yourself or who you are.
Go fucking get it, you absolute monarch 🏳️‍⚧️❤️💜
Can we normalize not affirming TERFs as feminists? They are not feminists. They are transphobes who weaponize feminist ideas to focus their hate.
💖💖💖
Congratulations 🥳 Hope your self-love journey w/your new identity goes well! 

Came out as Nonbinary back in May 2021. 💖
She wouldn't do anything disrespectful yet would still see you as a woman.. lmao good thing that's over
Wooooo boy! I can't tell you how excited I am reading this. I didn't even read the other original post you made, and I don't know you at all, but I'm proud of you! These are huge moves towards self actualization, way to go.
Good job!  I'm proud of you!

(Although, I do wish people wouldn't use radfem a short hand for terf - it's a specific branch of feminism that can also be trans-inclusive. And most terfs aren't even real feminists, let alone radical ones).
So glad for you! And so good you broke up with someone like that: if she doesn’t see you as who you are, that’s not respect. There are plenty of other ppl who will actually respect you.
😄🎉
wow your ex is just yikes
>she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman.

tf? This is absolutely NOT treating a non-binary/trans person with respect. 🤬

If you are enby/trans, you are not your AGAB and don't want to be treated like it 😠
❤️❤️❤️
I’ve been waiting for this update! Live your best life and know that you’re valuable and wonderful.
Congratulations!!! We’re proud of you ♥️ keep going! You got this
So so happy for you
💜💜💜
Im so happy for you. I hope the rest of your journey goes well.
i don't think i saw your first post so i'm not familiar with your story but i'm so glad to hear you're feeling better and making awesome progress on your gender journey! happy for you 🥰
Waah, I'm happy for you! <3 I feel like you know this, even if your ex gf and society tried to surpess it; you are totally worthy of calling yourself nb and trans, say it with me ""I'm worthy and valid"".
Amazing update!! Congratulations and I'm wishing you the best of luck and all the happiness with everything in your future😊
Youre doing amazing! Im proud of you! 

And dont worry about calling yourself non binary.
If it feels comfortable for decribing yourself go for it!
Both terms are umbrella terms that cover a great deal of different experiences! Non binary is simply not always fully feeling like your agab. Whether that is genderfluid, demi, a-gender etc.
Congrats! Sounds like you have already made huge steps in your journey! Never forget you have a whole community here to support you! 🏳️‍⚧️💕
Happy to hear you are doing better and have people who support you.

I am kinda questioning if I trans too but have not yet gone to talk to a mental health professional about this because I have not found a person who is openly LGBTQ supportive. Like gender dysphoria is still labeled as *mental illness* in my country.
Thank your for the update! I’m so happy to hear that things are looking up for you. I’m very happy that you’re able to stretch your wings and grow into yourself.
Keep being an amazing human being!
Radical Feminism isn't inherently transphobic, it is merely the belief that social restructuring as well as political laws are necessary to achieve feminism.
Quotas, the debate on the male gaze, the fight against gender norms and roles are all parts of radical feminism.
TERFs misinterpret radical feminism to their liking despite many radical feminist authors being trans-inclusive, please don't let them take away this tradition from actual real feminists.
And I'm glad you got red of her, she seems toxic asf.
YAY! So glad to hear you're doing better :)
I am very proud of you! It can be incredibly hard to leave the ones we love in order to move forward comfortably in our lives. I wish you happiness :)
Congratulations 🎉 and proud to read the edit 😊
I'm glad for you, cousin. I wish peace and happiness for you. That took courage and strength to get through. Be proud.
Hi, I commented on that post! So glad to hear you're in a better place now. I wish you the best on your gender journey ❤️
I didn’t see the original post but good on you for being able to break things off! Here’s to hoping your journey is a great one! 👍
 good thing u broke up with her
Good job taking this step for yourself. Proud of you.
You have earned this massive W. I admire your agency and taking control of your life. I wish nothing but blessings for you from here on out💖

Remember to love yourself, monarch🌺
🙌🏻
I love the double meaning here. Not only is monarch a nonbinary term for royalty but also a type of butterfly which is appropriate as well.

Idk why I'm tickled so much by this, but I am.

ninja edit: also, sorry if I'm being lame for literally explaining the joke, but it is too good for people to just scroll past.
I apologize for that. I thought radfem and terf were synonyms. But yes, my ex is trans exclusionary. I didn't want to date someone who say really bad things about people like me and make me feel unsafe to talk about my situation.
Agreed about radfem vs TERF. There *are* radical feminists who are trans-inclusive, and I worry that we run the risk of alienating them if we say radfem when referring to the TERFy ones.
unrelated but i love that DF avatar
You're right and you should say it. Radical feminism is a very cool thing that was co-opted by very hateful people
Not sure why you are getting downvotes for effectively saying the same thing I got upvoted for. Trans-inclusive radical feminists do exist, and not just in a soggy toast “well, I’m inclusive by not being exclusive” way. Many radical feminist ideas have contributed to our society(ies) becoming more accepting of gender binary non-conformity in the past several decades. Let’s not throw out the allies with the shitwater!
Oh it was GREAT for you to explain it, because I didn’t even know what I did there
I bet they've never read any actual radfem theory either, most theorists were hella pro trans.

And if they've read any, it's probably the idiots that wrote transsexual empire and the other idiots that started political lesbianism.

Of course!! All the skincare products are from The Ordinary.

Morning:
Couple drops of Hyaluronic Acid 2%
Let dry then apply vitamin C 23% 
Leave for 1-2 mins, then apply Natural Moisturising Factors

Night time:
Cleanse face in preferred way, pat dry.
 apply another couple drops of Hyaluronic Acid
 let dry, then apply Retinoid 2% in squarlane

I have very dry skin that needs a lot of rehydration, so it might not be the best routine for everyone! 

The foundation is a Korean brand called Klairs, and the blush is by Makeup Revolution!

I'm happy she accepted you that's awesome
happy for you!! :)
Congrats!! You look beautiful! She did a wonderful job with your makeup! So happy she’s there to help teach you and support you!!
Dude, how it cool it would be if a partner wanted to start using makeup for the first time, and you were the one who could teach them. So wholesome.
Thanks so wonderful!! I'm so excited for you!!!
Thanks! ☺️
Thanks!
Thanks! She’s really great at it. She said she was missing one of her lip products when she did them. I had a fun time posing lol
Thanks!!! :)
Thank you! 😃
Thanks!! 😃
Thanks. She’s the best.
Thanks! 😊
Thanks!
Thanks! She’s the best, and we both had a lot of fun.
Thanks!
She may have been missing lip liner? It's usually the secret to a clean overlined lipstick application. I've never figured it out, personally. I stick to lip gloss and lip tints when I use any lip product at all.

The new looks and I'm just happy I got it.		"That last outfit is so cute!!! Love the neutral androgynous vibes!!!!
i love how you did your eyes!
Idk what you’re going for so I don’t want to make you feel bad if this isn’t it... but that light dusting of stubble on the upper lip kinda ties the eye makeup down with the beard hair and makes it very cohesive, and the ear jewelry and headwear really bring it home. Pretty iconic, is what I’m trying to say here
Dem eyes 😍
You look gorgeous 😊😊😊
You look great!
Your eye makeup is fantastic, and I love your headwraps!
This sub has the best eye makeup 10/10 love the sherbet colors. 2nd outfit is super cool too.
how do you pick your outfits? you give up such put together vibes in everything you post! 10/10 gorgeous human all around
Eyeshadow is gorg and that last outfit is perfection!!
That dress is divine and you have a cat!! Can we pls see the cat??
Get you a them who can do both
You look OUTSTANDING
STUNNING!!
That beautiful eye make-up of yours really flatters your skin- and eye-tone!
oh your makeup is FIRE 🔥
I've tried to take away my hair and I hated it. I love my beard and mustache so I keep it will all the femme vibe.
Randomly finding them. It's all just random coincidence. Thrift shopping in my really old town helps though.
Femme facial hair is a valid femme look!!!!!!! Seriously though any way you slice it you’re killing the enby fashion dance, I know there’s some people who might be a little more timid who are going to see your look and feel some contact euphoria"	ngjckj	NonBinary	909	1.0	2021-05-19 22:36:37

It’s super dumb but after doing the Rory Gilmore book challenge I saw this and just, whatever, I did it expecting woman, because I’m afab and questioning and things, and I’m so happy right now yo don’t understand🥲😅		"It ain't stupid when it works (correctly).
I got “transgender” 

That’s…

I mean, I guess they got the spirit?
I got agender, which is the gender I identify myself. 
Now I’m suspicious that this test stalked me on reddit or read my texts.
I got cis. Guess hrt for 6 years and top surgery was for nothing
I'm cis apparently, good to know 👌
Everytime I see a quiz like this I just imagine:
""Question 1: What is your gender?""
Ok, I've been confused about my gender for some time and used to think I was binary transgender instead of enby, and I got trans on this test so my confusion kinda came back, I have to meditate and accept that it's just an online test lol
Got a link to the quiz?
It said I'm agender
I got transgender. I dislike quizzes like this with completely random questions and ""who would you date?"" lol no one. At least it didn't have a question about a song lyric!

&#x200B;

I'm glad it made you happy though.
i got ""cisgender"" lmao like even if it was true that wouldnt make any sense for a quiz answer since its so non-specific
I got CIS. F\*\*KING CIS. I'm gonna chug a bottle of bleach now /j.
I got trans... But I'm glad I didn't get cis? 😂
Glad you got some validation. I know these things are dumb but right before, and after coming out I was doing them a fair bit
I got nonbinary, but half my answers were random cuz they didn't apply to me lmao.
THE FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKED???
This one is fun too. The questions are a little more relevant, so even tho it's just another online quiz it'll get you thinking:

https://www.idrlabs.com/7-identities/test.php
I got nonbinary which felt very affirming even though it's an online quiz. I'm sure it's accurate 😉
I dunno mans (the test) said i was cisgender. Im very nb 🤣
Nonbinary here as well! Yay
Hm got agender. I’ll need to think about this!
Phishing.
I got agender…

I’m a non-binary femboy 🤣
I got non binary too but idk what I just did, from all the celebrities the only one I knew was Eliot Page
I got non-binary too, I feel so legitimated 💜
Oh this shit ACCURATE accurate
I got nonbinary too, which is accurate as far as I can tell!
You had me at Rory Gilmore. OG gender envy...
i got nonbinary too

im happy
Apparently Netflix=cisgender, Hulu=agender, and Disney+=nonbinary. So y'all better change your subscriptions to confirm your identity
I guess these silly quizzes can actually be kinda helpful in a way, cause the answer you’re secretly hoping for reveals a lot
The test said I was transgender which is... nope. No gender over here
 Mine was cis 💀 hell nah
Link?
I got Cisgender... which is half right I guess?
yeah you're right, it's a dumb inaccurate quiz because it claimed i'm cis >:(

i'd literally be happy with every other answer - nonbinary, agender, trans, i'm all of these - and yet, i somehow got the one i DON'T identify with??? bruh

half of the questions were not really applicable to me anyway. i don't actively use streaming services. all i know is i like the color blue. i'm also aromantic, so the last q was especially stupid, i tried to skip it but nah i was forced to pick.... 😒

glad others got validated through this though.
I'm shocked that worked. I blame/credit purple and Demi Lovato haha.
It's not stupid if it makes you feel happy and affirmed in your gender!!! Whatever works, y'know?? Things that make you feel good are never dumb or a waste
I got transgender, and I am, but that's not actually a gender at all.
It’s a bit like when they say to flip a coin if you have a decision to make - the outcome doesn’t matter but how you feel when you see which one got picked will tell you how you actually feel. Congrats and welcome <3
I got cis :(
Can I get the link to that quiz? Asking for... Uhhh a friend?
Telll me abouy I swear so many other quizes thought that I was Genderfluid or A Demi girl
one question was “what celebrity would you date” and i got confused because i couldn’t pick all of them
hey, what's the web name, I want to try it up
I hated this quiz as one of the questions was 'who would you date?' and I'm aroace with no intention of ever dating, but quizzes like this in general can be pretty fun.
Jokes On Them I Can't Even Guess My Gender With 100% Accuracy! I'll Give It Like 68%, That Sounds About Right, Maybe 70% On A Good Day.
I mean I’m still questioning but I was really happy when I got non binary! Also quick question: is enby ok or insulting? I’m really new, sorry🙈
Ehhh it kinda is, you’re not non-binary because a test told you you are you’re non-binary because you’re non-binary. That being said I’m glad it made OP happy
You are trans, nothing else. Just constantly fluctuating and moving
😂 maybe it just works really well for some people 🙈 or maybe it stalks people 🧐
I mean it’s not accurate. It was good for me, but it’s just a stupid test online asking the wrong kind of questions 🙈
I mean it’s not accurate. It was good for me, but it’s just a stupid test online asking the wrong kind of questions 🙈
Same 😭
🙈🥲
Me, too! I never knew. O.o
Sorry I didn’t mean to spread confusion 😑 it’s probably not that good anyway since it asks like four questions and one is about attraction! 🙈
tbf trans nonbinary is definitely a thing, but meditating is good for you anyway 😄
Yep, coming! It was a bit of a weird process because it was sponsored on a very different page, but here it is: [gender test](https://quiztest.me/en/test/6137.html?cat=LGBTQ&month=202209&type=normal)
Really like wtf do streaming apps have to do with gender 😭
I got cisgender too, but according to my flight attendant friend who sees thousands of people every week I'm the most masculine woman he ever saw. I guess I'm a man now?
Same
Don't worry fam, these tests are about as accurate as the quizilla website of decades past, obviously you're not cis lmao
same here this is why i hate these quizzes
Yeah, I feel the same. I know these things are dumb, but whenever they don’t say woman I feel so good. I should have noticed something sooner 🥲
My result was a tie between non-binary and agender. I’m confused now 😂
I like this one much more! I don't want to take a quiz that genders music taste and streaming platforms!
It’s really not, but I’m happy for you!
🤷🏻🙈
Same! 🧡
It’s not accurate, it’s mostly for fun, I was just happy I got non binary, you know? Also I think the only answer used is who would you date, and I would have chosen the option no one ever if there was one
In the comments… it’s one of the oldest
something something ""it's not the result that matters, it's how you feel about the result"" still rings very true i think
Must of us are ok with enby, though some people find it infantilizing
I love enby for myself but some people find it infantilizing. Using it for yourself is fine, and as a group is usually ok but check with individuals
Personally, I’m not 100% convinced when it comes to the term “enby”, but it’s the only term that’s kind of the equivalent of “man” or “woman” but for non-binary people and I don’t like calling myself “non-binary person” in most contexts because it’s so long.
I got validatet, so it's pretty correct
Not inaccurate lol
I hope it’s the first option. I don’t want to be stalked by someone
Pretty disappointed they couldn't tell my gender identity based off my choice of streaming platform and favorite color lol
Don't worry, I just found out I'm still and maybe will always be questioning myself, and that's not necessarily a bad thing!
Lol I also got non-binary

Are we all just a hivemind or something? Do we all answer it exactly the same?
i got transgender.... which is not a gender lol
First time through answering honestly I got nonbinary. 

Then when I answered using the least favorable answer I got ""Cisgendered.""
I got agender, not true at all lol. I am overflowing with gender
yeah this was not accurate for me. I got agender which is not right. I am Non-binary trans masculine. So no thanks. Plus in my personal experience I am the only one who can determine what is right for me. No quiz online can ever do that. I have found being on a subreddit like this and just reading other people's experiences in life and how they feel has been the most helpful in discovering how I feel. It's pretty wild when a post or the comments on a post jump out at you as if this random person in the internet were discribing you exactly but only talking about themselves. Like  wait a second.... Someone else feels this way. *Gasp*😱
The only problem for me with that test was the dating question since I'm aromantic.

Anyway i got agender which is pretty accurate. So i guess my answer based on asthetic still worked
I got cis, which is just not true.
I had multiple options on a few so i did both and both came back as agender, interesting 🤔
Lol I got agender that ain’t it probably
Oh I know, it’s just always this way so it’s infuriating xD
I like enby/enbie as a substitute for ""girl"" or ""boy"". I use nonbinary where I'd use ""woman"" or ""man"" for binary people. Except I prefer it as an adjective rather than a noun, while enbie works fine as a noun
Thanks ☺️
The thing is, I used Enby because NB already has a fairly common use. NonBlack. And thus since enby is recognized as nonbinary, I am fine with giving the NB Tag to the bipoc community use
Thanks ☺️
Same. Also, I got non binary and I’m still questioning.
Actually, probably same!
If you switch black and blue for colours it stays non binary, I know because I tried
lmao same. got agender when im really gender fluid between *kinda* girl but not, just straight up neutral and *ELDRITCH ABOMBINATION*
I got cis.
It’s not accurate
If we weren't questioning we wouldn't be making those quizzes I guess lol
I picked purple lol

Now I wonder what the percentages are.
Obviously, I am well aware that you can't guess anyone's gender from whether they like Hulu or HBO Max, it just stings a little in an irrational way ok :(
Welp. Maybe they use the other answers and or say to most non binary because it’s an umbrella term? But then they would probably use trans most. Who did you choose for date?
Yeah, I get it, like it’s irrational that I felt good 🙈
I chose the only one I know out of the four, pfft

Happy New Years to me!! This gentlethem is feeling particularly euphoric about my gender marker being changed on my license!		"[deleted]
Wooo! Also, thanks for introducing me to the word ""gentlethem"" :)
That's so amazing!!
I can't wait to do this. Maine just recently made this a thing! Happy New year
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/nL3ITWG. 

okay, in all seriousness I'm so happy for you, congrats!!! :))
Just looked up the form in my state and the only options are Male and Female ugh! So glad you got to change yours and hoping my state changes their forms in 2020! 😇
[deleted]
Congratulations I'm so happy for you. And Happy New Year and decade, I hope the following years bring you lots of joyful moments and good fortune 😁
I want this so badddd. Can I ask what state are you in? Does every state allow you to change your gender to X?
Ayo they just came out with the new model of sex: Sex X.
Congratulations! I hope my state does this eventually, but given I live in Kentucky, I doubt it'll happen anytime soon.

I do wish they'd change it from sex to gender though.   
Sex= your biological makeup (usually what's in your pants, unless you've had bottom surgery)   
Gender= between your ears.
Congrats, this is wonderful!!!
Just had mine changed as well😍😍 got it in the mail last week!!
Fuck yeah! It's coming to my state next year as well I think.
Whoooaaaaa - congrats!
Congrats! I’m going into the passport office in the next few weeks to get a X. I’m super excited tbh.
That's awesome
This is great! Why does your license expire next month?
I got my license changed to X many months ago and every time I see it in my wallet it makes me smile
🥺🥺🥺🥺 i want this
Congrats!! I’m kinda in a pickle since I get my license this month but I wanna come out so I can get the X on my license. I think I’ll honestly just settle for the M for now
Congrats
You are very strong and very brave and I am so proud of you.
Dang you’re short
For real, I might loose my license, for separate issues, then I won’t have that problem anymore. Still got to come out to my family tho.

I keep reading it as ""Bethlehem"".
It was just that easy! I went in with a gender form that I had gotten on the DMV website, marked x, and they changed it! Got a new photo taken and they will be sending my license card in a few weeks. It was $27 for me.
There are only a few states right now, so you’ll have to check in your state! The only ones I personally know of right now that have a non-binary “X” option are Washington and California, but I know there’s most likely others. So check! I hope they have the option for you, and if not, I hope that changes in the New Year ❤️
SexBox One X
I'd say sex= your chromosomes(however not always because of intersex people), and

gender= between your ears.

Otherwise I totally agree.
Thank you! Also, you would not believe how aggressively I read your username
The paper license does, once my actual ID comes in it will be longer :)
Yes, the height dysphoria is strong within me
[deleted]
Thank you so much!
Starting today (2020) New Hampshire is on that list
Minnesota also allows for an X marker - it's all just self selected, when you go in for a renewal
I know someone who just got theirs changed to NB in Indiana this year
There are a whole bunch of states! And countries! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_recognition_of_non-binary_gender
Oregon does as well! I really want to get mine changed too
But sex is more than just chromosomes
Deedee never learns. Shes always messing with me experiments and get in the way of my science
Ahh, that makes sense.

my friend bought some pins for me! the flag isn't known to many people where I live and nobody cares about my pronouns anyways but just having these after so many years of being non-binary makes me feel happy		"I wore a enby pride mask when taking public transport today and yeah its pretty obvious that almost nobody knows what the flag is. To most people it's just a bunch of cool colors I guess. I did notice 1 person staring at it with a big smile on their face though, that felt nice.
[not a phase](http://etsy.me/2iX64Ly)

[nb flag](https://etsy.me/2LH36Ja)

i didn’t see that particular pronoun pin, but there are a ton of great ones on etsy, and never buy from aliexpress because they often do cheap knockoffs of etsy artists without giving them credit
Where can I buy these op?
I love the not a phase one :D
I want all of these.
Yesss
I would like to get ALL of these for my partner. Do you have the link or shop name?
Super cute
the pronouns pin is awesome!!
that's so sweet! I definitely don't expect anyone to recognise what the flag means but I know it always makes me so happy and excited to see anyone wear something I know is pride-related in public, so if I can give anyone that kind of feeling, that'll be more than enough for me :)
my friend said she got them all from AliExpress, she's about to go to bed (she's in NZ) but said she'll try to find links when she gets up :)
I've seen very similar pins on Etsy.
SAME! As a bisexual who follows.....unorthodox religions, this pin fits me so well.
if you check the comment above yours there's links for the flag and not a phase pins, I don't have the exact links my friend used yet (she's still asleep) but I agree with what someone said about how there's very similar ones on Etsy that are even better to buy since you can support small creators that way :)
Thx
Thank you friend! I appreciate that and will definitely check Etsy as well (:"	img4fz	NonBinary	892	1.0	2020-09-04 13:41:06

Happy Nonbinary People’s Day! It’s been a gradual journey but I’m so happy how far I’ve come - and to be in awesome company... cheers, my siblings. 🤗💕		"You're really just living the nonbinary dream here arentcha? Looking gorgeous and having a shit ton of plants. Do you already own the cat or is that a necessary enby purchase you will make in the future? XP

Also, hurray for Enbyday! ✨👾
Please ignore the lack of enby colors in the post. 😅😓
I don’t know what I love more - that fabulous outfit, your incredible plant collection, or the incredibly joy you are radiating!
This is such a wonderful joyful pic 🤗
the sun isn’t half as bright as you are 🌞🌞🌞
Ugh I LOVE your dress 💕
I love everything about this picture so much. Your plant game is so strong!
Wow!!! 🔥
wow 😍 you are radiant!
I strive to have this kind of gorgeous energy, y'all are absolutely stunning!
I'm amazed  how you were able to pull off this rainbow gown look so flawlessly. What an inspiration!
I love your outfit
So cute!!!
You are positively radiant. That glow puts even the loveliest of your plants to shame! (No offense, plants.)
Beautiful!!
I’m trying! Oh, and I have TWO kitties! 😁
the abundance of plants more than make up for it
🤗💕
🤗💕
Aww shucks 🥰
It’s a two piece number from Target! $5 for the top and $5 for the bottom (they’re both supposed to be tutus)!
I’m trying! It’s been quite the journey! 🌱
Quick, get the fire extinguisher! Haha 🤗
That’s what gender euphoria looks like!
Isn't that just the neatest. It's like the perfect enby life right there!
I’m that case, I’ll get more! 🌱🌳
omg Target for the win again, so many of my dresses are from there, I might have to go back when I get paid Friday 😁"	hr4cwj	NonBinary	882	1.0	2020-07-14 16:11:30
Growing My Hair Out Was My First Step And I'm So Happy I Took It		"This is my first post in the sub, so here is a little about me:

I am genderfluid. They/Them  
I am African American, I was born with albinism.

I just turned 31 and my last haircut was six years ago.  

Deciding to grow out my hair out was a massive step for me, especially after I spent my entire childhood being dragged off to the barbershop  because my father didn't think that one who was AMAB should have long hair. The trauma and dysphoria from these experiences have kept me out of the barber's seat for over half a decade. It made me feel like my body wasn't my own and that it didn't matter how I wanted to present myself, but how society felt I should present myself simply because of what was between my legs. I spent far too much of my life presenting as strictly masculine, always feeling as if I was not my full and true self. 

&#x200B;

Looking in the mirror and seeing my hair always gives me so much life, because it reminds me of the power and agency I took back.
You look like a demi-god/dess
Try photographing yourself against a dark background next time, that'll really make your hair stand out!
You are beautiful. I think you're absolutely breathtaking. And I hope you share your lovely hair (and lovely self) with us often!
Your blonde fro is amazing, your beard is amazing, and so is your taste in music! Keep being your beautiful self!
Your hair on that background looks like a supercritical fluid, and I’m honestly jealous 💛
Youre such a beautiful little cloud
Congrats on this step! You look lovely
The hair growth and beard — I love it! Continue on this journey to find yourself and explore different ways to express yourself ❣️
I have a deep affinity and appreciation for people with albinism and vitiligo. I find it to be very unique and beautiful. Therefore you are unique and beautiful. Thank you for sharing yourself.
Ethereal beauty
Hey, fellow person with albinism here :)

Your hair looks amazing, you totally rock that look!
Hello beautiful person! Thank you so much for sharing with us.
Oh yeah I'm so happy for you! Also it looks good!!!
Hey!! You are so beautiful and ethereal, I'm so happy for your hair finally being able to bloom without it being cut against your will. Also a Nirvana fan <3
One step closer to the beautiful, ethereal cloud you were always meant to be. Shine on, friend!
so cool! love seeing an African American person here with albinism. i don’t see them much and it’s just so cool to see.
Must be my eyes but I cannot see your hair against that background 😭
ooooo what do you plan to do with it?? sorry if im wrong  I have bad eyes but it looks like you have a nice mane going friend !
You look beautiful!!
You look amazing! I'm sure you get that all the time, but it needs saying. :)
I love your eyes! The darkness of them really shines through the lightness of the rest of your hair, which I'm sure will look really fabulous at the length you want! (＾ｕ＾)
Your hair is fabulous! I really like how fluffy it seems, the colour really compliments it a lot.
Btw your eyes are gorgeous.
I also love Nirvana and have trauma memories about having my hair cut against my will. My dad didn't take us to the barber, just sat us in the kitchen and chopped off my sweet sweet curls. 

Happy to have you here. Your hair is really pretty.
I plan to do modeling as a hobby, I'll make that one of my themes!
A demi-deity!
Oh, I definitely plan to!
Hey! I'm always pleasantly surprised to meet another one.
I variety of things, for the short term I ant to grow it just past collarbone length and ""train"" to be more curly. My final, permanent hairstyle will be mohawk dreads.

Can I borrow some of your coolness because you clearly have it in abundance.
Love this outfit!
You look great!!
I was trying to achieve a perfect genderqueer look this morning and it’s hilarious to me that my outfit is almost identical to yours in this pic, as well as our matching short curly hair.
That outfit is so powerful wow
Fucking goals holy shit I love your hair
oh my god I love your hair and those pants

The hair is crazy wicked itself but silver?!? Badass.

Happy Pride😍		"Your shirt is so cute!!
WHERE DID THAT SHIRT COME FROM??? Also wow you're cute!!
Woah I need that shirt!!
Omg that's such a cute shirt???? I need it!!!
I want that shirt! 

Except I can’t wear it  because I’m albino, and some of us refer to ourselves as “bino” so it would be confusing lol 

Wait, does that make me a “bino non-bino-saur”? Fun. 😅
Love the facepaint and the leather arm brace
Im a geologist and have this shirt and I love it haha.
I’m obsessed with your look. Happy pride!!!
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
THAT IS AN AMAZING SHIRT
That shirt is cute as hell I weep
Awww tyyy!!!
[removed]
Aww thank you😍

And Amazon 😤😤
there are other sites that have it but they didn't have it big enough for me which is why I had to get it from Amazon
[removed]
Get it and we can be twins
Unfortunately I got it from Amazon because other sites didn't have it in my size. 
I believe there's another site that has it as a coffee mug
Omg lmao. So I guess you are a super ultra cool version? 
But cool puns aside if you like it you should totally get it
I even painted my nails
Thank you! I loved it too lol
That's AWESOME
Awww ty!!! 😍😍😭😭
Thank youuuuu

Fuck off, scammer. (Check their nonexistant post history peeps)
Ah the joys of being big and trying to find anything good that fits you. I know this well :,)
i know lookhuman.com has some really cute ones!! i think they have a similar design to this :)
Thanks! Unfortunately struggling to find a UK stockist :/
⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆️   

**/u/BarbaraJenningsd is a fake spammer account**

**This applies to mugs/posters/etc...**

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.  

The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print. 

Be careful, friends!
Are you familiar with Pokémon? I often refer to myself as a shiny human. It’s more fun. Hehe. But yeah, this shirt is tempting af
Can we see them?
Fuck off.
There are spaces in the URL, which means it isn't a real URL. They would either be escape characters or underscore. Plus, to avoid [this sort of thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) you should always hover over any links. In this case, it doesn't lead to the invalid URL it supposedly does.
Maybe they actually just made this account? I think a welcome is more welcoming than a fuck off, if you can’t be certain.
Oof. It's a struggle. 

""It ain't easy being this cheesy""

""It's never quick to be this THICC""
Thank you for the tip!!
Oh my Lord I was thinking the same thing! You are a blessing.
Sure!
Oh hey, I didn't even notice that. I just recognize the layout of the site they use. (notably the timer)
I'm very certain. It's an incredibly common and well documented scam on reddit that always uses those same timed vendor services in threads where people show off t-shirts.
Lmao thank you! Great minds think alike!

Just being happy has our enemies losing their game huh, that makes me feel powerful.
Heck yeah, stick it to em!
Wow ❤️
You look lovely❤️
Ok but your eye makeup omg it's so pretty

Also let's make JKR mad by being happy, yes <3 Terfs can suck my *[insert pure chaos]*
Ahh gosh, you remind me of a person I see going around all the time that's on tiktok. They have longer hair but a really soothing voice and this image and caption reminded me of them 🥺❤ I wish I knew their username, I'd link it here.
ofc, it's my fave sport~  
   
And omg, I just saw your IG post. Small World 😆  
  
PS: Your makeup skills are on pointttt

This makeup is so pretty WOW really suits your features especially your lovely mystical eyes! you look great <3
Being happy and smiling at people all day makes it that much more difficult for anyone to criticize me for being me.

Happiness as solid as rock is definitely not something bigots would want to punch.
Hottie 🔥
100% right
I wear black eyeliner and nail polish, sometimes short shorts. It’s fun to see some transphobes looked at me angrily. Also you look great, I love the facial hair especially.
Well, that's a good reason to smile. :D
aww thank you so much!! 

hells yeah, it does; it knocks them off their rhythm.

I recently found out they have wedding jumpers, and I'm not much into suits, but dont want to end up in a dress, I'm so happy.		"I just told my husband that we need to get married again so I can wear this 😍
I recently went to a wedding dress place and talked to a lady about how to get these since I dont want a jumpsuit (the long flowy legs). Basically she told me to find pants to wear and bring them in then they would simply add the top of a dress and a train to recreate the look
This is so cool!!
I'm only down for this if there's a crotch zip so I don't have to get fully nude to pee! With short rompers you can just pull the crotch to the side but with long ones its the WORST I just want them to have a pee zipper like a ""mens"" one would have but with the tighter ""womens"" cut to the garment. Then at the least I could use my pee funnel >:/
That’s flippin awesome
hell ya! that rocks! When or if I get married I'ma get a jumper.
Where did you find this/where is it sold? And do you know how much it runs???
What company makes that one. Love it
It's absolutely beautiful! Glad you found something you could wear to a wedding that is comfortable for you!
hell yeah! do you know who designed this dress?
I love that!
OMG yesh. I didnt know thats what they called them... I called them pant suits with capes. It will be so much easier to find now!! (Congrats on your wedding)
That is fuckin GORGEOUS!
Both you and the jumper look amazing
Holy Smokes! Breathtaking 😍
Holy Shit I had no idea these existed!!! You look amazing :D
So friggin CHIC!!! Love.
I used to tell my mom I wanted a wedding dress with pants underneath so I could pull off the dress and dance in a suit at the reception...should’ve known then. 😂
Oh my god yes
I love it! You look so nice with it.
I saw it on facebook so sadly I dont know. I just saved the photo so I could see if I could get it commissioned later for me.
I sadly dont know. :/
I am officially calling them that from now on because that's way better. 
I am not getting married yet, this is just a photo I stumbled upon on facebook, and I thought a lot of people on this sub would like in case they felt stuck themselves! :) thank you regardless though! :)
that's a photo from the clothing website, no? not a pic of OP :)
Could be lol its early lmao
It's not me, it's just the model, but I absolutely adore the design!! :D
It is the photo from the website I saw it on, but regardless the model is pretty as well! :)"	dnpuau	NonBinary	842	1.0	2019-10-27 06:39:45

Happy Thursday! New pinnie dress, no makeup cos I don't feel like it. This is today's comfortable. I am masculine, I am feminine, I am me. Hope you are having a great day being yourself, or planning to be yourself xx		"your colorful neklace and shirt combination looks lovely!
Love it 💖
Thank you for being yourself and empowering others to do so. All that while looking great! Have a wonderful day yourself
Thats a super cute and really age appropriate outfit! I dig it!
Aww, your necklace and earrings look so cute!! And you have such a lovely smile, I can see the confidence and self-love! Thanks for sharing <3
looks great !!! fabulous
That shirt/dress combo is EVERYTHING I love it. So happy you found today’s comfortable :) finding that every day can be hard.
Love you pure and beautiful soul
You look like somone ik
That blue is 1000% your color. Makes your eyes just POP
nice fit! hope you have a great day!
You look awesome! And it gives me hope to see people like me when can't be myself

I am loving it! You rock that fit!
That is so well composed. Even approaching that level of style is a life goal.
not only do you look great but your title is so great. sometimes i spend too much time worrying about how i'm presenting to other people but it's so important to recognize that it's just me. thank you so much and i hope you have a lovely day ♡
I know a lot of times we focus on fashion as a way to express ourselves, but I've just got to say:

The most beautiful thing you're wearing is that smile. Absolutely stunning.
Thank you so much. Necklace was from my lovely other half. I think it's really pretty, and it's special cos it was a gift xx
Oh thank you. I'm still not used to seeing how I look, but this helps to normalise it xx
Thank you so much, you lovely human bean! Feeling kind of warm and fuzzy today. X
Well thanks so much! There is not much about me that is age, or anything appropriate, so it's nice to hear 😊
Thank you so much, kind human! Got my ears pierced a few weeks back. When they have fully healed, I'll be able to have some fun! Have yourself a great day xx
Thank you, kind and excellent person! Xx
Thanks, I appreciate it xx It can be hard sometimes,  but the feeling when everything comes together (in your head, more than clothing) is worth any aggravation. Have a great day x
Thank you! Have yourself a lovely day xx
Well, maybe I am...I am a real person 😁. I'm in York, UK. Is that possible?
That's really sweet of you, thanks so much! Have a delightful day xxx
Thank you so much....and you too!
Thanks so much! I was just like you a few short months ago, so there absolutely is hope, and I myself took heart from other people on here. I don't know your circumstances, but can I make one respectful suggestion? I bet there is one small thing which you could do which would be affirming for you and a reminder of your intended journey....but would be little or not at all noticeable to others. Find that thing and try it! Even if the journey is long, careful and slow, you might feel better for starting it? Best of luck xx
Well that's super kind, thank you. I have taken so much comfort from other people here, so that's nice of you. Have a great day xx
Oh, thanks you so much, kind human! Xx
Thanks so much! I love my colours, and just occasionally the mishmash aligns 😁. Have a lovely day xx
Thank you so much! Yes, you are just you in all your non binary / genderfluid glory. We don't need to be something else, we can just enjoy however we want to be. Btw I fully respect people who want to pass as their preferred gender, and understand how important it is. It's just some of us like the fly the flag  for the confusing, messy, glorious middle way 😁
Now that is a really kind thing to say, thank you sweetie xx
Yes I think you look great and fab. I’m looking for a pinafore dress myself at the mo, always loved the look. Xx
also, just noticed your username ! i luv ferrets :3
Well no, I live in Canada, but you do look alot like someone ik lol. But you also look great
Thanks so much I'll try!
Never tried one before, I like it! Good luck in your search...it's fun to look 😀
But not feisty ones, only the calm peaceful ones 🤣🤣🤣
As long as I look like someone you know who isn't some kind of monster, then thats ok 😁. Have a lovely day xx

You’re so lucky! Mine just shipped from Maryland, so it’ll be a while till it gets to me.
that's amazing!!! I'm so happy for you!!!!
It looks completely natural on you, bud! I would not have guessed that you wear a binder because flat just seems to me like what is natural to you lol.
Isn’t it a good feeling when you try on a minimizer or binder and turn to your side and see....open space? 

Is it comfortable to breathe in this one?
I know we have never met but I've known at least 2 people who look eerily close to identical to you.
You look a lot like a cis guy I know
you look so handsome!
Nice! Congrats! 💛🤍💜🖤
Oh my goodness - I just woke up to so many messages of support. Thank you all so much
Thanks handsome ;)
It’s like an extreme version of a sports bra that compresses the chest area, so that AFAB people can look more masc
Thank you. I hope you can get one soon :)
Thanks!
Thanks. I hope you do get one for Christmas :)
Thanks :)
Yeah, it’s a great feeling. It’s surprisingly comfortable and easy to breathe in actually but I didn’t wear it for very long so I guess I’ll see if that changes

My bright yellow graduation outfit proved popular when I posted it here a few weeks ago, so I thought I might as well post my graduation photo wearing it! Hearing the announcer read out my preferred name made me so happy :D		"that's fantastic and i appreciate you dyeing your hair to match. once i get my court order i'm gonna see if my university will issue me another copy of my degree.
KICK ASS!
Congrats ! You look hella cool ! Rocking that yellow hair ! 💛
Damn, I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone pull off bright yellow hair like that, but you rock it! You look cool as hell.
That is a great color and cut on you! 🤩💛
Congrats!!! I got my name anounced as Mx. [Chosen name] when I graduated in 2019, even though I don't have anything legal done yet, and it was great!! It even says it on my diploma!!

Again, congrats on graduation!!
So much positivity in this picture!  Happy for you!
It seems the lemons have evolved congratulations!
Nice! Congrats! I remember my graduation split us up between genders (color and sides to sit at) smh. Ruined my graduation lol. Yellow hair with the yellow & black looks sick
Congratulations on graduating; you look awesome!
Congrats! You look amazing!!
you look so badass. I’ve been thinking about switching up my pink hair to yellow and it looks so cool on you that I’m even more tempted now
I've actually had the yellow hair for 3 years, bought the suit to match that! Good luck with your court order, I was actually told that I could get my name on my diploma without one but I am in the UK so maybe it's different :D

I do lots of handstands, and variations on them. I don't really have a routine, I just do whatever exercises I feel like at the time :3. I do do this every day. You don't have to train daily, but for my sport specifically training every day is my best option :3.

gotta love spreading support and love 😵‍💫		"When I first came out as non-binary, I was all like, ""No, the goatee is staying!"" And it did, until I got a sudden rush of dysphoria looking in the mirror one day and shaved before I even thought it through. But that's me, and I love it when enbies show off their makeup and dresses with their full beards. What works for them does not work for me, but nobody should be able to force that on them because \*I\* got dysphoria over it. I'm now getting to the point where I don't have to shave every time I leave the house, and I can accept that even now, as a trans femme enby, I will have stubble for half the week.

(My skin hates shaving, but I'm 52, grey, and laser and IPL do not work on grey hair, and ain't nobody got money for electrolysis!)
He also completely disregards that there are non-binary people and that they  may have a different experience than binary trans people.

I personally don't want to pass as anything. I want to go on hormones and have top surgery and look like a 'typical man', looking like a woman gives me a lot of dysphoria. But I'm still non-binary. I just want to pass as myself and that is how I feel I should look like. I don't want to be seen as a binary man though. 

Everyone is different :)
I hate my body and you don’t hate yours and I’ve decided that’s a you problem!!
Sure, having a beard will generally make people assume someone is a man. That doesn't mean that person cannot be trans tho, wtf?
Someone took all the yikes pills this morning.

And they seem to be confusing societal associations with certain human anatomy with gender presentation. The two do influence each other but - buddy get this - some cis women grow facial hair and choose not to shave it. 

Let’s also not overlook intersex people here.

As a general rule, don’t push your opinions, beliefs or expectations on what someone does with their body or feels about their body onto anyone.

In any situation.

Ever.
How can one be trans and gatekeep being able trans? They ain’t even good at it ffs
Ciswomen develop beards. PCOS and genetics are a huge factor in hair growth, like wtf. This needless policing of gender dysphoria.
Truscum are so sad. They really hate themselves and refuse to let go of internalized transphobia. They’re like maybe if I flog myself hard enough the cishet normativity boot will step on me less. Newsflash, the bills trying to keep us out of bathrooms and sporting don’t have a note in parentheses that says (except truscum). 

I feel bad for them honestly. Trans joy is everything, they should try it sometime.
Oh cool. I love it when idiots act like they know what they’re taking about (sarcasm). Sorry you had to deal with that. :\
I love it how people without medical degrees think they can define and diagnose a complex condition like gender dysphoria and then describe --completely-- how it impacts someone with it.And then, as they lose their shit when they get called out, tell everyone *else* lhow stupid they are. Um...? Good times.
I don't get how you can feel more comfortable in your skin 😡 (basically)
I'm sick of hearing that trans people have to hate themselves to be trans. It's an act of self-love and authenticity to transition, not a symptom of how much we hate ourselves. Many trans ppl experience dysphoria but our identities aren't defined by that
The fuck? Oh, I I've looked at the cost benifit analysis of surgery and hormones and decided even the best case scenario results don't justify that ordeal *in my personal case*, and there's some comfort to be found in working with/claiming the body I'm stuck with. Guess my identity is fake.
Some days I don't have chest dysphoria. Some days I do. I stopped HRT cause well money and I just am comfortable with the permanent changes. I Sometime wear dresses, skirts and makeup.
Does this make me not trans now? 
Idk why this person is sitting there saying you must hate you body the same way I do to be trans. Like tf?
Some people experience things differently. No need to gatekeep like that. I think they need to do some self reflection.
average r\truscum user
Ah, truscum! 

Yeah, I don’t have voice dysphoria, I’m still trans. 

I mean, I’ve got dysphoria in plenty of ways. It just hits different for all of us. Doesn’t matter though as far as being trans. We’re still trans! 

Nothing that person can do about it. I suppose they could get mad. They can grasp as hard as they can to patriarchal ideas of gender. They can say some folks don’t belong if they don’t fit their idea of “trans-ness.” 

Seems a bit exclusionary to me. Weird, I think there is an acronym we use for a group of anti-trans folk with that word in it, “exclusion.” Huh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s “radical” of me to compare them to a group who is supposed to be inclusive of trans folk by definition of their own ideology, but then feel threatened because trans-ness is too “different.”

Either way, folks who don’t have dysphoria who are trans are still gonna be trans! Nothing they can do about it. That at least brings me comfort. I suppose the point is, you’re valid. And so is every lovely trans person who deals with dysphoria in a nuanced way, or not at all!
As a fellow trans with a beard I appreciate you <3
For me, I mainly have dysphoria from my voice being masculine and me just have hair around almost everywhere making me feeling like a gorilla (other big dysphoria areas for me where my feet and the thing between my legs) but I’m fine with having nipples so I’m just in a weird position.
I think the word for people who believe that you can only be trans if you have dysphoria is transmeds or something and they're dumb af.
Don't bother arguing with transmeds. They're idiots.
*you gotta love the truscums...*
Well, they are just being ididotic, because, that is how you want to look and you look fab all the time so never listen to them and keep being the amazing you you are!
I’ll be the first to say that I used to believe that too, I thought that others identities somehow invalidated my own. But actually through Brennen Beckwith’s videos where they spoke out about Kalvin Garrah and his gatekeeping of what it means to be trans, I realised this mindset was the reason it took me so long to come out as nonbinary. Because I thought not wanting hrt (at the time) meant that my dysphoria couldn’t possibly be real. But I was struggling severely. This person is unfortunately still stuck with this thought process. Hurt people hurt people. All we can do is love and support each other and hope that light we create can help guide those through their pain. May be cringy to say it like that, but that’s how I feel. 💜
OP just wanted to say I’m sorry you went through this. No one should ever invalidate your identity or experience, ESPECIALLY within our own community.
I recently realized I’m non-binary. First thing I did was shave my beard off. Instantly knew it was the wrong move and it’s coming back. Everyone’s different.
Crazy when people think the point of being trans is to “pass.” Some of us will never pass, some of us don’t care to, it shouldn’t be a requirement to hate our bodies and be scared to present however we feel comfortable
I truly empathize with people who have extreme dysphoria but how can you not understand everything is on a spectrum and some people will not have the same level of dysphoria as other people. Also I'm sure these same people have no issue with cis women not shaving if they can grow facial hair.
Man if facial hair automatically makes you male I wonder what this person thinks of all the folks with PCOS who have sensitive skin and cant shave. 🤔 But in all seriousness, I do hope this person eventually understands that the trans experience is very personal and therefore very different for each individual.

Heck, I'm a femme presenting enby with PCOS who's currently pregnant. That didn't stop my euphoria from being told by my partner an outfit I was wearing was very masculine the other day. Some days I'm okay with my facial hair, others I hate it. 

People like that are sad and bitter and I always hope they get the growth and maturity to learn and grow to be better people.
I honestly will never understand why they think wanting to pass is a requirement to be trans

Their logic doesn't hold up the moment you try to apply them to cis people. a cis woman can look like a man, have muscle, never shave and have masculine hobbies, and even produces more testosterone than average and no one will question her if she's actually a woman

A cis man who likes to wear make up? That's just a regular guy. A trans man that likes make up? A trans trender how dare he engages in anything remotely feminine
nbs must wear gray jumpers, clear nail polish (no colors! no bare nails!) Medium length hair, a SMALL tasteful brass pride flag pin, exactly ONE tennis weight gold necklace, an analog watch with brown leather strap and sensible shoes.   


such a great idea to just end up inventing another wretched set of random gender standards as if two were not enough.
Hot take: concepts of ""passing"" as a trans person are rooted in western patriarchal beauty standards and should be rejected as a necessary step for transition. (That is to say, if it's something you want - go for it. But it is not going to be a part of everyones journey.) There are cis people that ""look"" like the opposite gender naturally and don't identify as such. Are they less cis? Objectively, no. They ARE likely to be ridiculed for their appearance and made fun of regardless for being too masculine or too feminine or incongruous with their AGAB. ""(*""But wait!! I thought gender is what's in your pants!? Why do transphobes ridicule non-passing cis people?""* Because it was never actually about sex and gender, it is about power and marginalization and ""othering"".)

Nobody owes anyone a specific appearance, and if someone is happy with who they are, despite whether or not their appearance lines up with the beauty standard picture of that specific identity, then they are doing a lot better than most people on earth in terms of self esteem - cis, trans, or otherwise.

This is more or less how I've come to make peace with being a non-passing trans person who is likely to never ""pass"".
I really don’t get it why some people are so idiotic. They have no idea what other people go through in their lives and want to tell them how to live, what to do and what not.

If someone thinks they are trans, so, let them **be** that. I mean who better to know than the person in question? Why not just let them discover their lives, and at most, help them when help is asked for.

Come on, we are all trying to muddle through this thing called “live”. It didn’t come with a manual, you know, we all have to figure this “thing” out ourselves…

I wish people would just leave others in peace. So, what if that said person discovers, after some time, that they are, indeed, **not** trans? So, f***ing what? Did they take something away from me? No! Did they hurt me? No! So, WTF???

Sorry for the rant. This just drives me really, really crazy from time to time.

Love you all.
🥰😘
Isn’t it weird how cis people just get to be cis, but we have to go through all these different tests?
Your perception of someone is within your own control. So, when someone asks to be perceived a certain way, it is up to you to have the personal integrity to respect their best wishes. Misgendering, both unintentional and intentional, is always the fault of the perceiver. It just matters whether or not you can take accountability for your faults. Remember that trans people owe the world nothing. Men don't owe masculinity, women don't owe femininity, and enbies don't owe androgyny.
I BELIEVE THIS “…” THEREFORE EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE!!! OTHERWISE UR A FRAUD IF U DONT AGREE WITH MUHHH - *them* (mwuahaha)
""To be a part of our club, you have to hate every waking moment of your life while also encouraging others like us to do the same. If you fall outside of these very narrow parameters, at best you're a faker, at worst you're just trying to fuck us.""
Ah trans meds. I can't imagine how shit they must feel about themselves with that shitty world view.

I'm guessing this is a mainstream LGBT subreddit?
People get dysporic over diffrent things too.
If someone is totally okay with a beard but get disporic about certain clothes thats the same experience but from difrent thing.

Also gender roles are not the same as gender.

And trans and nb people dont owe you shit. They dont need to look a certain way to be valid.

Feeling comfortable is a just as valid goal as passing as a certain gender.
Them: ''YOU CAN'T BE A FEMALE IF YOU DON'T FEEL DYSPHORIC ABOUT YOUR BEARD!!!!!1!!!1''

Cis women with beards who don't mind having facial hair: hhmmm
Lmao it's like ""sorry my idea of being nonbinary doesn't include looking youthful and completely androgynous."" Some of us have no intentions with gender presentation at all. Idgaf if you say I'm a woman, man, alien, or whatever. I just want to exist outside of the stupid gender binary that society likes to push. Gendering myself feels like gendering a coffee table or a toaster, you could, it just feels out of place. I feel human and I do have dysphoria, but that hardly has anything to do with giving a fellow human the respect of not shitting on them or telling them how they feel is objectively wrong. All feelings are objectively true and it's stupid we have had to spend generations justifying them. It's created a culture that makes it so we have to justify already true statements, it's redundant and doesn't make any sense to me. 

That's not even including the conversation in privlage. I couldn't even afford gender affirming care if I wanted it right now. I have $0 to spend on surgery, laser hair removal, and hormones. I live in a state that doesn't even cover a breast reduction on medicaid so that's not a viable route either. 

It's so weird how much people can't just let other people be happy and live their life without some sort of criticism or bitter words.
Found out my cousin was like them. They started to deadname my best friend because ‘he wasn’t transitioning fast enough so he must be pretending.’ I already didn’t talk to her much but when my bff told me that I have blocked her and told my family that I won’t attend anything she is at.
I hate my facial hair so I'm always happy for an enby who likes there's lol
Literally got bullied back into the closet by a terrible trans person like this one when I was 14 bc I didn't have dysphoria (ofc I didn't, I was a child with no secondary sex characteristics yet, I dorky really have anything to be dysphoric about) she was the worst person I'd ever met and I'm so angry she basically forced me back into the closet for over 4 years, the most painful 4 years of my life I think

(Obviously I hold no resentment towards other trans women, she was just a terrible person, her transness had nothing to do with it)
I don't understand the passion that transmed people have for squashing the joy of other trans people and policing their experiences. Dumb af, unproductive, and full of internalized transphobia. Bit sad innit? 

Keep your facial hair and whatever else feels good to you. You're right that there's no right or wrong way to be trans and being trans is about gender euphoria and queer joy, not medical procedures and dysphoria!!
I personally love the beard and think it's beautiful and I still see you as feminine idk what they're problem is
Only the truly ignorant consider themselves experts.

(Not you the other person.)
I hate the cookie cutter trans people that attempt to put other ppl in a box. Dysphoria can be handled whichever way the person experiencing it feels like handling it, there is no one path to euphoria and I wish they’d get that through their thick ass skulls.
i used to be similar to this person when i was 14/15, fell into the truscum trap. although i still believe you'd need some level of dysphoria to be trans, i really dgaf about neopronouns/xenogenders and what level of dysphoria that needs to be. i dont care about other peoples labels because it doesnt bother me. being truscum is honestly horrendous lol, they'll claim they dont need cisgender approval yet bash ""transtrenders"" (can we please just let this term die already) because they ""make the trans community look like a joke!! they wont take us seriously and we'll get our rights stripped away"" soo you're appealing to who? the non-trans community? thats literally cis people. 

also ""we dont hate nb people we dont know why tucutes spread so much misinfo"" if you check they have a ""is nb real"" post every few days, its why i got sick of their shit and left. straight up had people bash nb people for transitioning using t because ""why would you want to look like a man??"" yet if an afab nb person doesnt want to transition they're a ""trender"". you cant win with these people and honestly most of them will grow out of it, they're like 14-18 (you can see the poll where they ask peoples age) and once they have less free time they wont have time to worry about this shit. just basing how i was at that age, i genuinely hated myself and had low self-esteem. i cared way too much what other people thought about me. now idc. 14 y/o truscum he/him jason version of me would hate me but hey thats character development.
I love having a beard realistically, it's a fun piece of me to stylize and play with, not to mention the fact that I really suit it.

Sometimes I get really off about having facial hair, or I'd keep undercut rather than growing everything out, however I've come to realise that whilst I do suit the clean shaven undercut look (which I do sometimes like dgmw), the only reason I lean more towards it, is the fact that it makes me look more noticeably queer... 

Only reason I avoided certain looks was because I didn't want to be clocked as ""a man"" by every single person that sees me. And I'm mostly over that now, growing everything out to be a bearded, long haired badass, and even trying to bulk out a bit even though it's a pain in the ass seeing as I'm 6'3 and have a metabolism worthy of being a flash villain :')
Omg spotted the truscum

Also, fun fact, [some cis women have beards](https://www.allure.com/story/women-with-pcos-facial-hair-beard-interviews)
I had dysphoria over having periods and having to shave. Wanted to cry when I shaved my legs and I was suicidally depressed during my periods. Now that that’s taken care of I’m happy and only thing is now I might wanna get rid of my chest. Yeah I haven’t had as severe dysphoria as other trans people but it exists and it’s different.
It's annoying to me that we fight among ourselves and that we deem that there is a wrong way and a right way to be trans, everyone is different and everyones experience in life is different. Everyone goes through things differently and also the factors in they're life play a big part too. Plenty of people see colors differently, I can look at the same flower as my sister and we could both see it as a different color but we will never exactly know how how the other sees it no matter how hard we try. There is no one exact way to be trans. When you have a cold you may not have all the symptoms of a cold. Just because you don't have all they symptoms doesn't mean you don't have a cold.
I believe dysphoria (like most phenomena in life tbh) is a spectrum, and can fluctuate for some. Just as some binary trans people have very strong dysphoria and are extremely uncomfortable with anything related to their birth sex, other people may have less, or be uncomfortable with some things and not others, and it’s up to them how they interpret that for themselves. Gender dysphoria isn’t an all or nothing scenario, hence the existence of non binary people. Just because you may not be suffering in the most extreme way possible doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be able to do anything to minimise the suffering you do experience, and maximise your own comfort and happiness.
The ONLY requirement I need to see for you to be trans is you say you are trans. I don't care what you look like, how you dress, your voice, your pronouns, etc. If you tell me what you want to be called I promise I will try my best to honour you.

Look at me. I experienced dysphoria, and now that I identify as non-binary, even though virtually nothing about my body has changed, just presenting myself that way has helped me. Who knows, maybe I'll get gender (unaffirming? deaffirming?) surgery if I think I need it. I definitely want to get the body hair I despise with my heart and soul lasered off eventually.

Not even your motive, if you want to call it that, or reasoning to become trans, enby, etc. matters to me. The reason I'm non-binary is because gender roles make me horrible uncomfortable. That is not to say I don't like gender roles; feel free to fill them, but don't you dare enforce them on anyone but you.
Really who cares if you have dysphoria or not. Just be you and be comfortable with yourself! Look the way you want to, dress the way you want to, don't let Society tell you what to look like.
I know ever since I've been more open of myself and looked at myself as a Nb person I've started to love myself and not see myself as birth sex. Tho I still get big dysphoria. But hopefully in the next few years I'll be getting rid of that or just toning it down to a level I can handle.
Now if only my mum could see me for who I am. 😔
I’ve always had a very deep masculine voice and have never had a problem growing a full beard even as a 20yo but because of how I’ve been raised I’m forced to feel bad for being me and I’ve considered getting laser hair removal and vocal reconstruction just to make people stop judging me for dressing feminine and wearing makeup when I sound and look like a man. I hate it
Truscum moment 🤮
bless you ❤
yikesssssss
Omg
Everyone's so obsessed with all these stipulations about gender identity. I typically stay away from many communities online for reasons such as this. Gender is a construct, albeit a personal one. How you identify shouldn't need any requirements.
[removed]
I'm AFAB. My tits rarely (not never!) give me dysphoria. I am still nonbinary because 'no gender markers' is not the only way to be NB, it's just one way of presenting. I'm sure there are cis women who don't reduce their identity to their tits as well. I just don't get why people can't... just let that be?
Sounds like those people who also feel like there is no possible way for same-sex couples to be happy. Like if you think passing is the standard for what gender you are, then 5$ says that the one who wrote it doesn't conform to their gender's ""media ideal beauty standards"" and is just super salty and insecure about their own body.
I get dysphoria from my deep voice sometimes and other times I get dysphoria from my badly still developing titties.

Sometimes I have euphoria from my deep voice and other times from my chest. 

I'm less dysphoric about my genitals than I was in the past though, and less dysphoric about my face and hair. 
But quite honestly though, I've always felt weird about my chest, even before HRT.
""it would be like if I had my tits out at all times and insisted on being called a man""

which is exactly what I do, in fact, because the last time I wore a binder I ended up having a massive asthma attack in the middle of a parking lot. 

ignore idiots OP, I'm sure you look fly and dyaphoria's a hell of a beast for anyone 💓
EWWWWWWWWWWWWW TRUSCUM TRASH! 

I've had the same argument thrown at me as a fem leaning genderdoe person... They can kindly fuck off. You're valid <3
And the whole idea that it's a nonbinary person's fault that something they like about themselves is gendered by society, so that means they can't have it and should feel dysphoria. That's whack af. It's different if you do end up feeling dysphoria because it's gendered, but if OP doesn't feel that way then that's awesome! I love it when another trans or nonbinary person doesn't have to feel dysphoria about themselves. Plus people gender everything, so who cares. I'm getting new glasses because strangers code me as my agab even though I don't think they look that gendered, and I'm actually really mad that I feel like I have to give something up that I like in order to be comfortable in public. So for everyone that doesn't have to experience that I'm glad.
I was similar until I also got that rush of dysphoria. But tbf I was thinking of getting rid of my facial hair anyway because I always shave and am probe to ingrowns.

I just started laser while my hair is still dark. I have a few grays though, I have to get get electrolysis for those.
Omg this reminds me, when I came out everyone kept asking when I was going to cut my hair short???? And I was like what do you mean tf like everyone has this fucked up little view of non binary people as these androgynous cis women I don’t get it
When I came out as NB, I started picking out more neutral clothing, I grew out and dyed my hair, but the beard was not going anywhere. The beard is part of my style whether I'm [REDACTED] or Axyl. A clean shave just doesn't work on my face.
I feel this. I don’t want to look like a man. I don’t want to look like a woman. I just want to look like an adult with no particular sexual features. The very idea of having more secondary sex characteristics makes me wanna cry.
THIS
But that's the crazy part is I do hate my body 🙃 and for some reason my choice to not shave makes everyone think I have 0 dysphoria and there for am not trans. But some trans people live without dysphoria and it's fucked up to be like ( no dysphoria no gender affirming)
Way to downplay dysphoria
Yeah and I totally understand the mistaking me for a man. It doesn't upset me and I let it be. What I don't stand for is invalidating an entire group of people like every person is exactly the same and has to be the same. That shit does not fly.
Saved this comment in my special time vault 🥰
It's always been like this for me 🥲 I was scared of coming out as trans because of people like this 😪 I'm not scared of them anymore though 😅 they are just babies
r/transmedical is full of people with similar beliefs. “GNC/non binary people/trans people with no dysphoria make the community look bad” bruh
Based on my experience those types tend to be in two camps: 

To be trans is to suffer, if you dont suffer you are ""valor stealing"" (this can be seen in ADHD, autism, etc. As well. You can get high support requirement folk in those communities try to push out the low because they are just ""trenders"") this probably stems from envy of trans folk who get just the euphoria and little dysphoria. 

Quality control the trans: the deluded idea that bigots will change their mind and accept trans people if they oust all the ""low quality"" (ie: trans folk bigots rail against the most) seen in the ""neopronouns hurt trans people"" and ""you have to be binary trans and hyper fem/masc to be valid trans."" (This is because that type of trans person is the ""least confusing"" to bigots. A trans woman tomboy breaks their brains for example) LGB drop the T operates on the same mindset.
Yeah 😅 alot of the reason I have it is to support all the groups of people that have facial hair and don't like it. 

I used to do a LOT of postmates orders and there were more then a few bearded ladies and bearded trans mascs and bearded trans female that all seem too scared to go out in public so they order food. So I go out in public as I am to show that there are groups of people like me, they are just scared of society 😔 and I mean I am too. But I think what I'm doing serves a good purpose
This person definitely adheres to the binary.
Definitely 😍 they should try being happy some time 😂
🥰 it's okay I feel like I handled it fine
Essentially 🥲 I feel sorry for them but also they can fuck off
Yup yup yup 🥲
I feel a little dumb for asking but what does truscum mean. I kinda know what truscum is all about but my mind reads it as True Scum and I can't image they named themselfs that.
One of their users said “it’s transphobic to not date trans people because they’re trans” then straight up said “I don’t want to date other trans people because they’re trans”. Baffling.

Ty so much brain slug 🥰
Fuck yeah friend 🥰 take my follow
My main dysphoria is my voice too. 🤮 but I also think I have a pretty good voice just not the one I want. So i try to record myself singing because it reminds me that I do sound good to some people 😌 just not the voice I want

I also hate having to tuck golf equipment everyday 3 times a day 😑 I'd really like to not have to do that anymore. Or at least simplify it some 😉
I agree it's real ridiculous
Ya spelt “loath” wrong
I love this 🥰 thank you for sharing it with me
It's been happening since I was 11 😅 I'm used to it.but your right it shouldn't happen, I hope my posts create a safe space to discuss that stuff 😀
Yeah I'm terrified of that. I don't like my beard. And it gives me dysphoria. But I'm afraid that I've gotten used to it and if I shave because other people told me too then I'll regret it because it wasn't MY decision, I just got tired of the hate 😪 

So ima wait till I know I'm ready myself.
I’ve been spending so much time trying to figure out ways I could pass, to the point where I was almost convinced that I really wanted to get top surgery and begin hormone therapy. I just now realise how the whole “goal” of passing made me miserable and brought me into hating my body even more because I knew I would never look like the average skinny androgynous looking nonbinary individual described by media :’)  I also hate the idea some people have that in order to be trans you MUST go through a physical transition too, there are so many reasons why I do not wish to change my body through medical procedures and it goes way beyond not wanting to or having the financial stability for it.
😂🤣😂🤣 omg I love this
I've never worried about passing exept in 1 instance. Public restrooms. I REFUSE to go into the men's bathroom. Infact the last time I tried was 3 weeks ago and I cried.

 I had to go to the bathroom really really bad and me my partner and feys whole family were there to watch here younger sister do a cheer squad think for a football game. So you know, there were lots of kids and parents there. Now I had my titties not at all hidden because I refuse to do that and there were several parents that would stare and 1 basically followed me to the bathroom even when I wasn't going I just happened to be nearby. 

So I was NOT going to get assaulted that day and decided even if my partner took me into the bathroom 🙃 girls bathroom was off limits right now. So I was going to attempt going into a men's bathroom for the first time In like 6 months. THAT SHIT WAS DISGUSTING. there was urine allll over the urinal area, the handle, the wall, the floor had like a 3 foot puddle. I looked in stall 1 of 3 and it had a mountain of doo doo that went higher then the seat so sitting down was literally impossible. Stall 2 had what looked like 5 different left shoes 🤔 and I was like what kind of weird pact is taking off your left shoes and flushing them together. And in stall 3 it was actively overflowing because it was cloged. There was a nice slow stream out of the toilet down the side across the floor and into the drain that wasn't clearing any of the urinal urine. I cried a little cuz I had to go real bad and I just stared at the mess for like 60 seconds with some tears streaming down my face because I was too scared to go in the girls. I actually was even looking at the sinks thinking 🤔 well maybe possibly could use it as a urinal which I've never had to do before, but even that was covered in pee. Someone already had done that and left it a mess, and I realized I would never do that anyway 🙃 I was just desperately thinking about it. 

So after about 2 minutes of a mental break down I had to myself in the bathroom I decided I'd hold it 3 more hours till I got home and if I went in my pants by accident it would be damn worth it to not get the police called on me for ""being in the wrong bathroom"" 

 The best part about this whole thing though was when I came up the bathroom crying a little bit. I overheard 3 of the girls that were hanging out in front of the bathrooms talking about me. One of them was saying that I went into the wrong bathroom probably because I was uncomfortable going into the girl's bathroom here. And one of the other ones was saying that I was a guy. They pointed out the flowers that I had on my clothes close and my boobs and said they think I'm trans and that I just went into the wrong bathroom right now. 😭 that made me cry a lot, I didn't say anything to these girls and they were defending me and explaining things I am too scared to bring up. I fucking love kids 😭 God damn 

(Ps. Made myself cry again 😅)
Thank you for the rant 🥰 I completely agree, that's why I'm glad I consistently make posts and give people like you a place to rant about this stuff 🥰
Yup 😅  sure is fuckin weird
Lol 😂 are you pretending to be my mom? Cuz it's spot on
Yeah they were literally commenting on a post about gender expression not equaling gender identity 🙄
Lol but I do feel dysphoria from the beard. I keep it for bigger reasons then my dysphoria though
Jesus 🥲 that's so fucked up 

""They didn't decide fast enough so they don't get to decide"" like who the fuck do you think you are to decide for someone else like that 🤔
Haha jokes on you I don't like mine either😂
Lol I love these moments 😅 ""I hate that person, but not because they're trans""
Also this happened to me a few times over 😅 but I realized that pride was about being prideful in yourself and that changed my perspective on everything.
Ty Kirby 🥰 I kinda do too even though I don't like having it 🤣😅
Yup I have mine in support of them. But also trans males with no top surgery who are on testosterone and trans females who are too scared to shave are very large groups too 🥰
And that's the way it should be
It gets better Maria 🥰 when you no longer HAVE to talk to them they will start to worry more because they are going to lose you. It's the best feeling ever to finally not care about your moms opinion or having to contact her
They are an asshole but outing them isn't super nice 😅
Yup… I’m on the fence about changing my voice. I kinda like my voice.
I used to compare the way that I felt to that of being a lego or a Barbie😅 you know how they are just perfectly flat
I want people to look at my gender like you would a pretty rock.
Do people not understand that people have dysphoria about different things? 

I've had people say similar thing about my appearance ""well if you cut your hair then I'll believe your trans!"" cis men have long hair too, I don't really have dysphoria around my hair. My boobs though? Yeah hate those. Voice? Would like to change. Of course I get gendered as a woman because of my hair, but I got gendered as a woman with my hair cut short. I'll probably always get gendered as a woman because I'm 5 feet tall.
Love when people just project their assumptions on what others deal with internally based on seeing a very very small snippet of someone's life 🥴
It's not down playing it. But to be honest somebody else's dysphoria is not my problem. Some people get dysphoria, and I feel bad for them. I get dysphoria,  Sometimes people feel bad for me. But nobody gets to make that someone else's problem. 

Your dysphoria is your own to deal with and if you're having a hard time with it then you need a therapist.
They didn't tho?
Way to downplay this ratio 😼
No absolutely, I totally agree with that. Just because people are in the same group of people doesn't mean they have the same experiences.
Seriously, I understand mistaking me for a woman too, because it takes much more effort for me to fully come across to strangers as a man when I am one, than to just wear less fitted clothes and forgive people who assume I’m just butch or something. Plus I love my rockstar hair and don’t currently want to give it up even with the damage. I often get shy around people, especially androgynous people because I admire them but also have no way of guessing without asking for pronouns, which is really frowned on by people who aren’t LGBT in my area.
Fr. Anybody who spends their time trying to invalidate the happiness of others shouldn’t be taken seriously
What?
Just gotta send em love, loving and healing energy, and leave em be 💗🙏
to my understanding, they were originally called that by non-transphobic trans ppl as a shorthand for “true transsexual scum”, but truscum seem to have reappropriated the label in their proudness of being exclusionary “scum”. kind of that self-virtuous “i’ll stand by my beliefs even if i’m hated, cause they’re right and i don’t cave to wokeness!” attitude
Make it make sense 😐
Not cool outing them. This is harassment.
yeesh, i hate the abusive way the OG commenter treated OP as much as anyone else, but really? literally all you’ve ever commented is all related to the person you linked, idk if you’re a sock puppet of the OG or just obsessive, but either way that really don’t seem healthy
You called? Oh got sick of dming me telling me to kill myself?
My ex helped me so much with this. He stated that ""being trans isn't about dysphoria as much as it's about euphoria."" To clarify this isn't to wipe away the idea that dysphoria isn't prevalent in the trans community, but that it's isn't a 'gatekeeper' to being trans.
😂🤣😂🤣
Thank you for reading!! 😋
and that’s so lame that you’ve had to just get used to it 🙃 but you definitely are creating that welcoming space so thank you 🥹
Damn, and even after reading a post about it they missed the point.
Oh... well

Them: ''YOU CAN'T BE A FEMALE IF YOU DON'T SHAVE YOUR BEARD!!!1!!1!''

Cis women with beards who don't shave theirs: hhmmm

there, fixed
Honestly? A bitch. She kinda ruined our relationship after she, and my aunt, believed a known liar that I talked shit about her behind her back. So this was more than enough of a good reason for me to drop her.
Lmao I mean like I'm a trans guy and I'm dating a trans woman. I hate her and she was the worst person I've ever met for a fuckload of other reasons but as I said, she's a bad person AND she's trans, she's not a bad person BECAUSE she's trans
Awh I totally get that, potentially you feel like how I feel with my curvy chest I just see it as a part of my body like my elbow but because I know the rest of the world has a very cut out perception of curvy chest = woman even tho I don't see it like that I know for a fact other people will and therefore I have a hard time when I'm not wearing my binder 😅 idk I think your awesome and I send positive Energy ✨
Yeah! And some of them absolutely despise it while others don’t care. Because if it doesn’t make you feel dysphoric then you most likely just accept it as part of your body/part of yourself. Which is awesome 🤷🏻‍♀️
Same. I always thought mine was on the more neutral side until everyone started clocking me when I answered the work phones 🙃
I was for a while too, but I'm menopausal so I can get it done with a pretty lose dose of T. Figured why not give it a go and I can always stop when I'm ready to. Just met with my hormone doc yesterday. In two weeks we meet up again and begin treatment
I've recently only wanted to slightly change my voice. I love its register and warmth but wish it was a bit more feminine.
Same. Like I like my voice for the most part, it's on the moderate to lower side of feminine and can sound neutral at times but I wish it could be deeper sometimes.

Edit: spelling and grammar
Yeah they will always find a reason to invalidate you. Just remember they don't mean shit to you.
Like seriously, my dysphoria over my chest is highly variable in both directions, while my voice dysphoria is only ever more or less “bad.” Otherwise this is an okay body and I’m just struggling with accepting I have massive scars now.
The hair thing is so annoying. I know tons of cis men with long hair and cis women with short hair. It’s arbitrary af
Having long hair makes me feel MORE masc and that's why I'm growing it out.
instant win
KO!
Definitely true. I've spent a LONG time meeting a lot of colorful people and there are a lot of different mindsets out there for things I never once thought of. I think it's the coolest thing but other people call me dumb for not understanding thought processes that most normal people get 🤔
Yup 😅  I don't
From the post: ""having facial hair makes you a man only."" That you can't be any kind of trans if you still exibit characteristics of your assigned sex, even if those characteristics aren't *exclusive* to your assign sex. That humans can only be 1 of 2 things.
Yep 😅 sometimes I can do that
Nice 😂  thank you for the lesson 🥰
Thank you for explaining

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Lol yup 😂🤣
Aweee I'm sorry 😞
I mean I think it's a little different 😅 just because I do actually not like my beard 😅 there are a long list of reasons I keep it. But being comfortable with keeping it is not me right now 🤪  But it doesn't hurt me physically and and it's not the worst dysphoria I've ever felt
Lol that's the thing that's weird about my situation though 😅 I do get dysphoria from my beard and I hate it. But I think I want to not get dysphoria from it before I shave, or maybe I'm making a point, or maybe I'll like the beard one day. 

I just feel like I hate the beard and I can't tell if it's because I actually don't like it or everyone tells me I'm fucked up for keeping it. So until I'm sure I'm shaving for me then ima keep it to support people 🥰
I want my voice to be a bit more deeper so people won't mistake me as female. Because I just don't want to be seen as a female. I want to be seen more as a msc Nb.
No but it really is quite cool. It's not like we're all just one big hivemind haha. Everyone has their own views and experiences, it's what makes a person who they are...
Hehehe of course just reminding you to rethink ya reactions! 💗💗💗 much love
I agree they don’t deserve our kindness. This doesn’t mean they deserve *unkindness* though. And if you can’t see how telling someone to kill themselves and sharing their details online is wrong then you need to take a serious look at yourself.
Be better then them mate 😅
learn to control that bud. not gonna get far by telling ppl to kill themselves when you're mad
I mean I don't like my chest either I just look at in a natural kinda way
Hmmm ok but a beard grows back so you could try to shave it off to see how you feel, don’t force yourself into discomfort just because of others. You need to consider how you feel first :) 

I mean. I’d suggest trying it out, it doesn’t cost anything and it’s a personal choice. Choosing to yourself not have a beard doesn’t mean you don’t support trans women who keep theirs :)
But that’s just my opinion haha you do you!!
Oh lol 😆 I try to be positive and helpful 🥰

This person was aspecially stupid though 🙄 and caught me on 4th day of no sleep. Not an excuse because I don't care about what that person thinks but I was way to tired to be polite about his idiocy.
I agree 😬 harrasing them was not the purpose of my post
Yeah I'm attempting that with my face 🙃 it's going... well? Kinda. Except for the death threats.
Well the thing is since I have been on estrogen my beard hair has been changing and I'm kind of worried that if I shave it it'll never grow in this full again so I feel like it might be my last opportunity to try having a beard
Understandable!
Hmmm. Yeah I getcha. Maybe ask around other people on E to see how it changed their facial hair? Maybe it’s just gonna be a bit thinner and paler but you could still grow a beard? Just to assess all of your options properly

I painted this mug while on holiday last week and I really need to share it. I'm so happy with how it came out! (and I have a really shaky hand so I think the messy bits just give it character, lol)		"I wouldn't mind drinking from that cup for no reason.

anyway we all need our daily dose of non-binary right?? 😉😉

anyway good work I would spend my money like selling away all my things. I love it!

Awesome job love it 💞
Hey that's awesome! I need a mug like that too :D
That's such a rad mug! Can i ask what kind of paint you used please? 💜
LOVE LOVE LOVE
I love this so much!!
That’s so cool! I think you could play with the shakiness and make it your style. Play with it, see what cool patterns you can make <3
haha, we absolutely do. Thanks so much!!!
thank you, they were!! My plan was to make it look like each colour was melting and dripping down over the next, I don't have a steady hand though so it was really hard getting the lines crisp. I accidentally got quite a few smudges of black on the colours too. Overall I really like how it turned out though!!
thank you!!! 💖
aww thanks!! hell yesss I hope you get a chance to make your own!! :D
Oh gosh, thank you so much! 💖💖 Aww I wish I knew, I did it at the pottery painting studio where I was on holiday last week, so I just used the paint they provided. I'm not sure what kind. It was glazed and fired in a kiln overnight, and it was definitely water based, if that helps narrow it down? It was so fun to work with!!
Thanks!!!
Aww thank you!!!

I had a teacher who was trying so hard to scrounge up ally points and so he asked for pronouns but like all it did was announce that I was the one trans kid in the class and later I emailed him saying god don't have people like announce them, ask it privately and double check when you can use them.
This is a way better way to ask than, “are you out to your parents?” imo.

I work with kids with mental health problems and we get a lot of trans kids.  I try to get out of doing calls, but I’ve called a parent before and didn’t know what to do because I forgot to ask beforehand.

I guessed right and they were out to their parents.  I touched base with them afterwards.

I’ll be putting this in my toolkit.
This is amazing!
Great teacher!
I WISH my teachers did this, mad respect to Ms. blank
this is AMAZING
That is a very astute question! A sign of a truly dedicated teacher :)
THIS IS AN AMAZING TEACHER!!  we need more like them 🥺
Mad respect to your teacher but the PANIC I would have felt seeing that subject line LMAOOOO
I always ask my students if I may use their pronouns outside of the classroom! It's something I wish more of my coworkers did.
OMG  
 👏  RESPECTING 👏 TEACHER 👏 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm sorry that happened to you, I know that feeling.
I'm really glad this could help another student feel as good as I did when I got this email :)

Happy NB queer, freezing their ass off at the tip of Africa 🤣		"Beauty!
Hi friend! Your hoodie is super cute :D
Meanwhile I’m a European nb and absolutely roasting.
You have such a great smile and energy :)

Good choice for winter!

Sometimes you gotta give yourself blue eyebrows and wear fish earrings to be happy		"100% relate to 100% of what you just said there. keep being happy:D
THOSE EARRINGS ARE SO COOL!!!

Also, your makeup matching your hair, omg, it looks too perfect! This is such a good look, and the fact that the earrings even are the exact color of your hair and shirt/eyeshadow...hell yeah!
omg. a look~
Goals
I love your blue eyebrows! I've done that as well!
Amazing. I want your hair color!!!!
I know two other Nb people with these earrings did I not receive the dress code or something??

Ps. You look amazing
I feel you. loving the colour, im pale blue atm!
Coloured eyebrows is where it's at
I love your whole aesthetic, especially the color scheme!
Looking awesome! You've got some big Fire Emblem energy going on there.
Thank you!!! The earrings were actually what inspired the outfit!
Well I used ion semi permanent color brilliance in mint!"	d1iziq	NonBinary	769	1.0	2019-09-08 23:53:08

I don't believe if something so beautiful also exist
Nothing is as beautiful as you..
It’s a buckle up jumpsuit from Amazon! It’s really comfy.
Thank you. Sometimes my eyes do that in photos and it’s nice
It’s a buckle up jumpsuit from Amazon! It was pretty cheap but very comfortable
exept i painted my case not that long ago
Modeling would be cool I think
Thanks!
You are a hero
It’s. A very nice case. I got it recently actually
If you do it just take good care of your health mental and physical. But seriously you'd be a great model.
nice! mines like 3 years old now lol
Yeah I know. I don’t think I’ll ever do it but I do enjoy picture taking
Well your face is certainly picturesque."	pmrjkk	NonBinary	764	1.0	2021-09-12 12:09:30

My partner (offscreen) bought a binder for me as a surprise and it came a day early. I put it on and instantly started sobbing, I feel so happy. (They/them)		"Aww you are adorable! I am super happy for you! Congratulations! 😁😁🎉
You made me cry! Im so happy for you!!
This just brought back memories of the first time I put on a binder. Hugging people without flesh lumps getting in the way was the best part for me.
I... got a little emotional seeing how happy you are here! You're beaming all the good vibes!
this is so sweet :) i’m super happy for you, congrats !!
I am happy for you. I have to ask, was that a tornado siren towards the end?
Perfectly portrays my feeling when I first put on a binder too LOL. So much euphoria that I didn’t know I needed.
That's awesome!
Your joy is so pure that I cannot help but delight in you. I want to scoop you up in the biggest Dad Hug and just spin you around and celebrate you!
so happy for you!!! you look great :)
Aww I'm so happy for you !! 💕💖
I’m so happy for you!!
Aww congrats!! I love the shirt and look!
Fuck yea gender euphoria is the best feeling 🥺❤️‍🔥
Can I ask the brand?
It makes me want a binder so freaking much.
Thank you! And no, if I’m correct it’s likely the intro to a hardcore song we were listening to haha."	o9v6ce	NonBinary	754	1.0	2021-06-28 22:38:48
Happy Trans Day of Visibility! 💛🤍💜🖤	"The 31st of March - today - is international trans day of visibility, so I wanted to extend a very happy one to all my enby siblings ❤️❤️❤️ 

I'm marking the day by booking an appointment to try and get referred for HRT via my company's healthcare provider, so please keep fingers crossed because I've been waiting for a long time! 

How are you all celebrating (if at all)? 😁"	"Think i’m going to come out to my friends on social media… i have a post drafted just gotta work up the courage to hit send

update: i did it. was great success. validation machine go brrrrrr
We have a Queer and Trans Employee Resource Group at my organization, but we’re mostly focused on anti racist work. We sent an all staff email this morning to bring attention to the day but also to ask how folks moving forward are going to center queer liberation and disability justice alongside the anti racist work because you can’t have one without the others! I’m also anchoring in a TDOV march here in Nashville tomorrow, here’s hoping no one comes to mess with us 🤞
I just put an enby flag in my dicord pfp lol
Mac n cheese
I’m celebrating by appreciating I have an appointment about starting HRT in two weeks.
Celebrating by being extra goblinish today. 💛🤍💜🖤
Im currently on my way to my bf :3
Going to a day of visibility event on Sunday at my local courthouse. :) It will be my first official event I'm going to after coming out as enby.
I am celebrating by getting over my general life funk via ruining transphobic morons on my posts.
I came out full public. Only 5 ""friends"" lost with a post stating from here on, this is how I'm doing things and if they don't like it, quiet leaving is requested. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out type of ultimatum.
I’m on vacation with my Partner. Maybe today could be a day to come out to some friends. (Partner already knows/very supportive)
I came out to my dad yesterday and i might be coming out to my mom today. It went really well yesterday so just working up the courage to hopefully repeat that :,)
Im celebrating by uh, uhhhhhhhh, watching a tv show? Idk
i’m playing w/ my dog w/ music in the bg. i also made cookies :D
Yay! Gonna dedicate my day to annoying my co-workers by telling them Trans people have always existed 😝
Thank you. Am trying to spread a bit of caring joy, but on the day British Athletics ban trans athletes it shows how much more allies are needed who give more fucks to the trans community than their ideological masters.
I am celebrating by posting Trans Day of Visibility pictures on my social media accounts and watching and listening to relevant stories about trans and nonbinary people on my local public television and radio stations.
This post just reminded me to go to my local rally, thank you!!
just celebrating by reminding myself that it’s my choice to do hrt and that my body is my own :) i struggle daily with feeling guilty for choosing to change my body but i have to keep reminding myself and know that there’s people who support me 🤞
i will make a fire in my backyard tonight. i need an excuse for arson because i enjoy it
Good luck
I was going to go to a demonstration today, but I'm sick and it's cold and rainy.
Im paying for a speeding ticket :( but then having a campfire
Omg my cousin sent me the message and then I subscribed to get alerts from this sub and saw this message and was like fuck yeah! Honestly, I had not thought about how to celebrate except to use Lensa to make AI non-binary looking pfps lol! I did journal and wrote on my pillowfort account tiny bit. This is really awesome though! I hope there is more good days like this in the future! I hope that your spoon goes well! Thank your making this post! 💛🤍💜🖤
I'm at a drag show at a gay pub! So fun!
Happy TDOV to you too! It’s my 1 year anniversary of starting T today, and I’m designing a tattoo to commemorate. Good luck with your appointment <3
Happy trans day of visibility my Enby siblings!
Holy shit, yall see me???? 



(The invisibility cloak doesn't work)
I Was Planning To Celebrate By Just Making A Silly Meme About It (As Alas I'm Not Out To Anyone IRL And I Can't Really Work Towards My Transition In Anyway), But I Wound Up Being Busy And Then Didn't Have The Time :<
forgot that was a holiday. gonna keep doin nothing special
I didn't realise it was trans day of visibility yesterday 😢
Amazing! The very best of luck to you, really hope it goes well and congratulations either way on making the choice to live as your authentic self. It's never the easy choice, but it's always the right one
Proud of you! Remember that you are totally valid regardless of whether you decide to come out today or not! :)
Sometimes it is just about the little things :)
I really wanted some yesterday but didn’t get any 🤔
Amazing news, super excited for you!!
That's wonderful! Super happy for you, and good luck for today!
That's the way to do it! We've always been here and we always will be
100%, if you don't have your own body you don't have anything, do whatever you need to feel comfortable and at home in your own skin
Fuck YES!
Thank you!! <3
That's great, you've already got the first bit of kindling!
Lovely stuff! Glad to have you on the sub, we're all better for having more of us here :) Hope you have a wonderful day!
Nice, have a grand time!
Fantastic! Hope to see that tat on the sub soon :) congratulations!
Thanks. I am sure they will take it well but I’m a very private person so it feels like a monumental task even though I want it known…
I will make mac n cheese for everyone.
Thank you!!! I am also excited.
UPDATE: I did it and she was totally fine with it and it's such a freeing feeling :))))))))
comments like this are why this community is so important to me 🙌 sending hope & the best vibes your way 🤙❤️

Looking very androg. Also I need those socks.
Oooooh, I love your tats!
You look confident. Confidence is sexy. Keep being your awesome self!
I love your style! Also omg your room is amazing now I kinda wanna paint my walls orange.
I'm such a sucker for a thigh tattoo!! Lookin fine as hell!
You look great!! <3
Hi, this may be an odd question, but where'd you find those shorts in the first image? They look really cool and I can never find gender-neutral(ish) shorts.
I’m so happy to hear that, I am so proud of you!

Also, gender envy. You look amazing and I’m high key very jealous👀
Where are all these nonbinary people getting these awesome straps on their clothes!!! It's amazing!!!

And you for my dream room too!!! Jealous!!
Looking good! I'm so proud of you!
So attractive <3333
Thank you!!!
Thanks!!! I sadly forgot where I got them. I've had them for 6 year I think.
Thanks! I really wanna get a few more done.
Oh my god. Thank you! I'm the opposite of confident, but I guess I had a really confident day.
Thank you!
I'm glad I painted the walls this way, it makes me happy and feel cozy everytime I'm in the living room. I don't like plain white walls.
Thanks! It was one of my first tattoos I got done by an actual tattoo artist. I just wanted to cover up scars, but I'm also in love with it!
Thank you! <3
Not an odd question at all!
I bought them from a second hand shop, but they are from an italian sportwear shop called diadora. But I fear they're already a few years old.
Omg thanks!!!
I sewed the straps myself, no idea where to buy them.

Thank you!!
Thanks!!
Omg thanks!
Thanks!
Oh cool! I swear I see nearly every nonbinary person with chokers, chains, awesome clothes, straps, corsets, and everything under the sun!! I'm so jealous! And you're welcome!!

Sometimes I wish I still looked like the left one but most of the times I'm very happy with my current more masculine but still feminine /or androgynous appearance. I'm not sure if that's considered non binary ? (sorry if it's an annoying question, I'm still exploring my identity)		"Damn. Both of those presentations are hot. 💖

Presentation, while a factor, is only one part of gender. 

Depends on what you prefer, maybe you're just the hottest androgynous presenting woman ever? You tell me, OP.
Non-binary is a huge spectrum !! There’s no need to feel pressured into looking a certain way, if you feel that this word describes you well then you fit being non-binary !
I mean if you feel feminine terms are wrong, and like gender neutral terms then that should count as non binary
The fun part about this is you get to decide what you are - whether you’re a woman, a man, non-binary, genderfluid, or something else. It doesn’t matter how you express yourself or how other people perceive you (or how you “present” as some people put it) those are all things you can be. A man with long hair one day and short the next, a woman with a cool shirt, a non-binary person with nice cheekbones. Nobody has the authority to tell you who and what you are except you :)
there's not a certain way to look non binary, u can look and present feminine and masculine and still identify as non binary. remember, non binary is a gender identity not a look. being non binary doesn't mean u have to look androgynous!! 

but beside that, u look amazing in both pictures wow u can really rock any length!
It kind of depends on you if feel comfortable identifying like that or not. If you’d still rather be considered a woman, there’s nothing wrong with that either
Anything can be non binary! It’s really up to the person, if you feel non binary then you are! And may I just say you look absolutely gorgeous as either! You can always save up and buy a nice lace front wig for the days you feel/wanna look more feminine! Get the best of both worlds!! Not questions related to figuring yourself out will ever be annoying, I wish you well in your gender journey!
This looks awesome
You’re a fabulous looking human in both pictures!
It's totally  valid to present differently than is typical of your gender even if cis. It's also totally valid to feel more like one than the other, but not entirely like that one. It's also totally valid to flux between what you feel like. I hope you resolve your journey of identity nicely, and you look great while you're doing it.
Stunning picture
Ahh thanks! I didnt deserve these sweet comments!
But yeah, my confusion is with the terms genderfluid/androgynous/nonbinary, can you be all of them at once?
You're very welcome.

To answer your question: Absolutely. 

Anything outside of strictly male or female can be considered nonbinary. (All labels are optional btw.) 

Genderfluid can be considered to be a subtype of nonbinary or simply an identity in its own right. 

Androgynous generally serves as an adjective but androgyne is a closely related gender identity. Androgyne could definitely be considered nonbinary as well. 

Its all pretty complicated and a lot of it is optional. 

Nonbinary and genderfluid both can be a stand-alone identity and an umbrella-term.  

So it really depends on how the person in question views themselves and the way they relate to other people and their gender."	peuzsc	NonBinary	714	1.0	2021-08-31 00:34:59
My GF called me her BF for the first time. I’m so happy 😭		"Aww you have them save as ""láska môjho života"" aka the love of my life in Slovakian.....this is too cute and I am way too single😭🖐️
She referred to me as her BF on a forum we’re both active in (and again last night in casual conversation) and I’ve been floating on cloud nine ever since. I’m bigender and prefer feminine and masculine terms, and since I’m AFAB, everyone mostly sticks to using feminine pronouns and such with me. She’s the first to use masculine with me. God I’m in love.

EDIT: apologies for any concerns I might have caused! Nothing displayed here is personal info that can lead to either of us being tracked. The names and images are personalized and private. She’s huge on internet security and I wouldn’t betray that!
I love that feeling, my girlfriend was setting up an app and was putting my name in. It asked for the relationship and out loud my girlfriend said ""who are they? Why, she's my boyfriend of course""
I love this so much for you two! ♥ 

The first time a really good friend of mine called me ""handsome,"" I about died it made me so happy. It's just the best feeling for us AFABs who never get called more masculine things.
This is so cute omg I'm so happy for you!!
Gratuluju! :)
I know how u feel. I'm genderfluid so my bf calls me his gf, bf or partner depending on how I'm feeling n it always makes me happy.
You guys are cute! :)
This wholesomeness made my day :))
When my bf called me his bf i almost imploded out of happiness
this is the cutest ty for sharing
💖💖💖
She’s Slovak and I’m trying to learn too! That was my attempt at being all suave and sappy, and it just kinda stuck.
My partner also learns Slovak terms of affection for me, it melts my entire heart and it's too cute to see someone else doing this too!! 💖
Congrats dude, I’m so happy for you!!
>I’m bigender and prefer feminine and masculine terms, and since I’m AFAB, everyone mostly sticks to using feminine pronouns and such with me.

Same but agender AMAB. I'd like it if someone would fuck around with different pronouns on me sometime as he/him doesn't cause me dysphoria or anything, but it's just easier to see ""beard = he."" Doesn't *bother* me, but I'm bummed nobody wants to step out and try it, including my queer friends.
It doesn't suck it's so cute🥺
He said it *stuck*, like it just became a thing /lh"	z9nobl	NonBinary	702	0.99	2022-12-01 13:18:44

This would make sense if IDs said gender, but it says ‘sex.’ 🤷🏼‍♂️ your gender is whatever, but unless you have a chromosomal abnormality then your sex is set right?
it’s one of my favorites 🥺🥰

if we do I promise we won’t be lighting any hillsides on fire 😂

i fully support being illegally non-binary (I was for 29 years)

you could either be supportive or say nothing 💜
Good on you for leaving behind your criminal past mate.

sorry for the late response i was sleeping, its herringbone half double crochet!

finally came out to my mom as non-binary. she said “phew i thought you were gonna say you’re gay not bi and that your bf was gonna have to move out and i would have to come live with you until you found a gf.” haven’t felt this happy and accepted in a long time :)		"I love that she concocted that whole big story to worry about in the time it took you to tell her.

Did makeup today and I'm going out in public with it. A touch nervous about that, but have to live happy right?		"You look so pretty!!!!!

Hey! I and so many other people can be nervous about going out/presenting as NB. But I'm so happy you are! You look great and representation is a way to give back to the next generation. I'm a millennial, and Gen Z allowed me to be non-binary. If you're ever feeling nervous about presenting, remember how much you're helping all of us by showing up! Thank you!!!!
You are gorgeous! 🤩 Live ya best life! 💯
Soo beautiful!
It's lovely! Very subtle and goes well with your hair :)
Love how your makeup matches your hair, shirt and cartilage piercing! ✨👏🏻

Hey, your hair has the exact same coloring as mine lol! Dyed it a deep pink/red a few months ago and an honestly loving the washed out coloration as it fades back to bleached blonde? It looks great on you btw, and fits well with your impeccable make-up!

AESTHETIC
You are so gorgeous!
Holy shit! I love your look here
Whatever you did with your lips, I'm into that apparently.
This is kind of a weird, totally random question. But what color would you say your eyes are?

They look very very similar to mine and I'm never sure whether my eyes are supposed to be called green or hazel, or green-hazel. Because they're blueish on the outside and have a bit of brown by the pupil and are green in the majority/center part, like yours appear to be. So I think they technically have more than one color in them, but it seems like hazel eyes are depicted as primarily brown toned and looking nothing like my eyes.

(Also as a side note your skin tone and hair color are also quite similar to mine, lol!)
You look amazing! <3
You're beautiful
💖💖
Thanks so much!
❤️thanxx
Just a simple gold metallic lip 👄 💛
I always tell people green or hazel 💋💋 also depends on what color shirt I’m wearing 😂

Hi I’m a parent whose daughter has come to me and said she is thinking about being addressed as they/them.	I love my child no matter what because that’s what being parent means. Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means. I want to be supportive but I’m quite confused. My mother likes to tell me that I’m letting her be exposed and interact too much with social media thus making her confused since she is already young… and trying to figure out her identity. Then I have this other family member telling me if she truly knew God she wouldn’t have this emptiness inside her and feel like this. I just want my daughter to be happy. I need positive opinions and good solid information please. I’m getting enough negativity from my family and the worries I have in my own head.	"Allowing your child the space and support to explore who they are is the opposite of confusing and the opposite of emptiness. Studies have shown repeatedly that offering gender-expansive kids the room and support to be themselves drastically improves outcomes across the board. You are 100% on the right track in providing that for your kiddo.

I'll say up front that they/them pronouns are just words. They are part of a wide variety of presentation choices that are available to all people, regardless of their gender identity. Cis folks can use they/them pronouns if that's what they feel comfortable with, or binary trans folks. And non-binary people can use she, or he, or any other pronouns they wish. Pronouns, and other forms of expression, are open to everyone. They're choices you make, something you *do.*

A gender identity, in contrast, is an internal experience, something you *are*, regardless of whether or how you choose to express that. I'm non-binary because that's how I feel inside, not because of how I choose to dress or which pronouns I use. My experience of gender is what it is, it's not a choice I make, and it is what is is regardless of how I choose to express it.

So, why do some people feel more comfortable using they/them pronouns? Often it's because they/them is disconnected from a specific gender role stereotype. Sometimes that can just be a fun form of self expression. Other times, it can be an outward reflection of an internal experience of gender that doesn't align solely and completely with either of Western society's gender boxes. We can't see into your kid's soul, so we can't say which is the case in this specific instance. And your kid may not know yet either, and that's okay.

They are likely to get some pushback from folks claiming that they/them is plural only and it's wrong to use them for a single individual. That's actually not true though, for several reasons. Grammar rules for things like whether ""they"" is singular or plural are *descriptive*, meaning they describe how the words are used in common usage. They are not *prescriptive*, meaning they don't define how someone can use a word and if they don't follow the rule then they're ""englishing wrong."" Language is a collaborative experiment in passing information from one person to another, and every individual speaks their own unique dialect of their language. There is no single authority that can declare what is or is not ""proper grammar."" If you're interested in appeals to authority, here are a few that are widely considered the most prominent authorities on how to use English:

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.

Interestingly, these citations show that singular they *predates* singular you.

Does that help a bit?
First piece of advice, **do not let these family members around your child unsupervised if at all**, and if you do allow them around your child, shut down any of that kind of ""you're just confused""/""if you knew god, you wouldn't be this way"" type rhetoric immediately. Don't wait for your kid to do it, don't assume these family members will magically change, make it clear both before and if it comes up that your child is trying to figure out who they are and you are supporting them, that there will not be any bigoted rhetoric tolerated, and lay out clear boundaries with those family members. This, by the way, is coming from someone who came out old enough to handle my family on my own, I wish my mom had been willing to step in for me anyway because the main family member who rejected me is on her side of my family and it stung even knowing it was coming.

Second, try to get used to gender-neutral language, it may take time and that's ok. Your kid might be angry and upset and emotional and might not always be able to communicate in productive ways, that's normal. You didn't mention how old your kid is, I was 15 or 16, and I was scared, angry, and felt very much alone. I felt like no one was willing to work with me, and I lashed out. Now as someone who's turning 24 later this month, I realize I didn't handle it well, I also recognize why I didn't handle it well.

Finally, have conversations about it with your kid when they're ready, make it clear you're willing to talk and to listen when they want to have that conversation. You might be their only ally depending on how things go with others, and it's important to be open and honest that you're trying to support them. If you mess up, apologize and correct yourself, don't harp on it or turn it into ""I'm sorry, it's just"" (something my own mom has done a lot, though she's not the worst and is genuinely trying).
Firstly I wanted to say thank you for coming to a non-binary space to ask us how to help with something like this, it’s too easy to find no welcoming spaces that will try to have you smother your child’s individuality.

Try not to let those family members bully your kid or make snide remarks about them. Kids are being far more open these days about identity stuff and that is great you child is asking for a safe space to start figuring themselves out. They are no different today than they were yesterday they just want to see how being addressed differently makes them feel inside. People will give them crap for it and that will be hard, for both of you. It’s incredibly comforting to have a family member willing to support you as you go to bat for yourself even if they can’t go to bat for you. 

The best way to stop being confused is to explore, that’s what your kid wants to do. None of it needs to have anything to do with religion at all, it’s just a kid figuring out an aspect of their personhood.

I like to be called They/Them because being referred to in the feminine makes me feel disingenuous but being referred to in the masculine doesn’t always feel accurate either, we don’t have options that I find adequately describe who I am so They/Them pronouns are the next best thing and it feels better for me because most people find it easier to pick one pronoun and use it for a person forever though I would not mind so much if more people could use a wife variety of pronouns for me. 

Each individual has their own reasons for wanting to use the pronouns of their choice but that is part of mine, when your child is ready they may discuss their reasons with you.

It’s not being “empty inside” it’s an act of self love and respect to be one’s self as fully as possible, being stifled or mocked and shamed into silence is what causes people to become empty inside.

[here’s a good read](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85) to be clear not every one of us has dysphoria I just know this article helped me a lot in figuring myself out.
Nonbinary is different for everyone. Your child might feel they are both masculine and feminine, they might feel they are neither... I would say the best you could do for your child is to *let them show you who they are*. Provide them with the safety and comfort they need to express themselves, make sure you clearly communicate that you are a safe person to talk to about anything. 

No one can tell you who they are better than them! 

If you try your very best and still don't get it: *understand that you don't understand*. But understand that from your child's point of view, they might feel that for the first time, they finally understand themselves. Nobody else needs to understand them for that joy they are experiencing to count, but they will appreciate it so much if you make an effort.
It seems like you're coming from a caring position wanting to do the right thing so please don't take this the wrong way but: Stop calling your child your ""daughter"" and ""she"" unless they have told you they're still okay with it. Respect their pronouns and practise using them no matter when and where you speak about them and whether they're present. This will go a long way even if you don't get it right 100% of the time and even if you make mistakes in other aspects of this.

It is important to remember that you don't have to fully understand it in order to just respect their decision. If they tell you something about their identity, believe them.

That being said: Thank you for trying to learn and do right by your kid!
Your kid is asking you to address them as they/ them.  Respect that
https://youtu.be/fYtKXc2VdDw I recommend watching this video, it’s a series on unpacking / debunking a book written by a reactionary who is transphobic against trans men and non binary people. This will help you sharpen yourself against unsupportive family. The “social media is confusing your child” bit is in the book, & addressed by Cass Eris.

Basically, Cass Eris explains that while some platforms are definitely nefarious (meta) children seeking support online is not a bad thing, because they will need that validation from somewhere.

I’m so glad you chose to come here. Because of media like this book, its totally possible for parents looking for support to end up stumbling down a rabbit hole of transphobia.
Most of the time, people who use they/them pronouns are non-binary, meaning their gender identity isn't strictly male or female. It could be both, neither, or something else entirely. Pronouns aren't the same thing as gender identity, though. The pronouns someone uses are the pronouns that feel the most comfortable for them, mostly because they align with their gender identity, but not always.

That being said, I'm surprised no one here has mentioned the possibility of dysphoria. One reason that it's important to use the correct pronouns is that many trans and non-binary people have a mental health condition called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is when someone experiences distress when either their body or the way they are perceived doesn't match their gender identity. Not all trans and non-binary people have it, but a lot of us do. It's also not a black-and-white thing; people can have dysphoria around some things but not others. Some might only get dysphoria about the name/pronouns used, or only about certain body parts, or some combination. Or they might not experience dysphoria at all.

It's worth it to consider taking your child to see a gender therapist so they can have a safe space to figure things out and receive mental help if they need it.

Given your child's age, it might be helpful to talk to them about if they'd like to use puberty blockers. This isn't the same thing as medically transitioning. It just delays the puberty process so your child would have more time to decide which kind of puberty they'd want to go through. For many trans people, going through the puberty that doesn't match their gender identity can be traumatizing and cause dysphoria due to permanent body changes that aren't gender affirming. Not saying your child is definitely trans or non-binary though. Puberty blockers just help buy extra time so your child can figure out what their identity is and what they want to do. Even if it turns out your child is cisgender, the puberty blockers can be stopped and they'll go through puberty normally without issue.
Hi, I use they/them pronouns and I'm in my thirties. Your child came out to you because they trust you and they want you to see who they are and treat them in ways that feel right for them. Gender variance is a form of creativity and should be celebrated. Being nonbinary or trans is good. 

People use they/them pronouns for lots of reasons. I'm genderqueer and trans, which means I don't see myself or want to be seen as a man or woman, either in the social sense (how people dress or act) or in terms of my body. The trans part for me means that I take hormones which change how I feel and look. Not all trans people take hormones or get surgery.

If you want your child to be happy, use their pronouns and ask them open questions about who they are. You might also ask yourself questions. What do you like about your gender? W

There are some trans people who believe in God, but religion has been used to harm a lot of LGBTQ people. If you are religious, look for LGBTQ accepting religious communities. They do exist.
Hi! First, I just want to thank you for your humility and desire for understanding in doing what's best for your child. It's really nice to hear this, always, because many of us had rough childhoods or bad relationships with our parents. People like yourself make a major difference, and you are important. Please don't listen to any family members or others who are trying to criticize your approach to parenting, or your child's feelings. You're doing the best you can, with your child's best wishes in mind, and that's what counts.

Now, forgive me, but I personally am not very comfortable speaking as an authority on things. I have a thing about not wanting to boss people around, and I'm not sure if I'm a natural teacher. 

At the very basic, though, it sounds like your child is experiencing the feeling of belonging to both genders, male and female. Perhaps they feel they have internal characteristics of both? They might see themselves as both a girl and a boy simultaneously, or somewhere in between. They might see themselves as neither. In my personal experience, as well as that of people I love and trust, all of those criteria could apply to nonbinary folks who use they/them pronouns.

My best advice would be to check out r/askLGBT. It's a really helpful question forum for straight and cisgender people to better understand and support the LGBTQ community, especially people in their families or friend circles. It's populated by a lot of parents and older LGBTQ people who honestly I feel could relate more to you on multiple levels. It's a diverse crowd, too, so you will get a variety of perspectives that will probably make points you had not considered previously. As a nonbinary person myself, I found a lot of useful and helpful information there, as well as just a lot of really kind and intelligent, interesting people.

For what it's worth, I believe that God already supports your child, because if they're a God worth worshipping, they already know you're a good and loving parent. ❤️
I was fairly certain that I wasn't cis at 5 but everytime I tried to talk to my parents about it they told me that I was ""confused, going through a phase, or I'd grow out of it"". I'm 31 now, changed my name, go by they/them pronouns and am looking into surgery.

My mother still thinks I'm confused and will grow out of it
Stop calling them your daughter. You've been getting replies for multiple hours telling you to use gender neutral and you are misgendering your kid in all of your replies. You didn't know when you made the post, you know now. If you want to support non-binary people, including your child, take that advice now. Its really uncomfortable when ""allies"" post here getting so much praise for being supportive while only selectively taking feedback and misgendering the person they talk about. This should be a safe space, so change the language or stop talking here until you can
I use they/them pronouns. For me, a departure of gendered terms makes me feel good. I am afab and don't identify as female nor male, so it make me very uncomfortable to be referred to as she/her or ma'am or miss, etc. When people use gender neutral terms for me, it make me very happy and validates who I am. 

Exposure does not 'confuses' people. It educates. I didn't know what non-binary was most of my life, but I knew I wasn't really okay with being feminine or being female. I just didn't know how to classify myself or express myself until I learned about gender identities and such. Now I'm proud and comfortable with who I am.

Any child has to figure out who they are. Your child is no different. They are just expressing themselves in a way your mom doesn't get because this knowledge most likely wasn't something openly shared when she was a child. That's fine, as long as she doesn't try to suppress who your child wants to be. 

My dad gave me great life advice when I was growing up and it's something I strive to live by: it doesn't matter what you do or who you are, as long as you're happy and not hurting anyone.
You sound absolutely lovely and I want to upvote every comment in this thread. You're already on the right track by proceeding with love, an open mind, and a willingness to learn. 

The only thing I have to add is that gender and sexuality are a spectrum and your child may have many identity shifts in their life. I've identified as bisexual, a lesbian, straight, pan, considered whether or not I'm trans, decided on genderqueer then non-binary when that became a term people used, and now I also identify as asexual but biromantic. 

I'm 38 so even I get confused by all the terms that are available to people these days! When I was your child's age there were like 3. 

The best thing you can do is to listen to them and be a safe space for them to explore and change without pressure or judgement, and to chime in with the others, yes, keep them away from the family members who think of their gender identity as an ""emptiness"". Even though I consider my current gender to be kind of a nothing, what that means to me is that I can be anything. 

Again, you sound great. Good luck!
From my own experience (I was assigned female at birth like your child, and I identify as nonbinary and use they/them pronouns) it isn't a choice. It never was an emptiness that made me feel like I was neither male nor female, it was just how it was.

I hate to break it to you, but those family members are being pretty bigoted and toxic, and those sorts of views/opinions most likely will be damaging for your child. If they're feeling this way about their identity, they need support and they need to be listened to.
Do not let those family members get to you! Don't let them do that shit to your child if they're going to be queerphobic like this!
It's not a choice, first off. And second, for why, because they're nonbinary.
Well i use they/them because i felt sad being thought of as a girl. Being a girl just wasnt me. I still am the same person and so is your child. Im not a girl but im not a boy either. I simply like to exist outside of the expectations of gender.
I would say what others have said, talk with them about it, research it, try to use gender neutral terms, and be patient. It can be difficult (I still misgender myself sometimes because I’m so used to my old pronouns lol) but it’ll get easier over time. 

As far as the whole “if you truly knew God” conversation, I like to remind people that God is referred to in both masculine and feminine roles in scripture, usually being referred to as a mother and a father. To constrict God to the binary of gender to me seems rather insulting and limits God/puts God in a box. I’ve come to terms that God loves me for me and I’m made to be exactly who I am. 

Hope that helps and thanks for being honest about your questions and concerns. You sound like a good mom

Listen. Your relatives pushing religion into the situation need to get a hobby. I was raised x-tian and always, ALWAYS, felt like I was different. It took me til I was in my mid 30's to figure out why because of the conservative xtianity of my very sheltering parents. I was suicidal during most of that time. The pain of knowing you are different without having the means to express that difference or worse, being denied your identity, is not something I'd wish on anyone. 

Let me tell you how I've explained it to people:

You know how you KNOW your gender? You know beyond the shadow of a doubt that how you think of your Self and your biologic sex line up in the way society tells you they should. This is just intrinsic and it's a part of you like breathing. It's the same thing. Your child knows that they are not exactly what society says they should be according to their assigned sex. They know this with every fiber of their being. It's natural and intrinsic and it's a part of them.

It also might change, and it might not. Gender really is a spectrum and even the girliest of girls has a masc day or two, and the manliest of men has a femme day or two. It's natural.

 I personally did a lot of soul searching before coming out as non-binary. My 13yo has said that he's a boy, a non-binary boy, and non-binary using he/they pronouns just this week at different times. He's discovering who he is and how he wants to present himself to the world and that's okay. It's a part of childhood and growing up.

Like you said, your child is still your child and you love them. I'm glad you're taking the time to try to understand where they are coming from. You might do well to ask them if they want to change their clothes or anything about their personal space/bedroom. Just something to help make them more comfortable in the day to day. As long as you are accepting of them and supportive they can probably take on the world. :)
First off, it sounds like you want the best for your kid, and want to do *your* best for them as well. Kudos on being a good person!

Whatever your kid’s gender identity may actually be, that they’re thinking about pronouns other than the ones they’ve used up until now is a pretty solid sign that they’re probably not cisgender. Of course it doesn’t mean it’s absolutely guaranteed that they are; they could be just trying to work out a bunch of things about themselves, working out what fits. Whatever the result of this process winds up being, let them guide you. Let them know that they can talk to you about this stuff. 

If they’re saying that they’re *thinking* about using they/them pronouns rather than saying they *do* want to use they/them, however confident, decisive and sure of themselves they are usually, could be a sign of their nervousness about being accepted rather than uncertainty about themselves. That’s not a judgement on your parenting style either. Coming out, even to someone you’re sure will be supportive and accepting can be scary, and phrasing it this way could be a way of testing the waters. Talk with them about when to use those pronouns. Do they want you to use those pronouns for them all the time, or just in certain situations amongst certain people. They should be the ones to decide if and when they’re ready to announce to people who they are, and how that happens.

It’s okay if you’re confused or uncertain about some or all of this. I’m reliably told that parents don’t actually know everything there is to know, and are sometimes even surprised by things. ;) Seeking out information is always a good thing. Assuming that it turns out your kid is in fact nonbinary, keep in mind that there is no one way to be nonbinary. The pronouns they’re comfortable with may or may not be they/them, and may or may not include other pronouns as well. They may or may not want to change they’re name, at least partially dependant on how gendered their name already is. They may or may not want to change their presentation: clothing, grooming, etc. whatever decisions they make about these elements of themselves now, may or may not stand the test of time. A good way of showing you’re supportive might be to talk with them about the use of other gendered words in relation to them. If they want to use they/them pronouns, they may want to avoid the use of gendered words like “daughter” in reference to themselves. (They may also be okay with it; see above re my “no one way to be nonbinary” comment.)

The absolute best you can do, is listen to what they say about themselves, support and accept those assertions - especially in the face of family members who aren’t as open-minded - and give them every opportunity you can for them to be comfortable and happy with themselves. Good luck to the both of you, and hopefully you’ll be able to come back to us down the track with some positive follow up!
Growing up as a male, I felt a lot of responsibility to present as male however I never felt comfortable with it and I felt confused and lost while I felt this way, and since changing my pronouns a few years back to they/them the responsibility felt like it was lifted, I much preferred to be referred to as a person than what gender I am because at I just don't feel like I belong to either binary genders. I hope this has helped, if you have any other questions then feel free to dm me if be glad to help :)

That site has some good descriptions. 

In regards to your mom, a lot of people have no qualms saying babies are cishet, but freak out of a teen/preteen isn't. Your mom needs to overcome her own bias. 

The Bible explicitly says to love your neighbor emphatically and multiple times,  people that use religion to denigrate others are ignoring an important aspect of the religion. I agree with the other person about not having your child around that relative. Hateful comments will poison any relationship they would have. 

Exploring identity is something to be encouraged, as critical thinking is quite a valuable skill. It may shift some as she ages, but don't think it necessarily will. 

> Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means.

This is often because there is an incongruence between someone's sense of self and how it is perceived.
First of all, you should ask *them* what it means. We can’t read their mind so we won’t know what gender they specifically are (or even if they’re nonbinary. It’s a fair assumption but I know some binary girls may go by they/them)

If your kid knew God, well that probably wouldn’t change much, seeing as this isn’t some “emptiness” inside them. (Also this rhetoric is disgusting in general. Being devout does not a cure for depression, sadness, or emptiness make and claiming so blames the sufferer for a problem they did not cause. God may help heal but the person does not lose God for lack of devotion. Just an FYI if you are raising your kid religious, I can’t quite tell from this post).

Basically, your kid probably doesn’t think they’re a binary girl. What they are specifically is up to you to ask them. Being a good parent means trying to understand, and you’ve got that down just by asking. Thank you! 

The decision to change pronouns is to align how you are seen with who you are. Often because the pronouns used before are causing pain. But that’s the only choice, to tell people about it. Their being nonbinary/trans is not a choice. 

I recommend checking out PFLAG for more about parenting on this subject. But in general, offer an ear and also do as they asked. You’ve used she/her and “daughter” to talk about them in this post and the comments. Stop the “she,” and ask what terms they like, because daughter is likely not one.

Y’all have added some great resources in the comments!! I also think using their pronouns and trying to be mindful of gendered language, things like calling them your kid instead of your daughter, can go a long way! You’re gonna make mistakes like we all do but try to hold grace for yourself when you do and keep on learning how to do better! This post honestly made my day, thank you for your humility to try to understand, or at least to learn how to be most supportive of your kid. We’re here if you have any more questions along the way!
1.  My family's god/christ-obsessed culture actually caused me to feel empty, flawed, unacceptable, and freakish.  And all this before I even had my own realizations that I was bisexual and non-binary.  I'm born male and have had no surgery or hormone treatment, and the gender roles, stereotypes, and expectations of straight men that they forced onto me when they began to see signs of effeminacy has fucked me up to this day.  I wish I could have come from a science celebrating family that understands that genderqueerness and homosexuality are part of nature.  

2.  Queer people have ALWAYS been here.  They were part of every single human nomadic group existing thousands of years before any Abrahamic death cult or their hateful books.  I knew that I was different when I was a kid.  I knew that I was different still even from other gay and lesbian kids.  I wish I had the language that we do now so that I could have figured myself out in the late 90s.  Social media and the internet are just exposing more of the variety of humans that are out there.  So your family cannot keep people in ignorance
Go along! Don’t let the family members around them without supervision, and do NOT stand by and say nothing if they try to tell your kid “you’re confused”. Respect their pronoun and name preferences, think of it how some people like to be addressed as a nickname and others HATE being called anything besides their full first name, it’s up to them what makes them comfortable, and it’s up to you to help them feel comfortable. Don’t be afraid to have conversations about this stuff, be genuine in wanting to learn when you ask them questions, and take in as much info as you can. 

If you’d like some recommendations for books that would help understand the situation better, feel free to DM! 

This was likely hard for ur kid, and you should be proud of them for being brave and telling you. Be there for them, and be proud of yourself for wanting to learn and help.
I don't know if it helps, but I'm probably older than you are. It took me a long time to understand a lot of things about myself, including that I'm nonbinary. What I can tell you is that my life is not better because I spent so long identifying as a woman. I detested everything about what people say it means to be a woman, and I was really angry and frustrated. Having an angry, stressed, confused kid wasn't fun for my parents, and being that way wasn't fun for me. Your child will undoubted appreciate your support while figuring things out. Pushing God or taking away social media won't solve the problem, but it will probably push your child away.
Those who posted before me have said a lot of great things and I hope I won't repeat too much. I'm 47 and didn't figure out I was nonbinary until I was around 30. My life would have been SO much richer if I had the understanding of myself and the world that your kid is demonstrating! As to what leads people to request different pronouns, there isn't a universal answer. For many of us, it's that the binary options (he/him and she/her) don't match who we are. For me, it's just how I am on a fundamental level. It doesn't come from an 'emptiness' inside or other lack. If anything, it comes from truly understanding that I don't follow the default. Someone in my support group pointed out that the work that gender diverse people do to learn who we are is an invaluable strength!

One thing I don't think I've seen in the other replies is a way to handle the argument that your kid is too young to know that this change is right. It may be that your child will evolve in terms of their understanding of their gender, and that's 100% fine! I don't know anyone who had their whole identity as a person figured out at 12 other than those who never matured past that point. 

Trusting and respecting your kid enough to use their requested language does no harm to anyone who matters and will build am even stronger relationship with your child. If they eventually decide that another set of pronouns works better or that some another form of expression will make them happy, then great! This is a journey for all of us. If you look around this sub, you'll find some older enbys out there living their best lives, and some didn't find their place until later in life.

Just like any other aspect of learning who they are, supporting your kid around their gender will pay off in the long run. I hope you can take the responses you've seen here as support in standing up to those family members who don't/won't understand. Hopefully, they'll come around, but that's not your responsibility. They're grown, so it's on them to decide if they actually care for the kid you have or if they only care about who they expected this young person to be.

You got this! Good luck!
Thank you for supporting your kid in this way, my own parents cut off contact after I told them the same thing.  They sound like a really smart kid and I'm sure they appreciate your support and validation immensely! Just practice pronouns and maybe get them a nonbinary flag as a gift!
Try having someone misgender you, and it just feels wrong. That's how we feel when we hear the wrong pronouns. Speaking from a 32y trans NB, I wish I would have been able to go deeper into those feelings when I was younger
I came out as bi at 17 to my mom. She told me I was confused. She told me I didn't know what I was talking about. It broke me. I don't think I was ever the same after that. I spent a couple of decades in deep, deep shame and am only now digging myself out. 

Take the advice here. Do the opposite of what she did. I believe in you, from one parent to another. Give your child the gift of believing them. <3 I believe in you.
You’ve gotten so many great responses so I just wanted to touch on one thing that I wish my mom was better about. She still struggles a lot with my name and pronouns and I know exactly why. It’s because, despite a lot of soul-searching and attempting to let go on her part, she still sees me as a girl.

I know this is a hard thing to change in your brain when you’ve known someone their whole life, and especially when the idea of being non-binary is something really new. But I think being conscious of it is the best first step. It’s something I had to figure out when I first had a friend come out as trans. I managed not to mess up his pronouns out loud, but in my head, I still slipped up. But then I realized it was because I didn’t see him as a guy yet. As soon as I realized that, I thought, “that’s dumb, he is a guy” and that was that. It seems really obvious, but just consciously reminding your brain “hey! They’re non-binary, not a [insert agab here]!” is, in my opinion, the best way to get better about names, pronouns, and gendered language in general.

I hope this is helpful! And thank you for being an awesome parent and reaching out to your kid’s community for help. You’re doing an amazing job already and your kid is lucky to have you as their parent!✌🏻
70's liberated heterosexuals from the expectation of raising a family
Lockdown gave individuals the privacy, and time to collectively share another revolution, that liberates all from performing one of two genders
It was a matter of time, what an unnecessary burden, to be told you are not woman enough, not man enough; what an obvious solution, hidden behind taboo, that we should represent ourselves exactly how we feel on the inside, and support others, so that we may all be supported
Why are you still interacting with these toxic family members is the question... I would ask your child what using they/them pronouns means to them. Are they trans/non-binary? Just gender non-conforming? Do they need help accessing things like a binder or other things to express their gender? Would counseling be helpful, are they interested in physically transitioning?
First of all, it’s not a choice. Our gender and sexuality is how we feel as a person, and we can’t choice who we like or how we feel from the inside.

Also, social media doesn’t impact how we feel as a person. It’s how we act and how we feel, just like I said.

And we can’t stop feeling this. It’s who we are as a person, and it’s not some excuse to feel happy or something. It can make us feel happy, but it’s not by choice.

I’m non-binary, but I don’t choose to feel neutral. It’s how I act and feel as a person.
Absolutely!!
So my mom still doesn’t understand me and my gender, I’ve actually never told her I’m non-binary, and I’m 28. So first off congrats on being there for your child. Try your best to be open and free from judgment.

Some things my mom did that were not positive while growing up were not letting me dress how I wanted, because she was so worried about what people would think of her. Make sure you’re encouraging your child to be authentic and true to whatever they are feeling. They can always tell when you’re worried about what grandma will think, or if you’re asking them to change how they dress because gramma or aunty is coming over to visit. 

I obviously don’t know if your child feels the same way, but when my mom would want family photos and she would buy me dresses, I was always so uncomfortable. I never enjoyed being dressed as a girl, even as an adult I have weeks or months where I cannot wear dresses. Let you child explore, try not to put up boundaries, in the end gender roles are social constructs and they change when people stop following them. 

This is not a disease, your child is not empty, they are simply exploring a part of themselves that most adults don’t even tap into. I wish you both the best!
As a non-binary person whose parents struggled with this exact thing, I’d suggest reading up on gender and the trans experience- I’ll link a really good webpage with lots of different resources here: https://www.lgbtmap.org/policy-and-issue-analysis/advancing-acceptance-for-parents 
Thank you for being a parent who wants to support your child 🖤
It isn’t a choice. They chose to confide in you. My best advice is to listen to your child. Their are a lot of good resources and videos of non binary people talking about their experience with gender. Non binary people have existed before social media. It’s just that this is a new term. A large amount of civilizations had more than two gender classification. Ancient Egypt had three iirc. Gender is social performance if you think about it. Even being a cis man or cos woman, everyone is following societal rules of the game. That’s why the standard for beauty and attractiveness chance throughout history. It’s all made up as we go. All of it. Some people don’t fit in the narrow binary idea of gender. Your child  is one of those people. Give them time to get to know themselves and just be there for them.  It’s not a race for either of you.

You're amazing for wanting to support your kid. And your kid is amazing for having the courage to speak out for their truth.

This is a journey...for you both.

Coming out is just one step, you'll take a lot more together and it'll be probably the most rewarding thing you do as a family. Don't be afraid to reach out for support from others. There are many queer friendly therapy groups and therapists now. It's helpful to go, even just to develop a comfortableness around discussing the topic, your emotions, and the external judgments that will come your way.

I'd say the best thing for a parent is to be vocal about how much you love your kid, and create boundaries around supporting them so others cannot cause damage. There will be some struggle, life is an ongoing struggle for many things, but what makes a family is your ability to  love and listen in the face of confusion. Like I said, this is a journey and nothing is written in stone. A non-binary person may fluctuate in the way they act or dress or express their gender. We just need space and time to explore what that means to us.

You mentioned in some comments you struggle with self-esteem. I did too. Speaking your mind and standing up for something/someone you believe in is one way to develop that. When the voices of others nag at you in the back of your mind, tell those thoughts to fuck right hell off because your kid is amazing and beautiful.

Then go out and do stuff together. Have fun. Live you lives to the fullest. You're both worth it.

As a lot of other comments have mentioned, being non-binary is different for everyone. Here's *my* reasoning for being non-binary just to give another perspective:

1. The words ""man"" and ""male"" have a lot of weight and meaning to them in our society
2. Many of those meanings don't align with how I live my life and see myself
3. The words ""woman"" and ""female"" have a lot of weight and meaning to them in our society
4. Many of those meanings don't align with how I live my life and see myself

When you put all that together, non-binary is a great fit. It allows me to be *me* without having to worry about not being ""right"" by some rules that society gave about what was ""manly"" or ""feminine"".

Personally, I also think those four points are a good starting point for understanding the idea of non-binary more objectively. Just about everyone has *some* trait about themselves that doesn't match cleanly with their gender identity. I know men that do most of the cooking and cleaning in the house, and I know women that can fix cars better than my own father. Just because those traits are traditionally not related to their given gender doesn't make that gender less right for *them*.

Another thing to keep in mind that this isn't a ""new thing"". People have existed who would have been better described by non-cis gender identities forever, we're just putting new words to it. Taking the emotions out of it and remembering that these are just more specific words people use to describe and express themselves can help with understanding better sometimes.

From the sounds of it, be prepared to enforce boundaries with other family members. Even if you don't fully understand what your child is going through at the moment, they need to know you'll be there for them. I'd suggest talking with your child about what boundaries they'd like to set so you're prepared to enforce them and don't have to worry about family members crossing a line that they can't *un*cross.

All in all, I think you should focus on the fact that your child felt comfortable coming to you with this. It means they trust you, and that is a *wonderful* place to start from.
There are many great comments but I would like to put in my input as a teenager who does not have the support of their mother. 

(At the bottom I will have a simple guide to “transness”)

First of all, coming directly to this community for support and questions was the best thing you can do. Do not listen to anybody that is not trans or doesn’t regularly work with trans people. You wouldn’t go to a dermatologist if you had a kidney problem. All those comments you mention (and ones you’ll get in the future) come from ignorance and lack of education regarding the trans community. Most things people hear about the trans community is propaganda to incite fear (ex. trans people are predators and pedophiles). 

First and foremost, the biggest way to support your child is to be educated, listen to their needs, and be supportive. One of the biggest ways you can do that is using their preferred pronouns (and preferred name if they decide to change it). It feels awful to be misgendered intentionally. And know now you will mess up. You will accidentally call them the wrong thing. You will not be perfect immediately, and that is absolutely okay. It takes a minute to retrain yourself to use different pronouns. Even as a trans person myself I mess up with peoples pronouns as they are coming out. All you do is correct yourself and move on. Don’t stop what you’re saying, don’t make a big deal out of it. Just switch the pronoun and keep going. I’ll give an example of what to do and what not to do. Using myself as the example.

Ex: “Leo said she- he wants to get food.” (Correct way) You may want to apologize but don’t do it in the middle of conversation, it draws attention to it, and nobody wants that. If you really want to apologize just pull the person the side later and acknowledge that you slipped up but you promise that you’re trying.

Ex: “Leo said she- oh my god I’m so sorry, idk why I did that. I feel so bad oh my god I didn’t mean it.” (Wrong way) do not ever do this. One, you’re drawing attention to the slip up and making it awkward for everyone. Two, you reinforce in your brain that this is bad. And you’ll psych yourself out of learning to use these pronouns. People do this to me all the time and it’s very frustrating. A lot of people just use my name instead of using my pronouns because it is “too hard”. It is never too hard to have basic decency to someone. 

(One easy way to get used to using pronouns is over text. You can easily go back and fix mistakes. Plus you’ll get used to regularly using those pronouns for your child)

Just remember it is not about you. It’s about your child and their happiness. It’s not too hard for you or too much for you. You have the privilege of being a cisgender (someone who identifies as their assigned gender at birth) person. You don’t have to deal with dysphoria, transphobia, violence, and if you’re in the U.S., watching your rights being stripped away from you. It’s not hard for you to switch pronouns. It is hard for your child navigating the world as a trans person. 

As for your child being “too young” to know, just ignore that. Even if they are just questioning, why make them miserable for the time being? So many people are worried about hrt (hormone replacement therapy) or gender affirming surgery. But depending on your child’s level of dysphoria (and the laws regarding trans people where you live) it may not be necessary. And there are many steps to take before you can even access that type of care. And there are steps to take before you even consider that. First, if they are comfortable with it, assess your child’s level of dysphoria. For context dysphoria is like a feeling of unease or wrongness because your body doesn’t match your gender identity. It can be a very weak feeling. My weak dysphoria would be “oh this shirt makes me look feminine so I won’t wear it”. Medium “I’m anxious about going out because I’m afraid I’ll be misgendered”. High “My body is wrong and I want to hurt myself”. If your child has no dysphoria that’s wonderful continue their social transition of using different pronouns and/or name. If they have mild dysphoria try using different clothing, makeup, new hair, etc. to make them feel more comfortable. You could possibly try binding, but it can be very unsafe and damaging if not done properly. If your child considers doing that then please properly research good binders. Wear it correctly and don’t wear it longer than needed. Some people bind for days and days, sometimes weeks, and that point is when something like top surgery is needed. You shouldn’t physically hurt yourself to feel better mentally. I’m aware that treatment is a luxury a lot of people don’t have, but that is never an excuse to harm yourself. So if your child ever binds please monitor them. If your child’s dysphoria is so high that they desperately need hrt or surgery find them a trans friendly therapist. Someone who knows what they are doing, and you can work out together how to proceed from there. Honestly I’d suggest getting a therapist regardless of who you are, but that’s a luxury that some people don’t have. 

Anyway to wrap this portion up. You did a great job by reaching out to this community and admitting that you’re worried and don’t know how to handle this. A lot of people have too much pride to do that and end up hurting their child. The best way to handle this is to listen to your child. They know what’s best for them. If they want extreme things, like maybe bottom surgery, that’s when you as a parent step in. (I would not suggest bottom surgery to a minor who is possibly still going through puberty. If that is ever an issue things like packers or stps are an option). Communicate fully with your child. You’ve got this.

Also, please ask us for anything you need. I’m always willing to help and I’m sure many other people here are too.
Hi OP. I'm a transitioning nonbinary adult who does a lot of volunteer work with trans and gender creative youth as well as their parents. If you would like to DM me with any questions you have, I can also see if I know of any resources in your area. Local support groups exist and are fantastic places to start. You will feel a million times better meeting other parents with kids like yours (and they will make some friends too!)

You've gotten some great advice in this thread already but again if you want to talk about anything in private please feel free to DM me. This stuff is my lifes work so to speak and I am an open book for questions <3
I would recommend looking up a group for parents of LGBTQ+ children. It’s important to learn the statistics, language and culture in order to make your child feel free to be themselves

Edit: thank you for wanting to learn and grow and understand
I really found this zine so helpful and comforting as I was coming out to MYSELF as nonbinary, but it’s actually written for caring parents and family such as yourself! https://www.craftordiy.art/nonbinaryzine

Your kid sounds like a great kid, and you and your husband sound like great parents that your kid feels comfortable to come to both of you about these things! Some people “know” they are trans/nonbinary/queer in some way from when they’re little, some discover it later, some people change throughout their lives. That’s true since before social media, and regardless of religious affiliation.

The best way to help your child be happy: listen to them, and support them in the ways they ask, or in some cases “wonder about” if they are too afraid to be firm (something I do too, as an adult!) 

And consider… even if this is a “phase” (which gets a bad rap, but we ALL have different phases in our lives!) what’s the worst that could come of using they/them for your kid, getting comfortable with gender neutral language, and standing up for your kid if anyone has a problem? Your kid will know you have their back and take them seriously, and that’s not too bad, is it? :)
Take a deep breath, and remind yourself you're doing a good job at parenting. I know all this information can be very overwhelming and you're worried about making a mistake, but the fact that your child feels comfortable at all to share this part of themself with you, means they feel safe enough to do so. That's something which, sadly, is in very short supply for many queer kids. So you already have put the right foot forward before even starting this journey with your child. 

Being non-binary can be extremely confusing for someone who's never experienced their gender feeling ""wrong."" Heck, it's still confusing even for people who are non-binary! It's completely okay of you don't really understand everything right now. Loving and respecting your child, while being open and listening to them, is the most important thing.

As a way to explain it though, this is a very simple metaphor I've used to talk about my experience: 

>I was given size 6 shoes to wear. They never fit right. I tried and tried to walk around wearing them, but they always hurt my feet. Yet every shoe store I went to only had size 6 or size 10. Everybody else I knew could fit into those sizes. Some were even given the wrong size, like me, but switched to other and then they were finally comfortable in their shoes. Not me though. I tried the size 6's and the size 10's; they either were too tight or slipped right off. I struggled for years walking in the wrong shoes. Until finally, one day, I found a different shoe store. And for the very first time, I got a pair of shoes that fit me perfectly. It turns out I was a size 8 all along. 

>I know I am non-binary in the very same way I know when the wrong shoes do not fit me.

And I did know. Many trans folks (non-binary falls under the transgender umbrella) have these feelings for years before they find the language to express their identity. I remember being in kindergarten and a) having crushes on girls and b) not wanting to be a girl myself. 

But it wasn't until being in my 20's that I understood what non-binary genders were. Learning about non-binary folks made a lightswitch flip in my brain. I can't forget the day it happened. I was watching a youtube video of non-binary people talking about their gender (cause I wanted to be supportive to my queer friends) and I had to pause like two minutes in and just sit back going ""oh fuck, that's me."" Like a revelation. Suddenly everything in my entire life of feeling like being a girl didn't ""fit"" made sense. Suddenly *I* made sense to me. 

Not to ramble on about my own life story, but I mention this cause it sounds like there's relatives who are saying some very harmful things about your child. There's no such thing as having one's gender (or sexuality) influenced by friends or school or social media or tv or whatever it is that people pick to blame. Yes, I came out as non-binary after watching youtube videos about non-binary folks. This is true. But it didn't *make me* trans. It didn't *influence me* into slapping a ""trendy"" new label on myself. All it did was give me the words to actually talk about who I am. I've always been non-binary. It's certainly not a choice. The only confusion about my gender which I've ever had was always being told I was a girl, despite never feeling like one. I did feel empty then. Only after living as my actual gender for the past few years, have I learned just how deeply unhappy I was before. I *like* me now. I'm not disgusted by my body anymore. The feeling of being ""wrong"" is gone.

This is just my experience, of course. Not everybody is gonna have that ""Ah ha!"" moment and it can take years and years to figure out one's gender identity. Your child may tell you they have different pronouns and such as they keep figuring themself out. That's perfectly normal. And, if that does happen, use the new pronouns and just keep on going forward. No one knows your child better than themself. From how you've talked about them, they seem to be a pretty good advocate for themself too, and it's wonderful that you've raised them with such confidence.

Another important conversation to have is to ask them how *you* can be the best possible advocate for them. Unfortunately, as you've already experienced, people will be queerphobic, intolerant, closed-minded, and otherwise just disrespectful to your child. It is the shitty world we live in. But, they got you! And that's fantastic.

Ask them what boundaries they need. That one God preaching family member of yours should be kept away from your child entirely. I don't know the situation with your mother, however, don't let her talk to your kid without you there. A young queer person being told they're faking it and just confused is very damaging to their sense of self and their own agency as a person

Ask them if there's others who make them uncomfortable. Family members might not say things to you directly, but they'll say things to you child. Ask them about school. The students and the teachers. School can either be sometimes pretty supportive or absolute hell. Probably more toward the forner, hopefully, since you said they have queer friends. Do they need accommodations at school? Bathrooms are a whole issue, plus if there's anything gender segregated, like uniforms. Changing name, pronouns, the whole shebang will be something you have to make happen for them. And ask them about being in public in general. If someone misgenders them, do they want you to step in and correct it every time? With friends and family, definitely, but strangers? Your impulse might be to of course fix that for them (and that's a good impulse!), but they might also simply not want to deal with it. Sometimes it's easier to hide than risk a potentially hateful reaction. 

Something that my wife and have is a code word for when we need to the other person to step in, or get out of a situation. Obviously, it's a bit different for a parent and child, though having a word your kid can say whenever something's happening which is making them feel uncomfortable (without needing to go into a whole explanation) could be really beneficial. Things like dysphoria and experiencing queerphobia can be very hard to talk about, even to ourselves. Much less while they're still in the stressful situation. 

Ah, sorry this got so long. Again, no rush. You'll get there, and you're doing great already. Coming to talk to non-binary folks in the first place is just, like, wow. 

It's obvious you respect your kid and are focused on what's best for them. From me, a non-binary person who had to go no contact with my mother years ago, thank you for supporting your child. You have no idea how much it means to a kid for their parent to accept who they are is real. I hope for the absolute best for you and your kiddo. Best of luck to you both! 💜
Okay, so you mentioned in comments they're 12 and I wanted to offer a few suggestions 

#1 - realize they're young! It's possible as they explore their identity they'll end up with different pronouns later, possibly going back to she/her, maybe he/him, possibly adding or taking away some along the way. It's a journey of exploration and finding themselves and this could take time. Other people are sure of it right away, regardless, don't let others tell them it was ""just a phase"" - their a kid, phases are how they find what sticks. It's completely normal to go through phases and I think it's important to recognize that. But recognize it by treating it like it's not a phase, not by brushing it aside. (I also don't think it's a phase, to clarify, but I also don't want to suggest it's not also a journey of growth exploring gender) ""Getting confused"" while exploring identity is sort of a red flag phase, if you're exploring your identity, you're likely to get confused. But the only way to know if  things are going to work is to try them.

#2 ask them if there's any other changes they'd like to make. A shortened name? A nickname? Would they like a haircut or anything similar? Are they okay being daughter or would they like to be child? Are they comfortable using gendered restrooms at school or would they like you you reach out to the school?  Different people have different preferences. 

#3 If you can afford it, I'd consider therapy. Not with a therapist to talk them out of their identity, but with one who they can talk too that can help support them in their gender/queer discovery journey. Talk with the therapist first and make it clear you want to support them as much as possible. 

#4 Get yourself a therapist (again, if affordable/feel like it's needed) just to check in and see how you're doing. Transitioning can be hard to wrap your head around, and dealing with unsupportive family/friends can be difficult. If you're not solid on boundary setting, it can help to get some professional support. 

#5 They made the choice because to them its who they are. They're young, but the fact they've trusted you with both their identities at such a young age speaks volumes (good ones)  about you as a parent. They trust you, hold onto that trust and believe them when they tell you who they are. Taking the step to reach out here is also amazing, having to explain your identity to people when you may be still figuring it out can be difficult. So the fact you're doing the research yourself is really good. That being said, I would in the future when asking about stuff (or talking in general about them)  use their pronouns! It's a good way to practice and make sure you're getting them right. It can also help to practice in front of a mirror, saying stuff like:

Mabel is my child, they're on the swim team! I'm really proud of tjem because they got second place in a meet last week. 
John is my child, they do art and they just showed me a really cool painting of theirs. 
Forest is my child, despite being named Forest they're really good at computer science. 

Stuff like that on your own can be helpful in learning and practicing.

#6 Ask them if they're comfortable with you sharing stuff publicly. I know younger friends transitioning who want their parents to document it on social media so they can look back on it. But others would rather avoid mention of it and just treat it as if nothing happened. Again, talk  with them about their preferences for how they want to move through the world. That kinda gets to the point of your original question - what does it mean? Only they know. 

#7 In terms of if you're worried about reactions from people, people are going to be hateful but people are always going to find something to hate. You can be successful and nonbinary. (I have a coworker at a nonprofit who's a department head in the Bible belt but openly uses neo-pronouns!)  You can be married or have kids (if that's your vibe) and be non-binary. Heck, we have non-binary politicians and therapists. (I imagine also lawyers and surgeons I just haven't heard of any) While it can often feel like being trans or nonbinary is a scary existence, it's also a loving one with an amazing community. I'm writing this cuddled up with my girlfriend right now and our cat is knocking over my water bottle. I met all my friends in college through queer affirming groups (including campus ministry!) 

#8 Just in regards to the campus ministry thing, if you are religious, take a critical look at how your religion handles queer people. Are they affirmed? Not just welcomed/accepted, most religions welcome/accept anyone. (At least the ones I've interacted with) But affirming means queer people are allowed to lead, they're allowed to educate, they can hold opinions and those opinions are valued. Those places exist, look for them if they're important to you or your child.


Eta: I have no idea why certain paragraphs are bigger in text size. I'm on mobile
Heya:) I can see that this post is genuone and coming from a good place so I'm really glad that you've been doing that. 
Each non-binary person's experience is very different so although it's good that you're reaching out to other people in the community, the key to understand where your child is coming from is to have a conversation with them about it.
Also, you briefly mentioned a family member bringing in God into the matter and I just wanted to say that there is nothing contradictory about the faith and atypical gender expressions. So if you are a Christian/religious household, please dont feel the need to choose a side. If the crux of God is love then that is all the support should be focused on:))
I wish for the best for your child and hope that everything goes well
non binary people are just people, i can see from every point there, those people are trying to demonize the idea of being non binary but if you really sit and think about it, what is the harm? at the very worst, they could be wrong, but if that's true all you have to do is make sure your clear about loving them no matter how they identify so if one day they decide they were wrong they can feel comfortable telling you, outside of that, there's really no harm in calling them ""they/them"" is there, also i would say, with an extended family like that, they probably need your love and support more than most.
Mom to a nb teenager & a not legally adoptive mom to a genderqueer teen over here. Just wanted to say thank you for not just shutting it down and instead coming to the internet to do some research. I have watched my “adopted” kiddo be told that they don’t know what they want, that my kiddo is just badly influencing them, that it’s not appropriate, it’s “against god”, be told that they are supported but won’t be called by their name or pronouns, limited on what kind of clothing they can buy, how they can cut their hair, etc., and I have watched these actions absolutely crush this beautiful human’s soul. Just… thank you for trying. 
You already have a lot of solid answers here so I’m not going to double up much but I would like to emphasize the advice to be wary of allowing those kinds of family members access to your child. It can be incredibly damaging to hear that kind of stuff from the people who are supposed to love you. My mom and I have had to cut a family member out of our existence because he couldn’t keep his opinions to himself, caused a full blown panic attack for my kid. I legit packed everyone up and left in the middle of a visit multiple states away and my mom ended up moving out, It’s made it harder to see the family we love but, I told my baby I couldn’t control how everyone reacts/supports them, but I could control if it was my family/friends and I’d go scorched earth for them no matter who was the culprit and I got to back those words up a lot sooner than I thought I would lol. 
IDK if it’s already too late, seems like it might be since you’re catching flak from family, but it might be helpful to talk to other people about this and not your family unless your child has expressly okay’d you outing them. We have family members that my child is uncomfortable being out to, and ones they’re okay with and we keep things very separate until they change their mind. At the end of the day this can greatly change the makeup of your kid’s circle and they deserve control over when that happens. 
Lastly, all “my” queer kiddos came out to me around 9-12 years of age. And yeah, maybe it is the internet’s fault, not for *influencing* them, but supplying them with the appropriate vocabulary to better define themselves. I’m thirty something and when I was a kid, the words were gay, bi, or trans, and that was about it, right? But none of those things were exactly… me? Now there is this abundance of people sharing their experiences and understanding and it can make things a lot easier to process on a different timeline than other generations. That’s my take on it anyway.
They are still who they are they are just more. It’s important that they know how much you support them. Keep the other family members away if they’re unable to treat your child with the care and love that they should. 
Like everything, enby is like a spectrum. For me personally I feel like gender norms shouldn’t define me as a person and I go by any pronouns because I just don’t really care that much. For your child it could be completely different as well. 

My best advice to you is to just listen to them and believe them when they say they feel a certain way about their self. 

I hope I didn’t come off prissy or anything, I apologize if I have. 
Have a great weekend!
hi, I'm also a mum of a nb young person. they've chosen they/them pronouns for now, although they are happiest when they're feminine. one of our favourite things was going shopping and allowing them to choose their own clothes/jewellery ect and develop there own style/persona. 

the main thing I've learnt is to follow their lead. also been surprised by who has been supportive and who was dismissive. 

sorry I haven't had a chance to read all the  comments yet (I will as there looks to be some great resources in there)

ps. they're 10m
Since everyone else has the big stuff covered: do little things to celebrate your child's identity. Maybe buy them a pronoun pin or hang a non binary flag in the house. Today at work a kid came running up to me as soon as they were dropped off to show me the necklace their mom got them, which had the non binary colors in beads. Little things like that mean so much because it shows that you don't just accept them, you are proud of them and want to celebrate them.
Hi! First of all, you are already doing a great job, and it's so amazing that you seek out information and help from the community! You are willing to listen and learn, and I can't stress enough how important that is.
I wanna touch on ""they're just confused"" rethoric a little. So, its transphobia, plain and simple. But i think its important to recognize where it's coming from. Many ppl are afraid that kids are pressured into and/or will go through all the trouble of being trans just to recognize it's not for them later, when they think is ""already too late"". But here's the thing. If one's experiences change over time, that does not make them invalid. If you feel anger in one moment, and happiness I the next, that doesn't mean your anger was invalid. If you liked dogs as s child, but then grew up and started liking cats more, that doesn't mean your love for dogs was somehow inadequate. We are all just a bunch of experiences in the specific moment in time. And yes, those experiences can change. But that doesn't mean anyone should regret them. My sister explored her gender for a bit and then came to a conclusion she isn't trans, and there's nothing wrong with that. And I'm pretty sure I'm nonbinary trans, because that's a consistent experience for me throughout the years, and there's nothing wrong with that either. So, yeah. It's just something important for you and your child to recognize, so that those comments won't get under the skin of both of you.
And the one about the God is just bullshit. God didn't helped or thousands of other trans ppl. If I continued to follow religion, I would still hate myself and be miserable. That, ofc, depends on how you view religion, but where I'm from the rules are too rigid to allow me to be myself and be a believer at the same time. On the other hand, there are a lot of trans people who do believe in God, and it's not like they believe in him less than others. Belief doesn't magically make you conform to your assigned gender at birth or make you strsight, that simply doesn't work the way some ppl seem to think it does.

Anyways,  that's all I wanted I say, hopefully that helps you deal with those relatives. You're doing great, I think your child is very lucky to have you!

P.s. if you wanna hear abt my ecoeriences of being nonbinary and/or how I came to this realization, lemme know! I'm just not sure if I should write it due to the abundance of comments x)
""I love my child no matter what because that's what being a parent means.""

""I just want my daughter to be happy.""

Solid parenting right there. 👍  As long as you keep thinking like that, pretty sure your kid will turn out alright.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It reminds me of a newspaper clipping I saw awhile ago. Some parents had taken out a notice in the ""birth"" section in the newspaper, making a correction to their original notice, saying that they didn't have a daughter anymore. Thinking the worst, I read on...

Turns out their daughter had come out as trans to them, and wanted ""he/him"" to be used.

So the parents were writing in, saying the original birth notice was mistaken, and that they now have a son. ❤

It ended with a note to their new son: ""Loving you is the easiest thing in the world. Now tidy your room."" 😋
So I haven’t noticed this said yet: please don’t ever refer to being nonbinary as a choice.

The only choice involved with a person’s sexuality and gender identity is wether they tell you what it is. Its less about harm directly to your child, and more about reinforcing negative thought processes of other people. Thinking people choose their non-cis gender identity leads to the connotation that it is abnormal and divergent from the “regular” genders, and that eventually slides into what conversion therapy people believe.

I highly recommend looking for some historical references of gender throughout history (the book titles escape me right now but they are certainly out there). Non-cis genders have existed as long as humanity has and learning a little about it will also help your child learn of the normality of gender spectrum and be better informed.

Best of luck in the parenting adventure!
You clearly have an amazing relationship with your child if they felt they could come to you with this! I love this so much. I recommend following people online who have non binary children and support them and watch them and practice using their new pronouns when and where you can!
There is no emptiness. It isn't a choice. It has nothing to do with god.  Those 'connections' like comparing an apple to a blackhole, they have nothing in common. Your child is really just showing they are comfortable with you and trying to figure out how to be comfortable with themselves.  When I asked my mom ""how come you accepted me being non-binary so easily."" she said ""Why would I not? That is just another part of who you are and I am not much of a mother if I don't accept my children for being humans themselves.""
Well on the subject of what causes someone to identify as non-binary, it's that we don't feel like, or want to play the part, of either ""traditional"" gender. 

Nature doesn't do things in a binary mode, bimodal sure, but a binary ""either/or"" view of gender is just the categorization that most people layer over the reality of it. (If you're unfamiliar with distribution curves, bimodal distribution is two bell curves stuck together.) So most people don't experience a lot of dissonance living within the traditional binary, that's where the most people are in relation to gender. But those peaks have tails, or areas that are a measure outside what you'd call gender conforming, and that's where non-binary people experience and express gender.

I know very few people come here for statistics presentations, but I hope this gives you a different way to think about things. 

Arguing the extended family into accepting and embracing is going to be quite difficult. This is more of a feelings disagreement than a facts argument. It might be a better tac to find out why they feel like letting kiddo be themselves, or hell just explore, is dangerous? It might come from fear that they'll be treated lesser than a binary gender conforming person, if so you could impress on them that it's even more important that you encourage and support them.
That is very, very helpful advice! Especially from a parent perspective! Thank you for your insight and wisdom. I welcome it with open arms❤️🤗  I wish you luck on your journey in parenthood and healing from your past
I don't have a kid, but I do have a mother and I think I can give some insight and advice. 

First, its not a ""choice"". It's simply who your child is. Not a boy, not a girl, your child. They were born this way and it just took time for them to realize it. I'm 24 and realized when I was 23, your child is ahead of me in that regard. 

Your mother and this other family member are wrong. Your child does not have any ""emptiness"" inside them. In fact, suppressing their identity would cause an emptiness because they wouldn't ever feel like who they really are. 

Finally, begin using the same words I have been this whole time. For example, ""this is my child, they're fantastic and I love them."" They may be fine with being called ""daughter"" but I'd recommend making sure. Using the pronouns they request is SUPER important, don't exclusively use them around your child, use them everywhere and with everyone when referring to your child. My own mother doesn't do this well and it makes me feel unloved. If you truly do love your child, use their pronouns as requested. 

I hope this was helpful.
>Then I have this other family member telling me if she truly knew God she wouldn’t have this emptiness inside her and feel like this.

Start putting up some boundaries between this person and your child - that sentiment will absolutely harm someone who is in the process of exploring their identity and inner self.

I was raised Christian and did everything ""right"" (not claiming perfection) I followed the formula prescribed to me to a T. When I ""fell short"" I ""repented"" and my heart wanted nothing more than to please God and be his kingdom's representative here on earth...

...problem is, I was *repressing* myself the whole time because who I am didn't fit their mold. I was left with terrible anxiety and no self esteem at all (in spite of knowing God and not doubting his love for me).

I only started deconstructing away from the faith a couple years ago and finally felt free enough to be myself as I approach 40yrs. So much of my life wasted, pretending and surviving rather than living and thriving.

.

>Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means.

It's less of 'making a choice' and more of 'realizing that society's assumptions of gender are out of sync with your internal experience' and then owning it and living that truth honestly.

As I previously mentioned, I only **just** started exploring this stuff and living truthfully within the last year and I've never been happier with life and with who I am.

Unfortunately even being almost 40, I'm terrified to bring this up to my parents because I don't trust them to see me. You seem like good people and you're taking the right first steps ✨
Thank you for asking about this. I was afraid to for fear of offending someone. My teen is dating someone who is non binary and they have a ton of friends that identify the same. He tried to explain it but did so poorly. So I lurk and learn. Eventually I threw them a big party and 30-40 kids showed up and it was wonderful. My generation wants to put everything in a labeled box, and I am deconstructing that notion and just accepting what others choose for themselves. Everyone deserves the right to be happy and safe.
Uhh, what makes you want to use the pronouns you prefer? It just feels right, it fits. Your child may be feeling that being a girl isn't the right fit for them. It's important to be supportive of your child right now so they can develop into who they want to be, and not be suppressed by overbearing family members who want to force them into conformity. That just makes everyone involved miserable. By the way, they/them pronouns work for anyone of any gender. When you watch a car run a red light, what do you say about the driver? 'they were probably on their phone' or something like that. It works for everyone regardless of gender. However many people like to use more specific pronouns to reflect their gender identity, such as she/her, fae/faer, he/him, etc. I don't see how using or not using specific ones is any more or less valid, nor do I see how only certain specific ones are valid. That's just rigid traditions refusing to include everyone.

It all depends on how you look at things. If you try to look at this from your child's point of view, it will make sense, they're expressing how they feel inside, and that feeling may not be feeling like a girl, as you may have previously expected of them. Just work with them and make sure you two are able to communicate openly. If you try to impose the judgement of the particular society you grew up in on the situation, where there may be restrictive, rigid gender roles and expectations, a lot of people just don't fit into that structure and are treated like freaks and feel perpetually misunderstood.
I didn't see anyone link any professional sources. Here are some, a drop in the bucket to what is out there. Don't have kids myself, just the experience of being one. My parents overall were really great, the things that made being a kid difficult was when they didn't see me for me. Looking at what they thought I was and could be instead of who I was in the moment

From my understanding.. They are non binary. Being their selves has nothing to do with God. 

Non binary means that they're not a boy or girl.. Now they might want to look masc or fem or both but it doesn't change their identity. 

I'm 17 and I found out at 16..

My advice is talking with them, google, talk to people.. Learn about them and their identity. This doesn't change who they are.. 

Just try your best to use they/them and gender neutral refers.. Like instead of daughter, use kid, child, baby ect
Let me tell you, I appreciate that you are trying. I would have loved to have parents like you. Instead, I got my head slammed in a dryer door. I am so, so glad that you are choosing to support your child. Keep your toxic family away from them, and I'm sure you will.

I do, however, agree with the wariness of social media lol. Nothing to do with gender or sexuality exploring, just with the fact that kids are *so* impressionable and *so* easy to get hurt on social media, either by their peers or by adults. I'm glad I was kept off social media until I was in high school, tbh. But if they've already grown accustomed to being on social media, well, I'm not sure how you'd handle that battle if it were one you were to choose.
Lots of things have been said, but I didn’t see this. Explore your own gender and share with your child when you’re asking them about theirs. What makes you feel like the gender you present? What makes you feel euphoric in your gender? What makes you feel a little icky? Nothing related to your body, what you do for others, etc. Just things that you feel internally and why. It’s a really good way to get to understand why someone else needs to live in line with those feelings in themself, no matter how young they are. Think back to when you were a kid and what complex things you understood about yourself and the people around you, how intense your emotions were. Kids get it. They need space to explore their identities, and if you explore with them it won’t be one sided vulnerability.
Hello! as a nonbinary person without kids i can't give much advice on the handling family side but I just want to tell you that acceptance and an attempt means the absolute world. It doesn't matter if you mess up, just the willingness to try, to have that much respect for you to try and love for the kid you have over the one you thought you did means a lot. And while being nonbinary is different for almost everyone who is, and it's a lot to put into one comment, I want to open my DMs to you for any questions you might have! Finding information is hard and there's the worry of imposing on others, so I'd like you to know that I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about your child's identity, their experience, and how they'd probably like to be treated while navigating their self-discovery : D
I'm the (nonbinary) parent of a trans teen too. Its HARD to defend to other adults that yes your kid does in fact know who they are. It's hard to come out, or tell people your kid isn't cis, in a world where that's not always safe. You're at the start of a hard journey, but you love your kid, and you want the best for them. Be there for them, defend and protect them, just as you would with any other trait about your child. 

God makes us all EXACTLY how we are. If God made you trans, you're trans. If God made you a nonbinary person, you're a nonbinary person. Far be it from me or any of your family members to question God's plan for your child. 

Your kid can be happy. They're not empty, they're not any more confused than any other 12 year old. They're figuring out who they are and you being there to support them is the best thing you can do.
Your child is the source you need to listen to for what they're going through and why they feel this way. What I encourage you to do is to take a positive but inquisitive tone with them. Ask them to help you understand, because you'll both (hopefully) learn a lot from them and understanding their reasoning and feelings. What I found helpful (and do take this with a grain of salt, everyone is different) was people reacting with honest curiosity. The more I explained myself and my feelings, the more confident I became. If they are questioning, then this is good practice with a loving and supportive person. If they already know (and I do believe that people have to experiment to know sometimes, whether it turns out to be something else or not), this helps them build resilience and learn to articulate themselves.
As someone who is non-binary at a young age rn I can tell you that the most important thing is be open. This means different things like to conversations and to changes with their gender. As well as preferences, in your post you said other members of your family were saying things. Don’t be surprised if your child doesn’t want to communicate with them and if they ( the family members) are saying something mean and homophobicly rude.  Lastly let them tell you stuff when you are ready
You're child came out as non-binary right? You kept mentioning them as daughter here (it can hurt)
But don't let them around your child. I had a grandma who said these things, I'm no longer a Christian because she made me feel broken.
Ask them what terms they want you to use. They might want to be called your daughter but they might prefer child or son. Open conversations are something i wish i had with my parents. You might see a doctor about puberty blockers if they're interested. Take time and do your research about queer things. Use their pronouns and name as best you can and correct others. Let them experiment with clothes and hair and expression. Affirming their gender is suicide prevention. Overall just let them know how loved they are.
Just wanted to hop on here and offer encouragement! I’m really happy for your child figuring out who they are! And I’m ecstatic for you, reaching out to the community your child is beginning to enter into and get to know is so wonderful! It shows how much you love them and are willing to learn and communicate in healthy ways! Please keep it up! 

And as for your family members giving pushback, always support and respect your child’s feelings around any family member. And as much as you want to, you can’t always change everyone’s minds. And it’s okay. Your kid just needs to know you’ve got their back and that they’re safe with you. 

Please keep up the good work. We need more supportive moms willing to get educated and grow. 💕
If they want to use they them pronouns then maybe dial back on using she her. Even when not talking to them. It is good practice and I know I would be deeply hurt is I found out someone was only respecting my pronouns to my face . It takes time and being consistent with it helps you remember. Also definitely have a talk with them about what they are comfortable with being called and be aware that labels can change especially since they are so young.
everyone else has already said all the important things, so i'm just here to chime in as a happy, fullfilled 34 year old enby.

when i was a child there were no words for ppl like me. i was still nonbinary, but i was alone and afraid. i bound my chest in unsafe ways, i was incapable of forming meaningful relationships with others (because i was unable to be myself), and i was ultimately traumatized by trying to be a cisgender binary person. i felt like an impossible thing.

then the internet happened and i found my words.

i came out at 21 and i've been out in all areas of my life ever since. i've been medically transitioning in nonlinear ways that work for me, i'm wealthy in the chosen queer family department, i know who i am, and i get to be my authentic self. i feel extremely, extremely grateful to be alive and nonbinary.

i'm sure you know this, but your nonbinary child is a treasure. you're lucky to have them and they're lucky to have a parent like you. just know that your child's future is bright and that trans joy is real, regardless of what's happening in some parts of the world. this is a fantastic community and you seem like a great parent.
Hello! To second what a lot of people said, good on you for being supportive; many queer and trans kids don’t have that luxury. Your willingness to learn is a good start. 

Be on the lookout for dysphoria, anxiety, people’s comments around them (looking at your family and strangers), and be their biggest advocate! It’s hard to stand up for yourself, especially that young. Correct others for them - IF they say that’s okay and what they want. Keeping an open line of communication is key!

To add a couple of points that I haven’t seen yet:

Another possibility as to why they would choose they/them is because they’re a type of non-binary called “genderfluid.” This means that sometimes they may feel feminine, sometimes masculine, sometimes a mix of both, sometimes neither, sometimes like a girl, sometimes like a boy, or any combination of those - I’m genderfluid and use they/them because it’s easier thank asking people to switch pronouns based on how I’m feeling. Only they can truly tell you their experience with gender identity. 

Another thing to ask them about would be gender expression. Do they want to change their haircut or style? Do they want new clothes? New shoes? It can be expensive but it can help them feel so much more comfortable with their body and valid in their identity!

It might be a phase, it might not be. Hell, even at 19 I’m still figuring myself out, and that includes my gender identity and preferred pronouns. Do NOT discount or write off their experiences no matter what comes next. They’re figure themselves out, and it’s a beautiful journey. I’m glad they trust you to take with them❤️
The only thing you can do here is trust your child to know their identity, and provide them with all the love and security you would have given them had they not come out to you. It sounds as though these family members are the ones who are putting your child in danger of being confused.
Well, the way they feel about pronouns isn’t about choice, it’s just a feeling, it’s hard to explain, but it’s there and your kid is feeling it too. Please don’t let them around those family members alone as it could put your kid in danger. I’m glad you are open to it and are willing to help them explore their gender openly. At first adjusting to the new pronouns may be difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it will be easy. Using these pronouns for your kid will really help their mental health. Definitly ask about different labels such as whether they’d rather be called “daughter”, “child”, “kid”, “niece”, you know, those sorts of terms. Find out what they are comfortable with and they kind of language and compliments they prefer too: “pretty” “handsome” “cute” etc.
So I have some resources that might be able to help like books and other posts!!!

Please feel free to stop by r/transgenderhelp and ask us questions and we will guide you!!
You've got a lot of amazing comments to reference already, that have a lot of great advice and resources. I just wanted to let you know that I'm a non-binary person in my 20s, and have been openly non-binary for a decade (came out in my teen years). If you ever feel like talking to a non-binary person who went through teenagehood as a non-binary person could help you with any more specific questions that come up while you're learning, I'm open to DMs! (I'm not always great with responding quickly, so time-sensitive things would be better taken elsewhere when possible)

I know there were so many things about my experiences I couldn't articulate as a teenager that I now have the language for, and while I obviously can't speak for your kid or know what's going on in their head, I can let you know my own perspectives, both how I feel about certain things now, and how I felt about them as a teenager. My parents didn't have a lot of resources when I first came out, and it was hard for all of us because they couldn't understand things and I couldn't explain those things. I'm very happy to try and provide parents help so that things can be a little easier for families than it was for mine.
Hi, OP, everyone is already giving incredible advice, so I just wanted to say thank you in conjunction with everyone here who has already said so. Thank you for reaching out to this space, and thank you for doing your best to support your child. It means so much to me, and many other people here, to see a parent like you doing your best to learn and be supportive. I wish you and your child nothing but the best. 💖💖💖
I wish you were my mum :”) your kiddo is very lucky
Ok so... I'm nonbinary. I've been nonbinary since I can remember, but I grew up in the 90's, before social media was a thing. I remember being 6-10 years old and wanting less gender affirming clothing, short hair, and a gender neutral name. This was long before the use of pronouns was a thing. I remember at one point *wanting* something like a they/them identifier but it was 1999 so it wasn't a thing yet. 

I'm 30 years old now, and I'm still nonbinary. I'm just glad there's a name for it now, there wasn't when I was growing up. 

A couple of years ago, I realized something. I don't know if this counts for everyone, but in my case, I realized that a lot of my gender identity preferences had less to do with how I felt about my own body, and more about the way others perceived it. All the gender roles, social expectations, and ""rules"" for each gender seemed a bit arbitrary to me. It used to revolve more around how I played, but now it's evolved a bit. I still get a bit of judgement for being the one that cuts the grass and takes out the trash, and being the breadwinner while my AMAB spouse is the homemaker. 

I wish I had a better way to explain it, other than my own experience. But to me, being nonbinary isn't so much about how I feel about my own body, it just feels like the world is trying to cram me into a box. There's a male box and a female box, and each box has its own limitations. But I don't want limitations. I just want to be me.
Nonbinary isn't a hard label. It leaves room for all kinds of expression and changes later in life. Your kid may feel restricted or limited with the clothing choices and the enforced role of femininity. 
 
Your kid may be saying ""I need space to figure out my own gender expression. I don't feel like a girl but I'm not sure if I feel like a boy. I would like time to think about my identity and explore different methods of expressing myself""
You're lucky your kid trusts you enough to tell you who they are. No one else can tell you more than they know about themselves. Try to honor that. There's nothing negative about this. This isn't a choice and more than being gay is. Changing pronouns just means you realized , hey, it feels wrong when people call me this, I am more comfortable being referred to in this is way instead. There isn't much more to it. Just like some people like or maybe just don't mind being called he or she, it can be upsetting for others. Media did help me because I never saw anyone living as I wish I could. It gave me courage because I realized If they can live as themselves then so can I. When everyone around you is denying who you are, then yeah, there are plenty of people like us who your kid can come to. And we will support them because we know what it's like and we know we are real and we don't want your kid to go through what we did (years of stuffing it down til you can't keep living that way). The world can make room for us. It's not too hard to understand. But I think most people have simply never considered gender. And we now know that it is largely arbitrary to uphold the idea that men and women are the only option and that it is determined by what's in your pants. What do we lose if we admit that we have to power of self determination? Mostly bigots from our lives.
Hey They/them here.


I have always struggled with my gender. For a long time I thought about transition -ftm- but their are days I feel feminine and days I feel more like a man and days I feel like well both!!! It’s not really a choice it was the way god made me. It took a while for my family to get used to but as long as you try they will appreciate it, hell even when my dad makes crappy dad math Jokes about it I still know he truly trying to understand that I was just made a little different then everyone else.


Yes their are family members that still call me she/her but I still love them and try to understand that they are trying
Anyone who is being judgmental can go fornicate with themselves. This is about you supporting your child (also kid, spawn, and baby). 

It is absolutely ok for you to be confused and to struggle with shifting pronouns to they/them. One of my friend is a mom to a non-binary kid, and she put an autocorrect in her phone to change ""she"" to ""they"" so she wouldn't inadvertently misgender her child. 

I knew I was different by the time I was 4, but I didn't know about being non-binary until I was in my 30s. When I was in school, the girls in my class seemed like a different species from me. I knew I wasn't a boy, but I wasn't one of them either. 

Let your kid take the lead and support whatever they want to do as long as it's safe to explore their gender - clothes, hair, name, pronouns, etc.
the fact that they are comfortable enough to share this with you is a bigger thing than you might think, so don't worry too much, you're doing good! :) the thing is, they might end up with different labels in the future but it doesn't hurt anyone to try something out. this is just the way we grow.

I was also born female and now I identify as non binary & use any pronouns. I came out (with my gender) not that long ago but honestly, if I had the words to express myself I would've came out much, much sooner.

I always enjoyed both masculine and feminine things growing up and I'm so grateful my parents let me be myself. looking back I could've known a long time ago; I always tried to mimic the men I have in my life, was afraid to present ""too"" feminine cuz I thought others would just see me as a girl and was upset by some changes in my body when I started puberty. later in life I considered if I'm a trans man but I wasn't uncomfortable with being a girl either. being non binary & using different pronouns for me means that I don't have to throw away a part of myself so I can be like a ""typical"" girl/boy. I don't have to choose between what norms  to follow so I am seen as a binary gender. it's just freedom to express myself and good vibes. :)

also, I'm christian. it's hard to keep your faith when your different. personally, I moved myself away from the church (it was toxic in other ways too) and I've been really happy. I believe that you don't have to ""show off"" with going to church and any events to believe. it can be just between you and a God and that's perfectly okay. whenever someone tries to tell me otherwise I just ask; if God hates me, why do I keep winning? :D (like truly, I have an amazing life)
First off, you kept calling your kid ""daughter"" and ""she/her"". The first step to showing support is calling them their proper pronouns and using terms they are comfortable with. Unless they specified ""daughter"" is okay, don't use that. If you're talking to them and a gendered term slips, apologize, correct yourself and move on. Talking about the issue more (Things like ""oh no I'm so sorry, I promise I'm trying. I didn't grow up with this, i have to get used to it."") can often cause dysphoria in people, not everyone but it can happen. 

It's great you came here to seek advice from other nonbinary people. The greatest piece of advice I have is to cut off or educate the family on how to be supportive. Your kid is going through changes and finding themselves. Even if they later decide that ""nonbinary"" doesn't feel right, at least they felt that support and were free to explore their identity in a safe space. Then in the future they feel safe coming to you for advice or support. 

You should prioritize your relationship with your kid above the mean comments from your family members. 

I wish them the best of luck on their journey!
People who have gender identity dissonance are always helped by gender affirming care. For some people all they need is to use different pronouns and be encouraged to dress how they want. Some people need more some less. You are their parent and they need your unconditional love and support. That means trying your best to use their pronouns and new name if that’s what they want.

Check out the book Whipping Girl by Julia Serrano.
As a parent it is your job to teach and protect your child, but also to learn and change with them.
Will addressing your child as they/them hurt them? No.
Is it something you can talk to them more on?
Yes.
Why do they feel this way? For how long?

I myself go by they/them/zir.
For me changing my pronouns was about being more comfortable with myself, I hate being call girl or lady or miss because it didn't fit with me and even felt demeaning. I was about 14 when I found a  proper term 'non-binary' and 'enby' that fit me better.

My mother has told me from her side of things, that there is a bit of a grieving involved in your child changing from what you knew, to someone who is freeing themselves to be their truest most authentic self.

It's completely valid to experience those feelings of grief, concern and doubt. But you also get to relearn who this amazing person you brought into this world is.

Best advice is talk and communicate calmly, share your concerns alow your child to do the same, because the alternative could push them away. Would you rather be there for them no matter what or potentially push them away because you didn't try.

not going to offer any advice here, just here to say that you're doing amazing. any parent this open and honest and willing to learn the steps to support their kid out of love, no matter the pushback from family or friends or social norms, is an incredible parent. my own weren't the most supportive when i came out, and im sure your child is very lucky and thankful to have you in their life. no matter how overwhelming or stressful things get, remind yourself the steps you're taking, the communication you're showing and the support you're offering are all the right things to do and your kiddo is lucky to have you. i wish you the best of luck ❤
Why they make this choice:
- they have found the words to communicate how they feel
- they (finally) feel safe enough to express themselves
- they want to feel more comfortable in their life and live as their authentic self

Are they too young to know who they are?
- no
- would you ask a someone who identifies as their agab (assigned gender at birth) that question?
- did you know when you were a kid that you were indeed a [insert agab] and not trans/non-binary?
- did you know as a kid you were cis straight?
- why would someone question their gender if they were ‘the norm’. Wouldn’t it be way easier then as everything is already spelled out for them? 

The answer is: they are finally who they are, and yes they are old enough to know who they are. This might change in the future if they find other words that better describe them, but even if they were to change their mind later, at least they are respected and well cared for by being who they are and being appreciated for who they are. Don’t fight them on their identity. They know who they are!
I think when you aren't nonbinary it's very hard to understand that experience and how it feels, which is okay, as it's not an experience you've had. If you want to understand what your kid is going through I would advise that, rather than trying to imagine being nonbinary, imagine that everyone around you insisted you were. I don't know if you are a man or a woman based on your post, but you can probably imagine that it would be alienating and strange if everybody in your life referred to you using they/them pronouns and didn't talk or think about you as a man or woman, whichever is your identity.

If you can imagine that situation, you can begin to understand the disconnect and discomfort that your child may feel when they are perceived and treated as feminine. It can feel like you're invisible.

None of this is particularly specific advice, though i do think it generally holds water. You're already doing a great job by acknowledging you need advice and seeking it out. Just talk things through as you go with your child and anyone else who can help and you'll do great. :)

Thank you soooo very much❤️ All of this has really helped immensely. Especially since my child has trouble putting it into words themself. Sharing some of these things with them could help their confidence. Right now I am worried about them because they seem to be dealing with bad anxiety (especially social related) and maybe depression. Unfortunately a lot of this wonderful stuff runs in our family. Is there a local support group usually for youth in the LGBQT+ community? I feel like a lot of it might be because they feel alone in all this.
Something Else Interesting To Bring Up Is The First Known Complaint About Singular They Was In The 18th Century, If Memory Serves, Over 300 Years After It Started Being Used. Interestingly Enough, I Found Many Of The Oldest Sources Saying Singular ""They"" Is Bad Also Disliked ""He Or She"" And Variants, Instead Desiring The Masculine ""He"" Be Used Generically.
They just turned 12 but I swear they are going on 30. They told me they were Pansexual when they were 10. They are actually more emotionally and mentally mature than most adults I know. Their dad and I have been very supportive. Your advice is very helpful. Thank you so much for the insight. I am more than willing to stand up for my amazing child but unfortunately I have a very low self esteem and doubt myself and my parenting. My relatives are all too happy to tell me I’m wrong and over step.
Thank you I really appreciated your sincere words and they really made sense. Reading your explanation and the ones above have really opened my eyes and helped me understand the whole idea/community better. It is also making me feel more secure in standing up against those I know are going to not understand. I want to always be in my child’s corner.
Well that’s the thing my daughter is only 12 and feels like she needs to decide now what she needs to go by. She’s putting a lot of pressure on herself. I will support her no matter what and begin using the pronouns she chooses when or if she chooses them but right now she is just feeling very confused. She came out as Pansexual several years ago and her father and I have been very supportive. When I asked her about why she might want to go by they/ them or could she describe to me why she felt she needed to be called that just so I could understand… she said that she had not quite decided it and couldn’t quite put it in words of her own exactly. She just felt safe enough to share with me that she was contemplating it very seriously.
Wow, I am just blown away by the support and all the information you are giving me. I am actually feeling so excited and hopeful. I can’t wait to share a lot of this with my child and tell them about my new understanding then explain how we have backup ammunition to support us in the fight against the negativity from those who don’t understand.
I’m really glad you brought this up! I’ve heard about this before from a trans friend at work. I believe she mentioned she dealt with it. Someone else did mention for a moment in the comments before about this but didn’t quite explain. I was going to look it up. Thank you for explaining a bit. The way your bringing it up it does sound a lot like what they might be experiencing.  I don’t know if I should just bring it up to their regular counselor or get a referral to the counselor who specializes in these things.
I totally believe in that. My mother and some other family members are unfortunately on the other spectrum of that. In my mind God loves everyone no matter what and I’m ashamed of how most Christians act now a days. I will definitely be looking into a church where my child can feel welcome and we can cross out that negative influence that my mom and other relatives have been lathering on. Thank you❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much!! You sound like one the the most beautiful souls I have ever met! I feel so awful for all those who were not unconditionally supported by their parents. Doesn’t matter if you got pregnant really early or came out as gay. Your parents should have your back and support you no matter what. Even before my daughter came to me about who she was I have had an open heart because I too believe God loves everyone. I believe that a person is born this way and God does not make mistakes. He wants us to truly be who we are. To express the beautiful gifts inside us. I am honestly appalled by how most Christians act nowadays. “Judge not lest ye be judged” and “You who is without sin, throw the first stone”…. My fellow Christians must have forgotten those. So busy bothering people who are doing nothing but being true to themselves and expressing love in a form that might be different than what they know but it’s love just the same.
I’m so sorry your family does not support you. That breaks my heart. Sending you mental hugs across the miles. 🤗❤️
u/AdultingMakesMeCrazy I saw your reply about re-reading your comments but I can't see it anymore. I typed this reply but it didn't post, so here it is

&#x200B;

Thank you for being receptive and re-reading your replies. It's understandable to be overwhelmed, especially if this is the first time you have a non-binary person in your life. You (and everyone) are gonna make mistakes and sometimes it'll upset people but as long as you're willing to learn from it and keep trying, that's all anyone can ask!

  
I don't know if your child has dysphoria or not, and honestly they might not know either. When I first came out I didn't think I had dysphoria, but soon I realized that I did and it was quite bad. If they do have dysphoria, it might hurt to be misgendered even if you recognize someone as trying. If they get upset when misgendered, it is probably not from thinking that you're not trying, but because it can hurt.

  
It's not uncommon for non-binary and/or trans people to overcompensate as their agab before realizing. For example, some trans and/or nonbinary people who were afab were heavily into makeup and other traditionally feminine interests, and looking back feel it was a mask. Some people might've avoided things associated with their agab, but now feel comfortable with those things in a non-gendered way. That was something that confused my parents about how much changed after I initially came out. It might take some time to figure themself out, their style out, they may initially want to keep their name but also might decide to try others. I think you will do great, as long as you stay open minded and receptive
^^^^^
OP said that her daughter was considering it, not that she had officially come out as it
Your post is very wise. Especially the advice your dad gave you. I agree so very much with his saying or advice.
If anyone sounds lovely it’s you 🤗❤️
Wow, that was one amazing comment and made me think of my Aunt Kathy that I looked up to. She had a way with words and wisdom and looking at the world. She was a very beautiful, old soul. I loved every word. Thank you ❤️🤗
Thank you so much I really appreciate this❤️
Thank you for your comments and insight. My child still seems to be deciding but when that decision is made I will be respectful of it❤️🤗
The support in your comment really meant the world to me. Thank you so much for the uplifting words and insight❤️
Thank you so much❤️ that’s some good advice. And I’m glad I made your day🤗 Everyone here is making mine by being so supportive and helpful.
I’m so sorry that your family was like this. My mom is the one who is a Christian like that. I promised myself I would never become someone with such a closed heart. I have always believed that God loves and accepts everyone. There are so many Christians out there that offend me and give Christianity a bad name. They mold the Bible into what they want it to say. Jesus was about love and forgiveness . One of his most prominent stories in the Bible has him saying “you without sin, cast the first stone”… when they were about to stone a woman for her sin. We are all equals. None of us the right to act like we are better than another.
Oh wow, you have such a beautiful soul❤️ your mother is really missing out! Don’t let her confusion and negativity pull you away from your peace. I believe in you
I keep hoping that the family in question will get their crap together and listen to me when I say that this is who they are and this is what they need to be happy. These people know not to say things in front of them. If a person did they would no longer be going around them. I have them in counseling but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Maybe I have the wrong counselor. They have already said almost two years ago that they decided they were Pansexual but is just now feeling like non-binary pronouns might be part of who they are. They are not sure. They are only 12 and feel like they need  to figure out everything out now.  I just want to support them and give them the best advice
I am so sorry your mom made you feel like that. At first I would let my mom bully me into trying to get them to be more feminine or dress nicer… because among my many issues I am codependent. But thankfully I realized before I ruined my relationship with my child that my mom needs a lot more help than I do. So now my child never has to wear a dress unless they choose to (it would probably be more of a pantsuit and rainbow colored). Even at a family get together or whatever. I say be yourself just wear something clean. They even have shirts that are obviously supporting gay rights or hats and pins like that … they ask me if it’s ok to wear to a  gathering and I tell them if someone can’t except you for the way you are.. they aren’t worth your time or mine….. so wear whatever you want.
Leo’s Guide to “Transness”

Terms you may not be familiar with or have the wrong definition to:

Cisgender: someone who does identify as their assigned gender at birth

Transgender: someone who doesn’t identify with their assigned gender at birth

Non-binary: someone who doesn’t identify with a binary gender, male or female. (Non-binary is not a third gender that exclusively uses they/them pronouns. It’s an umbrella term that applies to many genders that are not male or female, but you can identify as just non-binary)

Gender non-conforming: someone who doesn’t not fit into societal gender roles. Not all gnc people are trans, but they may face similar discrimination with trans people. You can be cis or trans and be gnc.

Genderfluid: someone whose gender fluctuates or changes. One day they might feel masculine. The next they could feel like nothing in particular. Then maybe they’ll feel feminine.

Agender: someone who doesn’t have/feel/ a gender, or doesn’t have a strong enough feeling of their gender to label it

Genderqueer: what a lot of people think gnc is. Pretty similar to the non-binary label. Kind of up to the person. Usually someone who doesn’t identify on the gender binary. Other reason could be: not have a clear label of their gender, having multiple genders, having no gender, etc.

Trans man: someone who’s not biologically male that identifies as a man.

Trans masc: someone who’s trans but feels more masculine or presents masculine (not necessarily feels like a man)

Trans woman: someone who is not biologically female that identifies as a woman

Trans fem: someone who is trans and identifies femininely/presents femininely (not necessarily feels like a woman)

Deadname/given name/birthname: someones given name at birth

Deadnaming: calling someone by their birth name (big no no)

Agab: assigned gender at birth

Afab/amab: assigned female/male at birth

Taboos, No No’s, and other Tips and Tricks

Deadnaming is a very big no. Some people are okay with it but never ever do so without asking. It’s very hurtful and usually causes dysphoria or reminds you and other people that we are trans. 

Outing people is never okay. Some people aren’t ready to be out yet. And outing them without their consent can sometimes put them in danger.

Calling someone “a transgender”. It’s objectifying. I am transgender not a transgender. (Very similar to queer. Calling someone a queer vs queer has two very different meanings)

Transsexual is a very outdated term. Before people were really aware of non binary people they only assumed trans people were ftm or mtf (female to male and vice versa). Being transgender was just going through surgery to “change your sex”. That is no longer the case. Some people still identify as that term but that is only up to them. So never use it unless someone specifically asks you to.

Tr*nsvestite (not sure if slurs are banned) usually describes a cross dresser or someone that dresses in the “opposite” clothing for sexual pleasure. It’s commonly used as a derogatory term towards trans people, usually trans women.

Tr*nny is another derogatory term. Some people may still identify as it. Unfortunately the meaning was taken away and turned into a slur. 

Pronouns don’t equal gender. I use they/he pronouns but I don’t identify as a man because I use he/him pronouns. Someone could be cisgender and use she/they pronouns. Someone could use all pronouns and not identify as every gender. I’m sure you get my point. 

(Feel free to add anything I missed)
That is a lot of really amazing, helpful input❤️ Thank you for taking the time to do that and open your heart🤗🌻 I am so very sorry your mother does not support you. That breaks my heart. Sending you ‘mental’ hugs across the miles. My child did ask about binding, especially since they are uncomfortable with their chest. But yes binding sounds so scary to me. I’m afraid of them hurting themselves. Especially since they are still growing. Are restrictive/high impact sports bras a good compromise till they get older? I just want to do the best thing to make them feel themselves but be safe.
I know it took you some time and care to put this all down for me ❤️ And let me tell you I appreciate it more than I can put into words. I want to be aware of everything that’s going to connect with my child’s world and make sure I’m  learning to become a better, more rounded human being at the same time. I’ve always supported the LGBTQ+ community even when I was younger. I had some really good friends from some of the communities back in the day (cause I’m old, at least that’s what my kid says lol). But now it’s been more difficult to make any kind of friendships being a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on things. Become an advocate if I could. It just makes me so said that so many parents don’t support their kids out there. My kid and I are going to the local Pride parade and I got a shirt that says “Free Mom Hugs”. My kid picked it out for me❤️
This is amazing! Thank you so much! I will take you up on your offer
I really appreciate the info you offered for me to check out❤️ I need all the info I can get🤗 and thank you so much for you positivity and support
I'm not sure where you're located, but there are a *lot* of support groups around the world for folks like us. PFLAG would be a good place to start, or their school's GSA. I'll add that it's okay for *you* to need support, too. While I recommend a supportive gender therapist for anyone going through this process, it's also a good idea for parents to have their own support structure. While your focus should be on providing support for your kid, you also need support for the work that *you* are going to do during this process, and that's okay.
I just want to say that I can tell you love your child very much and it’s great that you came here for advice. It’s also very nice to see that you switched to they/them pronouns, I know (as someone with parents lol) that even the smallest things like that can be very validating even if they don’t see it happening. I hope that you are both able to continue exploring this together and get the resources that you need to help them ❤️
Gender Spectrum https://genderspectrum.org/ is another great resource for trans and non-binary youth and their families! They have a glossary you might find helpful, and facilitated online groups for kids and teens.
depending on how populated where you live is there is almost always LGBTQ+ youth support groups, usually with age restrictions and adult coordinators to foster a genuine safe space. i'd just research around your area to see if any resources are around like that for you and your kid :)
Also, please don't talk about them as ""she."" They asked you to refer to them as they/them, and it's best to do it even if they're not around to hear/read it. It's always good to practice their correct pronouns and getting used to it, plus, it rubs us all the wrong way if you use the pronouns that they told you not to use. You will sometimes slip up and that's fine as long as you try to refer to them correctly. Soon enough, it will be natural for you to talk about them as they/them.

Anyway, props and all the glory to you for being an amazing parent and making an active effort to support your child, you're doing great by reaching out to us ♥️
I was also considered very emotionally and mentally mature, and I hope you can find a good balance between respecting your kid's maturity and still protecting them, I know it's hard for a lot of parents to do that. I think it's good that you came to a nonbinary space for advice on this, honestly, not a whole lot of parents do.
Dude I would have given anything to have parents like y'all, it sounds like you're doing amazing. Especially if you kid feels so comfortable expressing themselves and who they are to you.
Hey this might make you feel a little better- I realized I was nonbinary/trans at 13 :) for me things started to get funky when I was 10 and started puberty, so from my experience that age is completely normal to start questioning/figuring themself out. My partner realized he was bi at 10, and the only reason I didn’t realize I was nonbinary sooner was because I grew up in a very sheltered household. As soon as I became aware of what nonbinary meant, it was like all these big complicated feelings I’d experienced my whole life suddenly made sense- so I wouldn’t call it a choice 😅 this is just who I am! My biggest advice would be to listen to your kid and give them the love and support they need to be themself first and foremost. I didn’t have supportive parents (my mom actually bullied me into not coming out till I finally got the courage at 21), and I think just knowing my parents had my back and loved me regardless would’ve helped me a lot. Even now I still wish my parents were supportive lmfao. 
Also, as far as your religious relatives go, please keep your child safe from them. I was in religious education from ages 12-18 and it completely destroyed my sense of self. I’m still dealing with the trauma from that time in my life 4+ years later. 
You have a very good heart, and it makes me so happy to see a parent who wants to be there for and help their child in whatever way they can. :)
you don’t have to be perfect, but you’re learning and trying and growing. you’re going to save your kid so much pain and they’ll never forget it.
Messing up pronouns is okay (for the first little while), but immediately (or try to) correct yourself. You won't catch it every time, but making an effort is 100% much better than just ""she goes by they/them.""

Pro tip: talk with them about which relatives it's safe to come out to/use gender neutral language in front of, and which they'd rather wait on. And be sure to respect that. Accidentally slipping a ""they"" to a relative said relative likely won't notice, but this is where you learn selective gendering - pronouns one way one minute and flipping the script for another set the next. As a closeted person, I had to do that a lot.
I came out as pan when I was ten and non-binary at 12. The journey of self discovery can be at any age
Gender affirming therapist here!  I agree with the above!  I work with kids too and imo the trifecta of teen trans support is this:  supportive home and family (this is non negotiable) trans affirmative medical support (like yesterday) and finally but still as important queer social support (friends, camps, therapy support groups, and other queer community).  Hope this helps!  Feel free to DM with questions.
The fact that you are already using they/them pronouns for them shows how much you care. You’re going to do great, and as a non-binary person I would love to have you as a mom.
You’re not wrong to support your child. My 10 year old is very much more mature than I was. You’re doing great! There is a great book called Genderqueer by Mia Kobabe, it’ll help you understand and see it in a way that breaks down the old archaic walls society has put up <3 your kiddo will probably like it too, it’s a graphic novel.
I started having feelings of not being cis when I was 7, it intensified when I was around their age as I hit puberty and took me until now (17) to accept that I'm trans. If I had a parent like you, who were willing to hear me out and educate themselves, maybe it wouldn't have taken me 10 years of denial to finally accept it. You're doing great, keep supporting your kid, it's a journey of self-discovery for both of you.
I hope someone has said this, but in addition to all the care and work you're already doing in this thread by showing this wonderful change in behavior and effort towards supporting your kid - but one of the best things you can do, for your kid's safety with the family and for your own happiness, is giving yourself more credit and believing in yourself and your parenting. You raised an amazing kid who trusts you with these aspects of themselves, these relatives that overstep can get lost! You're doing great.
Well, if what you've said here is any indication, I think you're doing a great job. Your child is lucky to have you.
The fact that you are here is honestly the sweetest parenting move. You are choosing to let your child express themselves and learn about themselves how they know best. 

I took time to figure it all out but access to the internet means more visibility for people and youngsters who are questioning. Please look for good role models for your kiddo in the LGBT world. You may find some you will look up to also :)
Oh ya, that's just cause you raised them well. Stable caring environments lead to rapid emotional growth. They are still young so they still depend on that stability to express more complex and nuanced understanding. When they grow up they can continue that practice of developing and providing a strong stable environment for themselves and others around them.
Definitely work on your own self esteem. Your relatives likely contributed to that problem. You deserve to feel good in your own skin and choices. You are doing a great job.
I think the fact that you have doubts about your parenting shows you ARE a good parent tbh. because you actually care and want the best for your child. you're doing fine mama keep it up 💖💖
I am sorry you deal with low self-esteem and overbearing relatives at the same time.

But let me just say, the trust of a trans child is so precious, they must really love and believe in you to have told you their truth. Many of us don't trust another soul until well into adulthood, and sadly some never do. The fact that they've showed you this part of themself really speaks to how they view your relationship. If you're ever feeling down on yourself, try to remember this, because they'll need you to maintain that love and trust more than ever. 💜

I’m really glad you found us over here, it says a lot that you were even willing to ask and even more that you are actually willing to learn! I’m really glad that I was able to help.
I think it’s important to remember that your kid can only figure out if using they/them pronouns feels right if someone uses them. When I came out as non-binary I said I was thinking about using they/them pronouns because I thought this language would soften the blow to others but it just created an out for them to never use those pronouns. 

I can’t speak for your child but I’d try using gender neutral language from now on. If your kid decides they don’t actually wanna use those pronouns they’ll let you know. But they won’t know if their comfortable if the person they’ve trusted to help them figure things out isn’t using them. 

Maybe start by asking “is it okay to say you’re my daughter or would you prefer if I call you my child?” Or maybe try using “they/them” in front of your kid for a day. At the end check in and see how the day of different pronouns made them feel.
In my experience when someone says “I’ve been thinking about using they/them pronouns” it means that they are sincerely asking you to use those pronouns for them but don’t feel confident asserting that as a direct demand. It’s not that they are unsure about wanting to use neutral pronouns, it’s that they are unsure if you are a safe person to make that request of. If you start using they/them for your kid you will show them you are a safe person to keep sharing with. But If you keep saying “her” waiting for a confident declaration they may just decide that you aren’t safe to talk to. It sounds like you may be the only family member who wants to support them so you really have to step up and make an effort here or your kid will feel like they don’t have anyone on their side. Using the pronouns someone has asked (or hinted about) is the essential to showing you respect them. Use they/them and call them your kid/child until they tell you otherwise.

If your child is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns now, that is something you should respect to show them you're listening. They might be saying they want to always be nonbinary or they might not and it's okay for people to change. They might come out as transmasc with he/him pronouns later, or say they're fluid between multiple genders, or stay the way they say they are now. (Don't be surprised if their name changes too.) You'll make them feel much more comfortable talking to you about their identify in the future if you believe what they say about themself, refer to them the way they believe they should be referred to now, and defend their right to self identify as any gender or sexuality. Ultimately, they're the same child, with a new set of words describing them. You'll probably want to do a lot of research about trans people. Learn what trans people say about themselves, rather than what non-trans people feel about trans people, because you'll learn more about how your kid feels about themself that way (and non-trans people on the internet who go out of their way to talk about trans people tend to be judgemental and hateful- not a good place to get information from if you want a good relationship with your kid).
okay it’s good that your kid feels comfortable enough to come to you with these things, but you literally just responded to “respect your child’s pronouns” by continuing to call them she/her and your daughter. i know its likely a hard transition for you, but typing is the absolute easiest way to make sure you’re referring to them correctly. because you can backspace and fix it. get better about it with strangers on the internet or you’ll never get better about it in front of your kid.
I'm glad my explanation was helpful! In regards to what therapist to see, I really would recommend seeing a gender therapist. A normal therapist is not required to learn how to handle gender identity issues. 

I think another important thing to mention is that your child might not feel comfortable talking to you about it if they do experience dysphoria, and it's possible they might not even know the word for it. Also, I am not sure if I explained it well, but non-binary people can indeed feel dysphoria around their bodies. I know in my case, as a non-binary person, I experienced a lot of dysphoria around that age and I never told anyone nor gave anyone reason to suspect anything was wrong. I felt a lot of shame around it and was scared what everyone would think. I started feeling dysphoria around my name as early as kindergarten. I didn't experience any dysphoria around my body until puberty started, but when it started, I didn't feel safe talking about my dysphoria and ended up self-harming to cope, and hiding that too. I'm not saying that this is the case with your child, but it's important to understand that it's a very real possibility that your child does already have dysphoria or might develop it in the coming years.

Edit: Wanted to add that dysphoria can show up as symptoms like anxiety, depression, dissociation, and/or symptoms similar to cPTSD.
I had a religious upbringing and was deeply uncomfortable with queer people before realising I was one of them. If it helps, you could tell your mother that there is nothing about trans or nonbinary people in the Bible. Jesus preached acceptance and compassion, and was happy to be associated with people such as sex workers, who were considered social outcasts. In my experience, the objection that many Christian people have to trans and NB people is that 'we were created in God's image, and disliking or wanting to change something about yourself goes against God's will.' If your mother says something like that, ask her how she feels about people dying their hair, getting breast implants, wearing makeup, etc. Why are some changes okay but not others?
Aw, girl. You just made me tear up. Again, I just have to say that people like you affirm my faith in humanity, not just spiritual things. You're a true Christian and a warrior for peace, how could God not love and protect you and your kid? May they bless and keep you both, always.

Thank you, truly.
Thank you I really, really appreciate your sincere 🥰words❤️ especially all the info you gave me about Dysphoria and other things to be aware of. I really want to be the best mom I can for them. Hugs
Thank you! What a lovely message to wake up to after retrieving a lost Pikachu at 5:45 am. XD Hashtag parenting is never quite what you expected but you gotta roll with it.
I mean the best advice you can give them is you love and support them, that they don't have to figure any of this stuff out right now! Yeah, I would look at getting her another counselor who deals specifically with LGBT youth if possible. Some LGBT centers also have support groups for parents of LGBT youth, that might be helpful for you also in understanding them and how best to support them.
As someone with top dysphoria I wouldn’t suggest binding so young. Just because of how risky it can be. That could maybe be an option in the future, but you really have to be safe about it. Sports bras are a really good option. Just make sure they’re getting the right size and not one that’s too small. Another thing that helps top dysphoria is the type of clothing you wear. Stay clear from stretchy, thin, or clingy material. Any shirts that highlight boobs or waistline. So basically no shirts that are “womens’ cut”. I’ve noticed thicker, shorter, and wider shirts seem to eliminate the shape of my boobs. I’m not sure what style of clothing your kid likes to wear but there’s shirts I get from a store called Zumiez that I pass a lot more in because it doesn’t highlight my chest. [This shirt](https://www.zumiez.com/welcome-baja-stripe-ivory-t-shirt.html) specifically and others in that shape. Depending on chest size and style of the shirt stripes are usually a no go but I’ve noticed that they’re just fine on these types of shirts for me personally. Mens or unisex hoodies are a good option. As long as it’s not too hot. Button up shirts are one of my favorites. You can layer them and keep them open and they’ll hide any side boob. Or you can wear them as just a shirt and they really don’t highlight boobs. As long as it’s not a tight one. More loose. If you absolutely have to wear something tight like a tank top because it’s summer, then darker colors are your best friend. They don’t show your chest as much. I can wear tighter black shirts because there’s not really a shadow or any depth highlighting my chest. Avoid v shaped neck lines on shirts or sweaters they’re usually meant to highlight cleavage. Any thick sweater, or crewnecks. Tucking your shirt in and pulling it out [like this](https://pin.it/1gGeiIx) creates a pocket where your chest has room to breathe and it doesn’t get highlighted. Also if anything has a tight waist it will highlight the chest. Which you can use a sports bra to try and fix or avoid those types of clothing. If you have high waisted pants and tuck a shirt in that’s too short or too thin it will show your chest. If you want to still highlight your waist but cover your chest you can either do the lil tuck and pull with the shirt or hopefully be covered enough with a sports bra, and possibly a button up shirt layered over. 

If you need any help figuring out how to put that into an outfit just ask me, and I can totally show you my personal outfits. I can explain what I’m doing with the clothes, so you can hopefully help out your child.
Thank you soooo very much❤️❤️❤️ I really mean it! I can’t believe how much support I’m getting. I’m literally sitting here in tears feeling so much better about the future. You have no idea how much this has really helped.
Thank you❤️ I am definitely going to look into that for them. They need a safe space besides home to express their true selves without worry.
Sorry for not realize what I was doing and really focus on my pronouns. I went back and tried to fix a lot of my comments. I am a bit overwhelmed with everything and other things going on in our lives so I’m not being 100%. I didn’t mean to offend anyone and I am really so thankful for all the support and information I have been given. Thank you for opening my eyes
Christians love to mystify children. Sooo intelligent mature etc. But they are just children. Christianity has a problem with infantilizing adult women and molesting minors. Id steer clear of seeing your child as anything but a child, developmentally. My parents did that to me and i wish they had not. It causes a lot of stress on the child to grow up too fast. It also isolates your child from their peers to think “they are not like other children.”

As far as exposure to the internet and such, many Christians are groomers (like your parents and my grandparents) that only talk about bad influence and exposure when a child is exposed to something they disagree with or that threatens their work in grooming certain values into the child. For instance, all the “bad influence” friends just so happen to be poorer, POC, LGBTQ+, Indigenous, etc. All the “bad influence” media just so happens to be non-Christian. All “bad influence teachers” just so happen to not be nuns, preachers, or ppl passing on their values. There’s no end. Essentially, they just want full control of your child’s mind. It is how they maintain their christian legacy. No matter what they say, it is of historic, divine, and political necessity that they influence your child. What the top reply says is SO RIGHT. Do not let them near your child, especially alone. My grandparents got ahold of me only a few times in my childhood and each of those times were… scarring. 

As far as your child being enby and pansexual, its not a big deal. They dont identify with either side of the gender binary (man or woman) and can love any kind of person. That is all it means. What i assume is hardest to wrap your head around is how someone could so easily NOT adopt the gender and sexuality orthodoxy and what it means for who they will become and if they will want you in their life. What you need to do is keep the philosophical work of understanding the gender binary on yourself. The more you know about feminism and the gender binary and how patriarchy and society create and maintain social categories, the easier it will be to understand someone who does not identify with those categories. Simultaneously, read some books by enbys and pansexuals. Fiction or nonfiction. It is important that you try and find as diverse set of authors you can and that they be enby or pan. (Children’s books written by them too for your kid, after reviewing them to make sure they are appropriate in content according to your values, of course). It is a different way of thinking and the one of the next best things apart from talking to ppl (like you did reaching out to us on this sub) is listening to pan and enby voices through their literature. 

Hope that helps! Good luck to you and your child :)
Sending big mental hugs your way for saying such a sweet thing and going through what you have. 🤗🤗❤️
Real, i felt that too and i prolly woulda realized if i knew those words existed
I’m so sorry your dealing with this trauma😢 Sending mental hugs across the miles🤗❤️ Thank you for the wonderfully kind words and advice. It does help to know that you knew so early. I guess to me it feels like such a big thing like something I might not figure out till I was at least a little bit older than my child is now. But I guess that’s the mom in me talking. I just don’t want them to grow up and have to deal with this world the way it can be with anyone who doesn’t conform or is different. I mean I was just a brainy, nerdy poor kid and that got me all kinds of picked on. I just want to keep the world from hurting my child but I know I can’t. It makes me feel so powerless.
That means a lot thank you

🤗❤️hugs , your words mean more than you know
🥰🤗 you have no idea how much that means to me because most days I don’t feel like it
Adding on to this great advice, just run it by your child to see who they would like you to use their pronouns around. Referring to them as they/them when talking to other people might out them, so it's a good idea to see who your kid would be comfortable with knowing about the situation. :)
That is a VERY good point! Thank you for bringing that up. I will start doing that.
I will definitely take that seriously. It makes perfect sense. They have a low sense of self esteem so maybe they are worried about how people will react? They came to me and their father two years ago and got a lot of support when they told us they were Pansexual. So I would hope that they would think we are are a safe person to confide in and tell how they want to do important things like this in their lives.
I will definitely tell them this too. I’m worried about them feeling like they have to label themselves. I just want to know what makes them feel like themselves.
You make a lot of sense. Thank you. I will work on it 🤗🌻
Oh my gosh that is super helpful! Because right now I have been super worried about them because they have been really acting depressed and having big problems with anxiety. It runs in our family to have depression, anxiety, bipolar and other fun stuff so I have an apt with a better therapist than the one they are seeing who works with a psychiatrist. So I could be looking in the wrong direction all together maybe? It could be what your talking about?
I wish more parents reacted the way you are, and I wish I'd had support growing up. Now I'm older and maybe a bit wiser, so I feel like helping folks out that are starting their journey (or supporting those who are) is a little way of being the change I want to see. I'm glad you've found it useful, and I wish you and your kiddo all the best. We're always here for help if you need us.
After reading your post and comments like this I'm positive that your child will get the support they both need and deserve. Thank you for not listening to the rest of your family, you clearly have your head on better than them.
The LGBTIQ+ community tends to be very welcoming and supportive, and there's a special place in our hearts for parents who support their children in exploring, understanding,and living their identities whatever those might be.

Welcome to the fam, fam!
as an nb person, this is a fantastic mindset to see in a parent. i can't speak for everyone, but making an honest effort to get it right and to improve is a lot more than many people do. (i still get my **own** pronouns wrong sometimes after four years using them, so i can hardly expect anyone else to do better!)
as another user pointed out, you're absolutely not offending anyone. You're in the middle of understanding this, no one's expecting you do everything perfectly right without being told how first, so really, you are doing a great job, keep it up!
Don’t feel guilty either because it takes TTIIMMEE for our mouths to follow our brains. My son is trans and it took about 6 months because I called him other pronouns for years. All the support groups and doctors , therapists and queer community folx said the same thing- as long as you keep trying and apologize it will eventually not be an issue anymore. You’ll get there :)
You are a wonderful perant, trying to understand your kid and they're pronouns. That is a marvelous thing. Hope for the best to you and your kid. And try to help them with this  adventure
I'm sharing this tip I got for getting used to a person using a new name or new pronouns, maybe it can help you too.

Have little training conversations with your child or another person if your child doesn't want to. Let them tell you something about them like their hobbies, how they look, what makes them themselves. Repeat those things using your child's pronouns. You can also do this alone by writing down things you know about your child while using they/them or simply repeat it in your mind.
Just here to say you're doing absolutely amazingly! This is a huge thing to process as a parent, and a huge learning curve too. Be gentle with yourself and compassionate to yourself too about how this may take you time to adjust to emotionally.  

The fact that you came here, and everything you're saying just shows how loving you are as a parent, and at the end of the day, no matter what anyone else says, that is by far the most important thing!! You're amazing, keep up the good work, your child will be so grateful to you, and you will be their safe space!

-Sincerely a 24-year-old non-binary psychology and counselling student who wishes that they felt safe at a younger age to talk to their parents about it!!
~~Not me finding out at 16 and I've told 2 ppl...~~
Oh! Thanks 😊
Another very important thing I just thought about:

Do not take your kid slipping up and referring to themself as ""she/her"" or with female terms as ""oh, they've changed their mind again"" because yes, we may accidentally misgender even ourselves, especially when it's still a fresh change.

Instead, if you really get the feeling they may be using those words/pronouns intentionally, check back in with them. They may have changed their mind again, they may still be figuring out which set of pronouns and which reference terms feel best, it may have been accidental slip-ups... It's always safest to keep an open communication instead of assuming.

And yes, with strangers is an excellent place to start practising so that it'll be easier and with fewer slip-ups with people who really count (like your kid, your family, ...)! :D
I wouldn't say it's looking in the wrong direction at all. It's very possible for trans and non-binary people to have those mental disorders, and family history is important to keep in mind. It just would also be helpful to talk to your kid about gender dysphoria, and ask them if they're experiencing any at all, whether it's around their name, pronouns, or body. If you can get a gender therapist in the picture, it would be easier to have that kind of conversation, and also figure out if/how to go about treating it. 

The one thing I'd recommend though is that you don't share it with your relatives if they do say they experience dysphoria. Odds are, your family won't treat them well, which could make things worse. Definitely tell your child that they can talk to you about this and you won't say anything to family or anyone else unless they say they are okay with it. Having that kind of safe space and support can be critical.

Also, I just want to say that it's really awesome that you're putting in the effort to understand them and how to support them better. I can tell you're a great parent.
Thank you I really appreciate you saying that 🤗🤗❤️
Please don't use folx, folks is already gender neutral. It feels preformative and frankly a bit dehumanizing to shove x's in everything to make it sound inclusive. It feels like you're saying we aren't automatically a person included in the language. Ex: humxns could be seen as implying nbs aren't human
I sooo appreciate that because I’m very bad at putting guilt trips on myself.
I absolutely type the x because it’s inclusive of neo pronouns, not to exclude anyone at all. I am non binary too, not just a performative person. Y’all been here a year. You can go they my post history. I’ve spent years as an activist and advocate. I am not performative for trying to as intersectional as possible with a single word. There are trans humanists too, so, sorry…but the x and the word folx is the biggest umbrella term and I am not going to change it because one person is speculating about what others *may* think. There are assholes actually saying we aren’t human now. No need for infighting.
I have a friend whose a mom to trans youth. I’m trying to get used to the terms but she transitioned to he pronouns and changed their name to Finn. I have absolutely no problem with something like this because like my friend I believe it is who you truly are inside “coming out” and it’s very toxic and deadly for you to suppress your true self. It can lead to something as horrible as suicide. So I’m more than ready to support anything my child throws my way I just wanted to understand things better. And have better information to give to my child in her decision and to bring up when people around us are being negative Nellys.
Wow❤️❤️❤️ You have no idea how much this words mean!!! The comfort this community has shared with me is priceless. I feel so capable now! Thank you for lifting me up with your words! I hope to be the best mom possible to my amazing child and hopefully help some lost ones along the way.
Well I Was Just A Couple Months Short Of 16 (Or Maybe A Couple Weeks... Can't Remember The Exact Time.) When I Finally Accepted That There's No Feasible Way I Could Be Cis, If That Counts. And Then Didn't ""Come Out"" Until Almost A Year Later. (I Did Kinda Like Half–Come Out To Some Internet Friends Earlier, But Ehh I Don't Really Feel Like Counting That.)
You're welcome!
Your words of support really do mean more than you know❤️ and I am taking all this advice, not just yours, very seriously. It’s good to have all this information and peoples opinions and insights. Obviously I do not have all the wisdom I need yet but I’m will to “bend” and learn.
Ahh, so happy that I could help!! 🥰♥️♥️♥️

happy international nonbinary day everyone!!		"Skeletor is an ally
I love this, but wouldn't ""they-person"" be more accurate? Or is there a difference between ""he"" and ""man""? I thought they went together like ""she & woman""

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong <3
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Btw I fucking love Skeletor I've always had a crush on him. It's nice to know he's an ally lol.
Maybe they are an enby boy.
Well “man” technically means adult male according to definition 1 but definition 2 says “a human being of either sex; a person “.  So They-Man works. It is their chosen name, they are still valid.
People can mix and match parts of their identities if they want to. I identify as an agender woman. I use “agender” to describe my innate sense of my gender (or lack thereof), and “woman” to describe my usual clothing choices, gender presentation, how people interact with me, and how I was socialized.
I think it's funnier this way since all superhero names end in -man or -woman but they-man sounds like... ""Wait, what?"" 😂

Also they man can be male presenting or male leaning nonbinary. Or man is just his last name.
I think my superhero name be would be She-Person. I'm nonbinary but use she her pronouns.

Edit typo

Edit even left a word out lol
The original meme was actually made by a transphobe trying to make fun of us, but they kind
of
failed on that :~)
it'd technically be more accurate, but i like to think of they-man as being genderfluid and also just enjoyin' the 'man' title for now \^\_\^
Aren't ""boy & girl"" binaries though?
Edit: Spelling
They prefer they now, didn’t you read the meme?
Thank you :D
Oh okay, that actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you for taking the time to explain it to me :D Now I know more <3
Yeah me too. I go by she her pronouns and wear dresses. I basically look like a girl. That's okay with me even though I am not binary on the inside.

One thing I want to do is get a binder nd lose weight so I look more androgynous but I'll never pull off someone thinking I'm a boy lol. And that's OK with me.
""They-Man, aaahhh! Master of the Them-Man, aaahhh!""
Ahh how hatred turns into humor
I have seen the term ""non-binary boy"" before. It makes sense to me, at least, as it implies you are a boy that doesn't confirm to traditional boy roles (or something along those lines).
Last I checked ""bog"" isn't a binary gender.
Oh lol, sorry for that!
FWIW in the winter I’ve had a few strangers call me “sir”. The bulky clothes are what sell it.

My 10 year old is nonbinary	"They told me their pronouns are they/her. I am doing my best to support them and have always considered myself a strong ally. I am trying hard to not make this about me, but I am struggling to understand and I think their dad is struggling even worse. We need help! So if you have the time to read my long post I would love your take on my situation and any advice. Even if you must drag me through the mud in the comments, I probably have it coming...

My poor kid started their period at age 9 and already  has b cup sized breasts. So before she even thought about gender or sex, her body breached the topic for us. We live in a very conservative state and since we don't match the status quo religion around here, I moved my kid to a very progressive school the same year she turned 10. The school is absolutely amazing, it is a safe place that she has thrived at. It has a unique culture- there are more LGBTQ students than cis-gendered, which is so awesome but I also worry the school may glamorize being LGBTQ just because it is such an awesome place where queer people happen to flock to. 

During back to school shopping they told me they want binders. I am so happy that they are feeling comfortable enough to tell me these things. She doesn't tell her dad or any other adult and hasn't come out to anyone but us yet. BUT I am pretty much against the binders. I told them we can get just sports bras but changing your body is a big step and I think we need to do some more research first. I told her that among this research, I think she should talk to her pediatrician about it (who I mostly trust to be accepting).

My other big problem right now is that their dad insists this is ""just a phase"". He would never say that to their face and is as cautious about pronouns as I am. But how do I get him to realise and accept that this may not be a phase? That our baby girl is a baby them and that is totally ok and changes nothing with our relationship? Of course, it could just be a phase, they are only 10 YEARS OLD! 🙃

My therapist told me that non binary is the most difficult for people to accept because humans like to categorize and place others in nice little boxes where they think they should go, non binary is two or more boxes or sometimes no boxes and the human brain struggles with that. I find myself struggling and I need to get out of the struggle to help my kid and do the right things for them. How can I do better?

Edit: I am blown away with the responses and in tears. Thank you all for your kindness and wisdom."	"> BUT I am pretty much against the binders. I told them we can get just sports bras but changing your body is a big step and I think we need to do some more research first. I told her that among this research, I think she should talk to her pediatrician about it (who I mostly trust to be accepting).

Binders are safe and non-permanent. It is not a ""big step."" It's literally the smallest step one can take to see if having a flatter chest feels better. It's not medication or surgery. It's a piece of cloth. You take it off when you're done with it.

> My other big problem right now is that their dad insists this is ""just a phase"".

The problem here isn't that it's a phase. Everything in life is phases. You had a phase when you were single, a phase when you were childless, a phase when you were a child yourself. Those phases have ended, and new ones begun. You being a child in the past is what allowed you to be an adult today. Phases are a normal natural part of all life on Earth.

The issue is that this is used as an excuse to dismiss someone's needs. It's just a phase *so I'm not going to practice your pronouns.* It's just a phase *so I'm not buying you affirming clothes.* It's just a phase *so I'm going to ignore what you're telling me when doing so is convenient for me.*

It doesn't matter if it's a phase or not. Your kid is having this experience *now*. Regardless of how long it lasts, til death or til tomorrow, is irrelevant. Let's say your kid decides next year that they're cis. What will they have learned from their parents? From you, they'll have learned that you stand by them no matter what, that it's okay to experiment and explore the variety and complexity that life consists of, that it's okay to be themself and that being their authentic self isn't a burden or curse. From their dad, it sounds like they'll learn that they're an inconvenience, a nuisance, someone that can be dismissed because they're ""too young"" or whatever. One of these is good for your kid, and one of them isn't.

I appreciate you standing up for your kid and trying to learn how to be a good parent to them. I wish more parents approached this with the same zeal for their kid's well-being that you clearly do. Thank you for that.

We do get asked parenting questions here pretty often, so our search function may be able to give you some insights. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/nq7d9n/im_writing_a_sort_of_guide_to_parents_of_trans/) is a thread we had a while back that I bookmarked as a good general primer for parents, including my comment there.

And [here](https://queerwoodworker.com/2022/04/just-a-phase/) is a blog post about the phrase ""just a phase"" that's a little more in depth than what I wrote above.

We're always happy to answer questions. :)
hi! first just want to say you seem like a great parent :)

a lot of folks think the big numbers of queer youngsters are because it’s “cool” to be lgbtq+ but it’s really just environments allow more people to explore their queerness from an earlier age, I say this as a femme non-binary 90s kid, who from a young age knew I was queer, tried coming out at 12, again at 15, and closeted myself until my late 20s when I was more secure, had less to lose

also being queer is amazing when you *are* queer because it feels amazing to be loved and accepted for yourself

being straight/het is great when that’s who you are, it sucks when it’s forced on you! gender and sexuality is a spectrum. gender is a social construct. gender is also a lived experience. let your kid explore

your kiddo knows something about themself, and that will change over time like all kids. a binder is not a permanent choice but they can be uncomfortable and you should check about the right fit. get some sports bras as well, let your kid decide what feels right on a day to day basis

ask your husband to do some research to broaden his understanding of gender. ask him to trust that he is out of his depth at this point, and that’s okay! like anything, when you are a beginner, start some research. listen to podcasts (anything featuring Alok), check out the videos of non-binary Jeffrey Marsh, maybe watch tv with non-binary characters living life (Feel Good on netflix is maybe a start)
Binders are like push up bras. They don’t change their bodies. 

Also, there’s no such thing as “glamorizing” LGBTQ. Our world celebrates and assumes cis/heterosexuality. A space where LGBTQIA kids can be themselves authentically and be proud of it doesn’t mean it’s “glamorizing”. Stop with this homophobic idea that queer kids must be embarrassed about who they are or uncomfortable or not talk about it.
I do want to comment that binders, when sized properly and used as directed, are safe. The issue would be if your child started binding with ace bandages or wearing so many sports bras that they constrict their breathing. Binding has honestly changed my relationship to my body. I still wish I didn’t have breasts, but I can free myself from a lot of that dysphoria for a bit if I bind. You’re doing a great job already by advocating for them, and using their pronouns. Just help them explore themselves and figure out what brings them joy.
hi, OP! my name is cosmo. i'm fifteen years old, assigned female at birth, and have been identifying as non-binary for about three years. first, i want to thank you for trying your best to respect your child and their identity, and for reaching out to our community to help support them better. i understand that you may not know everything about gender or what it means to be non-binary, but it's important that you take the time to research and educate yourself before you form opinions or make decisions for your child. this is a great place to start! there are a few misconceptions that i noticed in your post, so i wanted to address them.

1. you say that you worry your child's school may be glamorizing the LGBTQ+ community. so many people believe that the reason more and more people are coming out as LGBTQ+ is because the ""lifestyle"" has been ""glamorized"" or made to be seen as ""cool"" and ""different."" in reality, it's because being queer has become much more accepted over the years, and has gained a lot of REPRESENTATION through television, social media, the internet, etc etc. your child has been operating in a space where being queer is okay, or is even considered normal. they have probably LEARNED about different identities and labels that you have not, made friends her own age who are LGBTQ+, and found a way to acknowledge how and what they are feeling about their gender identity, which i think is GREAT! she is not being PUSHED to be non-binary, she is simply being taught what it means and that it is okay if she is.

2. binders are great, especially if they have a larger chest. chest binders do nothing to physically alter one's body; they are simply a piece of clothing that compresses against the chest area, which makes it appear flatter. they are incredibly safe as long as you are wearing them properly, and there are TONS of resources to help your child w/ wearing them. i have been wearing a binder from a company called gc2b for about a year, and it has helped tremendously w affirming my gender identity and making me feel more comfortable in my body. the only issues i've ever really had w binding were shortness of breath and a little bit of acne on my back. before i had a binder, i used to layer about three sports bras to try and compress my chest, and not only was it not nearly as effective, but it also hurt a lot more and was much harder to breathe in.

3. her dad thinks that it is ""just a phase."" i hear this one a lot from people, but honestly, who cares if it's a phase? if in a few years, your child comes to you and says, ""i think i was wrong about my gender identity. i am actually ____."" what does it really matter? they aren't legally changing their name, undergoing hormone replacement therapy, or making any irreversible changes to herself or her body, so there really is no consequence to letting them explore their gender. there really isn't! it's good that people have the liberty to question and learn more about themselves, their gender identity, and their gender EXPRESSION without feeling pressured to conform to their gender assigned at birth. 

OVERALL, i think you're doing a tremendous job parenting your child. i'm so glad they felt comfortable enough to talk to you about how she is feeling, because that can be very hard to open up about, especially to a parental figure. i want you to keep educating yourself and learning about gender identity and being non-binary. i also implore you to look into gender affirming care for your child and continue having conversations about what they would like to do (w/in reason) to make themselves more comfortable.

i'll leave a few links for you to look at, and you can also DM me for more information :)

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/breast-binding
i want to add here, that binders are safe and nonpermanent and i recommend one for sure if they want one, but PLEASE make sure they fit correctly! do your research with them and get the one you think is best, but for such a young child, one from amazon or ebay can be dangerous and potentially harmful. only get ones from companies that deal specifically in binders, customized ones like shapeshifters inc or For Them are even better! it's better for them to get a real and safe binder from their parent than a dangerous one through other means if they feel desperate.
They’re likely not done developing physically. Would you consider puberty blocking medication for them? Even if this does turn out to be “just a phase”, puberty blockers would give them time to figure that out for sure before completing puberty. 

Binding done periodically is safe. Maybe not every day, maybe not 24/7, but sometimes. And puberty blockers would help prevent their breasts from growing more.
The top comment pretty much says it all but I just wanted to offer a little of my own experience on the trendy thing. When I was in high school I knew of ONE gay kid at my school of over 1500 students. At one point I really thought I was bisexual, and my (usually supportive) mom dismissed it as a phase. And at some point (after experimenting with kissing several boys) I realized that indeed I wasn't bi. I just wasn't into other boys. Huh. Go figure.

Around 32 years old, I realized I'm not a man. My mom is supportive of that thankfully, and transitioning, while difficult, has greatly improved my life and sense of self.

The thing is, when I was 14, no one *talked* about trans people. I can't help but think, maybe if I'd been given a little more room to explore my ""bi phase,"" I would have been able to figure out a little more about what my brain and body were trying to tell me but I didn't have the words for.

So, what was ""trendy"" in my case was being cis and straight, and that really affected my life in a negative way for a long time.

Sorry this was long, but I think what I'm trying to say is, whether they still id as nonbinary or not in 15 years, how the people around them react to this is going to shape a lot of their thoughts about how free they can be to express themself and explore their own identity. No matter your gender or sexuality, that's a really important thing when it comes to living your fullest life.
I just wanted to add that cisgender kids go on puberty blockers for many reasons, starting puberty too early is one reason. I think even going to the doctors out of concern that a 10 year old already has B-cup might be an easier way to get puberty blockers than requesting them because they are nonbinary.
Whether this is a phase or not, your child is going to remember. Whether this is a phase or not, your child is going to use this series of events to determine whether they come to you with things in the future. 

I told my parents I was non-binary at the age of 13, and they brushed me off. Told me it was a phase and refused to even consider helping me. 

I’m 24 now and still non-binary. I’ve been in the closet for 11 years because of my parents. And I’m going no-contact soon because of the way they treated me when I was younger. Because they made it clear they won’t accept me. 

Whatever you do, just remember that your child is a person. A person who will remember how this felt and will use it later in their life to determine how they want to go about their relationship with you.
If you deny your child a binder, you are forcing them to live with mentally damaging, prolonged states of dysphoria. Ask your therapist about what kind of damage that does. As an enby adult who had no support from my parents whatsoever in adolescence, nothing hurts more than knowing you need a thing and then knowing that you can't trust your parents enough to ask for and get it. Also, not getting your kid a binder may lead to them doing patently dangerous things like using duct tape or ace bandages (the most common harmful substitutes used).

Sometimes, it doesn't take a child long after they start school, even in a more conservative setting wherein self-expression and self-exploration are discouraged, to figure out just by being surrounded by their peers that they aren't quite the same. The locker room was a nightmare for me being forced to be around guys to whom I was attracted, my body giving me away about that, being insecure about my nakedness, having it made fun of because my body wasn't developing muscle like theirs in spite of me working just as hard... My parents thought just me being attracted to guys was a phase, so I never told them about my dysphoria. It took me until 5 years ago to make sense of and get support for my gender identity.

I saw that your husband thinks it's a phase. This phase hasn't ended for me yet. Even when our parents mean well, we can feel when we don't actually have their support. Anything that boils down to, ""It's a phase,"" is doubt, and even if your baby never says anything about it, they know. We hear our parents' whisperings beyond our closed bedroom doors regardless of how quiet they think they are. Hubby needs to get on board at least for your kid's sake.

*eta:* I said nothing about the fact that you get huge credit for being where you are and at least *listening* to your kid and *taking them seriously*. It's more than I ever hoped from my own parents in 1996.
This is going to be a long comment, I hope you don’t mind

Binders are completely safe if used and sized correctly and if you purchase from a specialized store, like gc2b (there are others but this is the one I use personally). They’re just a piece of clothing that flattens your chest, that’s all, you shouldn’t use them for more than 8 hours at a time and they must be sized correctly, if you do those things, nothing can happen and there’s no need to ask doctors (who are probably ignorant on this matter, at least most of them) unless your child has any specific conditions that would put them at risk. If your child is healthy, they’re good and they’ll be fine.

Don’t use the phase thing as an excuse to not give your child the affirming care that they need, even if it is, let it be, there’s nothing wrong with exploring your gender and your identity, if anything, it is one of the healthiest thing a person can do. Just listen to their needs, respect them and do what they ask you to do.

Aside from their chest, you haven’t mentioned about any other forms of body dysphoria, I guess it’s too late for puberty blockers because puberty has already happened but I might be wrong, maybe someone more qualified than me can give you a better explanation. Puberty blockers are basically used to delay trans children’s puberty until they have a better idea of what they’re going to do with their body. You can either start HRT after that, or you can just let your body go through puberty as it would’ve on its own, they’re completely reversible and do not cause any permanent changes to one’s body.

In conclusion, the most important thing you can do is to be 100% a safe space for your child, somebody they can blindly trust and feel good around. In order to do that you have to listen, always, aknowledge, respect their struggles and their needs and do everything that is in your power to fullfill them.  Don’t force anything that is uncomfortable for them, communicate kindly, patiently, politely and respectfully. If you don’t handle this correctly, you’ll lose your child’s trust and potentially cause them severe trauma.

Contact a gender therapist if you need (emphasis on YOU, if you’re the one struggling, or your child as well IF they’re struggling, but don’t force it if there’s no need as gender variance is not a mental illness) I say gender therapist because they’re the only ones who truly know what they’re doing when it comes to trans mental health, the others aren’t properly trained and have a higher chance of doing more damage than good.

Edit: when I said that it’s very important that binders are sized correctly, it also means that you have to regularly make sure you change the size and get bigger ones, just like for all the other clothes as your child grows, since they’re really young and their body is still developing, so remember to double chack their measurements every now and then
I'm sure it's probably in the comments somewhere, but you can get compression tops that are not as tight as a binder but will help with their dysphoria. 

 My sister is trans and in her thirties, and knew since she was single digits old. My niece is trans and knew since they were 4 or 5. My kid and I are both enby and feel like we've always known, even if we didn't have the word when we were younger, or for me as a kid in the 80's, any support. They can definitely know at their age.
My dad said it was just a phase when I was painting my nails and playing with barbies when I was in preschool. So naturally when I started dreaming about, and feeling weird when I was around certain people of the same sex, I didnt recognize it for what it was. 

If their school is giving them the tools that they need in order to recognize who they are, then I don't think it's all glam'd up as you say. As well, binders are a clothing item. They arent going to change their body for more than a few hours. You've already recognized a similarity in sports bras(not the same thing, but you're trying).

I think you're doing okay, and you're asking all the right questions... but I do think you need to be a little more open to the needs of your child. Even if it is just a phase, they're not asking for something that is going to cause changes, let alone irreversible ones.
>but I also worry the school may glamorize being LGBTQ just because it is such an awesome place where queer people happen to flock to

Even if that is what's happening here...

I grew up in a conservative bubble where being straight, Christian, and affluent were glamorized. But trying to live up to those ideals made me miserable.

*But* it took time, and trial & error to figure that out.

Teach your kid to be thoughtful, to value insight and reflection - how to empathize with others and they'll figure it all out when they need to.

.

All that said, I theorize that a *lot* more people are queer than are aware of it. It's only when we have the freedom and acceptance to explore do many of us discover it.
You sound like a very caring parent and your child is super lucky to have you on there side. But over thinking the hole non-binary thing is not going to help anyone because at the end of the day they are still your kid who you have loved for all these years and using a different pronoun isn't going to change anything. Just treat them the same way you always have.
So, um, here’s the best way that I can explain my personal experience of gender, and I cannot speak for any other nonbinary person, but it has been helpful for the people in my life.
For as long as I can remember, my life has been very structured around gender. I was raised in Texas in a Southern Baptist church to be a Souther Baptist minister. I’m 37 years old now and AMAB. When I am expected to perform a role based around my perceived gender, or listen to things that are labeled as gendered, I have always felt like I was a small child watching a play in an auditorium full of adults. All of the adults are laughing and clapping and crying alternately at the play but the play is in a language that I don’t speak. I ask the adults to interpret for me and they laugh because everyone should understand the story. But I never did.
For me, being nonbinary is about not having to speak that language any longer. Certainly, it’s made life difficult in many ways because I speak my “own” language, it that makes sense? There were many times when I was sure that it was a phase, but over the years the certainty that it wasn’t just became stronger. 
The worst that you can do by allowing your child to use a binder and using their preferred pronouns is show them that you are a parent that they can trust and who loves them enough to not only accept them but respect them. 
Even a ten year old knows their body well enough to know if it doesn’t “feel” quite right. Maybe they will change their mind and maybe they won’t, but if you are by their side, regardless, then they won’t be so scared.
Binders are safe as long as they fit properly and you avoid things like ace bandages. gc2b is a great brand to check out! There's also transtape.

It's great that you're being supportive! And to the dad, everything is in phases. Even if their identity changes, it's still best to support it. Gender and sexuality is fluid and can change, but that doesn't mean we invalidate people for it. Just support her.

This subreddit will always be available to answer questions too! I'm glad you're being supportive and trying to learn.
Even if it is a phase, so what? I’m a queer person in my twenties and I still question my gender and have tried using hey/him instead of they/them pronouns. It might be a phase but so is life. Your child might or might not change how they want to be addressed and feel but isn’t it worth displaying unconditional love regardless of their gender?
As a fellow parent who went through this with my child a few thoughts.  Your husband may be going through phases of grief because he’s losing his daughter. It took me a few months to realize that this happened to me.  He’s may be going through denial right now.  Grief, anger and acceptance might be coming too. 

When our kids are born we have all these fantasies about major events in their lives and our roles in them.  Finding out my child was non-binary trans demiboy meant a lot of those things were no longer in the horizon for me. Helping to buy a prom dress,  supporting them through a pregnancy etc…. But the reality is they are who they are.  Those things were never in the cards for my kid. My kid came out at 16. I really wish we would have known when they were younger.  

Many others have put it so well. Even if it is a phase they need your unconditional love.  One of the hard things about some people who are non binary is that what they feel can change.  Some times daily.  It’s so easy the think oh they’re changing their mind, it’s not real.  But it is real.  Cis gendered people don’t question their gender.  Even if it is a phase and they decide they are a female later, knowing that you believed them and supported them will be way more important than anything else. 

You’ve got this!  And buy the binder. It’s really no big deal.  And when you see someone one call them sir in public and they just light up, you’ll know it was worth it.
I hit puberty at the same age and my chest developed when I was 10. I remember throwing absolute FITS when I had to wear “normal bras” like “all girls do”. And the gendered clothes and short shorts and low cut tops all made it worse to the point where I just covered up my body to hide. I was told it was just a phase I would grow out of and once I was through puberty I would love my chest. Surprise, I’m now 25 years old and JUST figured out that I’m non-binary. The years of being told that I was in a “tomboy” phase halted my exploration of identity. Thankfully now I have freedom to chose what is right for my body and self expression.

My two parents can’t get their heads wrapped around this though. After 15 years they still think it’s a phase. Mine ended up being a core part of me, but even if it is a phase (because sometimes people try labels and they don’t work, which is fine) your child deserves respect and space to figure things out. No matter how much or how little they choose to explore this idea. I don’t know what you should tell their dad, but he’ll either need to get with it or deal with the fact that your kid will know not to turn to him when they are going through something.
You’re already doing a great job by being so open and listening to your kiddo, their expressions and needs. Researching binders is always a good idea, I don’t use one personally but there are many great companies out there. If I could, I would also recommend finding a good gender therapist in your area. They could help your entire family understand better what is happening, help your kiddo feel safe, and help your husband understand that this is more than likely not a phase. Children understand gender and gender expression, and know even at a young age when their gender does not match their biological sex. Just know that while it may be overwhelming now, it will get easier.
I will ad this here, as I’m not sure if it’s been said: 

Binders are generally safe, but when used incorrectly (IE too often, too long periods of time, too small, etc) it could end up bruising  your ribs and preventing top surgery in the future, if your kid so chooses to get it.

I recommend trans tape. The kind I get is on Amazon, but you can find them all over the internet. The most “injured” you can get from it is a couple scratches, but it’s more safe then a traditional binder.

You are a GREAT parent for trying to support your kid. The child may not realize it now, but having a supportive parent like yourself will benefit them so much and help their mental health. Even if they turn out to be cis, they will be thankful for the love and support they received. Not many people have that. 

If I was in your position though, I’d let them experiment. Do your own research on different ways to bind, and help them do the safest way possible for them. 

PS also tell the kiddo that a lot of NB people use two sports bras as a substitute as a binder as it’s safer generally
Everyone has already said most of what I would say as well. But I also just want to say how much I appreciate parents like yourself who want to do the best for their child and try to be supportive even if it’s personally difficult for them. It may be difficult for you but I can say without a doubt that the love and support of family makes a world of difference in the life of a queer person. I speak from personal experience as someone who did not have a supportive family growing up. So thank you for doing your best for your kid!
I know you're coming from a place of love and that you want the safety of your kid. Know that if they ask for a binder it is that they're feeling bad. If you don't provide a binder and help them research how to bind safely, they could use inappropriate stuff and risk damaging their health, and cause injuries.
I would say the safest bet is to research with them, find a good binder and just enforce rules you all agree on so that they are not wearing it to bed, to do sport or for too long.

Honestly, if it is a phase, they got a chance to explore and figure it out and that is great and super healthy for them. They are lucky to have so much support to explore themselves this young. And if it is not a phase, showing your full support is showing them they can always come to you with their concerns, that they can trust you. 
So, basically, supporting them and helping them is making you win as a parent whatever the situation is.
As others said, a binder is a temporary relief, it's not dangerous and it's not permanent so go for it using ground rules.
In regards to doctors, definitely look for doctors who have experience with trans patients, because most doctors outside of therapists, surgeons, and endocrinologists who work with trans people don’t know much about our healthcare needs. In regards to binders: they aren’t permanent, and if they fit correctly and aren’t worn for too long, they are a very safe option for an adult/older teenager. That being said, I’m not sure how safe they are for a 10 y/o whose bones are likely still changing. At the very least, I would make sure to check that the binder still fits properly on a regular basis. I definitely wouldn’t recommend wearing too-small sports bras instead of a binder, since sports bras aren’t designed to minimize the chest. I’ve definitely found that trying to bind with sports bras is more painful and unpredictable than using a binder. I’d probably recommend that they use trans tape - it doesn’t go all the way around the ribs, and its good option for someone who has a smaller chest. Also some people on here mentioned looking into puberty blockers - I’d agree with them. Puberty blockers won’t reverse or even stop your kiddo’s development, they will just slow things down and give them some time to think what kind of puberty will make them feel the most comfortable in their body. They may very well go off puberty blockers at 16 and just complete their natural estrogen puberty, but at least this will be a deliberate decision rather than something that nature forces them into. Puberty blockers are safe (as much as we can say any drug is safe), going off them is enough for puberty to pick up where it left off. They’ve been used for kids who start going through puberty way too early for quite a while, and as far as I’m aware, the only longterm side effect that we know of is that they might cause someone to end up being a bit shorter than they would have had they not taken puberty blockers.
>My therapist told me that non binary is the most difficult for people to accept because humans like to categorize and place others in nice little boxes where they think they should go, non binary is two or more boxes or sometimes no boxes and the human brain struggles with that.

Your therapist put it into words very well and I’m glad you have that support. Most of what I came here to say has already been said better, but I’ll just add that you’ve already taken some great steps and I’m sure your kiddo appreciates the love you’ve shown them already.
Y'all binders are safe for adults and older teens, but OP's child is 10. They have a TON of growing left to do, both soft tissue and skeletal. I remember rapidly changing clothing sizes when I was that age; so did my brother, so did my step kid, so does pretty much everybody. I think it would be incredibly difficult and cost-prohibitive to keep this kid in binders that are safely and correctly sized for their changing body, and I would be concerned about the effects that constant compression would have on a developing skeleton. I think talking to their pediatrician before binding is a good call, especially if they're in a trans-affirming area. It also wouldn't be a bad thing to talk about puberty blockers, since it seems like even without the gender issues, OP's child might be experiencing precocious puberty. A flat sports bra would be an excellent compromise while they're growing, though.
Looks like some great comments on here but just wanted to pop and and say my child she was assigned female at birth is 10 and non binary so if you ever need an ear feel free to
Message me :) . 

We found a trans youth group that was amazing it functioned over zoom and then in person as well and it allowed me to learn a lot. Like hormone blockers aren’t as scary has some have made them out to be and that gender can be fluid for some.
I don’t have experience with the specific body issues that your kid has to deal with, nor do I have experience with parenting, so please take that into account when assessing my advice. That your looking for ways to help and support them is awesome; at the end of the day having people around us that support and accept us is important (with us being “people” just as much as “LGBTQ+ people”).  


As far as binders are concerned, some caution is reasonable from my understanding. If used inappropriately, with wearing them for prolonged periods of time without breaks and during exercise being the times I’m most aware of, there is the potential for injury. That being said, when used following the guidelines that are out there and by listening to your body for the signs of problems before they become severe, they can be of great benefit and value. Think about it like medication: as long as you follow the dosages and timing for it - eg the medication might be “no more than *x* pills *y* times a day, don’t eat for an hour after taking it”, whereas the binder might be “wear it for no more than *x* hours at a time, don’t wear it while sleeping or any time heavy breathing is likely” - then any problems are unlikely to pop up, and will be manageable if they do.  


I want to talk about the glamorise/phase issue, because it’s the kind of thing that pops up in a lot of places and has the potential to be magnified and distorted by both pro- and anti-LGBTQ+ people. As a few people I’ve seen here have already said, it’s possible that despite your kid saying that they’re nonbinary now they may come to realise something different somewhere down the track. Maybe they’ll work out a more specific category of nonbinary-ness that applies to them (agender, demigender, genderfluid/flux, the list goes on….), maybe they’ll realise they’re trans, or maybe they’re cis and whatever feelings they had that led them to nonbinary were actually signs of some other element of their life. That they’re physically developing earlier than the other kids around them may be a factor that makes them feel like an outsider, wishing they weren’t the way they are physically that has morphed into a desire to not be as feminine presenting. Maybe this otherness feeling goes away as other kids start to go through the same sort of changes, but maybe it doesn’t. (I was the opposite, desperate to start shaving to show I was an adult, which I think at least somewhat got connected with the latent wish to not be a boy, resulting in wanting to be a man, until 20 or so years later realising that wanting to be an adult and not wanting to be a boy didn’t in my case mean being a man but being a nonbinary adult.) It’s also possible that they’re right on the money with what they’ve already told you: that they’re nonbinary and will identify exactly that way for the rest of their life. Regardless of any of that whether this is a temporary phase of their life or not, it’s real for them here and now. If there was a movie coming out that they wanted to see because it has their favourite actor, or it’s of a genre they enjoy, or based on some other property that they love… regardless of the reason they like it now, you wouldn’t deny them seeing it because they *might* like something else in the future.  


I’m not going to deny that kids can be influenced, and certainly will want to emulate people that they like and think are cool. Having said that though, they also often understand a lot more than we tend to give them credit for. Whether or not that understanding is as nuanced as it might be in an adult, and whether or not they can articulate that understanding as fully as an adult that tries to drop in words like “articulate” into a reddit post, they still get stuff. Is it possible that there’s a person or a group at the school that your kid thinks is just completely awesome, who happens to be nonbinary that they’ve latched onto and want to be like, and so they’ve decided to be nonbinary too? Yes it is. But if it’s just a form of hero worship, why did they latch onto that aspect of this person and not something else? It’s likely that there’s some aspect of themselves that connects with that idea.  


It’s easy to look around and see that there are more people identifying with more terms under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. More people are openly gay, more people openly transition from their gender assigned at birth to their actual gender, more people are changing their names and announcing their pronouns… more people are being open about who they actually are rather than who their “supposed” or expected to be. At face value, it wouldn’t be crazy to think that there was a fad element to all of this, and it wouldn’t surprise me if there were a handful of people out there who claim to be something they’re not for ingenuine reasons. But a big factor in this apparent explosion in the numbers of LGBTQ+ people is that more people are seeing that it’s okay to be who you are in more places, that there is less stigma and more support (though neither of those are where they should be yet), and that people are seeing more possibilities. There are so many aspects and moments of my life that I look back on now and can see that we’re signposts to me being nonbinary, but I had no idea about it as a concept for the vast majority of my life. I first came across someone in media several years ago, and when they introduced themselves as being nonbinary and using they/them pronouns I had no idea what that meant. I was in my 30s when I first encountered the concept. A few years later I’d come to realise that that’s who I was, and so many of those past moments made a whole lot more sense.  


You can see the same sort of trend (a term I’m using in the mathematic/analytical sense rather than the style/fashion sense) with left-handedness: there was a period of time where the number of left-handed people was sharply increasing, but then it plateaued and has been fairly steady since. It wasn’t that it became popular or a fad, it was that it stopped having the association with being bad and wrong and evil, so people stopped being forced to be right-handed, which allowed people to just be themselves. (In this aspect at least.) The experts that actually study these things say the same thing about queerness today: as fewer people are actively against us, with more people being of not actively supporting and accepting then at least no worse than being indifferent to us, more people are able to feel comfortable to be out as themselves. The more people who are out, the safer it feels for others to come out. The more openly things are discussed, the more possibilities are understood, the more opportunities there are for people to have a better understanding about themselves.  


Let your kid lead you in this, while telling but more importantly showing them that you love and support them. If they’re comfortable with it, talk with them about how they came to their realisation. If they’re name is particularly associated with a gender, ask them about whether there’s a shortened form/nickname that they might prefer to be used (eg “Sam” instead of “Samantha”/“Samuel”), and whether they want you to use a particular name/pronouns in certain circumstances. This is particularly important given you’d said they’d not come out to anyone else yet, as outing them before they’re ready is a huge no-no. Are there other gendered words that they are comfortable/uncomfortable with? At the end of the day, you know your kid better than we will. You’ll be better placed to know if they want it shouted from the rooftops or treated like it’s nothing.  


Good luck to them and to you in all of this!
Everyone here has already mentioned that binders are safe when purchased in the correct size, I just want to add that by telling your kid that they can’t wear a binder for now you are leaving them to wonder if a binder might make her feel better with her body as opposed to just giving the binder a try so they can know how it feels. It’s possible they might try on a binder and realize it’s actually not for them, or they might love it. They can’t know how they’ll feel unless you give them a chance to try, and some day hopefully they will appreciate your willingness to accommodate them when they were trying to figure themselves out.
I wouldn’t suggest a binder for a kid that young. Rib growth is incredibly necessary and you don’t want to get in the way of that. Binders are 99% safe but having an option that’s 100% safe, go with the 100%. I would buy your kid a compressive but safe sports bra, considering that they’re a small cup size and should be able to get results they’ll like. If they don’t like the results they get, spectrum binders are designed to be safe for the ribs, but that should be your plan B. 

It very well could be a phase. They could realize that their dysphoria was simply discomfort with a changing body, and that they prefer to present in a gender-nonconforming way. You know what’s the worst thing that happens if you support their identity? They realize about themself that they aren’t trans, and they know they have your support no matter who they are. If they come out as gay, or have scary news, or don’t want to go to college, they’ll think back to when they were 10 and their parents supported who they may have been. They’ll trust you more than they would if you’re unsupportive. 

The best thing that happens if you support their identity is they realize young who they are. Personally, as a trans person who hit puberty young, (eight or nine, like your kid!) I felt dysphoria when I started puberty that has only gotten stronger as I got older. Having the support of my parents meant the world to me. They didn’t always understand, but knowing they cared meant I had a place I knew I was safe. 

Talk with your kid about their feelings. Ask how long they’ve been feeling how they feel. Talk about ways you want to fix their hard feelings. Do they want a haircut? Do they want some new, more neutral clothing? I’d suggest trying the use of they/them pronouns more. I’m aware they use they/she, but you mostly used she in the original post. That’s okay! It takes time to get used to a change. But it will really mean a lot to your kid if you put the effort in, and take the time it needs. 

I recommend the books “How to They/Them” by Stuart Getty and “Life Isn’t Binary” by Meg John-Barker and Alex Iantaffi if you’d like to understand non-binary identity better. Even if your kid turns out to be cis later in life, you understand the world around you a little better! 

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. I really appreciate when folks ask questions to be better ally’s.
Edit for formatting, sorry for the long reply!
Binders aren’t a permanent thing. Think of them as a sports bra that flattens out the chest even better! Just make sure they don’t wear it longer than 8 hours. As for it being a phase, it’s possible your child may realize that they are cis, or maybe they turn out to be trans. Or agender. Whatever the case, you need to stand by them, and support them! I wish my parents were as accepting as you! You’re doing a good job so far!
As someone who had almost this exact experience growing up in the Bible Belt, but kept quiet about it to be safe, I’d have absolutely felt so much better with a binder back then. By the time I was in 4th grade I had a huge chests, and one of my teachers even told me I needed to wear a bra, when at the time I couldn’t find anything that didn’t hurt or that fit properly. 

A binder would be a fantastic help for your kiddo, and it’s not permanent or harmful, so long as you choose the correct size and make sure they’re not wearing it 24/7, as in taking breaks, not wearing it to sleep, etc.
Hey, I'm a non-binary LGBTQ+ activist also from an uber-conservative state. I'm going to just answer some of your questions/concerns in list form here. It's a long reply, but I want to answer each concern as thoroughly and correctly as possible.

1) When working on education or asking questions, don't get too caught up in guilt about not doing better or getting dragged through the mud. Nobody's born knowing everything, and in terms of education on gender and identity, good resources to learn are few and far between. Don't take not knowing things personally, all it'll do is stress you out and make things harder than they are.

2) Getting your kid to a socially progressive school environment is a very good thing. It'll likely have problems like all schools do, but any way to minimize the amount of transphobia your kid might experience is good at their age. As for the school ""glamorizing"" being LGBTQ+, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Kids always fixate and get super-invested in things at that age, whether it's dinosaurs and astronauts or cartoons and Pokemon. Fixating on being LGBTQ+ has some difficulties that other fixations don't, due to how prevalent transphobia is right now, but so long as your kid has a community to support them they'll be as fine as they can. I'd recommend seeing if there's a PFLAG chapter in your area; it's a support group for parents of LGBTQ+ people.

3) Binders are an item of clothing used to make a person's chest look flat while the binder is on. They're only dangerous if worn too tightly for too long at a time, but in the same way that regularly wearing shoes that are too small can mess up your feet. It might take some trial and error to find the right size, but once you do they're no more dangerous than wearing a tie to work everyday.

4) I can't give specific advice on what to say to your kid's dad, since I'm an internet stranger and don't know him or his personality. That said, in my experience, I think the question of whether it is or isn't a phase is kind of irrelevant. Gender, like every part of a person's identity, isn't a static thing that's the same at all times in all parts of the world. Arguably, every point in life is a phase; a person will likely be wildly different at ages 10, 20, and 40. **The thing to focus on is that your child is still the same kid; the word to describe them just changed.** Maybe it is a phase, maybe it isn't; at the end of the day it's still the same kid you both seem to love and care deeply about.

Let me know if this helps!
Okay so binders aren’t permanent but I totally agree with discussing things with a doctor first. Non-binary might be a stepping stone for your kid or it might be their home either way that is for them to figure out in their own time. It sucks that your husband is skeptical but I suggest reading some books on the subject, even if he doesn’t say it to the kid’s face the kid will most likely be able to pick up on his attitude.
first of all, your curiosity and eagerness to learn and understand is very heartwarming to me. don’t let your fear of getting things wrong get in the way - i’m nonbinary and i got it wrong when i was first starting out. it’s part of being a human and it’s obvious you want to support your child…that’s what matters the most. they’re incredibly lucky. i knew i was nonbinary at 7 but didn’t know there was a term for it at the time, which caused a lot of pain and confusion. your kid is lucky they have access to the knowledge that’s more mainstream now.

it all boils down to assessing and restructuring the way you’ve viewed gender all your life. it’s hard to understand this if you haven’t completely reframed your view of gender. it’s a construct. it’s something we’ve made and something that’s enforced. gender isn’t sex; it has nothing to do with genitals. ask yourself what makes a woman a woman and a man a man. intersex people exist, a lot more people are intersex than you think! it requires you to disassemble society’s view of gender in your mind, that’s what makes people so uncomfy. it also takes time.
there’s a podcast called Gender Reveal that talks about gender and how much of a social construct gender is. they have an episode called Gender 101 and highly suggest.
I was given this advice when I was in college and one of the members of our GSA asked what to do when their parent is struggling.

Your child struggled to figure out who they are. And you knew them for 10 years as one way. Don't beat yourself up. You're doing great by supporting them and respecting them. And if it takes time, that's totally fine. The important part is you're actively trying. You've even on here asking for help and to see if what you're doing it right. You're a great parent. I'm sure your kid knows it.
Binders aren’t a “big step” or “something that will change their body”. A binder is the smallest step you can possibly take with starting a transition. They aren’t permanent and do not cause any problems, unless worn while exercising or while worn in bed.
my thoughts while reading:a binder isn't going to change their body any more than spanx changes yours. my spouse was kinda cautious with a binder at first with our trans son, but we asked our kid's doctor and he said it was physically fine (when worn carefully- not during exercise, no more than 8 hours a day, take good breaks from it, take it off if it doesnt feel right etc) and we got him the [https://www.gc2b.co/](https://www.gc2b.co/) binder and he only wears it sometimes, but it works very well.

impermanence doesn't imply insignificance, even if it is just a phase. Your kiddo is ALWAYS going to remember how you treat them with this, they came to you and told you something very important to them, and this is going to define how much they trust you for the rest of their life. If you call them by the right name and pronouns, let them dress how they want and present how they want, and they DO change their mind... in ten years, it will not matter at all. There will be no long term harm that comes from respecting your child, and they will see that you are on their side, and supporting them.

&#x200B;

Edit: you might also find some resources and people going through similar things on r/cisparenttranskid , I'm nonbinary myself, so not entirely a ""cis parent"", but I still find a lot of good on there!
Apologies if this has already been said. But I think the invalidation of ""it's just a phase"" is actually something that prevents young people from genuinely and holistically exploring their gender identities. Like, if someone says ""it's just a phase"" you're going to do everything you can to prove to them it isn't. So if you have some doubts about your identity, instead of exploring them you will shut them out because if you do change as a result of those doubts you will be confirming this premise.  
One of the things I learned about gender in my experience of coming out to myself and others as an adult was that the best way to figure out what I really wanted was to try things and see how they felt. I had the respect and understanding of the people around me, and that made it easier to try things like wearing new types of clothes, exploring makeup, using they/them pronouns etc. What I found in that experience was that I knew pretty clearly when something was or wasn't right for me. But if I felt like not being sure about everything was going to suggest to others that I ""wasn't serious"" about being nonbinary, it would've been harder for me to be honest with myself about various things. 

I think when you're exploring these things as a kid it's gotta be fundamentally difficult. Your parents may want the best for you, but they also want to ""protect"" you from the danger of not conforming to a particular gendered ideal. There is a grain of truth in that parental impulse, which is that it is safer to be cis than to be trans in this world for a whole number of reasons (obviously the big one is transphobia); however, you cannot ""make"" someone cis or trans. This form of ""protection"" really only holds people back from exploring their identities open-heartedly. 

I may be over stepping here because I have never been a parent. But what I would wish for myself is to have had a space within my family to explore who I really was (even the things that sat outside the bounds of my assigned gender). The idea of queerness as an either/or is a construct that I think makes this incredibly difficult, so it is really important to make sure your kid knows that there's no threshold they need to pass to identify a certain way. Your own identity as a queer person can take the shape of who you are, and it doesn't have to match up to a specific term or label; a label is a tool that can streamline the way you describe yourself to other people, but it is not a container that you need to fit neatly into. 

As is always the case, I have gotten ramble-y here. There are certainly more coherent and focused replies. But I hope you (or anyone else reading) can take some morsels out of this.
I wish I had the vocabulary for non-binary and other queer terms when I was OP’s kid’s age. 

You can see the non-binary screaming through my childhood pictures as I flip flopped from acceptable conservative WASP nest looks and what was actually comfortable and made me happy. 

Don’t be surprised when you’re asked about top surgery. I developed fast and the world is cruel to large breasted people.
The best thing you can do is support them, whether or not you personally feel comfortable with it. Because here's the thing: your kiddo may only be 10 years old, but ultimately they are the one who knows themself the best.

Up until this point and whether or not you knew it, you've played a large role in determining your kid's identity. You saw them as the gender assigned to them at birth and that was that. Now, your kid doesn't need you to do that for them anymore. They're maturing. They're moving into the next stage of life where they are becoming more intellectually and bodily autonomous. They're weighing what they've previously been told about themself with what they actually feel, and they've found out that it doesn't fit them. That comes with a real sense of loss for you, both from having to deal with the actual change your kid is going through, but also because you're confronting that they're not quite so much of a child anymore. But at the end of the day, this situation isn't about you and your needs. This is about your kid and what they need. They're telling you what they need. So listen to them. Let them have the things they need. 

Even if you don't like the idea of them wearing a binder, binders don't actually hurt the human body in any way. And if it is a ""phase,"" (which I don't think it is either) your kiddo will stop wearing them on their own. You have nothing to lose from getting them one, and the support that you show by loving them unconditionally will do so much more for your relationship than if you try to lay down a line that forces them to be something that's not who they truly are.
People have added a lot of great comments to this, so I won't reiterate what they've said. But I have to stress: your child will likely bind whether or not you get them binders. Think of it like sex education (obviously, there is nothing sexual about being transgender, but this is my closest example). People will have sex whether or not you give them sex education and/or access to contraceptives. The difference is that one way is **safer and controlled,** while the other can be **very, very dangerous.** Buying your child a binder will virtually eliminate the possibility that they break a rib binding with ace bandages because you wouldn't buy them a safe, fitted one.
I'm just surprised that they are having their period now, so idk if binders might be big or not. But even I'm waiting for one and I'm a teen. I just suggest do your best to help that growing kid best you can
even if it is a phase, you should still respect your child’s wishes. people go through phases all the time, what’s the harm in using different pronouns or a new name for a while. being unsupportive of them coming out will only make them want to rebel

Hi, non-binary person here. I first expressed that I was gender non conforming when I was in the 4th grade. Was not in a safe environment to fully express myself until adulthood. I am going to offer a bit of perspective. It is probably going to come across as a bit harsh, in all honesty. 

You call yourself an ally then spend the rest of your post trying to justify not adapting to the changes your child has asked you to make (pronouns, comfort in physical appearance). Have you even taken the time to research this at all before coming to reddit? Yes, it may take some time for you to mentally process your kids new pronouns, but it is important that you at least try, which you haven't done on here. Binders are not permanent, and there are a lot of companies that make a safe product or that can be used. Since they are so young I would probably suggest more of a compression top type binder (for them and tomboyx make some good ones), but for a full  binder as long as they are measured correctly, bought from a good company, and not over used (no binding for more than 8 hours, don't wear it overnight) they are completely safe and non permanent. Some good brands are gc2b, Underworks, and spectrum. Don't buy anything with clasps on it for a binder and don't buy off Amazon. 

As for the rest- yeah it may not be the identity they will stick with all their lives, but the way you and your husband act now will impact them the rest of their lives. The suicide risks for LGBT kids who have parents that are unsupportive are through the roof, and as much as you can say with your words that you are an ally, you need to show that with your actions as well. Just using a kids chosen pronouns and correct names significantly decreases the amount of suicidal ideation and attempts they will experience in their lifetime. It could be a phase. It probably isn't, as most people I know who have experienced gender dysphoria and are trans knew when they were their age. But it isn't your call to determine if it is a phase or not. If you react negatively when you think it is 'just a phase' you may find yourself with a kid who has broken off contact with you as an adult because you are no longer trusted with information with their life. 

I would challenge you, if you are an ally to unpack that mentality. It is incredibly dismissive and kind of homophobic to hold on to 'its just a phase' and keep that in your vernacular.
I think nonbinary is hard for people to wrap their heads around because gender is not a feeling, it's a knowing. In psychology, they teach you that there are 5-6 feelings. Joy, disgust, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise. You don't feel male or female or nonbinary, you \*know\* you are. While focusing solely on their internal sense of gender, it is VERY hard for cisgender people to describe that internal sense. If you ask yourself ""how do you know you are a man/woman? what does it feel to be a man/woman?"" you'll find it hard to answer. However, when asked ""when did you know you were male/female?"" you likely knew very very young. 

The best way I can describe it is this: ""I was raised a girl but I always knew that neither boy nor girl was the right way to describe me.""

The main thing I want all young non-binary people to have is acceptance from parents that let them explore and make gender presentation choices at their own pace. If they want to change their clothes, hair, name, wear a binder...etc. whatever. Cis people can do all that too there's no reason why it should only be allowed if the child is ""truly"" trans.

It's okay if they ""glamorize"" LGBTQ positivity at the school. I \*like\* who I am. Liking me means liking and embracing all of me, the nonbinary part included. It is not at all something to be ashamed of or hide. Being nonbinary allows me a great sensation of gender freedom and a unique perspective and open-mindedness that allows me to be more understanding and kind to others. This is something I like about myself. And there is nothing wrong with thinking you are nonbinary and then changing your mind. Gender exploration is allowed and provides people with valuable insights. 

The biggest fuck up my family made when I ""came out"" was that because I can hide who I am, they encouraged me to and never spoke of it again. I don't think we've talked about it for years. They wanted me to keep my name, my clothes, and my pronouns. Never to talk about it. And to live in stealth mode my whole life, never having a moment of gender euphoria anywhere but in private all by myself. The better move would have been to say to their child ""this is your life. what do YOU want?""

If it's a phase then so what? I bet you my parents still think being pansexual and nonbinary was a phase I went through in my teenage years because I present female and have boyfriends now. It's not. I've known that neither boy or girl describe me best since I was 5 years old. And of course, while my parents see that I have had a boyfriend, they don't see the gay things I get up to lol.

I was asking people how I could be made into a boy when I was 10. If I had known back then what non-binary was, if I had known there were opportunities to explore, I would have been over the moon excited! I present female because I like looking professional and put together and can't do that well with a masculine look because of my body type, even if I get top surgery. I'm never going to pass as androgynous or male and that doesn't matter. On the inside, my gender identity hasn't changed. I changed my name when I was 14 and I LOVE my new name. Every time someone has said it for the past 10 years you can just see me glow with gender euphoria. I gained confidence I never had.

The best thing is to just let your kid explore, and support the exploration. If you want to help yourself understand mentally the best thing to do is to read books and watch some docuseries on Youtube about parents raising gender-expansive children. There are actually a lot on there. That really really helped me when I was going through this when I was a teen. 

Also, it's best to order chest binders that are made for this type of thing. You can learn about safety with chest binders so that they aren't motivated to DIY it with tape or ace bandages or whatever else is lying around your house because that will cause problems.
I was 8 when I went through puberty and it was horrific and I'm left with lasting trauma due to how it related to my non-binary gender. I understand this is difficult, but your child NEEDS support and access to treatment such as binders and puberty blockers (if they desire; they might just benefit from them due to their precocious puberty regardless of gender identity. I'm abnormally short due to my precocious puberty) to prevent further damage to their body. Being forced to be a woman (especially when you're not one) that young is really, really difficult. My DMs are open if you're curious to hear more specifics about my experience with precocious puberty and being nonbinary. 

I highly recommend reaching out to PFLAG as a family to help understand what's going on in order to provide your child with the care that they need. Their dad especially. Be prepared to defend your child as ferociously as needed, listen to them, and provide them emotional and physical support. Even if this is a phase (recent data shows that in trans kids with a median age of 8, 92% of them remain their real gender identity into adulthood) wouldn't you want your child to know that they can come to you for anything and remain loved and supported? PFLAG had resources for families like you and can likely help you and their dad with the final hangups you may have. It saved my partner her relationship with her mom (the dad wasn't able to be open minded and she had to cut him off after he stopped participating unfortunately,) I highly recommend it.
I recommend getting them a safe binder that’s properly sized otherwise they might bind with improper materials that WILL damage the ribs and lungs. Either way your kid will probably end up binding, it’s better to give them the safer resources. Idk if it is a phase or not, but it probably doesn’t matter because being there and supportive in the moment is all that does matter. My mom bought me my first binder, and I still wear them (I’m 23), they’ve never damaged my body. I can even workout in them. Just leave it to 8~10 hours of wearing, so maybe only at school. Glad your kid feels safe with you btw.
Good luck

So many of these comments say everything better than I ever could but on the topic of binders I do want to chime in. Peruse around the nonbinary subreddits  a little more for binder recs (r/ftm and r/trans have some too). I've seen a lot of posts about gc2b not being good quality anymore and I know for a fact that they run small. I've heard good things about forthem (which looks more like a sports bra) but I haven't tried them. I personally swear by underworks.

As long as the binder isn't used during activity like sports or exercise it's as safe  (and less uncomfortable than) a bra. I wear one all day, every day and have done for a few years. Because of the all around compression, getting used to it a little at a time is important so taking breaks is key
I'd say it is smart to stick to sports bras for now, and maybe if they still feel the need for a binder then get it. As for your husband saying it's just a phase, I'm not really sure how to help there but maybe explain that even if it is a phase, it's still who they are now and time will tell
Binders.. don't change your body. That's pretty much the whole point. They're for trans, nonbinary, and gender non conforming youth and teens to feel more comfortable in their own skin without making irreversible changes in case they decide they wish to present more feminine when they're older. Let your kid get a binder. If you're worried about it causing damage, buy one that's adjustable.
Binders are perfectly safe and will not change your child's body permanently any more or less than a sports bra (a lot of us wish...) The only thing that causes permanent changes are hormones, and even not *all* those changes are permanent; obviously, ten may be a bit young to be taking T. If your child is having some body issues, I'd talk to your pediatrition about potentially hormone blockers; as far as I know, this just hits the ""pause"" button on puberty. With the fact they've already gotten their period and developed a chest, I'm not positive what benefits it has - I'm not a doctor and I didn't figure out I was NB until I was wellllll past puberty. 

As for your husband, it's perfectly fine for him to currently be under the impression that it's ""just a phase"" as long as he's still using proper pronouns and respecting your child. Could it just be a phase? Sure. But I also urge you both to come to terms with the fact that it's most likely not. 

As far as I can tell, your child isn't asking for anything life-changing. Get them a binder and support them in any way you can. And if you're not sure how, feel free to ask them. It's okay.
binders are completely safe and non-permanent. it's the same concept as getting her a push up bra, except they're going for the opposite look. it doesnt change anything, it's just a garment of clothing
You’re amazing for this, binders as safe for their body as long as they are worn correctly so make sure you teach her about how to safely wear one. :)

First I’m so glad that you are so supportive but I do have some suggestions to make both of y’all more comfortable😁
1.you can talk to them yourself and just ask them questions, like “I suppose you and id like to know more about how you feel so me and your father can better support you” or something like that
2. I am glad you didn’t dismiss the idea of binders completely because if can very much help their gender dysphoria which comes with a lot of non binary or trans people. Sports bras are a great start. And when y’all are both comfortable u can do some more research on binders since they’re relatively safe if you know how to wear them, I would suggest not putting binders off the table.
3. I think it would make your kid super happy if you could talk to their father to made sure he won’t say anything he’ll regret. I myself am non binary minor and I know what little things a parent can say that will stick with their child for a lot time. So try to educate their dad to try to be more supportive.

I honestly think you are doing an amazing job though, because you are trying. And that is the best you can do sometimes , and using their pronouns, going to therapy, and asking how you can improve yourself, you are being such a great parent !! 😁❤️

Good luck to you both !!!
If they want binders, you can get them some! They want to experiment with their looks, and a binder is really just a piece of clothing for those who want to have a try at a flat chest.

The LGBTQIA+ thing is not a phase, it wasn't a phase, and it will never be a phase! As a no-box nonbinary person, I say let them experiment with looks so that they can find out what look fits them best!

Me, I haven't gone to find a binder yet, but I want to try it sometime!
Much of what I’d like to say has already been commented on below but I do wanna say that I run a project that gives binders to people for free! Unfortunately it’s limited to the state and city we serve BUT i also give educations on the safeties of binders, wear and care, tips, do’s and dont’s as well as answering any questions and most importantly as well: how to FIND the right binder in terms of style, ability, and measurements. You are more than welcome to message me and I’d be happy to give the run down. Much info is on reddit and online as well and redundant but also varies some and I’ve condensed all that when giving educations. My DM’s are open or you can always email projectbinderfinder@gmail.com and I can provide a list of resources as well.
Even if it's just a phase, we go through many of them and all of them should be respected.
I was deep in the closet as a teenager because it was ""too early"" to express myself. Right now my mom also dismisses my identity because ""it's too late"" to change.

There is no ""right time"" to understand yourself, your child may choose a lot of ways to explore their identity. Maybe even they are seeing themselves as nonbinary because early puberty pushes us into a gendered role we are often aren't ready to embrace. It's awkward, it's uncomfortable, and they might feel they should be ""just a kid"" for a while longer.

You probably remember how scary is to ""become a woman"". If you grew up in a more conservative household you might have seen your parents becoming suddenly serious, having ""well so you're not a child anymore"" talks. It's a huge pressure that comes from changes you cannot control.

Just let your child be whoever they want to be. Respect the way they want to approach and embrace their own body and image. Help them feel comfortable and confident. If it's just a phase, that's okay.
Can I ask why you’re against binders? The only thing I can think of is a concern for safety which I understand, but all you have to do is talk to them about how to use it properly. 

Make sure they don’t wear it more than 8 hours a day, take a couple (or more) days off from wearing it each week, and don’t exercise in it. Tell them the dangers of not following those rules so they understand. Properly measure them to assure you’re getting them the right size binder. I can’t think of any reason to be against it as long as you use it properly?
First, since I saw you mention binders being something you're against, as long as it's used sensibly and you buy the right kind of binders, they're completely safe (personally I use GC2B ones, they're amazing to me and I like to use them as shirts sometimes too!). Usually, when binding, it shouldn't be used for more than 8 hours, and there should be some breaks between uses (e.g. 3 days on, 2 days off, but it's whatever works best for your child).

In terms of explaining non-binary, try seeing gender like a Venn diagram. One circle for male, one circle for female, and an overlap for some non-binary folks, and others can exist outside of all the circles.

So far, you're doing a great job with helping your kid. You're actually using her pronouns and they're comfortable enough around you to open up about what they feel like they need to have to feel comfortable. Try researching binder companies that are safe to wear while also being affordable, and feel free to ask any more questions here. I'm sure there's plenty of us to help!
Be supportive. I’m learning too as a parent and have a long way to go.  Whether this is their authentic identity or a ‘phase’, being supportive is the best approach.  I see a lot of girls my daughter’s age identifying as they/them/she/her.  At some level they are rejecting the notion and expectations that the binary concept of womanhood brings.  Whether that is their authentic identity or they’re ‘pumping the brakes’ so so speak from a place of anxiety in their perception of an over-sexualized society that they aren’t prepared to engage in… it’s all good.
Well, getting a binder would not change her body. It would just make her chest appear smaller. Only difference between sports bras and binders is the binders making the breast appear smaller than sports bras, and wearing sports bras would probably make her feel more dysphoric.

Also, their dad can’t assume that it’s just a phase. It’s try that sometimes people can be confused, and realize that they really are cuz. They are also a child, but if they truly feel like that, then it wouldn’t just be a phase. No one should tell her it’s just a phase or something like that, and people should always support her, no matter what they realize to be
You're a great parent, and you're doing really well. You're using your kid's pronouns, and letting them express who they are. From a non binary person whose parents didn't let them do these things... Thank you. ❤️ 

I work in mental health, and one of the biggest protective factors for trans and non binary youth is having people use their pronouns and chosen name. It's also widely recognized by LGBTQIA positive mental health providers that the only treatment for gender dysphoria is allowing people to transition. It's important that you let your kid explore their gender and access what she needs to do this!! 

As far as binders go, there is a safety concern, especially since she is young and still growing. I would encourage you to do some research on binder safety and communicate with your kid about how they can bind safely. I recommend GC2B binders! The ones with books like bras can be very dangerous. It's also important that they don't wear their binder for too long a stretch at a time! Please do your research, but as others have pointed out, binders will not permanently change your kids body unless worn improperly. They won't stop breast development, but they can lead to rib injuries if they don't fit well or are worn too long. I highly highly recommend you buy your kid binders and make this an open topic. If their breasts make them feel uncomfortable, they'll likely find a way to bind them, and it may not be safe. Also trust me, when you see how happy they are when their body looks the way they feel inside, the joy is contagious. 

As far as your husband's outlook goes, this kind of thinking is invalidating and harmful. The truth is, your kid might realize down the road that they're not non binary. They may be trans masculine, a trans man, cisgender, or simply queer. That's ok though!!! The important thing is that they're allowed to explore that and allowed to find relief from the gender dysphoria they're feeling. The damage done by not allowing them to transition if they are trans could be grave. If they aren't trans and this is just something they're exploring, the worst that happens is that they learn something about themselves... What's the harm in that? 

The Trevor Project is a mental health and suicide prevention organization that has lots of wonderful resources on supporting trans and non binary youth! I recommend checking them out and reading up on these topics! 

""A Guide to Being an Ally to Transgender and Nonbinary Youth – The Trevor Project"" https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/guide/a-guide-to-being-an-ally-to-transgender-and-nonbinary-youth/
While many people have already said this, I definitely encourage you to do more research on binding! It’s perfectly safe as long as you’re using a properly fitted binder and don’t wear it for too long at once, doesn’t permanently alter your body, and ultimately is way safer than not binding might be — if someone who experiences chest dysphoria doesn’t have access to a real binder, their dysphoria is likely to feel even more crushing and they may resort to using things like ace bandages to bind, which CAN be dangerous. Binding is a completely non-permanent way of managing dysphoria and is perfectly safe when done correctly.
I'm nonbinary. I always felt out of place in any gendered activity. I assumed this was how every body felt. I assumed it was normal to feel like I want to die when being told about being a girl and what girls are supposed to do and not do. At age 10 I realized this pain was because of having to by boy or girl and wishing I could opt out. Never had any concept of anything queer so I just went on assuming life was painful for everyone and at 12 I started regularly praying for God to kill me sooner. 

Learning as an adult some people reject being a boy or girl let me know there was a way to live life and not be in pain. 

If your kid seems excited, it's probably because it's pain avoidance, not because it's ""glamorized."" For every person that openly supports us there are 2 more that are openly against us. 

I understands it is confusing. Sometimes we're confused to. I'm confused as to how to wear my hair so I don't feel like a liar pretending to be a woman (I wish I was bald.) 

But please try to do what helps your child feel better. Because if you reject it there is a high chance you would be directly causing them pain. I think you don't want to cause pain
Hello, im max, a masc leaning nonbianary kid
I just wanna say you are an absolutly amazing parent for being so open as to hear our thoughts on how to help you understand this

Im assigned female at birth and i presented as such for many years. I only came out as nonbianary to my own mother as recent as a couple of years ago but i understand the fear of your child trying to change their bodies as such a young age. Or at least, the idea of them trying to change

Ill be honest, this story really hits close to home for me, i started puberty in the begining of 5th grade, and while gender identity wasnt a concept i was very familiar with nor cared to be, I did suffer from major dysphoria for years. I grew up in a mostly liberal but Very cis/het town, i never had anyone queer in my life to refer my experience to till midway through middle school. But even before then i was finding ways to keep my chest pinned down in very unhealthy ways.

Dysphoria doenst come from just wishing to be like ones peers, and it can be very dangerous. 
I tried to come out as a trans man to my mom when i was twelve, but all i really wanted at the time was just to have a binder.

Naturally she was just as scared as you are now, of me hurting my body, not only because i was growing but i also had asthma as well and she refused to entertain the idea of any kind of binding.
In the end i hadnt been able to wear a properly fitting bra for years until very Very recently. I still have the sports bra from middle school that would lock up my ribs and kept me from breathing deeply.
It was never a fun experience, and i didnt tell anyone for years. Anxiety and dysphoria can make you do a lot of things, especially when you feel isolated in that experience

But theres so many more resources out there now that i never got to have. And as everyone says, there are safe ways to properly bind ones chest without risk as long as everything fits properly
And even that little bit of acknowledgment and opportunity grow can mean so so so much
Perhaps it is a phase, but thats what we as humans do. We try different things, some work out and some dont, and we forge out identities through. Those expirences
And i think giving your child the space to learn and grown into whatever it is they may be is a wonderful thing. It really does warm my heart to know your kid is getting a supportive parent to help them through this new path they are trying
I think there are a lot of very good comments that give advice already, so I only have one thing to say:

THANK YOU

For believing your kid, for deepening your knowledge about this, for everything you do for them, THANK YOU
There are a lot of really long comments here so I'll keep mine short. 

I'm really glad you are being so supportive of them. This is a really difficult time for parents with trans children and it's always so heartwarming to see parents reaching out places like this. Your kid will thank you when they're older. Unfortunately, I think it's wise to be equipped to defend them. Understand the things people say about trans and nonbinary people (ex. ""it's just a phase"", ""sex and gender are the same"") and be equipped how to tell people they're wrong. 

While I don't want to say your therapist is wrong, psychology is a study of individuals and culture, meaning culture influences individuals behavior. Our culture is changing; being more accepting of our diversity, more critical of ourselves and our traditions. Nothing in culture is rigid. It ebbs and flows through each of us, from one generation to the next. Discovering the spectrum that is LGBTQ is part of the slowly changing tides of our human existence. It's discovering that we are who we make of ourselves. We decide who we want to be, and we create our destiny. 

That being said, people may have a hard time understanding, but not because of an innate human trait. Nonbinary isn't necessarily multiple boxes or no box, it could just be a third box. It could also be that boxes don't work for gender, being that men and women alike are called out frequently for not fitting in their box, or are pressured to always be in one. 

I hope this helped, though I know I probably made this bigger and more confusing for you. Still, I encourage you to look up more on gender expression. And keep supporting your child. Protect them how you want, keep them informed on their changing body just like normal, but let them be who they want and dress how they feel comfortable. I wish you the best of luck
There are teams kids that know at 4,so there's nothing weird about up or 10 year old exploring their gender identity! In fact if being queer wasn't ""trendy "" aka known to general public she might've spent years being depressed because they could tell something wasn't quite right but they wouldn't have had the knowledge or words to expresses what she wanted.
Firstly, you seem like a great parent. If everyone has this attitude, the world would be a much better place.

But aside, there's gonna be a lot of discovery here. I think the important thing to point out is yeah it *might* be a phase, but it might also be a huge part of their identity, and the opportunity to self discover now will save years down the line. If hrt or surgery is something they want to pursue in the future, then having explored already will save the effort of having to do so beforehand, both for making sure, and because legally that can be something that's required. This is *especially* important when you consider some treatments decrease effectiveness with age. Much like if they wanted to cut their hair or wear some new style, you should just let it be, maybe it'll be a passing thing, or maybe it's part of who they are. Ultimately they will remember that, and it will affect how they view you. Either you'll become the parent who kept them from exploring who they are, or you'll become a caring parent who nurtured and guided them through this, even if it wasn't truly who they are.

Also binders are harmless, just teach them good binding technique and it'll be fine.
Sup, anyways you are doing good, and I was Nb since I was 10(recently came out as trans boi)and I have experience with this stuff, usually sports bras do the trick coz binders can me constricting, I don't have much info to share, so good luck to you and your homo sapien spawn
If you don't help them with it, they'll probably go elsewhere and that's when they can get into unsafe situations. You don't want them buying t shots under the table and doing it behind your back. 

It might be a phase but that doesn't mean one should be any less supportive. Your child will learn through this who they can and cannot trust to be their real selves around, even if that self changed through time (which regardless of gender identity it will). 

Also Re glamorizing LGBT; I'm sure this has been harped on but can you imagine if we said the same the same thing about heterosexuality and regular schools glamorizing THAT? Because they are. So is mainstream media. In fact we're constantly bombarded with messages that heterosexuality and being cis gender is ""right"". I would take a good long look at your own prejudices you're bringing into these conversations. This forum was a great start! But now you have the task of unconditionally supporting someone through this process and that's going to require real, hard work yourself. It's pretty ducking cool you get to do this with your kid. In my day (lol) kids went through this alone and ashamed. I don't recommend that path unless you want them on anti depressants or worse
I’m 49, AFAB, non-binary. I knew I was different basically from the earliest point I can remember, but I didn’t have the language to describe it until about 2011. Thankfully, your child doesn’t need to go through the same fear, confusion, and self-doubt I went through, because they have the ability to experiment with terms in a safe and supportive environment. 

It doesn’t matter if it’s a phase. This is the point in life where it’s okay to try on new pieces of personality. A binder won’t change them permanently. New pronouns won’t change them permanently. Nothing here is harmful in the long term, so long as they’re treated with respect and given autonomy over these choices.

They may change their mind later. Or they may not. Either way, affirming their gender decisions now will also affirm their trust in their relationship with you.
Your better then my parents they call people like them and me It and completely ignored me coming out and use my dead name even more now

Your husband is wrong, my parents say it’s just a phase even though I’ve been this since 2018 that’s far worse then simply not liking your child cause that makes them think their feelings are genuine and can screw with them

And try and have a open mind, that’s how I got rid of my terrible ideas and misgendering friends cause I was to lazy to learn, it all takes time but I’m sure they’d appreciate the hustle even if their to young to truly understand (I tried rephrasing that but it only came out worse)
Is like to pose a warning. My younger sibling came out to our family as nonbinary about 2 years ago.

My step-dad was of the opinion that it was all just a phase and that my younger sibling was being influenced by their friends at school. So he refused to go along with it. He refused to use the correct pronouns. He continues to use very gendered language when referring to my younger sibling.

And guess what? My younger sibling made a plan. Since the prospect of coming out didn't go over well with their dad, they decided that they would intentionally act as if it was all a phase from the beginning. They stopped talking about gender identity. They stopped experimenting with clothing.  My sibling and I are close so they told me that they are going to basically pretend to be a ""good little girl"" until they turn 18 and can move out of the house and never be involved with certain family members ever again. 

My sibling has managed to learn that they cannot trust their dad to support them. And now at the age of 15 they have accepted the fact that they are going to have to break ties with many of their family members simply because no one has believed them when they've said that they aren't a girl.
As a genderqueer person, I’d say the best thing you can do for your kiddo is to love and respect them. Actively listen to what they say, without projecting your own experiences/thoughts on to them. Continue to do research when you have questions. Remember that everyone has their own experiences and just because something is true for one enby person, it may not be true for your child. If you and your husband don’t already have your own therapists, I’d strongly suggest finding someone. 

I didn’t find a label that fit my experiences of gender until my late 20’s and was super anxious to come out to my very religious mother. But she surprised me by responding with love, listening and educating herself. We had some great discussions about gender as she learned new things. That unconditional love and support is why we have a relationship now. 

Check in with your kiddo to see how different pronouns and other changes feel to them. Create a safe space of open communication and listening to one another. Let go of who you thought your kiddo would be and celebrate who they are. Gender is so personal, don’t allow yourself or your husband to push preconceived notions onto them. Explore your own gender identity with your kiddo, see the world through their eyes. If there’s something that concerns you or you don’t understand, tell your kiddo that you need to do some research and you’ll get back to discuss it further after you have more information. I’m not saying agree to absolutely everything, but leave your biases at the door. 

You’re off to a good start, keep the momentum going. And light a fire under your husband. Being a parent is incredibly challenging, but will help you grow as an individual and family cultivate true respect for one another and yourselves. The work is totally worth it.
One quick note on the binder - not body altering, but make sure you get one that fits properly and make sure they take breaks with it - they can wear it when they go to school or go out, but when they're home and relaxing especially alone they need breaks from it. Fucked up my ribs bad when I was younger by wearing too-tight binders for 16+ hours a day.
First, the binders are not dangerous like you seem to think. Definitely do some research on measurements and proper binder care before jumping into buying one (the wrong size can cause pain/discomfort and sizing too small can pose a safety risk) but binders are literally the least invasive, least permanent thing your kid can do when it comes to transitioning. When binding becomes genuinely dangerous is when done with improper materials like ace bandages, which can cause actual harm to your child. Binders are no different than any other piece of clothing. Also, so what if it's just a phase? Everyone goes through them, but claiming it's ""just a phase"" and not respecting your kid for what they are going through right here and now is only going to do one thing: make them understand that they can't come to you for unconditional love or support. I understand for you and your kid's dad this is a ""big change"" and ""difficult,"" but please realize that this isn't about you. You are allowed to have complicated feelings about something that you maybe don't entirely understand, but please still place your kid's wellbeing and needs first. They matter more than your comfort during this. 

You're on the right track and I'm glad to hear that you're trying and willing to learn. That's so important! A lot of the other comments I've been reading on this thread have great resources and are accurate/trustworthy. A lot of the links I would have posted have already been done. Just keep an open mind and keep learning, and keep loving/affirming your kid no matter what  :)
Everyone is saying binders are completely safe, I disagree. While yes they’re not permanent, they can be dangerous. Make sure they don’t wear one too small since they are young, they are growing and can easily grow out of one making it too tight on their chest affecting their breathing. It might be hard to notice because they might like how it looks but you need to keep their safety in mind. Also make sure the binders are not worn during physical activity or at night because it can be dangerous. It squeezes the chest and if it’s not the right size can really damage your kid. As long as it’s the right size and they understand when they can and cannot wear it, it’s completely safe. But I don’t want anyone overlooking the potential dangers if used incorrectly.
This is so well put. It also occurred to me reading this as a parent, thinking about this, kiddos go through phases all the time, and most parents still support that through purchases if they have the money . Liking Lego phase? Buy legos. Liking soccer? Invest in soccer stuff. So saying it’s “just a phase” in order not to buy affirming clothing shows internalized transphobia in a different way. Even if it were just a phase, as the comment or here says, we all have phases in life. Even if it were just a phase, support it. And as far as binders, maybe it will help you to just think of them as shapewear. As a non-binary person I felt a little weird about binders until I thought of it this way. All bras are shapewear in a sense, they’re just going for a different gendered shape than a binder. Bottom line is that supporting your child will help them feel good and feel good about your relationship. Not doing so can have pretty severe mental health and relationship consequences down the road as well.
Binding is safe IF done correctly! OP please make sure to research how to safely bind before allowing a ten year old to do it. There are health risks if not done properly. If you refuse to let your child bind, they may turn to unsafe methods. It’s important to make sure they know how to do it safely.

Well put together ✨
Excellent and well-put.

Binders were the first thing I ever did to affirm my gender, and there was a noticeable difference in how I felt about myself and my confidence.  If there is concern that your child may wear (or want to wear) their binder for longer than 8 hours, you may want to consider a compression top that is not as “binding” but still gives the flattening effect that your child wants.  [TomboyX](https://tomboyx.com/collections/gender-euphoria/products/adjustablecompression-chai) has a compression top, and [Girlfriend Collective](https://girlfriend.com/products/black-mia-high-neck-bra) has a sports bra that many trans/non-binary people have compared to a compression top (though it does appear that it is being discontinued 😢).

As far as it being a phase, I am 23 years old and I am not out to my parents because I have constantly heard comments like that about trans/non-binary people from them (even though they say they are LGBT friendly 🙄).  I have accepted that I will probably never share this part of myself or my life with them, which is honestly unfortunate for them.  Children are more perceptive than we give them credit for, so even though you and your husband are trying your best, your child may feel that there are things she feels are off-limits to discuss.  Tell your child explicitly that you are listening to them and how they feel, and that you are working on addressing your own feelings about the matter to better support her.  It will make a huge difference, I promise.

(Edit: forgot to include that TomboyX is a great brand in general for underwear etc., though it is a tad expensive)
You, my good person, get an award.
Exactly I wear binders/compression top sometimes and the rule is you don’t wear them for longer than several hours a day and you NEVER sleep in them!
My only concern is trusting a 10 year old to adhere to safe binding practices, I knew so many kids (including myself) who wouldn't even wear a bike helmet. If OP is confident they and their kid can handle that responsibility, full steam ahead I say! 

This comment spells it all out really well, a lot better than I ever could've. Good shit.
And even *if* it’s something the child will grow out of, the best way to help them figure out who they are is to respect who they say they are so they can learn and figure out what feels right. If you never let them live as non-binary how are they supposed to figure out that feels wrong if they’re actually cis? Or a boy? Or something else?
Thank you SO much from the bottom of my heart. I have read all your posts and threads and dont even have words for how grateful I am 🙏🙏 I've changed my mind on the binders and giving my husband some reading to do. Thank you for being such a kind and caring human ❤
The BBC also has a great podcast called NB that I found really validating!
I am 25, so relatively young. I have grown up in a relatively liberal, openly gay and trans place. I came out as trans at 22 and even though I “pass” as the gender I transitioned to, it has NEVER been cool or fun to be openly trans. I mean it’s nice to feel like myself and sometimes that’s cool. But society as a whole is definitely not accepting and I think even a 10 year old would pick up on that.
Thank you so much for your comment. We are both in research mode! Thank you for introducing me to Jeffrey marsh and Alok! I have been watching all the videos and ordered Aloks book off amazon. I am so grateful that such amazing humans exist! ❤❤
The shtick about ""glamorizing LGBTQ"" is often rooted in the idea of the""gay recruitment"" conspiracy. 

Basically, the accusation thrown at queer rights activists is that they where trying to lure children into the ""homosexual lifestyle"" by ""glamorizing"" it.

Tale as old as time...song as old as rhyme...
Exactly! 
If you don't give your child a binder (which, as stated above is very very safe!!) they will resort to an alternative that is easier to obtain, such as bandages, but it is also more dangerous
Oh my goodness Cosmo, you are wise beyond your years! You give me hope! Thank you so much for your comment and great links. I am doing all the research I can and have changed my mind about the binders. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your great advice ❤
Yes! I would say the fact that improper binding can be dangerous is all the more reason it's so important for them to have a supportive adult in their life who will help them find a way to do it safely and comfortably! Binding is only dangerous when ppl feel backed into a corner and have to improvise.
It’s also better because it makes it clear that it’s important and worth spending time/money on. It celebrates them for who they are rather than just feeling like it’s “permitted” for them to be non-binary.
Thank you so much for your comment. I have changed my mind on the binders and am looking for a customized one. Thank you for the information and giving me a good place to look for the right one!
Exactly! There are even guidelines for safe binding. No more than 8-10 hours a day, take breaks, don’t sleep in it, etc, and you’re good.
Under the guidance of a pediatrician — i don't see why not
Thank you so much. I hadn't considered puberty blockers. Your comment and the one above inspired me to do some research and I am trying to get my kid into a pediatric obgyn who has experience treating trans and LGBTQ patients. 
(I also changed my mind about the binders 😉)
Thank you. This is something I hadn't considered. Your comment inspired me to do some research and I found a pediatric obgyn who has experience with treating trans patients in my area. I am waiting for a referral to be able to get my kid in to see them. I find it a bit frustrating that her current pediatrician never brought this up despite problems she has had due to heavy periods, etc.
Yeah. That's what I'm thinking, too. Ten really is on the early side for puberty; if I were their parent, I'd be seriously considering blockers just for that reason, to keep them from developing while all their peers still look like little children--to give them some time to be a child before they start looking like a grown-up. Ten might not be so young that puberty blockers are actually indicated for precocious puberty alone, but it IS on the young side. With both those factors there, it might be worth thinking about. They might already be so far into puberty that it wouldn't do much--but you won't know that unless you find a doctor and talk about it.

That said,young AFABs are not in nearly as much of a hurry to get on blockers as AMABs are, all things considered, because it's pretty easy to get a chest reduction later on if you need it, and everything else will change with hormones. But your kid isn't going to be thinking about that kind of thing for years yet, probably not until they're an adult. A binder, and maybe hormone blockers depending on just how early puberty is affecting them, is plenty.
Thank you for sharing your story with me. You are so very right. This is some of the best parenting advice ever. I am so sorry for how you were treated, I can't imagine how that felt and still feels now. I want you to know you really helped me with sharing this. I hope your future is the brightest, whether or not you have contact with your parents. ❤
Thank you so much for your comment. You are absolutely right and I changed my mind about the binders. I am searching for the right company that can make a custom one for them, hopefully in time for back to school!
I’d also like to add that saying that your child is supposedly being influenced by the presence of queer kids in school and almost being concearned about it is a little weird because queerness is natural and it’s human, also I don’t see parents worrying about their children’s gender and orientation nearly as much when they say they’re straight and cisgender, just a thought…
Thank you so much for your comment. I am looking into getting a custom binder for them and hopefully seeing a new doctor soon to discuss options like puberty blockers. So much great advice here. 

I really aim to be that 100% safe space for my kid. I'd like to think every parent does. Thank you for your insight and thoughtful comment! I just got some of the best parenting advice ever. ❤
If you do decide to let your kiddo wear trans tape or binders, I’ll leave a few links of brands that are generally well liked by trans and NB people. Another person left different resources that you should check out.

Also, DO NOT buy a binder from Amazon. They aren’t safe. The trans tape from them is fine.
also, pat yourself on the back. Your kid telling you their identity means they really truly trust you and feel safe telling you deep, meaningful things they know about themself. You seem like a lovely parent.
Binders are fine at any age. You just are only supposed to wear them 6-7 hours a day if you’re under 15
You get a greater number when enby kids like mine and other LGBTQ kids are pulled from the crap public school system where they're bullied, or here in Florida treated like the government wants to eradicate them from existence, and placed somewhere safe. Personally, mine homeschools.
If there are so many lgbtq kids in this school is probably because they know it's a safe school and all go there, not because they are pretending... I mean, each school does not have a diversity in gender, sexual identity or even race or social classes that parallels society perfectly! Usually in ""good schools"" you have higher classes, and ""bad schools"" you have lower classes for exemple.
So much this. Free award went to you because I *really* like your addendum to this other person's post.
Thank you. I will keep this in mind as an enby who wants to give binding a try.
I'm so glad I could help! I wish you and your family the best of luck on this journey. And remember we're here for support when you need us :)

Is this the guidelines for people still developing, or for adults done developing?
and don't exercise in binders \^\^
Yes! Please talk to a doctor before hand to see what can be done.
Oh yeah, depending on how far along they are in puberty, blockers can be a great choice to give them time to figure things out for sure. If it turns out they really are a girl, then they stop the blockers and puberty resumes, no harm no foul. If they turn out to be a man, then they switch to male-based HRT (testosterone, aka T) once they are mentally ready for it and their doctors determine they’re physically ready for it. And if they’re nonbinary, they consult with their doctor on just how femme or masc they want to be, and figure out the right hormonal balance for that.
Adult height and hip width are also things that are impacted by going through estrogen-dominant puberty and are not undone by later HRT.
Thank you, again, for being the kind of parent to hear that comment. It made *me* feel better about my own life just to read about a parent who's genuinely invested in their child's peace. I wish you and your baby the richest, most rewarding relationship.
Of course, you seem like a great parent who loves this child so I’m sure it’s going to be ok, you’re doing really good.

I don’t know where you’re from but if there is an LGBTQ+ center in your area, or even a Trans center (which would be even better), I strongly recommend reaching out because they could guide you through the whole process and help you find trans friendly healthcare professionals (endocrinologists, therapists etc). They might even have support groups for both parents of trans kids and even for the children who would like to make some new friends who share their experiences. 

Good luck, I really wish you and your child all the best, if you need anything we’re always here, happy to help :)

Edit: if you’re interested, you can go [here](https://www.wpath.org/member/search) to look for trans friendly healthcare professionals in your area. Also go through the site because it’s really useful, especially read the standards of care if you want to have a better understanding of how transitioning works; by the end of this year they’ll also update the document and include some chapters specifically about non binary people.
I’ve seen some evidence that they can possibly impair rib growth if worn for too long, and sports bras don’t do that. For a child that young, I’d personally go with the guaranteed safe option (there are even compression bras designed to flatten the chest) but I fully understand why someone else would feel differently. I just think a kid might not understand how important it is to bind safely. If it’s every day, sports bra, some days, binder, imo.
Hun, the thread is like early half a year old. Get a hobby or something.
Both, I’d even say 6-7 hours for youngn’s under 15, and absolutely no exercising in it
That's true. But hip width is skeletal hip width; the fat padding changes nicely with hormones, and it's pretty hard to tell the difference. And height--well, yes, that's true; but if they've already had their growth spurt--which usually happens earlier than the first period--then that's unfortunately water under the bridge already. A doctor could tell; on an X-ray you can tell if the growth plates have closed.
The kiddo should definitely be educated about the risks but imao there are also risks to them being left to suffer through dysphoria

My cousin gave me some fancy dresses, and I totally didn't happy cry seeing myself in them		"These couldn't be more perfect on you, wow. Summer dress catalogue model!!
So so pretty
That black dress is killer!! 🔥🔥

You look amazing 🤩
Got an infectious smile in the 3rd pic! 👍
It’s the right time of the year for summer dresses 😊
You look amazing!! I love these dresses and your whole look! I just posted a pic of myself on this subreddit, and found your post in the ones related to mine. I love your hair too!
Putting them on, it definitely felt like they were made for me!
Thank you! Also totally random but I looked at your profile and I'm so jealous of your hair lol. What's your routine? Mine always ends up too frizzy unless I brush out my curls 😭
I agree! It's my favorite!
Happy is the best look on everyone (:
A lifetime of living vicariously through girl Sims really helped my fashion sense I think hahaha
Thank you!!
They make me feel it too! (:
I can kinda see that in the cheekbones I think!
Thank you!
That's awesome to hear and gives me hope adding to my wardrobe:)))
I just embrace the curls! I shampoo and condition and sometimes it turns out nice ahdhfjfj
That's good! ❤️
>Thank you!

You're welcome!
Fair enough haha. One of these days I'll figure out how to embrace mine (:
You should! You're so gorgeous and I bet your curls look super nice🥺
Check out the beginner routine at r/curlyhair ! <3
Here's what I do, maybe it'll help you:

1. Don't use shampoo, put in conditioner and rinse it out (this took time to feel right but it's a _lot_ less harsh on my hair)

2. Use leave-in conditioner

3. Use some mousse, for hold

4. Scrunch a lot - I do it after steps 1, 2, and 3

5. Don't use a towel. Squeeze water out with hands and then wrap in a t-shirt. Let dry for a few hours (I usually do overnight, but ""until it feels dry"" also works).

6. Take t-shirt off, then carefully shake out curls


That usually lasts me a couple days before it starts to frizz or look flat (depending on what I'm doing obv).
I do that 😭 it's a bit better than before, but going full on with the gel and everything makes my hair look so flat, greasy, and stringy. Even after scrunching up the gel casts
I pretty much do similar. I use shampoo like 1-2 times a week and use conditioner every other day, and I use a little bit of product while it's soaked. My hair looks nice but then it gets crazy frizzy when it dries all the way /: I think being on hrt caused the frizz since I have new growth and lots of baby hairs that have nothing to weight them down like my longer hair
How do you dry it?
Sometimes air drying, cotton t-shirt, flipping my hair over using low heat hairdryer, stuff like that. All look the same tbh. I don't ever use rough towels or high heat
Hm, that sounds pretty reasonable. I get the best results with no heat and using the t-shirt. But if those all work about the same for you, you may need to ask someone with more experience."	v0c0or	NonBinary	632	1.0	2022-05-29 14:12:17

Denied top surgery	"Went on my last meeting today where they basically told me that being nonbinary isn’t a thing and that they only treat people that are trans with gender dysphoria. Two years ago they said I’m nonbinary bc I’m obese…. then I lost 15cm in my waistline out of spite. Now they said I’m showing too much progress so I have the ”capability to live with my struggles.” Fuck Sweden. LGBT inclusive my ass lmfao

Also doesn’t help that I’m autistic so they just think I’m being confused.

EDIT; oh gosh, I didn’t really expect to get 40+ comments so this is a bit overwhelming but thank you guys for the support !!

I had been advised by most of my FTM trans friends to lie about my identity but sadly it was a bit too late for that as I was halfway through my meetings. 

The reason I didn’t lie is because after the first meeting, the doctor told me that the gov had gotten more inclusive and included nonbinary people. I had thought to myself: 
”Oh, I’m getting lucky!! Guess there is no need to lie.” 

The meeting I went to yesterday she informed me that.. the gov had removed that right once again. She really wanted to help me but she was simply just not allowed to anymore. The only other organisation that included nonbinary people is across the country and now that has also been limited by the gov.
They’re really just trying to limit us from getting help and being happy.

Next step will be time consuming or money consuming and honestly at this point I’d just want to go the money route despite how limited my wallet is. 

Oh well. I’ll get through this eventually :’)"	"Whattttt so sorry to hear this D: 
Is going private an option for you?
Lie to them I guess?
I'm sorry to hear this.
I also live in a country where they don't recognise non-binary as valid. Didn't even try it here. There's only one gender clinic with 10 years wait.

I'm getting my top surgery next week. Going abroad where you don't need any medical proof, just mutual acceptance. Downside is that you need the money for that. But I couldn't be more excited right now.

Have you looked into this possibility?
Sadly its the same thing in Canada (at least when I got top surgery). Although I do have gender dysphoria, I said I was a trans man because I heard that the surgeons will deny people who are nonbinary from getting top surgery.

I'm so sorry about that. It's not fair.
They thought your gender identity was caused by obesity? 🙄
You ""kids"" are trailblazers! Keep fighting for your right.

I'm 53. I'm nonbinary. I have always wished I could have my boobs removed. They get in the way. Bras are awful, uncomfortable and damaging. I don't use them so why have them?

But for me there was no surgery available because I was born a woman and women have boobs. You ""kids"" have changed all of that. 

Duck that. Push. Fight. Change doctors. You deserve to be the best you that you can be.

I'm proud of you. Good luck.
If you are looking for advice: lie to them

If not, man im so sorry. Its bullshit that they don’t recognize your gender or respect your wishes.
idiots will blame everything on obesity
I'm so sorry to hear this.
 I always thought if there's any country in the world, where enby top surgery would be covered it's sweden.

*Sigh.*

In germany there is the option to flat out lie to all doctors and psychiatrist/psychologists that you are a binary trans* guy (you then still may need a ""good"" reason for not wanting to go on T ; or find a doctors who is accepting and understanding and willing to lie to insurances with you )

Or

You pay for it on your own- most places I've looked into also have options for payment plans- 

I don't know if any of those things are an option for you.

I wish you all the best and hope you'll be able to find a way eventually.
Transphobia and ableism wow.
????? Goofy as hell.

Pull a fast one and just say you're a dude. What're they gonna do, put your boobs back in once they do the surgery?
You would think that they would support nonbinary people since they’re the same country that officially implemented they/them pronouns in their language
Ugh I'm so sorry. Unfortunately when I go to the Dr I have to larp the ""Hello it is me, He/Him super binary man and I love monster trucks and fishing!"" in order to get healthcare. It honestly feels impossible to force them to understand the nuances of gender, so my only advice is to just lie. It sucks but the end result made it worth it for me.
Yeah, Sweden sucks. r/transnord recommends lying about it and saying you're FtM.
🤗 (If you like)
Find a new doctor/therapist.
I feel your pain, I was denied in Germany a few years ago because I naively believed they'd accept non-binary people. I'm so sorry this happened to you.
can you go back and say, ""so after some soulsearching it turns out I'm ftm""? or can you approach a new care organization to start fresh?
I'm so sorry this happened to u

The gatekeeping system is so fucking disgusting in the EU 

This is just institutional oppression, nothing else
Pal, you better lie.
So sorry to hear this and I hope you find another way forward.

Sweden is honestly the most conformist non-affirming place I've ever been to and I'm from Africa.
Hi from Stockholm. I wanted radical reduction because my chest was giving me dysmorphia. I went to Kry to a GP ask about that. And they told me “that kind of things u do privately “.
I told her it’s not the case, that I can be diagnosed and get my surgery. So they put me in a waiting list to a clinic that does it. 2 years waiting time for the first appointment, and then it can take 2 years to be diagnosed. The GP was calling me “transsexual” coz her English wasn’t good and my Swedish isn’t enough to talk about medical issues.

I could have a regular reduction as I qualified but then they would make it just a bit smaller, “proportional to by body”, which I am sure it’s not what I need. Long story short I went privately in Dec…
Feel you 💔❤️
Lie, many Non Binary people to do it to get care. 
I was lucky i didn't need to lie, but about half of my Docters asked if i wasn't just a trans man. Because I'm really masc leaning.
So sorry to hear that.
What the fucking fuck. I’m so sorry. That’s not okay
I'm sorry you're going through this right now!! One of my partners is Swedish and they've expressed having a hard time getting trans health care. The trans healthcare system in Sweden truly seems to be garbage.
Honestly, I would send this info to the news. Read just now in DN about how a tv profile who appears to be nb (använder hen som pronomen men är fem-presenting) apparently had few problems getting breast implants to better conform to their gender. They might have done it through private means, was a long text and don't quite remember, but at least the topic is getting a bit of a spotlight at the moment
I’m so sorry your going through that, I hope something works out soon for you!
Lie. Get what you need.
i shall sprint to sweden and commit murder for you
The fact that I knew this was one of the Scandinavian countries just by reading the first few sentences omg..  
That sounds horribly frustrating and we got a pretty similar situation here in Norway from what I've heard. I'm definitely planning on just telling my doctors that I'm a trans man (technically half-true, so it's fine) because anything else is way too big of a risk. Progressive countries like ours shouldn't be this behind when it comes to trans healthcare. Super frustrating tbh
As a nonbinary person who is also seeking top surgery, this is my biggest fear and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 
You are valid in your identity, and I urge you to not give up on getting what you need to be comfortable in your body. 
Much love, friend!
I’m just stopping by to show some solidarity. This sucks, it’s wrong of them to deny you this, and I’m sorry that it’s complicating your journey even further.
Gaddam Sweden sure is handing out the backhands for troons today. In another sub a trans girl said they told her she has to be socially transitioned for a year (wearing skirts and makeup out before passing) before they allow her HRT. 

wtf I thought Sweden was like the beat place in the world to live or some shit
Jävla dårar!
That sucks! Exactly the reason I never wanted to transition medically (I'm also in Sweden).
well.. yes.
Em isbitnstill a demand that you get sterilzed before you can under go g""gender affirming care""?
I'm sorry.
it MIGHT be? There is another organisation but its all across the country. it has recently gotten a rule that I need a doctors note that my doctors arent allowed to give bc I’m nonbinary so it’ll be a bit hard
This is, sadly, the way. The amount of times I've needed to lie to doctors due to gender bias is infuriating.
What country are you traveling to?
How much does it cost? Im from the uk and the guidance says they only do top surgery on people who have been on T for 2 years. Im not interested in going on T but have a lot of top dysphoria. Cost for private surgery here is like 10000. Way outta my budget.
Good luck with your surgery btw and let us know how it went!
That's genuinely baffling to me. I'm in the southeastern US and like nobody had an issue (and I'm AFAB and generally femme presenting). Like... its your body and if you want to lob your tatas into the abyss then you should be able to lob your tatas into the abyss.
Wait, they will? :(  
I'm a Canadian enby who has thought about top surgery but never mind, I guess...
Really? I know several non binary people who got their top surgery covered by the Canadian govt in Ontario.
Anti-fatness is the real disease - it makes people act like monsters and treat those in larger bodies as less than human.  Like so what if someone’s fat?! (A word which I use in a neutral sense) If they want to chop their boobs or get any kind of gender affirming surgery, care, joint replacements, etc., why tf are they being denied - I do not buy this utter bullshit about ‘well the anesthesia is harder to do and dangerous and blah blah blah - like no, because you’re happy enough to rush someone into surgery and take their money when it’s a bariatric surgery.  But God forbid fat folks have access to life-improving care of other types.  SMH🫠  Bigotry is so gross.
Can confirm. Everything from my intelligence to my health to my gender to my sexual orientation to my political convictions is somehow caused by and/or invalidated by my weight. It's maddening.
Do you have tips for dealing with the psychiatrist examinations in Germany? I've talked to another guy about this and he said that I won't get their approval bc I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and now I'm (ironically) too scared to continue looking for one
Exactly. This makes my future look darker, too be honest
Unfortunately my understanding is that Swedish authorities work hard to shut down all providers that do not conform to their rigid rules. That sucks terribly badly but medical tourism is an option.
Ya
Barcelona, Catalonia. I have surgery with Dr. Brasó
Yeah, it's exactly the same here in Ireland.
In Barcelona you're looking at 5-6k in a good clinic, maybe less if a less known clinic. They're also more used to doing them surgeries over there, so I do trust them more than if I was to get it here.
[deleted]
It really depends where you are in Canada, don't lose hope! The place I went was fine with NB people getting surgery
Not everywhere! I've actually never heard of that, its disappointing to know parts of Canada are less progressive. But, my friend is non-binary, they're not on HRT (they dont plan to transition that way), and they recently got top surgery in Vancouver :) I believe the wait was much less than a year and it cost them like $15 lol (had to pay for anesthetic)
Not everywhere and not every surgeon! Mine was covered by OHIP and this was back in 2017-2018. Things may be different now, but back then I had to lie about being nonbinary.
Oh mine was covered too! I only paid $2000 out of pocket after the OHIP coverage.  


I'm saying moreso that I had to lie that I was a binary trans man (and also that I didn't have any mental health issues) in order to get top surgery. This was back in 2017/2018. Most nonbinary people I talked to had told me to say I was a trans man because many of them were denied for being nonbinary. Others were for being autistic.
My biggest recommendation is going to/calling/email-ing a dedicated counseling for trans*.
They know the local doctors, psychiatrists , etc and frequently deal with health insurance relate trans* issues.

Having other diagnoses does not automatically mean you can't get a diagnosis for dysphoria, being trans*, etc and medial letters and access to at least parts of trans healthcare.

There are people (even frequent psychiatry in-patients with multiple diagnoses) that get at least indication letters and HRT...

Approval for surgeries is in most cases a long and complicated process, often with rejections, for all sorts of reasons (according to my friend who was in contact with a trans counseler in a big city in NRW, she started her process in 2022)
Quite frequently only not accepting the decision of your Krankenkasse and going to court gets the final approval... 

I'm sorry I don't have more details or more positive things to share, I hope it was helpful anyways.
I hope there is some kind of support existing in your area - knowledge about who and what to look for (and what to avoid) can make daunting tasks much less scary.
Thanks a bunch! Gives me some hope for the future.
Oh I’m well aware that I’m one of the lucky people and not everyone can access care. I don’t personally have anyone telling me I can’t do what I’m doing (well nobody with the power to stop me).
This was in Ontario and back in like 2016-2018 for me. It was covered by OHIP for me besides $2000 (to make it 'look nice'). But yeah, things might be different now!  
I just know that prior to my top surgery, I had nonbinary friends who advised me to say I was a binary trans man."	10wcdoi	NonBinary	628	1.0	2023-02-07 20:36:20

Absolutely! Thank you so much

I’m the first (openly) nonbinary person to have received their PhD from my university!!!	"Dear fellow gremlins and others,

I'd like to share my happiness with you!

Long story short, this week I finally defended my PhD thesis in machine learning (online because I managed to catch a cold just a week before the defense :s) and even got a cum laude!!! My university respected my wish to be addressed gender-neutrally during my defense and by my new name, which is not my legal name yet. I’ve put all my pride into the design of my thesis and defense presentation because I could lol, because it’s MY thesis and MY defense, THEREFORE I'M GONNA USE ANY COLORS AND SYMBOLS I WANT, pictures are attached :)

[ My thesis, printed in 70 copies and distributed in my department. My colleagues' book shelves just needed to be queered up.](https://preview.redd.it/cr8zi758czt91.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ccbb13134d9a0e0d4a0e185d92789ebdaed6c1ad)

Congrats doctor! That's amazing!
Congrats! I love how artistic your figures are :)
Omg this is so cool, CONGRATS DR GREMLIN!!!
Congrats, dr! Way to go!

You are amazing and an inspiration!! Congratulations and I hope you have something big planned to celebrate cuz this is so awesome!!!
Congrats on your PhD, and on your courage! Thank you for walking, so others can run !!
Doctorb
HUGE CONGRATS!!
DOCTOR GREMLIN!!!!!! CONGRATS SO MUCH FRIEND!!!!!!!
I must say I love how much effort you put into the book, my only criticism, and it's a small one, would be that in my opinion pink text on a blue background just doesn't work. Congratulations on doing this otherwise though.
Yeah. If anyone calls me Miss now I'll be like ""it Dr for ya""
Fuck yeah I'm Dr Gremlin!!! Although, I also like thinking of 'Gremlin' as my honorific, abbreviated as 'Gr.' But one can have multiple titles, such as 'Prof. Dr.', so I'll be a proud Dr. Gr. [Name] [Surname]
Thanks! Yeah, my collegues told me the same, but this was after I printed it.
yeah a red tone on blue is provably hard to look at, chromatic aberration is a bitch for your brain to constantly compensate for"	y4pgx0	NonBinary	616	1.0	2022-10-15 14:32:23
My spouse is apparently embarrassed to be seen with me	"For context, I'm MTX, have started wearing some subtle makeup, paint my nails and am letting my hair grow out.

My spouse found out that a comedian friend of hers is in town for some shows this weekend and her sister asked if she was going (because it's my spouse's birthday today). She said no because she does not like going out at dark, it's not known as a particularly safe part of town anyways...

and then she hits me with ""and I'd be embarrased to get picked on by him because of what you look like now.""

Umm... what?

We've been to his show years before and he's very funny but unless he's changed his material a lot, this comedian doesn't make fun of anyone in the crowd (unless you're heckling, in which case good luck with that because he's great at handling idiots like that LOL). Besides, I can take a joke about myself. I'm made of tougher stuff than that.

But I love how she now apparently views my very existence and happiness is a potential embarrassment to her in public. I thought she was beginning to come around as an ally, since she has helped me purchase makeup and new clothes to help align with how I feel.

But this... this hurts.

Edit: Thank you all for your genuine concern and responses. Sorry I haven't been on to respond to you all but it's been rather hectic being New Years Eve and her birthday. I'm not going to ruin her day, but I will definitely be having a difficult conversation tomorrow.

Peace and love, y'all."	"Idk i think a lot of people here are downplaying what a serious concern OP has here. This is a big deal and you need to speak with her about it. If shes embarrassed about one setting enough to actually say it she’s likely embarrassed about more. Im so sorry you’re going through this.
That is SUPER fucked up and unsupportive. Your wife is embarrassed by your presentation, probably because she subscribes to traditional gender roles on some level even if she won't admit it. It's cruel, hurtful that she'd say it, and a very valid reason to need space from your relationship damn. 

I hope you find other, loving and supportive community.
You need to talk to your spouse about how she actually feels about you. If the comedian is not a transphobic asshole, it might be an excuse regarding your wife not wanting to be seen in busy public places with you at all. From there, couple’s therapy or the relationship might not last long
this is very upsetting, i am so sorry you are dealing with such an obvious lack of support by your spouse. i think sitting down and having an in depth conversation, even if scary, would benefit you both...i hope that things can change or that you can find a support system that sees you for who you are and not only accepts it but EMBRACES it!
I am so sorry this happened to you, I hope you can have an honest talk with her and she'll come around but if not. Remember anyone walking beside you should be fucking proud of you for you <3
This is like. Breakup level problematic. If she can't handle you being who you are in public then she doesn't deserve you.

Have a serious conversation with her about what she said and if she can't get past it, it's time to find someone who does value you.
I'm so sorry. It sounds like there are some really deep feelings on her part. I hope you can have an honesty conversation about it soon.
That's super fucked up. You're valid in feeling upset about it and I think you need to have a conversation with your spouse. I'm sorry that you had to hear someone you love say something so cruel.
yeah that sucks. unfortunately partners are often not supportive of a person's transition.
Oh hell no, I’d not put up with that kinda disrespect.
I was lucky. My wife digs it. But she dresses like a tomboy (hmmm) so I think she likes the extra colour by her side.
So she's not for you.
Me wife is fine with women’s clothing, and makeup but draws the line at being seen with me in a dress. I’m sure part of it is embarrassment but a lot of people also assumed I was a trans woman at the start of my transition, and my wife got called a lesbian a lot unfortunately.

Social situations can be scary for any trans person unfortunately, and this can carry over to our partners. Still what she said was hurtful, and rude. You should probably talk to her about your relationship, hopefully things will improve but it doesn’t sound like you’re presenting in a hyper feminine manner. Hopefully a few small concessions for now, and some time will make her more comfortable, and you can just be yourself.

Good luck, and I hope you feel better.
I hope they was just misspeaking, and doesn't mean it in a hurtful way. Have a chat with them about it, it's something you should sort out together, good luck hun xx
This. Is. Hard.  You deserve so much more and better.  Sending love ❤️
This makes me mad. Like…they’re clearly uncomfortable by your reaches to find what makes you feel your best. OP, I’m really sorry that your partner made such a transphobic comment. You deserve affirmation and love- not passive aggressive resentment loaded with transphobia and ignorant discomfort. We support you here. Really.
This is one of those times, it may be best to part ways. My wife and I left a cult, Jehovah's Witnesses, and thankfully, when I went through my gender identity crisis, it brought us closer together. You guys just may not be compatible anymore, and hey, you made it however long.
❤️❤️❤️
I think it's about time your spouse became your ex-spouse.

I'm so sorry, it may be best for you to break up
OP’s wife very bluntly views OP’s presentation as something that invites mockery, and cares more about how that mockery, in this mythical situation she’s created, impacts HER rather than her SPOUSE.

One of the comments in THIS VERY THREAD pins it on how OP’s wife might feel safer at night if they were presenting more masculine.

There was ZERO MENTION of unsafe areas or of worries about physical safety, and what OP’s wife said was very clearly about her vanity and belief in her self image over her partner’s autonomy.

It’s fucking disgusting how people on this subreddit respond to a post about discrimination against AMAB enbies with MORE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AMAB ENBIES.
If you OP do go to couples therapy I suggest looking for a therapist that has LGBTQ+ experience. Otherwise that could get messy and be an Unsafe space for you.
sort of similar experience here. My boyfriend is both traditionally masculine and very 💅 which balances nicely with the whole genderless gender I'm going for.

Their wife said “I’d be embarrassed to get picked on by [her friend] because of what [OP] looks like now.”

This is not about safety at night, this is not about “women feeling safer with men”. This is front and center, incredibly bluntly about OP’s status as a presenting non-binary person, how she cares more about herself and her self image than OP’s identity, and how she views OP’s identity as a threat to her.

I recommend you delete your comment. It’s incredibly disrespectful.
Say it again and say it louder. Very well said. Thank you
I may not be old enough to have experience with marriage issues, but I *do*, however, have experience with discrimination because of my status as an AMAB nonbinary person. So, I can recognize that kind of bigotry when I see it."	zzs557	NonBinary	615	0.99	2022-12-31 11:30:52

I love the way it looks! Can I ask what you showed/told the stylist to do? I think I’d really like my hair this way haha
You physically look happier
Thank you all for your sweet comments! <3
I didn’t go to a stylist, I did it all myself! I started by cutting the length a little longer than I wanted with scissors, then I used hair clippers at 1/2 inch to get the back short. I evened out the front with scissors and added layers with the clippers
you did a really good job then! Would you mind if I showed my hairdresser your picture to give them an idea of what I’m looking for? I don’t trust myself to cut my own hair haha

Happy 17th day of #Pride2022 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ Today I'm flying the OG Pride Flag and the Pansexual Pride Flag!		"I used to hate labels and flags. Odd thing to hate, since they're mainly used to celebrate almost everyone I love, but something ruined them for me a long time ago. Recently, that hatred melted away thanks to people like you. Mostly strangers, a few good friends, but one shared trait among them all: that radiant smile! It really is a beacon for those of us who get lost in the storm. 

TL;DR - You seem great, and I hope to be a little more like you each day!
Today I'd like to highlight the [Rainbow Parenting podcast](https://refugerestrooms.org/)!


Welcome to Rainbow Parenting, a queer- and gender-affirming parenting podcast. Every week, queer educator Lindz Amer starts conversations about the intimidating first steps on how to affirm queer, trans, and nonbinary kids. 


They talk to experts who explain how to approach age-relevant early childhood sex ed, queer kid lit, gender reveal parties, and much more. And this isn’t just for parents; educators, caregivers, librarians, and anyone who knows, loves, and works with kids can start the process of raising a whole generation!

I’m looking for some boxers too, what kinds/brands fit well for afab people?

Your fabulous
Dooope happy 4 u ☺️
boxers are comfy and easy to wear
I got some of those “boyfriends boxers” made for women, it was like “so you don’t have to steal his” lol, thought it was dumb but my mom doesn’t understand my identity that well so I’m going slow with her
I *love* boxers, once I tried them on I was never going back, no regrets, and you look great!
aaghh why cant i be afaabbbbbb

Just started wearing boxers and I am equally as excited! I just got some Fruit of the Loom pack. Would love to get more form fitting ones like yours!
LIBERATING
I can totally relate !!! Enjoy !!! Great pair of trunks too
I have really been missing out my eyes are OPENED they’re great
hey! I recently got some ""brave soul"" ones (I'll admit I got them on sale no way would I have bought them otherwise) but the way they're made makes it so there isn't any excess fabric around the crotch area.

that is of course if that's what you're looking for, and I think to find them search jersey fit - I wish you luck on your undergarment quest!
I use brave soul and French connection jersey boxers - although not the cheapest, I got them on sale heh, I would recommend pretty highly too!

Do you like them? Do you mind sharing the brand? I just got some “women’s” boxers but they don’t fit well so I’m still looking :(

Happy holidays everyone! I am one month on testosterone. ❤		"Happy holidays yourself! And happy T-time! 🌻
Do you mind me asking how it feels?  My Psychologist offered to help me get testosterone (I know, I'm incredibly lucky he offered and I didn't have to fight for it).  The idea of messing with my hormones makes me nervous though.
Looking good!
Happy holidays! You look handsome, I love your hair!
Happy holidays!! :)
Congrats!
Happy holidays and I looove your shirt dude!
Congratulations 🎉🎉.  Happy Holidays.
Omg, I love color on your hair! Also happy one month :)
Thank you! 💕
Keep in mind everyone's experience is different and my experience won't be universal, but for me so far it's going great! I'm on 4 pumps of Testogel daily. 

The first few days I was full of energy, which honestly could have been due to excitement over finally starting T.

My voice is cracking a bit, kind of like I have a cold? I've got some fuzzy tummy hairs coming in which is super gender affirming. And I am SO hungry, all the time! My body definitely feels different but I feel more like me than I ever have.

Keep in mind if you start T and then realise that it's not for you, you can stop! Hormones aren't for everyone. There are some irreversible side effects but just have an honest discussion with your psych. :)
That's very kind, thank you. 💕 Not many changes yet but I'm feeling more confident overall!

New haircut and some outrageous glasses makes for a very happy me. : )		"What brings you wonderful people joy?

For me it's balance. Making that routine and breaking the routine. Playing to both my sides, masculine and feminine. Getting dirty and feeling natural. Or being a whimsical fae! : )
can i just say that this is an incredible look and you're absolute goals 😍
It's like taken from a movie. You look fantastic.
You look so damn good. You seem so confident!
My mood for this post: “Have you ever seen someone so beautiful that you started crying?”
YOU LOOK LIKE ROBERT SHEEHAN. (that's definitely a compliment!!)
Damn you look fantastic!
You look awesome!
I absolutely love your hair, it looks great.
You're gorgeous 😍😍😍
Those glasses are totally cyberpunk and that's awesome. Also like that style of shirt collar, and your eyeliner is way cleaner than mine usually comes out.
This is such a look. Absolutely fab
You are absolutely gorgeous!
As a fellow curly haired person....might I say I absolutely love your hair!!
Oh whooawiii  🤩 you just shine my friend!
Ow, my heart.

Also, beautiful eyeliner
you look amazing!

Where did you find those glasses?!? Because !!!! That’s a necessity
The feeling of having a quest or being on an adventure, solving real-life problems. Feeling that my body and mind is working together. Getting in to some drama once in a while. Exploring, experimenting, having a tantrum. Just being a monkey♥️ and don't forget those sweet kisses♥️

I like yours, very inspiring. I want to find that balance you're speaking of. It's not always easy :)
Thanks! \^_\^ I shaved and got the haircut and managed to finally nail my wings so i was really feeling myself then. If only I didn't go out and drink too much the same night x_x
Awh thank you!!  
Hands down the praise goes to my phone tho.  
Pixel 2xl. Outrageous camera.
Thank u!!  
but things are not always as they seem to be  
i went out that night by myself and my anxiety was really peaking so I just drank alone and didn't really talk to anyone except some ppl in discord ;_;  
need some irl queer friends ngl
😭😭😭 dont cry!  
but oof do I know how you feel.  
i'll see a cis girl walking down the street and just be like ""dam, ill never be that pretty might as well quit rn"" but then I'm like NO! I will be pretty godammit! And so here we are. 😂😂
He's a curly hair style icon for me actually haha \^_\^
Thanks! <3
:D Thank u!
Thanks I've been really working on it for months now! I had really bad dandruff and a combination of only washing with conditioner, using a silicone scrubber to massage the product in, and a hard water filter for the shower did the trick and now it's healthy, curly, and no more flakes!
No u!!! \^_\^
Painters tape! No joke I use painters tape for my wings.  
And thanks I've always been way into fashion so I like to think I've developed a good taste over the years. :]
🥰🥰🥰 thank u!!!
And I'm a Gemini too! :D
Thanks! Curly hair is just the best isn't it!
Got them at Nordstrom rack on a mega discount. They were only 7 dollars!!! 😍
Beautiful... :)
I know that feel 😂😭 at least you were able to go out feeling like yourself
I get that. I wanna meet some queer ppl irl
If you share your location I'm sure some people here may be close.
I'm trying to bring out my natural waves and curls and washing with only conditioner is one of the things that works well for me too. Though mine is not nearly as curly, it takes about 2 days of bedhead to start looking really good.
Wow nice! Great find
You've probably already checked it out but /r/curlyhair has a great wiki and I use a method from there to really accentuate my curls. It takes awhile but the end result is worth it! In fact in this photo I'm not super happy with the curls, theres too many stray hairs and frizz but thats because the stylist washed my hair and dried it.
I didn't know about that, thanks!"	bp1t83	NonBinary	570	1.0	2019-05-15 18:48:53

Wow - I always find it difficult if someone posts a picture in the nonbinary section and I simply have no idear whether they are born male or female and if I am curious I have to read some posts and replys if there is a hint somewhere- your haircut looks cool
I love your style and your AxAB is a mystery to me. Onwards and upwards comrade!

You see, I'm not the only one who knows you have a fabulous aesthetic and a wonderful ability to express it! You should be really proud of the fact that you're even more beautiful on the inside.
Wow I wish I had such cool style. I love it. You're working it. Looking great. You're killing it.

Ok so real talk, I saw your pic and thought, wow, that person is very stylish and androgynous. Then I was like hmmmmmmmmm, then I looked a little closer, and I was like, ahhhh, they’re AFAB. Very smooth skin. I shall tell them my initial impression as a compliment and pretend I couldn’t tell they were AFAB.

AND THEN i saw your flair. No bamboozle fam 💚
Just being honest :)

Where did you get the jeans/jeggings from btw? :P
Thank you!
Thanks again! Same. Oversized is usually what I go for
Oh ;-; thanks ;;;-;;;
Nordstrom Rack. The whole outfit’s from there tbh
Thanks. "	an1ibn	NonBinary	573	1.0	2019-02-04 13:09:20
Gulp. 1st picture showing who I am, a bit nervous, so go easy! New blouse and capris...starting to work out my style. Happy Friday, lovelies xxx		"I posted a pic in full drag, but that's easy to hide behind, and doesn't represent who I am most of the time. So I'm a lot more nervous about this! Much trickier working out how I want to look an a day to day basis. Would be great to know how you think I'm doing xx
This is what I love about this sub. I so often feel like I'm floundering as I try to fight back the lies I internalized for so long and figure out what I like. Seeing posts like this reminds me that there are other people going through this process too- and looking really great while doing it 😉
Holy goodness, you’re gorgeous!
You look great!!
you look stunning and happy! thank you so much for sharing these pictures, they’re wonderful!
this is such a good look!
Simply beautiful! And your eye shadow is impeccable~
Gorgeous!
i LOVE your blouse!! 😍😍😍 the red nail polish was a great choice, makes the red in your top POP!
Soo good! Love the nails
this look is cute as a button. your eyeshadow matches your top AND your nails match the details as well. you look glam (note the sandals), chic, and comfortable all at once. also you have a really warm smile :)
OMG you look stunning!! Wonderful color coordination! 11/10 <3
Absolutely beautiful! Welcome to the club, gorgeous. The first step is the hardest, and you're doing great already! ❤️
wonderful color coordination! you look so happy :)
Hell yeah! I'm glad for u, I appreciate the makeup vibes
You look fantastic! That blouse is so fun and I love your eyeshadow!
You look gorgeous!
this is such a good look!
Well look at what we have here, someone looks great for sure! Love the outfit!
I've come to realize this as well. I don't identify as female nor do I care for a wig or makeup. Fashion took me awhile to dial in tho.
You look stunning!
You look amazing! Love your makeup style
I love the color coordination! The red nail polish and blue eye shadow look great with the shirt!
Your nails bring out the red in your shirt......I see what you did there lol   :)
I love the colors! Excellent contrasting! :D
This looks so nice on you! Be proud. You're doing great 😄
Soooo pretty. You look great.
you look amazing! the color coordination is perfecttt
Love how the eyeshadow and nailpolish complement your top! YOU ARE AWESOME.
I love that top on you! You look stunning.
Loooove the nails, perfectly colour matches!
We're all just keeping on. This is still very new for me, but being out to my nearest and dearest is such a release x
My, thank you! Braved up and answered the door to the postie. Still very much finding my feet, so appreciate it x
Thanks so much!
Oh my gosh, thanks so much. So much happier now I have come out and can be myself with my nearest and dearest xx
Thanks so much, I'm trying to practise my eyes every day....I'm slowly finding what works for me (super hooded eyes!)
Thank you!
Thanks so much, love the blouse, got it today. Squirrels and stags are too cute!
Thanks! Pressie from my lovely other half x
Thanks so much! I think if you wear enough different colours every day, you will eventually stumble on a combo that matches 🤣🤣. I certainly do feel comfortable,  which I guess is the only thing I really want to come across xx
You are really too kind xxx
Oh thanks so much! You help make it easy xx
Thanks so much! I feel so much lighter now I have come out and I can work out how I want to look xx
Thanks! It's my minimal makeup look :)
Thanks so much, I mightily aspire to fun!
Thank you!
Oh, thank you so much xx
Oh thank you, that's really kind! Xx
It's hard to work out your entire identity in clothes almost overnight...but I'm getting there! I'm working back to the most out there aspects of male fashion I have always liked, find their female equivalents, and then branch out from there. Its helping me find things that fit who I am a bit better xx
That's so kind! Xx
Thanks so much! Just eyes and a touch of blush. Working at home realness.
Work: ""We'll pay for a web cam, just expense it.""
Me: ""Yeah, I'll get round to it sometime.""
Why, thank you!
Thanks a lot, colour is such a lot of fun x
Thanks so much, contrast is my middle (also first) name 🤣
That means a lot, thank you xx
Oooh, thank you! Xx
Oh, thanks so much! Xx
Thanks so much! Tomorrow will be a whole different mashup 🤣
That's so kind, thanks so much xxx
Thanks so much! The polish was a gift from my lovely orher half, who is so supportive x
So proud of you for answering the door! It’s not a small thing. Well done!
I’m so glad to hear that! You look lovely and your color coordination is perfect, I hope you have a good day today!
Yes looking through my history it has definitely evolved.

HAPPY EARLY PRIDE MONTH ENJOY MY DAISY CHAIN		"I love your hair so much 😍
Love it!
“Those are daisies. I find them cheerful“ (pls someone get the reference)
My gosh, you're stunning! The way you've styled your hair was what first caught my attention, but from the side angle of your face, I would genuinely and sincerely say that's the contours of your face are just so damn beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.

Good grief! Beauty.

I'm seriously, seriously loving the shaved sides, though. Gosh, they suit you so much, OP.
Uhm hello, ur majestic
That’s some cute stuff right there!
You are gorgeous!
oh my goodness your hair!! i love it!! 🥺
I adore your hair 🌻
Cute hair! Also tutorial please on how to make daisy chains?-
thank you!!!!
THANK U SO MUCH UR SO SWEET
You never made a daisy chain before? o.o 
Here it is: ♡♡♡
1. Pick some daisys
2. Make a hole with your fingernail at the flower stem of one
3. Put another flower steam through the hole of the first 
4. Make it as long as you want
5. Make a hole in the stem of the last daisy and put the head of the first daisy through it. 
(6.) Eat the white & yellow part of the daisy"	np9w3i	NonBinary	554	1.0	2021-05-31 18:24:50
Finally experienced euphoria! Cooking dinner tonight, wearing my great grandmother's apron, I cried happy tears; for the first time happy with who I saw in the reflection of the oven glass.

good dye young bleach and manic panic electric lizard my friend, it would look so sick
Is he hungry for the rock?
That’s an amazing name!
actually he’s the devil and he loves metal
Is he the greatest cat in the world?

A binder and a dress makes my genderqueer heart happy		"WEARING A BINDER WITH A DRESS IS LIKE PEAK EUPHORIA. I was so surprised at how happy I was the first time I tried on a dress with my binder and realized my chest *didn't* fill out the top.

I'm so happy for you! Your chest looks so flat and the dress is so nice on you!
❤️ strongly agree- binder dress combo is 10/10. I got this cool looking strapless binder that I hope works so I can wear with some spaghetti strap dresses. I am unfortunately allergic to the adhesive on Transtape and I never got it to make me that flat anyways.
Absolutely killing that look! Super happy for you.
Saaaaame
The dress looks amazing on you! Your adorable smile makes it even better :)
Based picture of the dear leader there.
Also you look absolutely stunning!!!
Fat mood there! You look lovely in it too!
You look rad as hell!
Thank you and I KNOW RIGHT it feels amazing.
Right? Total goals. I'd probably throw on some of my favorite dresses again if my binder made me that flat... They might have to sit at the back of the closet for now until I get top surgery though :P
I hope it works too, good luck!

Love your hair! What's with the aquarium though?
I love it... your eyes are 🔥
Heat miser!!!  Love it
Absolutely iconic!!!
Ahh this is my dream hair! It looks so good on you
That's a very cute shirt
omg!!! where to even start??? that shirt! the eyeshadow! the orange hair! youre making me want to dye mine that color now lol
ur a handsome human
Looks like you came right out of a sci-fi game
You look fantastic! What product do you have on your lips?
You look stunning
Magic.

No other explanation xD
Yaaaas, looks awesome! 😄
Omg you're so perfect !! I love the color 💕
This has got to be one of the best compliments I've ever gotten, thank you so much!  ☺️
Oh my goodness, thank you so much, your comment really brightened my day!
Thanks!  Not sure what you mean about the aquarium?  It's not the best angle for the aquarium as the lighting is making it look kind of dark, other than that it's just your typical aquarium that houses Black Mollies and a snail
Edited to add: also the water is a bit low cause today is the day to change the water.
Thank you so much!
Thanks!
Thank you very much!
Thank you so very much!!!
Thank you!
Thank you so so much, you are too kind!!!
Thank you very much, you are so kind!
Thank you so much, you're very kind!
Awww thanks haha!
Thanks so much!  I'm wearing Almay 120 Go Wild lipstick, I found it at Wal Mart.
Thank you!
Oh gosh thanks so much! ☺️
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much!  I think it's maybe my favorite color I've had.
Also just saw your other post and almost spit out my water. Cannot believe you are 30! Would have guessed 24. Holy shit
Oh yea it's just the fact it's so empty? Like why isn't it filled a bit more? Is that for a specific reason?
My pleasure if you like bearded alphas I got more compliments where that came from 😁
*adds to cart*
Oh wow thank you SO much.  Turning 30 kinda mentally hit me like a ton of bricks (even though I know it's not old, it's just a personal problem lol) and your comment made me so happy!  Made my week haha.
Oh sorry I edited my above comment to add, it is a bit low on water cause today is the day to change the water.  No specific reason other than it's time to do their tank cleaning and top up!
Well it's not really a personal problem so much as a cultural problem.  But we can personally rise above (mostly...sometimes.... maybe).  Regardless, you look incredible!
Ohww okay! I'm just always very conserned when I see that, cuz if it gets that empty in a week, it might be too hot😅 and the fact that i once had that, and that way my heater broke😬😕
I think you're right, culture seems super focused on youth. Realistically I know it's just a number haha.  How we feel is so much more important.   
Thank you very much!
Deleted duplicate comment
We usually change the water and clean the tank about every three - four weeks or so (it's what they told us to do when we bought it but honestly I think we should probably start doing it more often with how much algae it gets) so it's more like it gets that low in a few weeks time.  

Thanks for letting me know though I honestly didn't know evaporating fast could be a sign it's too hot!  I hope your fishies were ok when your heater broke!
Yes luckily I found out quickly, cuz it was one that had a light that would turn of when it breaks, if it was my other one, i would have had a lot more issues! And yes, i have a 60 litre(13gallon) tank and a 35 litre (8gallob) tank, and i have to clean them about every week, because of ammonia 😅
Oh I'm glad they were okay! That's a nice feature, the light, ours doesn't do that I don't think.  
 I think our tank is ten gallon, and it does pretty well but I do want to start cleaning it more often.
Yea it'll be nicer tbh then, but anyway, nice to meet someone else in the hobby! And great hair, i wish I could get mine up like that!
Nice to meet you too!  And thanks so much, you're very sweet ☺️"	oi8t4y	NonBinary	540	1.0	2021-07-11 17:34:23

Omg you look amazing!!!! And you are totally passing as nb. ;) I’m so jealous! <3
It looks lovely :) I quite like it a lot!
You go, human!
Blue
If possible can we get some more angles of the photos you based out off of? I've been trying to figure out what to do with my hair and this looks like something I want to consider!
Thank you!!
Thanks hahaha!
Thank you!!! I'm quite stoked about it!
Thank you!! I've had a couple pixie cuts before, but they were always very feminine looking. This is the first time I've really fallen in love with short hair on me!
Thanks!!!
I'm not sure how to link a photo on mobile, but I just googled ""short androgynous hair"" and picked out a photo I liked. Sorry, I wish I was more help in that aspect!
Thanks for sharing! I really admire everyone who can post pics of themselves here. I am building up to that amount of courage thanks to you!
I don't think I've ever posted my face on Reddit before, but after cutting my hair I had a boost of confidence and decided fuck it, why not. I just got out of a long term relationship and move across the country, and I decided I'm going to take time to focus on myself and figure myself out. And I figured the best way to start would be to get the hair cut I've been considering for years now! I hope your courage continues to grow and that you continue to flourish! You've got this :)

I came out recently and I’m very happy since that moment 💛💜🖤		"""I'm coming out of the closet.""

""As what?""

""A 17th century swashbuckler.""

Seriously though, looking great!
Hey congrats on your coming out and also on your amazing moustache!
I just came out as nonbinary as well. It so so freeing to be the real me
Your stunning mustache has stolen my words from me.
Congrats on coming out :)

High-five, my fellow mustached envy! You're looking happy!
Magnificent.

Can I just say how much I LOVE the older NB crowd on here???	"I know age is always a hot-button, but as a relative(?) youngster (29), I just want to say I love and appreciate all the older (40s and up) non-binary people on here. I love my peers, and I love seeing the youth get out there being their best enby selves (srsly, some of you have it way more together than I do now and you're half my age), but seeing the older NB redditors give me such happiness and hope for my own future! You're all so unique and amazing and badass!

THANK YOU! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND MAKING YOURSELVES VISIBLE! I HOPE YOU FEEL LOVED APPRECIATED AND VALID!

ok bye "	"Thank you!

I wish I'd had groups like this when I was in my 20s. (In my 40s now.) Back then, the closest thing was ""crossdressing"" or ""transvestite"" groups and I had a hard time relating to that scene. I even disliked the term ""crossdressing"" because I felt like it's rooted in this concept of a gender binary where people are crossing over the line. I always just wanted to do my own thing with my gender expression.

We've come a long way since then.
Idk if I count since I didn't know I was enby till like 6 years ago or so, but Im 41 and ""non-binary"" feels like home ❤
I agree! Irl I rarely see older nb or gnc people. It gives me so much hope ❤️
It really means a lot to see enbies living their life at older ages! Because it can be so easy to internalize things like ""it's just a trend among kids"" or ""this never existed before.""

Please never stop being yourselves !
Feels good to be seen, thanks 😊
I love them too! I'm also 29 and a teen I met last year told their mom I'm nb and the mom was kind of surprised there are adults who are nb. Always have been always will be!
yes i fully agree with this!! i’m 23 and seeing older nb’s literally makes me feel like i have a future for the first time in a really long time
Thank you. Ten years ago I discovered the language I had been missing my entire life, and since then I’ve been working to increase visibility of LGBTIAQ+ issues in my industry. I never want anybody to ever feel as lost and alone as I was through my teens and twenties.
It's really funny to me that this is the only space I'm considered an elder. I turned 40 last week and I'm practically not allowed to say I'm old in my friend/work groups. Lots of ""OMG YOU'RE SO YOUNG YOU'RE NOT EVEN OLD YET"" it's like I'm a baby elder lol. 

My friend group is very GNC and most of them are older than me - we're out there, just not as active on social media, and we've lived for years in stealth mode because there weren't common words for it. You find your alternative subcultures you find us, we've always been here and we're always happy to adopt new friends :)
I feel this so much. They make me feel real and worthy of living as my whole self. Like there’s actually a happy future ahead.
Same! (Even though at 40 I’m now in the older demo myself lmao) TGNC elders are the best ❤️
I'd also like to thank our older enby frienbies here for sharing your amazing selves!
54 here, its only THIS YEAR I found out what NB is, and it fit perfectly with issues I have had since as far back as I can remember. 

over the ages, from the 1970's until now in order (at least where I grew up) first there was gay. then later trans people, then bisexual,  then pansexual....they all fit and none did. then finally non binary! 

I am so happy I finally found out what was ""wrong"" after all these years. 

(secret is there was nothing ""wrong"" with me after all!!)
I'm 34. I wish there had been any concept of being non-binary in my younger years. I literally didn't even know it was a thing until 4-5 years ago, and it just made so much sense. I am so very grateful to have found a community, even 20+ years after realizing I'm not cis. I just didn't have a concept or label to attach it to back then, and definitely no one in my social circle who could relate-- and the internet was a much smaller place back then!
You're welcome 😁
Lots of the young humans in this sub have it all figured out. As an older NB I appreciate you all pushing boundaries and giving me the words to express how I feel. Lots of things have fallen into place for me over the past couple of years and you have all made it easier for me too. 🖤💜🤍💛
I am 71,  NB / genderfluid,  E / monotherapy -- feel great on a low dose of estrogen, just don't flaunt or care what others think. I dress mostly gender-neutral. Sometimes I dress in traditional Chinese clothing made with silk, which feels wonderful!
Agreed 100%! I’m also 29 funnily enough, and seeing older people on here makes me so happy!

To my 40/50+ non binary people: We love you! Keep being awesome!
You’re all welcome! Thanks for giving us hope for the future!!
Yay I'm not considered old
Non-binary and about to turn 37 in a couple weeks. I used to dress up as Elton John as a kid (started around age 7, he was my favorite singer). In middle school I was bullied for having hairy legs and not wearing make up. Then around 14 or so I started wearing boxers and experimenting with binding. I’m honestly pretty amazed it took me till last year to figure it out.
i have nothing together thanks
I'm 32 and my hair is thinning. I'm so glad to see representation of so many varied enbies to realize I shouldn't worry about my hair. I should not make that make me ""less of an enby"", if I have the desire to have specific hairstyles that I no longer can have. (flat mohawk with matte clay, or the equivalent where the back and sides are shaved but hair on top)
47 yr old human. I wish I could meet all of you in person and see all your beautiful faces. Lots of amazing people around here ❤️
Turning 32 this week. I agree whole heartedly. I am relatively comfortable and confidant...and half that is seeing its not just me. Being late to a term isnt bad.
I‘m only 17, but I love them so much! It gives me hope for the future, and also disproves that it’s only a trend among teenagers like me, which gives me more confidence in my identity \^\^
I'm 43 and find it tough to come by older NBs in ""the wild"", so I'm happy to have peers in the older crowd here! And I appreciate the younger generation, it's wonderful to see that people can live authentically with more acceptance than previous generations. Things are getting better, but there's a long way to go...and we're in it all together. 

It's amazing to me that we've been around forever (I read a really interesting article about a Viking warrior who anthropologists think was NB b/c they had traditional male weapons and female jewelry in their coffin) but a lot of people think that it's a new thing. (Thanks, TERFS. 🤬)
This comment makes me so happy as a nonbinary teen. Just by being here, you've made the way a little easier for the rest of us ❤️ I'm glad you found your place
I'm AFAB and 47. The first time I heard someone come even close to describing a presentation that I identified with was Eddie Izzard using the term ""executive transvestite"". My brain went, ""That! We want that, but reversed!"" It took me YEARS to figure out what that actually meant for me and it's still a work in progress.
Of COURSE you count!!! Also it's amazing to meet a demi/enby!
We have always been around, society is just finally getting around to recognizing us.
Pretty sure we have terfs to thank for that belief that being Enby is only a youthful experience. Propaganda at its finest... talk about social contagion!
That's amazing!!!! This is also one of my goals. I work in a field where everyone is very ""ra-ra! diversity!"" and follow that up with almost no action. So I make action happen 😈
>we've lived for years in stealth mode because there weren't common words for it. You find your alternative subcultures you find us

Yyyyup, I've been hanging around my local goth/industrial scene for decades now. I barely even care for most of the music, but it's where my people are.
Wait wait wait... pretty sure the cut-off line for TNG is 35.... so those of us at 36 and above are OST... which I'm cool with... I will happily rub elbows with Spock! Lol
Well only as ""wrong"" as a star block fitting into the round hole... yes, it works but the fit isn't right. 😉😉😉
I'm in my 50's and I was so excited that my 'feeling' and 'being' had a name.
Yes, Eddie has been a long time inspiration for me as well!
I always preferred action transvestite. Running, jumping, climbing trees, putting on make up while you’re up there.
I have explained to my husband how lost I felt trying to be a woman when I knew I was fundamentally not that, but also fundamentally not a man either. I didn't even know ""neither"" was a choice (thanks, conservative upbringing) until I met younger enbys. I immediately went, ""THAT! I AM THAT!"" and it wasnt long until I felt whole for the first time in my life. In my mid 30's. Fucking drastic, that.
☝️our society, anyway... 🙄😔 So much stripped from societies around the world to impose the white man's shitty belief system. Many many other cultures did/do recognize us in various ways, but BIG OOF colonization.
I was half expecting you to break into Lady Gaga's song...
I was going to mention the goth scene but couldn't figure where to put it XD Friends and I started going (many many years ago) as a ""ooh, spoopy, let's try it :) "" and we have the ~nicest~ people in our goth scene, and it was where many of us got to explore our gender identity. 

Making some custom GNC clothes for a new friend to introduce them to the goth scene was uhh... step 2 to them becoming my spouse XD
LMAO <3
Same here, it's a relief to find the name for how you've always felt.
Also a fantastic esthetic!
Lots of us felt similarly, we just never had the terminology to explain it. I'd have to give a whole paragraph long explanation of my gender expression to people. Now I can just say ""I'm nonbinary"" and a lot of people get it.
😭 so same. I knew myself very clearly by age thirteen or so, but knowing I was very much not a girl yet also not a boy was just a contradiction as far as I understood then... I would have felt comfortable telling my parents I was trans at that point if I had been *binary* trans, but trying to communicate to *anyone* that I am neither never seemed like an option. So I shut those feelings in a trunk and shoved them deep deep into my mental attic for over a decade instead. 🙃 By the time I came around to opening the trunk it was *bursting* with experiences that aligned with my trans and nonbinary gender, and it was wiiild working through all of that, pulling out old experiences and holding them up like OHHHHHHH. 😳
What is it with conservative upbringing seeming to fuel this, or put it in overdrive? I’ve been hearing it a lot, and I had the same situation. I really started to struggle from puberty when things in my religion started to ramp up gender binary roles, and I just felt like I was put together wrong. :( It took having my first child and being depressed and confused for several years before it finally hit me. It felt like everything suddenly made sense and I swear my existential crisis ended overnight. It was incredible!
Yeah,  it's crazy how accepting everyone around ne has been, too. 

I told my husband first,  he was relieved because he thought I was questioning our marriage. When I came out he goes,  ""oh thank God,  I thought you wanted a divorce. Can I still call you wife?"" 

When I told my sister she suggested changing her nickname for me, which is very gendered,  but I told her how much I  like it so she didn't. 

My brother said,  ""cool.  My daughter is gay."" He's a man of few words.
Imma say the quiet part out loud. 

It's because conservative Christians do not walk with god, they walk with their idea of god reinforced by their cherry-picked bible verses which support their ideals only when taken completely out of context. They ignore the parts of their own holy book which don't line up with their bigotry and only use their religion to maintain their outmoded thoughts and force those thoughts on others. They perform many or most of the sins they claim to hate and project their self loathing onto people who are literally just trying to be happy. They judge others based on their misguided thoughts and convoluted view of the Divine. It's honestly quite sad.

To be clear, I know many good Christians, and I know many good conservatives. The people I know aren't like the Conservative Christians I've described, who are honestly a very VERY vocal minority. The problem is these zealots scream the loudest so they get the most attention.
My husband similarly was very worried about our relationship early-on 😥 It all felt so new to him because of the new words I was giving it, when it had been me all along. Nothing about *us* had changed. 🙂 He was always pretty supportive considering those anxieties, but he has had a much easier time supporting my transition in the time since working out that everything we've ever wanted together is still as it was. I just get to pursue that alongside pursuing a more comfortable self-realization too. 🥰"	w0sl9w	NonBinary	533	1.0	2022-07-16 22:48:59
Update. I am now purple and incredibly happy		"Yes

the purple hair enby collective grows larger
People with CRTs have big badass energy :>
Looks good!
You look wonderful!! My hair's purple too ✨
I literally just finished coloring mine purple! 😸 I've been doing red for a long while and wanted something  different 💜
i really like your glasses (and, of course, your hair)! :)
You look great but HECK i just want to point out your the spitting image of my partner. Almost exactly alike, even similar glasses. Wildin.
I love it 💕💕💕💕
Soooo cute ahh! 

someday...
Aaaaah! I love it!
aw yeah!!
I went purple recently too! I'll have to get a pic later XD

You look amazing!
Someday when I'm less lazy I too will join.
Idk what CRT means but thanks :3
Purple buds!
It's crazy, and awesome! Good to know I have a twin. You know for heist purposes and family swap scenarios.
I've been hoping to do it for like 9 months. I finally had enough money to do it properly.
I was thinking blue, but maybe I'll be purple instead when I decide to dye my hair
Cathode Ray Tube, it's the older blocky sort of TV like the one that's behind you!
CRT means cathode ray tube.

It's an old technique for displaying images on a screen. A small particle accelerator shoots electrons at a screen that lights up when it's hit. This paints an image on a screen.

Most displays in the last century used this technology.
You look adorable. Worth it :)
I'd been debating red or purple, lol.
Whyyy not *BOTH?*
You're absolutely right"	c2iu7h	NonBinary	533	1.0	2019-06-19 15:59:17
I'm stuck in bed sick but still feel happy to be a Demi-Girl on Non-binary day.		"You look great!! Sending love from a fellow demiwoman/bigender person! ❤️
love those smiles!
You look amazing
so cute!!
The only thing I love about being born as a male is having nipples but having no boobs, I'm pretty sure boobs would give me a lot of dysphoria and I'm happy that i don't have them, they also look uncomfortable
<3 thank you!
=\] I love flashing my smiles, I have a wide mouth and lips which makes for a large grin.
thanks! Happy Cake day!
Yall are cute too.
For me, breasts have been the largest source of euphoria since I started HRT. Nothing has made me feel more feminine and like my true self than them. They're real, they're mine and I feel so blessed to have had such a large amount of growth. Initially I didn't want more than B cups, yet now that I've shot past that amount of growth I am happy to have a big more. 

Sure the growing pain has been uncomfortable, but they make up for it by being sensitive and pleasurable to touch. In the right mood and moment even a light touch is enough to make my body respond. I love it. I don't find anything else about them that really bothers me except when I bump into things."	hruqq1	NonBinary	531	0.99	2020-07-15 19:54:43

They/them, afab. Happy Pride!! 🌈🏳️‍🌈 Hanging out with my partner all day today! I’m so excited! How do I look? My hair is making me dysphoric but 🤷🏻		"Omg you’re so freaking handsome!! I hope y’all have the best day together.
I'm afab as well and I honestly hope to look as handsome as you do one day!
I think you look great. Don't see anything wrong with the hair. Also, love those glasses frames.
You look so good! Have a great day! ❤️
You look great!!
Curious, what do you want your hair to be more like?
Excuse me your hair is fucking amazing and your everything gives me gender envy
Happy Pride! 🌈🏳️‍🌈 You are incredibly cute!
Happy Pride!
You’re fine. you’re the definition of what I want to look like

BRUH. You look masc as fuck dude, you are gorgeous. I don’t think you need to worry about your hair!
Wow you’re super cute! Those glasses look great on you and I love your nose ring :) 💛🖤💜
Idk pretty andro, not much to say really
This probably sounds so weird but your glasses really suit you!!!! You look amazing!
Happy Pride! It’s uncanny how much you look like Dick Grayson.
You look amazing! Very handsome! (Or if that's not your preferred adjective, I could give you a different one!) And Happy Pride to you too!
I wish I had your cheekbones! You look great!
I love your glasses!!
Wow u look super cool!!! Tbh I can’t even tell that’s your afab !
Tbh if you didn’t say that you were afab I wouldn’t be able to tell.
Damn man looks like T has done great things for you!! Happy Pride 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Sorry about that. To my non binary amab eyes I do not think feminine at all with the hair. It looks like pretty and actually taken care of male hair. Aka you like your hair and you take care of it. That kinda what I get from the glance
Thank you so much! That’s so sweet, oh we definitely will!
Aww thank you!! You’re so sweet! I’ve been on T since 2016 and had keyhole top surgery in 2019. You look amazing too, you beautiful human! It’s pride month! celebrate yourself, where you are, where you’ve been and will be. All of us look amazing and beautiful in our own way!
Exactly
Thank you so much! I really appreciate your comment
Thank you! I hope you have a wonderful day!
Thank you so much!
Thanks for the question. I want my hair to be more of a longer-ish mullet in the back, with choppy texturized bangs and completely shaved on the sides
Happy pride! Thank you!
Thanks, Happy pride to you too!
Thank you so much. Happy pride to you as well! I do feel so proud to be non binary
😳 I am speechless but thank you and you just made my day. These comments are making me feel so good about myself today when I really needed it. Thank you. You all are beautiful humans don’t let anyone tell you different!
Haha thank you! Yes you can have majority of it cause I honestly never really liked my arm hair. Love this comment! Haha
Awww 🥺😭🥰 thank youuuu! You really brightened up my day! Really boosting my confidence! Thanks!
Thank you soo much you’re sweet! Happy pride!
Thanks!
Thank you so much I don’t think it is weird at all! I get a lot of compliments on them. I actually got them at target optical. Thank you again!
Thank you happy pride to you too! I didn’t know who the superhero actor was so I had to google the name haha. But I agree with you it’s so funny and neat.
Thank you so much. I actually still vibe with “handsome” because to me it can be genderless
Thank you so much! Funny thing is I never used to has them and T really changed my face and made cheekbones stand out more and jawline
Thank you! They are Ray-Bans
Thank you yes I know I hear that all the time I pass very well as a cis male and did every more so when I had a full beard haha.
Thank you! It sure has, partner says I look really different then pre T
Happy pride to you too! 🏳️‍⚧️
Aw thank you so much!! I'm currently pre everything so you're deffo transition goals for me atm 🥺
Well I know you can get there, I’m sorry it’ll take time to get there tho
never let anyone tell you otherwise!! trust me, sometimes it can REALLY get to you 😅
You look like an AI rendered the definition of ""beautiful""

I hate u

I will become more beautifuler and destroy you, there can only be one

jokes aside, love yourself
You’re also just very attractive in general! I love your septum piercing
You’re welcome! I really understand but you’ll get there I promise! You just have to be positive. Thank you ☺️
Thank you I really appreciate it so much. Yes you’re right it’ll take time til I can get it. I just love at home still so once I move out in January, I’ll be able to do so. Thanks again
Oh I know you are so right my family is that way and my mother continues to misgender me  and doesn’t accept me being nb but my nb amab partner just keeps using my right pronouns and I just love it 😍
Hahaha best comment ever. I laughed its onnn! We’ll just see, I’ll fight you and I’ll win! Haha thank you and you love yourself too
Thank you so much! I love the septum as well I’ve had it for I want to say 4 months now. I want to get real Gauges eventually and stretch the septum a little bit
Honestly made my day, thank you! You're so very kind
Of course, fam. Happy pride ♥️❤️‍🔥
Happy for you!!! Future's looking bright 💖

Happy Solstice to all you NB witches!		"I'm OBSESSED with your hair! 😍 Also, I just learned recently that many non-white communities use nb to denote nonblack and have switched to using enby instead for myself. I'd never heard of nb standing for nonblack before a week or two ago, so I just wanna pass along the info! ✨
I'm being steadily absorbed into the vortex of color that is your head in this picture
You too! And happy winter solstice to any in the southern hemisphere
I love your make up
You as well! Your hair is beautiful!
wasn’t it just December?

fuck
Happy solstice! Sol Invictus! (Love your hair btw)
BLESSED BE xxx
Eyy, thanks! I didn't read the sub of this post and couldn't figure out if this was r/Wicca or r/NonBinary xD.
Witches are too gendered, I prefer Eldritch horror
Thanks for the shout out!
Blessed be my friend.  It was a new moon, solstice and an almost full eclipse yesterday. How about that for a little magick in the air. I 😉
Thank you for letting me know! I'll definitely be switching to enby now! Also thank you! It's faded a lot since I first did it so i plan on re-doing my rainbow before this month's end
Yess!!
Thank you! I haven't felt like playing in makeup for so long but i decided to for the solstice
Eldritch horror? What?I'm dumb
Of course, just spreading the knowledge! Wow, I bet it was awesome when it was super bright but the pastel is also a good look 👌"	hcsomk	NonBinary	503	1.0	2020-06-20 19:57:40

Seriously the lipstick is amazing! Not many people go for bold colors so whenever someone does I love it. But there’s something about a great shade of red lipstick. I don’t own any subtle shades but my favorite is my bright red. Keep rocking it.

YESSS WE LOVE AN ENVYGREEN MANOR SHIRT
It’s an EnvyGreen Manor spring collection shirt! All the shirts have very cottage-core printing
Thank you! It has mushrooms, plants, moths and other various occultish themed things! As someone said before its from EnvyGreen manor. The rainbows were made through a film I have over my bathroom window that turns sunlight into rainbows, you can find it on amazon but also sometimes in stores too.
Just looked through their Insta and wow. Definitely a brand to keep an eye on. Thanks!
Oh damn, those shirts are gorgeous! Thanks for introducing me to them, I’ll be sure to pick up a few"	vfw2fo	NonBinary	502	1.0	2022-06-19 14:12:52
My pronoun pins finally arrived!!	I'm so happy they're finally here!! \( >o< )/	"I feel like if I misgender you, I will wake up to a voidcat with a knife standing over me in my sleep...
So which are you me: yes
Where did you get them?
I’ve been looking at these as well!
I have one of those!
I have one of those!! I love it!
My clinic got these for us!
I need one of these
Gener fluidddddd
these are me pawnouns!!
KNIFE CAT KNIFE CAT
any she/him?
Ahhh, I have one of those, too. It's one of my favourite pins
Don't worry, you can't misgender me easily, my gender is as fluid as a waterfall and the knife-wielding voidcats only go after people trying to be malicious. (⁠◕⁠ᴗ⁠◕⁠✿⁠)
Exactly (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)
I got them off of Etsy, from the seller EDIParker
Ive seen them on etsy, so many different sellers im not sure who the original artist is

Just search ""cat pronoun pin""
They're definitely worth it! Just note sometimes they'll be more notably flawed and have imperfections, but otherwise they're still cute even with mild-moderate flaws and good quality pins. 😊
I approve of this pun. ಠ⁠◡⁠ಠ
Sadly no, the seller only sold these 5, if they had more I would have gotten it. You can contact the seller EDIParker on Etsy, and ask if they can make a special one, but there's plenty of beautiful & cool affordable customizable pronouns pins on Etsy if they can't/won't.
Thanks. :)"	11sztbm	NonBinary	501	0.99	2023-03-16 17:02:36
The hairdresser refered to me as a he and I'm happy. Even though I didn't bind today so I thought I wouldn't pass yay		"you look awesome :3
Your hair/whole look is amazing!
Hey, I wouldve never known that u had to pass, u look like a amab, and this is coming from a amab, u r amazing, u look amazing, and everyone should refer to u as he because it is who you are :)
So handsome 🥺🥺🥺
There you go you get my last silver award ♥️
Eyyyyyy that’s my goal ^even ^though ^itll ^never ^happen
You look amazing! Also I would've thought you were amab if it weren't for the title heheh
Aww thank you
Thank you so much!

Happy Pride! I drew this to celebrate my two-spirit Native family out there. Wado tsunalii!		"Hell yeah, this is awesome!!! There's like no native rep on reddit so thank you op
Love the art! Could you tell us more about which two-spirit tradition you're portraying here? I'd love to know more
What does wado tsunalii mean? /gq
 Wow, this art is gorgeous! Happy Pride to you too c:
Very rare to see art which celebrates someone like me. I am two-spirit from the Seminole tribe, Unconquered Pride right here. Thank you and many blessings. May your art continue to bring joy.
Agreed! Native voices are so important, but so rarely heard. On reddit...and in general really. I'm trying to make an effort to change that and just...speak about it more. Be loud and proud, right? 

(In my real life I hear Native voices all the time, though. Namely my mothers. And lemme tell you, that Native voice carries...lololol. lol. Jk. Love you mom...heh).
Agreed. Maybe they're a numerical minority but that makes them even more important, doesn't it? The more perspectives we have the more likely we are to solve any given problem.
I didn't portray a specific *tradition* in particular, just some Eastern Cherokee imagery (the smokey mountains, the flag colors in the beads, the roach headdress) with some rainbow thrown in. Cause...I'm a big 'ol gay.  

If you mean two-spirit in general, it was a term adopted in 1990 at the yearly Gay and Lesbian Native gathering, to encompass all the ""outside the gender binary"" peoples in Native tribes. Most tribes have terminology for ""two spirit"" people, this is just an umbrella term. There's tons of information out there, here's a [good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4lBibGzUnE) that gives a basic summary of it! A lot of tribes had two spirit members all throughout our history, and accepted or even celebrated them for the special people they were! It wasn't perfect, but it was a far cry from...ya know, Puritans and shit.
It just means thanks friends :)
Thank you, oginalli! Native representation, and therein two-spirit rep, are *always* lacking. We may be few, but we sure as hell are proud! Happy pride to you :)
Yeah, thanks for the response! I knew two-spirit was an umbrella term but I didn't know how to articulate asking for more info. Thrilled to see Cherokee rep in this sub and I'll def check out the video!
Thanks!
Haha, word. I can rarely articulate anything, so I feel you. And yay! Tsalagi life!"	nqozbj	NonBinary	486	1.0	2021-06-02 15:51:57
Outfit today ended up being low key NB flag colors. Happy pride everyone 💛⚪️💜🖤		"Where did you get a Hex Girls shirt?!?! My gay awakening

Ok love that shirt where did you get it
I love the hex girls shirt queenie! Sorry if the word I used is offencive, I just use that to adress people who look amazin'
Lmao same 😂 I got it at hot topic
Thank u :’)
Thanks 😊
My hair is so dark it was a very long process to lighten it enough (low key killed my ends too). Even then we had to go darker on the roots. Ive been there though I’ve had purple fails before it’s rough for brunettes.
Thank you ☺️
Hot topic :)
Thank u 😊
I love that word!! And thanks :))
I finally got a real stylist so I might try again with professional help
Well looks great on you
Any time awesome
You should! Be warned mine ended up being pretty expensive because of how long it took to lighten. Good luck if you do!
Thanks! I’ve decided to be more open with spending money on my appearance especially if it will help with dysphoria. Can’t put a price on happy

Happy New Year 2021 (stuck at home) vs 2019 NYE (on my way to sing with the symphony). 38 MTX, 16 months HRT. Finally free.		"You are looking great, your royal theyness
Sing with the symphony? As in the classical orchestra? That takes a lot of balls to come out to people that are pretty conservatively skewed most of the time. Absolute props to you!
Wow! Right On!!
i thought the left pic was the before at first! looking absolutely stunning!
Wow! Glow up! I love posts like this cause you can just \*see\* how much happier and more comfortable you are in the recent pic. Really happy for you <3
💜🥰💛 thanks!!
More like, they'll be surprised when covid is over and the symphony resumes! Not out to them yet. 😊 I was only 5 months into transition when covid hit.and the whole season was canceled. 😓
Aaah I see. Still, we need more queer classical musicians! I wish you the best of luck"	kpaccu	NonBinary	478	1.0	2021-01-03 01:14:53
Happy #NonBinaryPeoplesDay		"The nonbinary USB symbol is a mood - you ever try to plug your gender into something, and it doesn't fit so you flip it around and it somehow still doesn't fit and then you have to look inside to see which way to go?

I want this as a tattoo
For me this is every day
Wait? Any of you got storage space? I have some files to transport. /j
Yeah I had that experience yesterday, I needed legwear, and skirts were too feminine, and standard pants were too masculine. So I landed on pastel khakis, I got pink and orange (also Grey for when I'm feeling gloomy)
Sorry, my drives are all full of 0's and 1's. I need to reformat and repartition.

7 weeks on low dose T!! Changes are slow but I'm noticing some subtle things, like how I'm actually liking my smile now. Happy Friday y'all!!		"You are cute af
yooo love the space shirt 😍😍😍
You have a great smile, I hope you have a nice weekend🌈
Whoa you look amazing!

Also how does low doses of hormones work? I have some things I would like to change but nothing too drastic so I wonder about that a lot
You're smile is adorable! I love your eyes and your hair
ayy fresh my dude!
Please, I need to know where you got that amazing alien shirt
Omgomgomg you're so attractive🥺
You are beautiful/handsome btw.
You look SO good!! 😍 Goalssssss
I hope you take this as the compliment I mean it as, cause you've got serious John Mayer vibes going on.
You look great!!!!
Thank you so much for the reply. I feel like this will help me a lot in my decision.
You have a great smile!  And I’m living for that shirt rn 😄
Did no one else comment on the hickey? That's literally all I came here to comment on.. lol but yeah you're a good lookin' person. Good for you for being happy!
So with low dose T, you're going to be getting all the same effects that regular dosages of T has just at a slower and more controllable rate. It'll take longer to see the effects but in turn you're able to observe the changes more as they come and keep a close eye on it. If there are certain things you want to keep T from changing I would recommend looking into things like DHT blockers! Otherwise, low dose T is also really good for people who are nonbinary for example, like myself!

DHT blockers can stop things like your hair growth, bottom growth, and male pattern baldness, and can minimize voice changes. I'm sure there's more but I'm not positive on the rest. Hope this helps!
It's from Hot Topic!! :D
Okay yknow I vibe w that, thank u!!!
I'd just prefer we keep that out of it please. It's definitely not what I wanted any focus on and forgot that was there ;;;
But thank you for the compliment!
Wow I didn't know about the DHT bloclers!

Sometimes I feel very dysphoric I desperatly want to start T but when it's not bothering me that much I get scared that I might regret if I do it, so I was thinking about low doses or something but there is so little information about what it actually changes.

So thank you very much!
I am so glad you took that how I meant it 😂 you fucking pull it off too!
I say to certainly take your time with the decision. Honestly, I felt that same way for years. That doubt is what stopped me, and even shoved me back in the closet, for a long time before I decided to just go for it. And I'll be honest that even now I still have my doubts and fears because we're both just like that- we overthink things that even make us happy.

But for me it's been worth it. I am feeling happier with myself and how I look, very slowly but surely. Trans/enby folks don't need to feel dysphoric 24/7, it's not a measure of how much you hate yourself. But think of the euphoria- to me, that's the most important part and it'll help you figure out if this is right for you. I'm here to talk if you need it!
Naw man it's cool!! I can't say I've ever heard of him but I DO like his whole look. His glasses.....🥺
Yo, what? Fuck, is John Mayer now old people music? Brb gonna go have an existential crisis that I'm old now 😂😂😂

But really, New Light is probably his best newer song. You've probably heard Your Body Is A Wonderland before, too.
SORRY if it helps any I don't branch out too often with my music and stick to specific genres. But I'll be sure to give him a listen now! I'm always down for recommendations :D"	ozdswy	NonBinary	468	1.0	2021-08-06 19:33:25
