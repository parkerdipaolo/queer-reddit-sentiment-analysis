You look so cool!! Those pants are trippy
I love those pants!
Despite her best efforts, you look gay
Grannycore!
👀 Where are those pants from? I love this look
You look similar to the girl from that netflix show ‘end of the fucking world’ ! Love your look and hair!
So, grandmas are enby fashion icons? nice.
Honestly? Maybe let grandma dress you more often, she killed it.
Ya look amazing... Uh... Monarch? (Can you tell I dont have many NB friends?)
Paisley is not binary...I can write a 33 page thesis on this...  


...I won't...but I could do it
how u look even gayer tho

is""proper young lady"" slang for ""intensely pretty enby?""
This is an incredibly non-binary outfit tbh
Seriously, post this fantabolous look on r/redditgetsdrawn 

People are going to love it over there
Those pants are epic.
would wear tbh
Very 70s chic. Looks amazing!
I'd absolutely wear those pants
The trousers are A Look! And I love the colour on your hair, it’s so pretty!
You look great dude!
That's a fucking LOOK
swanky
It´s that 1960´s style that looks so great - leisure, colorful, a little crazy and yet chicque - maybe you should incorporate it in your closet - as without the hippies Idea of free love none of our modern ideas of sexuality could have ever come to bloom. :D xoxo!
Your grandma obviously has some swag, those trousers are a whole party on their own! Love it!
It’s like a colourful audrey hepburn look. Chic cuts, fun colours. I like how the pattern of the pants has the colour of the top in it.
Straight from the 70s
Wow 😍
She got TASTE
The outfit looks cute on you
I'm in love with your grandma...!
This is an absolute LOOK. I feel like you should be playing bingo with a bunch of elderly ladies all like ""Goddamn it Ruth they said B SEVEN, TURN UP YOUR HEARING AID!"" and ""Madge, what are you doing? No, uh uh, I see you trying to cheat! You made a deal, I won so you have to give me your coffee cake recipe. Pay up!""
Your grandma is kinda awesome.
Yaaassss work it!
That's amazing 😍
That's unironically a really rad outfit and no joke I would wear those pants/leggings whatever they are.
That's some great color coordination from your grandma. You look nice!
I love those pants! TJ Maxx lookout lol.
I think I’m team grandma..
Omg this is working so hard it’s giving me bangs inspiration
I beg your pardon. Thanks for your response. Either way, I like you. Sincerely, Tommy
Funky and hip are my thoughts when I saw your beautiful outfit. Did you keep the clothes? You look really pretty.
I'm a goth and even I'm jealous
I want to raid your grandma's closet!
If you don't mind me asking, are you out to her?
Run lola run?
Dig it
You're grandma has great fashion sense. I love the paisley pants. You are a beautiful girl.
You look amazing in anything
You should invite your grandma to post with you!
Need these pants!
Definitely snazed up!
She made you look like that elderly totally gay lady who lives in a little house at the forest with her ""special friend"" named Becky.
Together with Becky she makes very delicious cakes and smokes a ton of weed while offering goods to the forest spirits.

But in young!

Man I hope I will be like that when I'm old.
Wait, I would wear thos.... oh.
they be giving me art teacher vibes
what about a gay art teacher grandma ?
hehe thank u
Thank you!!!
Idk, all the paisley patterns remind me of bandanas and cattle. Is there a unicow?
Looks only!
Those pants are killer!
She got them in the 80’s 😭
Hehe thank u
They love u!
At least mine is!
Fr!!!
My friend or captain works
She’s the coolest
I am not, I figured she wouldn’t understand. She is very loving and accepting as a person & respects me being bisexual! But I think gender nonconforming identities might blow her 80 yr old brain :,)
Not a girl
Same. I would totally rock those.

TW: sh on other slides. Ngl, this first picture gives me mad euphoria and I don't even know why. Oh yeah, hope you're not tired of NB with sword, since there's a whole lot of that here.		"That booty and that crop top🔥🔥🔥
The crop top... full gender goals. I dunno if this makes sense, but my stomach/gut just looks too amab to wear crop tops... some chubby bellies look good in crop tops, sadly mine isn't one. 

You look fucking fantastic!
This is peak androgynous villain vibes right here
Your looking great!! I love your samurai posts!!

And it's all good on the TW, we all struggle sometimes, I've got my share of marks. I just hope your finally finding your enby self and living happier:)

P.s. nice butt!!!
The combination of suit and sword really is a treat. You look like a character in a game!
You look amazing :D

""how does a non-binary samurai kill people?""  
""They slash them""

Both outfits look great, I'm getting Vergil vibes from the jacket! 

So THAT's why I feel the need of more swords (and crop tops) in my style.
Love this picture, you look marvelous!
Great sword, great suit, great hair, great coat and greater booty. Holy shit you're so cute

You look amazing! As always :)
Dapper, and yet able to slice adversaries to ribbons

I’m praying to all the gods in heaven and below that you’re in the UK and hoping it doesn’t come across weird that I have typed the houses as British
Omg while we were too busy questioning our genders, you studied the blade.
This a deleted scene from Kill Bill? And that shadow makes it look like you have a second shirt on underneath.
Oh my goodness your outfit is absolute KILLER!!! So jealous, you look fucking glamorous and amazing, friend!
Sword enby! 🤩

I know others have said this but you look like a protagonist. But of like, a gritty modern day fantasy novel, specifically.

You belong in Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them
😍😍😍
You look ready to go slay a demon lord and then rule
yoooo kira tie
You look awesome my friend!
I see that tie! This is so epic, you look amazing. Goals, you’d make an awesome protagonist (or villain hehe)
I adore the Jojo pose in the fourth picture. You look fantastic!
Yess, I need that workout routine !!
That's what i was thinkin too! ❤❤❤
all bellies look good in crop tops, and out of crop tops! wear whatever makes you comfortable but also don’t forget you can wear absolutely whatever you please!
God I wish I was androgynous
Underrated comment
*dad joke groan*
Now i'm feeling motivated.
This is a sign
Same 😳
❤️
This is a sign
You're perceptive
Indeed
Do it
JoJo pose?
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I mean if I saw you IRL I'd look at you for a solid minute trying to figure out your gender identity.
AREN'T YOU? 

I really do not mean any offense, I dont know how to put this, but I honestly can not tell your... genital origin story (?)

Like gun to my head if I had to guess I couldnt. 404 not found.
Lol you’re pretty damn androgynous. I think with a bit of foundation and some other mild makeup, you’d be entirely vague
Show me your motivation
Not any more than that, I’m afraid! Love the fits :)
i'll think on it :)
Genital origin story is now my favourite term for birth gender, thank you for this new phrase random stranger
Hold on, let me go grab the amplifier stereo real quick... (I am the storm that is approaching approaches from the distance)

i got sleeping shorts! their mad comfy		"they look soft! and you look very comfy very gender
I have sleep shorts too.  I agree ""mad-comfy.""
Where u buy that I’d like one
i thought for a second you looked a LOT like this (gnc lesbian) girl I went to uni with so I may have glanced at your post history and SWEET SUNBEAMS you are stunningly beautiful in every possible way @.@
What brand?
They look amazing!
i love your style! honestly the power of sleep shorts is severely underrated, there’s something so affirming about the right ones!!!
anyways- you look rad! :)
Super cute, I need to get myself some shorts like those.
Sleeping shorts are the superior sleep wear.
I literally almost bought those exact shorts today I love themmm.
Looking mad cute 💖
Long sleeve and short shorts are the top tier combo
They look so mad comfy that I’d like to get in them lol
u look madcomfy!!
I love your hair so much. Any tips?
I love your hair
They are so cute I love them
Friendo, where did find those?
okay so people keep saying ""gender"" like someone said ""looking very gender"" but i have no idea what that means honestly
everyone should have some!
that is definitely a first time someone confused me with a girl😂 but i promise you i'm quite adverage hun😅
Liz caliborne
🥰
i got em at walmart!
definitely worth it😄
thank youuu!
my favorite!
thank you hun! tips on locking or the color?
thank youuu! i really need it re-done
i got them at walmart😄
it IS a compliment, lets get that settled first! its kind of like saying “this is giving me gender envy, you look euphoric” 

basically, you look good and very happy and nonbinary people dont really have a basis for passing, so i think “you look very gender” became a replacement (since passing is bullshit anyway)
Hi, just jumping in cause I think I can actually kinda explain this one. I was confused af by it at first too, but it's relatively simple with some practice. - People (especially on this sub) often say ""gender"" as a more neutral/androgynous/take-it-any-way-you-want-to form of feminine or masculine, so what would typically be ""you look very girly/feminine or manly/masculine"" becomes ""you look very gender."" 

Does that help?
Thanks! I'll have check there sometime.
Are they the supermarket ones? X
Styling the hair generally. I have no idea what I'm doing.
Thank you.  They have really soft camisoles there.
 thank you for explaining!
Oh my thank you lol. I kinda got it from context clues but without an actual explanation I was like 😵‍💫
it doooes, thank you!
to get my hair how is it i started with a good but of hair already then made coils that started to form locs over time, then i began using a hook to inner lock then more towards the roots when they would get fuzzy or there was a lot of new growth, they're a lot to keep up with honestly if you do it yourself and its expensive is you pay a stylist
i had to think it through a lot im ngl because it had to make sense in a way that wasn’t analogous to an inside joke
Totally worth it though. Thank you"	ufv8qt	NonBinary	941	1.0	2022-05-01 08:12:41
Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/

I made a mad specific meme about how I conceptualise about my own gender		"My gender is purely the concept of Baba Yaga and ancient forests growing lush under dark clouds hanging low with the promise of a fresh rain to renew and rinse the world below
Legend has it that the moss grows on the north side of the trees
....nah man, I feel this. Misty forest gender gang, unite
The entirety of r/goblincore relates to this. 

And me.  I also relate to this.
If the black circle inside a total solar eclipse can be a gender, which it can be, and a scrape of a claw on ice after a polar bear fight can be a gender, which it can, I see nothing wrong with a superspecific rainy forest gender
F that, moss can totally be a gender. I herevy proclaim myy gender to be the magic of a song's first note.
Squidward is wrong those are genders
Patrick says xenogender rights 💚💚💚
Conceptualizing my gender is this way actually helped me a lot. I’m not a mossy green forest lit dimly through clouds, but being able to actually say how my gender feels to me in a way similar to this helped me validate myself and now I don’t feel nearly so much genderqueer imposter syndrome. 

My gender is a sheet of origami paper that is orange flowery fire on one side and blank on the other. I’ve been folded into an origami woman, I don’t mind being folded into that shape sometimes, but really I’m just that sheet of paper that is orange flowery fire on one side and blank on the other.
moss is very much a gender
Sounds a lot like what my gender feels like though.
squiddy is wrong
Moss... Legend Has It That The Moss Grows In The North Side Of The Trees, And Legend Has It That World Turns Round On An Axis Of 23 Degrees!
What a lovely feeling your gender gives :D
it can be a gender if you want it to be
I relate to this post a lot :,)
You don’t need to put in *patrick raises his hand again* when it’s already showing, not trying to be a dick but it’s unnecessary dialogue. It’s part of the “show don’t tell” aspect you see.
Ever heard of xenogenders?
Ya, seems like a different way of conceptualizing gender. Also doesn't quite fit in the two. Idk sometimes that shit happens?
\*cough cough\* ^(xenogender) \*cough cough\*
Hard same. Thanks for posting. --Moss
Aye, big same. Occasionally a part of my identity is embodied by a wild goblin just...living life like power ballad in the foreground.
Username checks out. That is a boss concept for gender identity tho
My gender is the Japanese aesthetic concept of “wabi sabi”.
Legend? They taught us at school that you can point out where's the north based on moss on a rock or a tree
I adore both of those concepts as genders, the feeling of an eclipse is like nothing else and during the last one I felt a kind of healthy joy I hadn’t felt in a long time
What a beautiful gender! I can do vividly feel the idea of that note’s promise and the depth of emotion it can bring
I love that concept for a gender! Being bright paper folded into a shape resonates so clearly in my mind. I remember being in high school and being miserable and feeling trapped bc I thought the only options were boy or girl, and I knew I wasn’t a boy but the idea of describing myself as a “woman” made my soul itch and my chest tighten. 

I think if gender is how we relate to ourselves and the world around us, the vagueness of men or woman just doesn’t sit right with me, it doesn’t let me really say who I am and how I’m approaching the world. I relate through specific imagery because that’s just how sense the world; I can’t tell you what “man” feels like but I can thoroughly grasp the feeling of pink cotton candy set against the bright blue of a sunny sky on a boardwalk over the sea with salt in the air (nothing against people who feel at home in “man” or “woman,” it’s just not for me)
*-gasp-* cannot verify if username checks out but oooooooo 😄

"Stupid ""I identify as"" comments from cishets driving me crazy"	"I deal with this at work all the time, I'm required to ask for gender identity in conservative states like Ohio and Michigan, some of the worst when it comes to shitty people who exist to make everyone around them miserable too. When people dig and try and find something to target you specifically to get under your skin, why do people think these assholes are ok and tolerable? If you exist to be a shit why do people stay friends with you? I'm in a place for ransoms to get along but when they allow this kind of thing it is not a safe place for people like me and others. The mods just accept this person is horrible and refuse to do anything about it.

“I identify as a helicopter.”

“So, non-binary, got it.” 
(as ‘helicopter’ certainly does not fit into the binary)

“No, I was joking, I mean…”

This entire thread made my day lol.
Completely off topic but this post reminded me of how sad the story is of the author of ""I Sexually Identify As An Attack Helicopter.""

[https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)

tldr, Isabel Fall was a transwoman writing about her experience using a popular copypasta and was bullied and harrassed so bad by her own community that she ended up checking herself into a psychiatric facility and ultimately decided to halt her transition.
I really hate the word cishet. It just reminds me of fishnet. I didn’t add any sort of support to this post lol, sorry.
It’s transphobic for sure. I had a client do this and I just treated it like they were serious.
>Again, reddit does not accept transphobic comments like ""I identify as a helicopter"" as hate speech.




I just recently accidentally (because I know they won't do shit about it, it was supposed to go to the mods of the subreddit) reported a really transmisogynistic comment to the admins and just got an email that said it didn't violate their hate speech BS rules. It absolutely did, but of course they don't give a shit about trans people. 


I live in Michigan and it's a hell hole unless you're in a few good pockets. Detroit area, Grand Rapids area, uh, that's actually probably it, honestly.
Have you checked out r/onejoke? It’s a place to bond over how terrible the “I identify as…” “jokes” are
Reddit is not anything like a decent spot for that; its format is aimed directly at libertarian attitudes about zero censorship and accountability. This is not the right place to ever expect decency from.
Honestly, I've never really found a problem with it. Even I, a demigirl, make those jokes sometimes. Of course, it all depends on the context, and everyone is entitled to their opinion.
While it's annoying I'm not sure if I'd call it transphobic. 

Some of the same people who've made the same jokes have been my biggest advocates. 

On the other hand some sjw and LGBT people have been very toxic to me. 

I'm not interacting with these individuals one on one- but I'll take your word for it. 

For me transphobia has included- being called a freak. Reject job applications when using my preferred name. Delays and discrimination in medical care or complete lack of. Discrimination and harassment on jobs from coworkers/higher ups/HR. Lost friendships and family maybe for the better. Physical harassment. Strangers are scared of me. 

I sincerely hope you find a safer and better community and workplace if not- make one.
maybe I'm just on a different wavelength but I don't understand how this is invalidating or frustrating at all. why do you care how other people identify even if it's a silly identity? even if it's a parody? why does that matter?

My NB identity is for me, it's how I see myself and understand the world. I dont see why on earth id waste my time getting annoyed that other people are pointing out the absurdity of binary gender and how superfluous it all is by making an admittedly silly and stupid joke.

I can't say I find that joke funny persay but still, hate speech? seems harsh. I just don't understand the anger here at all. I would not feel very comfortable around OP I don't think, it sounds like their gender experience is very rigid and judgemental compared to mine
This isn't a silver bullet of a fix, but sometimes it's more helpful to describe it as identifying *with* a gender rather than identifying *as* a gender. It's pretty common to identify *with* characters in media, so even the ignorant can understand the vibe of what I'm saying when I say I don't really identify with other men.
That's what I do or say ""we are here to focus on you medical thingy. We can talk about gender I'll happily sit here and talk about the non binary spectrum all damn day. Or I can help you. Do you want my help? Good what is your gender?"" Or I'm really not in the mood I just sit in silence. The longer one if the people who go on s very long tangent about god or some shit. A lot of the time I just stay quiet and let them be awkward on their own and give them an ah huh a la kuzco style if they don't answer the question after a good long awkward silence.

The worst is the people defending these assholes though.
I vote for this response every single time! Sorry you're having to deal with all these shitty people OP 💗
Exactpy what I was thinking. Anything that isn't exclusively male or female is non-binary. Even if it's a helicopter.
Oh no I love it I'm just imagining Cishet bigots being mad because we are calling them out on secretly wearing fishnet tights 24/7.
I don't live there but I work with the worst of them. I take calls from there. I know how shit they are. I'm sorry you have to live with them.
Right this is a case where it's fine when we do it around our own people as a joke because we know we actually support neopronouns and gender identities. But when someone jumps in and says it when they don't support it, that's not ok. It's kind of like using the f slur, people in LGBTQ spaces use it with each other in some cases but you absolutely do not use it as a Cishet. This at least was what was happening in those spaces like 6 years ago but I don't know how common that allegory is now. Attack helicopter is the new f slur?
I’d say it’s a transphobic micro-aggression
I think the down votes on my comment make my 3rd paragraphs point very well.
 > annoyed that other people are pointing out the absurdity of binary gender and how superfluous it all is

When cis people go for the helicopter joke, they are not doing it to point out the absurdity of binary gender.

They are doing it to dehumanize people whose experience of gender is different from theirs, and to point out the absurdity of people who want to live as themselves without having their gender mocked. 

This OneJoke is a recruiting tool to convince other people not to take us and our needs seriously, and to dismiss us as attention-grabby and ridiculous when we ask to use restrooms appropriate to our identity, ask that people call us by our real names, ask not to be discriminated against in housing & employment, and ask to have competent healthcare that understands our actual needs.

On its own, in a vacuum, a joke about identifying as a helicopter or whatever is no big deal. But we don't live in a vacuum, the jokester doesn't say this in a vacuum, the audience doesn't receive the joke in a vacuum, and the people at whose expense the joke is made aren't subjected to the joke in a vacuum. The context adds meaning and power to the joke, and the persistent impact of this joke continuing to be dismissed as no big deal is to ignore the harm it contributes to a marginalized demographic. 

OP doesn't have to have a ""very rigid and judgemental gender experience"" for endless iterations of this joke to be annoying, even infuriating, instead of funny.

All that said, I identify as a boundless vacuum and will irresistibly suck the fun out of a playful attempt to pass hatespeech off as harmless jest.
Right but this was a transphobe being cruel to non binary and xenogender identities which isn't ok.
You could also just pretend to treat their initial answer as if it was serious so they have to say something or have it left like that
So true. I like the wording of asking them what the mean, like, ""What? A helicopter? I don't get it! Can you please explain?"" because it forces them to actually look at the mechanics of their joke and hopefully feel embarrassed about it.
Call them fishnet cishets so they get confused then

“What??”
It's all perspective of the receiver. If OP found it offensive- yes. 100%. 

Would I take it that way? Nah. Reasoning above. 

Some people will use my name and pronouns and minute my back is turned not do so thinking I can't hear it. 

Yet- same people who've made same joke above always respected my name and identity- even when I'm not present. One even encouraged me to embrace who I am. 

Strangers will make tactless hurtful comments. The more you get to know someone they may not be phobic just uninformed- and the most PC person can be a secret bigot.
No joke a guy laughed and said he is a lesbian as a joke so I went ahead and put that for his sexual orientation and made absolutely certain that he got a packet that discussed demographic targeting of LGBTQ people in the tobacco industry.
I called a kid Batman for an entire school year because he thought I was bluffing when I said I'd use preferred names, even if students changed their minds/requested something ""silly"".
“I identify as a helicopter/tiger/whatever” 
“I’m sorry, then, sir this is a hospital not a repair shop/vet/etc. We cannot help you.”

Or even better: “This is a hospital but you’re in luck, we have very capable doctors here who also know about helicopters/animals will gladly take you apart and decide whether it’s worth fixing you or if you’re a write off and will be disassembled and sold for parts/put down”
Then loom closer while T posing to assert dominance. Don't forget to use tassel pasties when making your exit to helicopter away while slapping your own ass
Yes but if they were just uninformed and ended up supporting you then I assume they stopped making these jokes? I think the situation with OP is a little different since it sounds like OP's having only brief interactions with strangers and trying to educate them probably is impractical. But it's good to know that even if someone makes these jokes there may be hope for them to come around.
I fucking love you.
Wait… the tobacco industry targets the community for potential buyers and users?
Honestly, this was the right way to handle it. Not your job to guess whether they actually mean their answers.
This is exactly what I was going to suggest!
Not gonna lie that’s actually kinda funny and cute.
Confusion is the best defense, and in some cases offense. I watched Ten Rings the other day and some girl in there would start singing song lyrics and dancing when an enemy wanted to fight them. It made them pause and gave the girl time to escape.
Same as the alcohol industry...

We are having higher rates of most mental health indicators...
Socio economic stuff...

Which leads to higher rates of alcohol and drug use...
(Which is why I - regular rainbow capitalism concerns aside - personally have quite big issues with alcohol companies sponsoring pride parades....)
The tobacco industry will target _anyone_ they can, to be fair. The old advertisements for cigarettes influenced a significant amount of advertising techniques still used today.

Knowing Better has a really interesting (but long lol) video on this [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GMOyNgLSX2g).
[They did, and they literally called it “Project SCUM.”](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/smoking-facts/impact-of-tobacco-use/tobacco-industry-marketing)
Which is why it was the perfect chance to double down ;) 

He did say toward the end of the year that it was fun to start over as Batman and not be the same Birthname Kid he'd always been. Pretty sure he was a cis lad and would contentedly be a dude for life, but still had a good time with a new name.
I love the strip naked and make them confused and frightened while you try and run at them dick first. Fight me what's wrong you wanted to touch me now touch me.
Woah! Spoiler! I haven't seen that yet!
I dated someone who had one of those “Celebrate Diversity” bumper stickers that is rainbow colored alcoholic drinks. Took me a couple months before I told them how much I hated it and how it’s not really supporting the community at all.

Edit: [an eBay link to the sticker](https://www.ebay.com/itm/362492746578) so you know what I’m talking about.
… well god damn that explains a lot in my personal life but also things in general
Major factors overlapping each other. I could help a trans girl with her quit and when it comes to asking about mental health conditions she could tell me she only has gender dysphoria which isn't a listed condition I can mark for the question. It's rare to find someone LGBTQ in my line of work that doesn't suffer from an anxiety or depression disorder but they are certainly out there.
Holy hell that's fucked up on so many levels.
Yeah, even the cis sometimes change their name. My youngest brother chaanged his, because he never managed to identify with his given name I also know a cis woman who changed hers because she did not want to he associated with anything to do with who she was named after.

And fun fact, both have the same struggles with making family start using the new name. Being deadnamed is not a trans/nb exclusive experience as far as I have observed. And it hurts the cis just as much, for not being accepted as who they try to signal that they are (or are not). Though there's less of the added lack ofbrespect for gender identity.

"Two separate people told a new coworker ""they'll get mad if you misgender them"""	"At the store I currently work at I came out as nonbinary several months ago and since then I have had an issue with people misgendering me pretty much constantly. Most people at the store seem to be just a bunch of mistakes for it, which I can accept, but there is one person in particular,  who just happens to be one of my higher ups, that does it all the time and reacts negatively when I correct him, which has led to me get very visibly angry, for obvious reasons.

With that being said, we had one of our old shift leads recently come back from maternity leave. She left before I was out and now that she has come back some people filled her in that I was nonbinary, which I can appreciate. She also mentioned, however, that they said it as a warning that I'll get mad if she misgenders me, and I don't really know how to feel about that?

On the one hand, it is kind if true. Like if I were being called the wrong name, repeated misgenedering will begin to annoy me, but the fact that they warned her made me feel like they thought I was overreacting. I've been honestly overly gracious with people making mistakes here and the fact that I apparently have this reputation is both frustrating and saddening to hear

I don't know exactly what my goal was with this post but I guess I wanted to voice the frustration to like minded people and maybe get validation? Advice? In any case, thank you to all who read this far 💛

Update: I brought this up with my coworker and friend who I suspected told the rehire (but suspected had good intentions) and she said that she has actually been correcting people on my behalf and letting new people know, but was not saying that I would get mad, which us lovely to hear. 

My guess is that one person said I would get mad and the other did not, but the rehire conflated the two. Still frustrating to wade through, but a much better situation. Thank you all for the support 💛🖤💜"	"Your frustration is valid.

It's trans antagonism. 

They're refusing responsibility for misgendering you, but instead offering you up as the unreasonable angry person - suggesting you're at fault, not them. 

They're giving a new coworker a bad impression of you, rather than making them aware of your ID so they have the tools to ensure you feel accepted and can make sure not to hurt you...instead they get a warning you're an unreasonable unfriendly person (aka 'one of *those* unreasonable trans').

Take being nonbinary out of the equation, it's still a coworker giving new staff a bad impression. It's shit.
transphobic people do this all the time. they’ll say “you guys call everyone transphobic!!!” and “you’re so sensitive for getting mad over being misgendered!!!” and then they turn around and say something transphobic and/or misgender you. and there’s no way to win. because if you call them out, you’re “proving them right”, and if you don’t then you just have to deal. to be completely honest, i’d consider it manipulation at this point.
I've had people act weird and tell me ""your not allowed to me mad if I mess up your pronouns"" or ""don't get mad if I don't get it right at first"". Which I wouldn't.. it's a habit that takes time to adjust and change. But ""I'm not allowed to be upset"" ... no Im allowed to. And why do people think I'm going to blow up on them for it?

Maybe this is just specifically in the context that you got upset and let them know (which is justified) and people saw that and took it to the extreme.. but I also think there is just a stereotype that Non-bianary people (maybe trans people too?) Will get pissed off and throw a fit and sue everyone for it. Just not true, I feel like most people on here say they don't even correct people when they are misgendered (myself included).
It’s truly ridiculous how just existing as trans makes people see us as “difficult”. If a woman got a divorce and asked her coworkers to stop calling her “mrs”, she wouldn’t be labeled as nagging or have rumors going around that she’s too tightly wound. It’s just because we’re trans.

Me and my partner both have had to file actual harassment reports at our job because one coach outright said she was misgendering us because we “didn’t pass well enough”. Now all the other coaches are acting like they have to walk on eggshells around us. Literally just treat us with respect, and we wouldn’t have to take it to corporate.
Just wanted to say ""good on you"" for standing up for yourself, no matter how they feel about it. I know it's cold comfort, but I think it's awesome you correct them, and they can kick rocks if they have an issue with you, your identity, or your assertion of it. <3
You should answer with “Does that mean that if I use the wrong pronouns with you or call you with a different name your wouldn’t get mad and/or try to correct me?” And if they answer with a no, start doing it. And call them by a different name everyday.
""Ok, so offer the same basic respect I give to all humans, by calling them what they want to be called? I'll see what I can do""

If you feel the need to tell people someone will get upset if you call them the wrong name, you need to reevaluate your attitudes towards people in general. That shouldn't be surprising
Thank you 💛
Unfortunately whenever you're in a marginalized group, you either have to walk on eggshells with absolutely everyone or else they will forever call you annoying and accuse you of being triggered and overreacting about absolutely everything. Just know that even though you may not win in the small battles at your work, the greater struggle is progressing at a good pace because of individual people having the bravery to come out to those around them and facing all the bullshit. Just know you don't have to be perfect, you are not going to ruin the movement for trans and enby acceptance by getting upset at someone trying to make you upset
I hate that people like to generalize trans people as rash, annoying, irrational, and aggressive by using dumb phrasing like ""that blue-haired girl with the xie-xem pronouns"". Groups of people in general shouldn't be reduced to negative stereotypes and generalizations. The way society views trans people makes me super self-conscious and hesitant to correct people when they get my pronouns wrong. Due to their preconceptions I don't want to come off as standoffish. You have every right to correct people if they get your pronouns wrong. They need to learn to be more respectful to you and not assume the worst based on generalizations based off of your identity.
Not Sure If It's Just Me, But The Fact That They Said That Also Seems To Imply That Either A: They Think A Better Reason Is Needed To Not Misgender Someone Than Just It's Common Decency, Or B: They Think The Person They're Talking To Might Think That. It Shouldn't Matter If Someone Gets Mad When You Misgender Them Because You Shouldn't Misgender Them. I Mean I Guess It'd Be Fair If Say They Start Yelling At People Who Occasionally Do It On Accident, But It Far From Sounds Like That's The Case For You.
They are deliberately pushing your buttons and playing victim if you react sppropriately.
Thank you. If it was the person that I am guessing it is then I don't think they intend on being harmful but just in case I think I am going to ask them about it for clarification. I'd rather have that problem resolved before any more new people come in and damage is done
staff should in general not be putting my name in their mouth.  I will introduce myself -
>And why do people think I'm going to blow up on them for it?

Because that's how media portray us to make us look like unhinged, unreasonable assholes instead of human beings who just want to be treated with basic respect like everyone else.
I literally don't bother bc it's not worth my exhaustion if im not in a work environment. But it depends if the person/people are clearly hateful then nah use wtf I tell you to
>""don't get mad if I don't get it right at first""

I had a big falling out with someone for using this after I first showed anger at repeated misgendering. That made me even angrier, because it had been *six years*.

We're thankfully now reconciled - they've finally got it and stopped misgendering me.
Ironically one of my cis coworkers (who often misgenders me, albeit by mistake and apologizes but doesn't *really* fix the problem) was cisgendered today and was visibly upset by it. It was kind of funny and validating haha

I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: what can I do? ( trigger warning ⚠️ )	"Hello! I'm the same person who wrote about dysphoria and wanting to go back transitioning. 

My dysphoria came back after 2 years of being ""gone"" (and by """" I mean that I'm thinking some aspects of my condition didn't went away all this time). I have dysphoria since I was 14yo and received and formal diagnosis at 17. I wanted to transition really bad by undergoing top surgery and microdosing T.

I talked about my friends about this: dysphoria, being confused and thinking that I tried to suppress my symptoms and desire for transitioning. They were very welcoming and I felt safe! 

Well, not the same happened to my girlfriend. I'll be honest: she is a radfem and I used to think somethings like her in the past (maybe due to projection or something), but not anymore. I didn't say anything about transitioning itself, I tried at first talking about my dysphoria and she said it could be ""me wanting to fit beauty standards"" (even tho I do already do fit, I'm white and have a thin body, except for being masc), ""internalized misogyny"" (even tho I dont feel offended being called a woman and etc), that maybe ""dont think I can be a woman just for being masc"" and other things like that. I said to her that me knowing those things won't make my dysphoria go away and that is something much more deeper.

One day I posted on my twitter a drawing I made of myself happy with a flat chest from top surgery. She and a friend of hers got upset. My girlfriend tried to argue the same thing. She even said she thought she was trans to, but she realized it came from s.a.. I thought that speech was really heavy and dishonest. Isn't that similar to saying gay people are gay just because ""they were s.a.""?

And that's not all: she usually makes fun of trans people, specially non binary. From my perspective, I think she tries to justify the transgender experience with just her personal perceptions, based on her own ideology, also with ""scientific facts"" that are not even a consensus in the scientific community, which I warned her about, such as ""autogynephilia"" and etc. She makes attempts to put all trans people in the same box: trans men are just ""poor women with internalized misoginy"", trans women ""gay men who can't accept themselves"" and that enbies are ""not really trans"". I find it funny that she usually misgender trans people she thinks are ""not really trans"", but if she's talking about a trans person who are ""not queer""/conservative, she uses their preferred pronouns. I pointed this behavior of hers, but she got kinda silent lol. I find it very simplistic to condition a group of people to the same negative thing, given that they are diverse and have VERY complex experiences.

It's easy to mock a group of people when you don't pass what they go though. And I get mad because that's also mocking my past experience. Yes, I did the same in the past, probably to feel better about myself and hide my desire for transition, but I don't want to be that kind of person anymore. Is not good, for me and for others, to talk negative things about a group ALL THE TIME. I feel bad and embarrassed by that.

I don't know what to do. I'm really upset and I don't feel safe with her to talk about this. (I edited the post to put more information and correct some gramatical mistakes)."	"she sounds like an awful person and not an ally to you or the trans community. maybe I'm just tired from all the anti-trans legislation going on in my country but I would run away fast if I were you. a loved one is supposed to support you, not perpetuate hate towards you. don't let a transphobe tell you who you are.
>I don’t feel safe with her to talk about this.

All you need to focus on is leaving her. She will not change, she will not see it from your perspective, she will continue to spout untrue and harmful bullshit to refute your identity. You may have feelings about her but she does not care about you as a whole person. This is not someone you can trust or feel safe around, there’s no point in staying with them or trying to change her mind. Start getting your affairs in order if you live with her because things will not improve and you deserve to pursue transition if it will make you happy.
Even if you weren’t non-binary I would suggest breaking up with her because she is an asshole
I don't see how this can work out in any healthy way if she's relying on pseudoscientific arguments to defend deliberate cissexism, and you can't feel safe - much less seen or accepted - in your relationship. I'm sorry. Best wishes.
That is such an awful place to be; having to chose between your relationship and your gender identity. I'm sure she has a lot of wonderful attributes which weren't included in the post, which is why you got with her in the first place. But it does sound like you'll never be able to explore your gender identity, and those dysphoric feelings probably won't just go away on their own.  We all end up suppressing parts of ourselves in relationships (i.e. I love musicals and my partner hates them so I don't watch them around him), but gender identity is a really big part. If it's too big of a part, you'll likely end up resenting her or feeling unfulfilled in your self. I could tell you what I think you should do, based on my perceptive, but I don't know how it feels to be you. You're the only one who can determine if the dysphoria/desire to transition is something you can bottle up, and if she's worth it.  Best of luck my friend, whichever way you decide.
have some respect for yourself and break up with her!! life is too short to deal with radfems
Please leave her
You literally don't like your girlfriend. You admitted it. Breakup.
Leave her? Im sorry sounds like a no brainer to me. 

People that don't accept you for you are not worth keeping around.

You'll eventually find someone else more compatible, you'll hurt for a while but you'll be glad you did yourself a favour by choosing your life over a temporary person.

I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing your relationships but relationships aren't everything. If being with a person makes you miserable then you shouldn't be with them.
You are not safe with her to talk about this, because she is clearly not safe. She needs to be let go. She is not supporting you by mocking and downplaying your lived experience and knowledge of yourself.

It genuinely makes me suspicious that maybe she really has felt a lot of the same but has ""successfully"" packed it away with internalized transphobia of her own... 🤷 Many many people who can't accept that they might be trans (or gay, or nonbinary) will find defense mechanisms that include shooting down that minority as a way of distancing themself from it...

Even so. She sounds extremely toxic on this front, and that's not someone you should be with even if you weren't personally the affected minority.
Please realize that even if you do realize you are cis, you are dating a transphobe. Can you really live with the fact that you love and are romantically involved with a transphobic person at a time where trans violence is at an all time high and the lives of young trans children are at stake?
Break up with her
I'm sorry but your gf and her friend sound like terrible people. TERFS are bad people, full stop.

I would remove them from my life
just as she has the right to end your relationship if you transition, you have the right to protect yourself, your well-being, and your dignity by not allowing your fear of someone's reaction keep you from transitioning. you are worth far more than the respect you are receiving, and i strongly recommend you reevaluate what positive things this relationship is bringing to you when such an important part of your life is being dismissed, downplayed, and disrespected. transitioning can make us lose people in the process, but it also guides us to the people who love us most no matter what path we undergo. you deserve better than this relationship.
She sounds like, at best, a person with an awful lot of trauma to unpack from several sides and an identity to unpack as well, and at worst, a great big transphobe. Either way, you deserve better. Your partner should make you feel safe and accept you always. One day, she may learn and grow, but you do not have to be the testing ground for her to do so. You deserve better.
I also give this advice to all the bisexual people who are in straight relationships and feel like they can’t talk to their partner about it… DO NOT TOLERATE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT DOESN’T RESPECT THE WHOLE YOU.
Your girlfriend is not a ""radical feminist"", she's not out burning bras, she's a **TE**RF, she's a shitty fucking transphobe.  The hell with her and her asshole friends.  Get yourself out of this relationship, she is not a good or healthy person for you to be with.
Only read the title. Your only option is to be direct, honest, and authentic. If she can't accept you, or isn't willing to try in some capacity, you have to decide whether or not she is worth the stress in your life moving forward. She is either with you or behind you. Your health and all comes first.
it sounds scary but you need to leave. I had a doctor who refused to give me HRT due to my past with SA and as soon as she said those words out loud I immediately decided to never go back again. ive been on T for nearly two years now.
if you do not feel safe with her now, you will not feel safe with her. this is not the person you want to spend your energy on. she will not help you grow.
**break up with her.** she is not a safe person to be around, and she’s not a good person in general. radfems are a hate group and you’d be best off getting far away from her.
I understand you're going through a lot and that you must care about your girlfriend. I have to be honest though, as someone who has been repeatedly told awful things by self proclaimed radfems, I cannot support them at all. Again, I understand she must have good qualities and that you care about her. I also hope that you find it in yourself one day to accept yourself and cut anybody who describes themselves as a radfem out of your life, because as long as she identities as one she will never accept you. She will try to tell you awful things about being trans and why you feel the way you do. You don't need that, especially when you're so early on in questioning. 

It is okay that you have this past because you are learning now. It's always okay to change our hearts and minds and be kinder. As long as she still identifies as a radfem, she is surrounding herself by some of the most hateful people. It doesn't take much googling to find cases of radfems and TERFS doing everything up to and including murdering trans women. 

Radfems and TERFS are genuinely dangerous people. I don't say that lightly. Again, I hope you find it in yourself to accept who you are and continue to learn and find people who aren't so hateful to be in your life.
She does not sound like she is very loving towards you.
If you don't want to be that kind of person anymore, why date that person? She's not going to change any time soon and it's not your job to make her a better person
get a new girlfriend
Sounds like a piece of shit

Find someone better
Just ask yourself if you want to be with someone you don’t feel safe to be yourself around. or do you deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are and fully supports you in your journey of exploring your gender and identity. the answers to these questions will make it clear as to what you should do for yourself. 
whenever you’re ready, i’m sure you will find a way to be true to yourself and choose what you deserve.
Leave that rude ass transphobe
Dump her. She sounds absolutely horrible, and no person is worth staying with if they disrespect you for being who you want to be.
I would urge you to leave this relationship, if you can.  I was in a similarly terrible relationship before I started transitioning, and it held me back for years and caused so much misery that made it even harder to accept myself later.  These people almost never change, and even if her views somehow changed, it sounds like she's being emotionally abusive in ways that often are even more ingrained than bad viewpoints.
I highly recommend reading some essays by Dr. Devon Price, like *Irreversible Healing: What Testosterone has Done for Me* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/irreversible-healing-what-testosterone-has-done-for-me-6e4b2f086823) or *My Dalliance with Detransition* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/my-dalliance-with-detransition-97ac9a5126e6). He is pretty honest about his transition and difficulties before, during, after. He is also very adamant about not lying to ourselves, and figuring out ways to be more comfortable and satisfied as a result.
Y'know, from experience with that sad excuse for a community, a lot of ""radfems"" are actually trans, they're just too broke, too cowardly, and too oblivious to know it. 

Many of them have severe androphobia due to trauma and it leaks out into every aspect of their lives. 

For your own mental health, get out of that relationship. It's not worth the amount of work.
I also fell somewhat down the radfem pipeline before I accepted that I’m nonbinary- biological essentialism and black and white thinking feels simple and somewhat comforting but in truth the world is far far more complex than radfem ideology allows for. 

You should leave your girlfriend- she is actively hindering your journey of learning who you are. No one needs to know why you’ve broken up with her, people end relationships for all sorts of things. Most people will accept that you just didn’t feel romantically for her any more. 

The most important thing is that you are able to self reflect and develop without feeling scrutinised by someone who will judge your identity.
Even if you're not trans she's still a piece of shit and your relationship is conditional
Breakup with her, she’s clearly not a safe person for you and she may even cause you to slip back into your old ways, and the whole “being trans bc of SA” Is disgusting and is extremely transphobic. You should be allowed to transition and be whoever you want to be and she’s holding you back from that when she’s meant to support you. You should get away from you before she goes full TERF
Everyone saying you have to leave her clearly hasn’t been in any situation like this. Firstly, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s so tough. I really, really hope things work out. 

Maybe seek out advice from friends- specifically mutual friends. You want advice and help without painting her as the villain and being told by everyone in your circle to split. These friends could have separate conversations with her (not about you, just the subject)

You could do some things to ‘ease’ her into it. Go to different community events, pride things, etc. Repost resources and things on your social media stories; things about accepting ALL LGBT+ people, things about trans rights, etc. 

At the end of the day though, it’s your decision. You get to choose how much time and energy you want to put into educating her. No matter what you do choose, I really do wish you the best of luck and peace of mind
Break up with her. Honestly. She will never accept you as you are, she won't even entertain the idea and would rather talk you out of it :/
You're feelings make a lot of sense. That feels like a direct conflict between your romantic relationship and your personal identity. Both integral things you don't want to have pitted against each other!

You could tell her all of this. If you think there's any hope of carrying on with the relationship, she would need to hear and understand all of that. I don't know her, so I don't know if that's likely.
this is going to sound harsh, but I wouldn’t recommend staying in a relationship with her. Even if you can get her to change her mind (which sounds extremely difficult at this point in time) it’ll take a lot of time and emotional energy. as someone who had a radfem best friend while i was 17 and finally accepting that i was trans (though i first verbally expressed maybe not being cis when i was 14), it’ll take a while to undo the damage that people like that have on you. and it truly held me back. I probably would’ve started t a lot sooner, considered top surgery a lot sooner, and changed my name a lot sooner if she hadn’t been against all those things for me. if someone’s actively mocking the trans community, they probably are gonna bring you a lot of strife to keep in your circle
The fact that your friends are supportive of you is a sign that there are people out there that will accept you for who you are. You deserve better than whatever the hell she's been giving you, and I would imagine you'd be better off without her transphobic views in your life. I don't see her changing anytime soon :(
(i didn't find out which pronouns you prefer so i am going with they / them, i hope that's okay)
when i read your post, i thought: good, this person understands exactly what is going on with their girlfriend. i think you already know what to do. you gave me a pretty good picture of your situation. she is not respecting or recognising how you feel, because of her own way of seeing things.
maybe really consider taking a break from each other. i bet that's what's on your mind too.
you can try that and see if you feel better when she is not around. maybe you find to your true self faster without her.
(Apologies for long comment)
as a nonbinary dyke who considers themselves somewhat radfem (trans affirming+believes that Women's Lib and Trans Lib go hand in hand) I think you might want to sit with the hard truth that your gf is unlikely to come around to your way of thinking anytime soon. From what you described, she is heavily peaked/indoctrinated into gender critical ideology, and it's likely she is surrounded by an online community that will provide her with built in ""explanations"" as to why you want to seek transition. If you stay together and go on T/get top surgery, best case scenario, she goes along with it while secretly pitying you/not taking it seriously. Worst case, she'll actively try to undermine your medical choices with the encouragement of her GC friends. In either scenario, your relationship will become incompatible with your happiness, If it already isnt. 

That being said, I have talked to quite a few ex TERFs/GCs who've managed to break out of the ideology, (it sounds like you were one of them) so it's not impossible for her to change. If you want to go that route, the best way to approach it is to introduce pro trans talking points through a radfem framework.  @aletheia327 on Twitter is an ex TERF but still radfem who writes often about why she was attracted to GC ideology until she realized it was reactionary, transphobic, and anti feminist. it might be easier for her to digest if she hears critique of her view from someone who doesn't inherently see trans rights through the lense of a queer people vs feminism culture war. I would also look into the work of Leslie Feinberg, a historical lesbian and transgender activist who considered zirself both transgender and a lesbian (by modern queer terminology would prob be described as a transmasc butch), which might help her understand the complexities and nuances of the trans experience.

Realistically, I don't know how much success that will reap, since it sounds like you've been trying and extending her a lot of patience to no avail. And I know it's devastating to realize you love someone who is slowly killing you inside. But ultimately, you know you've felt this way since you were 14. you know that no amount of ""unpacking internalized misogyny"" will make this go away, because you've already tried. And you deserve to surround yourself with people who make you feel safe and don't project their own gender related trauma onto you and dismiss you. And if she can't be that person for you, it might be time to let her go. 
Sending you all my love. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I hope you come to the conclusion that's best for you and your health, not your girlfriend's comfort.
Radfeminism breeds terfs. She is not in your corner.
I understand being in a difficult relationship and being afraid to leave or feeling as though maybe things will work out or that you can get her to change but please, it’s not worth it. I ended a relationship with a bigoted partner two years ago after I couldn’t take pretending to be cis any longer. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done but things are so much better now that I have the room to grow and be myself. You deserve that!! Your current relationship is not worth the pain of suppressing who you are and it will destroy you to keep going the way things are
Make sure you have a support group like a friend or family that knows you're breaking things off and safely break up with her. Radfem's believe in very dangerous stuff, and i'd suggest going with your own judgement regarding how you break things off. Please stay safe
She sounds awful.
I would leave someone like that
Who you are has NOTHING to do with who you’re dating. Don’t compromise your identity for her. I did and regret it.
she doesn't sound like a healthy person to have a relationship with. you (and everyone!!) deserve to have relationships with people who respect you and make you feel safe. not the same but i have been in a situation where i felt like i couldn't tell my partner things because i was worried about the way they would react and it's not a good way to live. if you'd like some support feel free to message me if you think it would help you 💓
One is supposed to feel safe around a partner. If you don't it's not a person who deserves you
Personally I would break up with someone like this, whether or not I was ultimately trans. I don't date openly racist people either, even though they wouldn't be racist against *me* because I'm white. Staying with someone like this is a tacit endorsement of their beliefs imo. Dating her is a problem regardless of whether you ultimately decide you're trans, and excising this particular tumor should be done sooner rather than later. For both of your sakes, and especially because she's creating a really unhealthy environment to try to explore your gender identity in.
Break up with her. Seriously. If this is how she is now, it's likely not going to get better in the future. You deserve to be with someone you can be yourself with.
This entire post feels like a giant red flag. She's constantly dismissing your ideas immediately, mocking a group of people she knows nothing about, and I think the worst part is the quote ""I don't feel safe with her to talk about this."" A romantic partner should be someone who you feel comfortable sharing your struggles and questions with without any fear, who you feel safe to talk to. I'm not just going to say ""Leave her she's terrible"" or anything because I don't know what she's like outside of this issue, but this does feel like you either need to have a discussion about it, or break up with her.
Someone you're dating should be someone who supports you, someone who you feel safe around, someone who accepts all of you not just the parts they like, someone who you can trust. Please ask yourself if all, or any, of these apply to your girlfriend. And if they don't, ask yourself why she's your girlfriend.
I give you permission to break up with her 🖤🖤🖤
Honestly, if you can work up the courage to, then I'd tell her. Depending on her reaction (as in if it's seemingly neutral or better), then I'd probably give her some time to see if her general behaviour towards trans and nonbinary people changes. If it doesn't, then she fundamentally would not respect you as a person, only her idea of you, and that's not the foundations of a lasting positive relationship.
Tbh even if you were cisgender I’d tell you to break up with her.

She’s a toxic asshole with shitty views and you can do so much better. She won’t let you be who you want to be, and it’s not your job to “fix” her. Call it there, and end it. Don’t even be friends, she doesn’t deserve it, and you don’t deserve to have to put up with someone like her.
Run. Get as far away as you can. That is fucking terrifying. You deserve better, and I don't mean to sound dramatic or scare you, but people like her can be dangerous. ***Please*** be careful. The fact that you don't feel safe talking with her about this shows just how precarious your situation is. Listen to your instincts. Surround yourself with people who love and care about you and will protect you. I personally would view this as a domestic abuse-type situation, and the period of getting away from the abuser is always the most dangerous time.
If she can not grow to accept you, you've given her time to come around, and she hasn't and decided to invalidate yours and others' feelings -

Then leave. As a partner, even if she doesn't understand where you are coming from the least she could do is try but instead she has attacked you for an identity/label that made you feel safe and demonized your feelings and disrespected you and your community completely. I know it's disappointing, but it's the option that would likely make you happiest, even if you lose someone you love in the long run. It's definitely better than her suddenly leaving you because of your identity, though.
only read the title, but fucker her.
uh

yikes at her being transphobic

Why are you going out with a transphobe who makes you feel unsafe?
Hey, this take might be a little spicy, but I’m just going to be honest. depending on the flavor of radfem, in my experience they don’t usually make safe dating partners, at least not for people who aren’t cis women. I’m an amab nb with varied gender presentation and my ex was a radfem leaning woman who shamed me for my body and was pretty open about hating men and amab people in general. I understand she had a lot of trauma from men which led her to that point, but I honestly walked away from the relationship carrying my own trauma and shame because of the way she made me feel about my body and gender. She wasn’t explicitly transphobic like many other radfems but her ideas did lead her down the rabbit hole of browsing terf and misandrist subreddits and stuff like that, which was honestly really upsetting to me, but I find it can be incredibly hard to reason with people of that perspective. After I broke up with her I basically vowed to never put myself through anything like that again. I have compassion for radfems and recognize there are deep societal inequalities that lead them to their ideas. I hope they can change, but for me they have just been generally unsafe to be around and I can’t imagine this experience being all that much better as a trans man or masc presenting non-binary person. Please be careful and remember that people like this can have a huge impact on others’ mental health
Hey! I’m a radfem, but not all radfems are trans-exclusionary; your girlfriend is just a dick. if you can’t be yourself around her then there’s no point continuing in a relationship. it’s hard but you shouldn’t give up your own freedom for assimilating into a relationship that will hurt you.
I have no idea what your gender is; no one else can tell you that. But you should have a support network that wants you to be happy and that will support you no matter your gender. If someone thinks there is an automatic right or wrong outcome for you as you explore your gender, they aren't really supportive of you.
I'm so sorry your girlfriend has shown she's not a safe person to be open with
You can't change her mind for her, all you can do is decide whether or not you want to stay
Honestly, even putting aside your own identity here - there's an obvious conflict between your beliefs and hers. She's transphobic, you disagree, and arguing about it isn't working. She's making fun of you to her friends/publicly putting you down about a sensitive and personal struggle.

I don't see her as particularly different from (another common example unfortunately) a cishet guy with a bisexual girlfriend, who he doesn't see as ""really queer"" and makes homophobic remarks in front of / about, while dismissing her identity as ""just from SA"" or wanting to be ""not like the other girls"". Both would be shitty, bigoted behaviours, even if they \*weren't\* talking to someone who is a part of the group being derided. To do all that to someone you're supposed to love and support is just... cruel.

That you were out, changed your mind (and engaged in terf-y spaces), and are now in a state of questioning and wanting to come out again is understandable. It's rarely a straight line from realisation to actualisation. Going back in the closet because you thought you were wrong, or that something else would be easier, or because the world is scary and you *hoped* you were wrong... happens. Can't beat yourself up about that. Also not worth beating yourself up if you do land on being cis again. The question is what do you want to do now, and do you want to tolerate someone who is going to dictate how much of yourself you're 'allowed' to be.
break up with her. you'll not have support and your dysphoria, at some point, will become a joke to her.

u dont deserve someone who don't understand u on your changings. its sad, but she changes only if she wants and maybe she won't do it. and probably will make fun of you on your process. is not easy, but think in a long term.
My guy, you should just break up with her
break up with her cuz she’s an asshole.
I’m sorry but your girlfriend sounds like an absolute trash human. I mean no one is perfect but she seems to be deliberately interested in causing harm. 

I wish you all the best as you navigate all of this. I really reallllllly recommend considering leaving this person so you have the space you deserve and need in order to explore and experience your gender. I hope you have supportive people (or at least one person) you can turn to.
Dude you need to leave her regardless, she is a horrid person
This, for real. Anyone who tries to make you fit the mold of what they think you should be is not worth keeping in your life.
She is wonderful in many things! But I really am afraid: I'm not sure yet what I am going to do, if I'm cis or trans, who am I... but I can't erase my transgender experience. It was a big part of me, I can't erase me. I tried, but that's is disrespecting my own being. If just being ""political"" (like what many radfems like to say) and acknowledging misogyny would be enough, my body dysphoria wouldn't have been back and I wouldn't have been questioning myself and my beliefs. How I perceive myself was always different, since I was 14. It didn't changed, even if I tried to hide it. I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

If I break up with her, my mother will sure want to know why I did it. I really CANNOT tell her about this. she will definitely be sad if I say Im thinking about going back to transition. I don't want to be judged. I really wouldn't know what to say if she asked ""why did you breakup with your girlfriend? Everything was going okay, wasn't it?"".
This is a nice take. Only OP can know what is most important here.
Worth noting, though, that even if you bottle it up, if it really is important it will come back out later!
Yes! I really think people who talk bad things about a group of people so much are probably a part of it, but they are denying themselves. For exemple, as a lesbian, I always have said ""lesbians"" who treat bisexual women badly and call them names 24/7 are probably bi and have internalized biphobia. I saw many ""lesbians"" like these that ended up coming out as bi with a boyfriend, what they ""feared the most"".

I wonder if that was also my case, but about transitioning
I guess flirted with some aspects of radfem thinking because of my projection and anger I felt at the time I came out as ""cis"" and also trying to distanciaste myself from the trans community due to that. Also maybe to get validation from my mom and the rest of the society. I remember my mom saying very clearly that she's ""glad that her daughter is a lesbian and not some trans man"". That was like a fuel to me for suppress my desire for transition and just act ""normal like every other women""

I'm glad I'm not alone. Now I see how lots of people of this ideology can be hurtful. My girlfriend really likes to say unpleasant things about transness. It doesn't feel good being surrounded by people who spend all of their time being a bigot, calling trans people this and enbies that. Even me, who aren't even sure about being non binary, is getting tired of that negativity.
No problem! I actually feel okay with any pronouns (and my name is Noah too!!)

Yes, I'm thinking about the possibility of breaking up, not gonna lie, but I always think a lot before making a decision. I'll probably make an appointment with my therapist only to talk about this situation. She's a good person in many things, but when it comes about dysphoria and all... I think there is really a possibility of me going back to transition because the idea of having a flat chest makes me euphoric and I don't think suppressing that feeling will make me feel better and stop my dysphoria. I don't want to be with someone that I'm afraid of being judged for exploring myself. 

But, at the same time, I'm afraid of what she and her friends are going to think of me? I don't know if she is going to see me in a different way and treat me like a joke just like she does with other trans people. Yes, I also was like this, but I don't want to anymore, I won't project myself in this community and talk negative things about them. That's not cool at all. And I don't want to be criticized for changing.
Thank you for your kind words! I'm going to look forward reading Leslie's work, because I'm both lesbian (I still identify as one after all, I don't see myself as a straight trans man) and gender non conforming. 

I'm really afraid of talking about this situation with my girlfriend. I'm almost sure she will ask me (again) not to go to a trans specialist because they will ""force transition down my throat"" or will say (again) that I'm like this ""maybe because I don't think I can be a woman because I'm butch"". I'm afraid that if I break up with her, but stay as friends, she will view me as ""one more butch woman who felt down the 'liberal trans ideology'"", maybe say that I'm ""not really trans"" because I choose the label non binary to describe my experience. I don't want pity from anyone nor feel judged. I just want to live my life like everyone else, in a body that I feel most represented, like how I see myself in my own mind.

Even before questioning gender critical thinking, I tried explaining to her why people with dysphoria choose to transition and I think is a valid way (precisely because I LITERALLY went through that) but she really did disagree and all. I always tried to give her a perspective of a dysphoric person, but she still have the same exact beliefs. 

I guess I still have to unpack more of my past trauma (fear of not being accepted, being excluded and judged) because I'm THAT afraid of what a person who I'm dating for only 4 MONTHS and her friends, who I never saw in my entire life, are going to think of me.
Well, she's not making fun of me, particularly. But if I say ""hey I'm feeling dysphoric, I'm thinking about buying binder tapes and maybe going to a trans specialist who can help me"" or ""I'm thinking about top surgery, I think I'll feel happy"" she will probably say again ""but that's wrong, that's mutilating your body"" ""oh it's all internalized misogyny"" ""don't go to a trans clinic, they will push transition down your throat"" ""maybe you think you can't be a woman because you're butch"" and more things like that. These words are not welcoming at all, and knowing it won't make my dysphoria disappear. Making me feel bad about it and suppressing these emotions won't help, definitely. She NEVER had experience with being trans as I did and she will NEVER know how it feels like.
That's what I'm afraid. What would stop her from saying ""oh [my name] went back being those queers"" or ""she thinks she's that non binary nonsense"" ""oh poor one, she was brainwashed by those liberal trans queers"" about me, just like she says about other people. I'll admit I was just like this, but I don't want anymore. I'm an adult, I've been in contact with both ""sides"" of the story, I can make decisions on my own.

There were this person who was formerly a radfem in my country, they really used to shame trans people and bisexual women, but know they are openly trans non binary. When my girlfriend told me this story, I said ""well maybe they're more happy that way, don't blame them"", but my girlfriend didn't have the same thought as me. I got where did she came from ""how did someone, who was very 'political', changed so much? Didn't they learn anything?"" but I knew that people naturally change their beliefs and the most important thing is that they're more happy right now. I thought that, even while falling down the radfem pipeline. I'm afraid my girlfriend just shame me just like in this situation.
You do not need to tell your mom why you broke up with your girlfriend. You can say something generic like “we have different values and I found myself struggling to relate to her” and if your mom presses you can say “I don’t feel like talking about this, it was a really painful thing because of how well we did get along”.
Maybe you don’t need to think of it as breaking up with her because if your identity. Maybe it can be breaking up with her because she’s intolerant, lacks empathy, and seems to spend her time conjuring up problems to have with marginalized communities. It wouldn’t be unusual for a white person to dump their white partner for being racist. The same can apply here. You don’t have to wait until you feel sure about your identity to cut an intolerant person out of your life. And the truth is, you’ll probably find it easier to understand yourself once you don’t have her in your ear anymore
>She is wonderful in many things!

Is she? Or do you just overlook things because you love her, or you think its normal, or you force yourself to change your feelings to align with that belief? One of the patterns I notice with intimate couples is that one person will come and tell a horrific story about their partner not at all being a good person and yet they'll still consistently say that their partner is wonderful and supportive and so awesome. Then the more people point things out, the more realization the poster has that maybe things aren't as great as they had convinced themself. Of course, not every person is 100% awful at all times, but there is often a long-term thread of disrespect, insensitivity, lack of support and so forth. People will do a lot of mental gymnastics to not have to deal with the truth about someone they love.

>I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

Yes, friend, she will. She has already showed you that. I really recommend you find a good trans-informed therapist to help you through this. and to help you better understand the ways you are ignoring keeping yourself safe. You're allowing your girlfriend to mistreat you because of the internalized transphobia you're feeling. It can be helpful in some way, because that outside source of disagree means you make more space inside yourself to come to terms with your truth. However, outsourcing that hate may not serve you anymore once you do start to claim being transgender. I think, in part, you're worried about not only how your GF will treat you but how you will treat you, how your parents will treat you, how your other friends will treat you. If you start building an inclusive support system now, it will help you so much with trying to make better decisions for yourself. I think it'll help you feel less like you'll lose everything because you'll already have people holding you up.
As for what to tell your mother, I wouldn’t tell her about your gender questioning until you are comfortable to do so (although frankly I have to say I hope you’re prepared for the possibility your hopefully-future-ex might use that against you to try to earn points in the realm of public opinion, although I DO hope she is a better person than that).

I would simply tell her that you found there were beginning to be topics that you didn’t feel safe talking to her about. That whenever those topics came up, your partner would say really dismissive, hurtful, and cruel things, despite you expressing that you didn’t like the way she talked about those topics. 

The ability to communicate openly with your partner is SO important to the health of a relationship. If you said that you didn’t feel “safe” talking about ANY topic with your partner, that would be a massive red flag for me, and it would be time to seriously reevaluate your relationship. Since this particular topic is so tied into who you are, and since her viewpoint is so steeped in bigotry, I’m inclined to say you’re just better off without her. But at the VERY least, maybe you can look into couples’ therapy (obviously with a well-reviewed LGBTQ+ positive therapist), and I hope you are also looking into some individual therapy to help you sort out your feelings around this and give you some guidance in establishing healthy boundaries so that you have the safety you need to explore your own gender identity.

Whatever you choose to do, I wish you well, my friend. Getting to know yourself is a lifelong endeavor. We never stop growing and we will never FULLY know ourselves, and that goes for gender too imo. I hope you find the support you need, whether from her or somewhere else, to find joy in the very act of working to know yourself better through discovering your gender. Maybe you are trans. Maybe you’re cis and you just want a different body. Maybe you’re some flavor of non-binary. Maybe your understanding of who you are will change over time. Whatever you are, you’re valid. And not knowing is valid too. It’s okay to be a work in progress. We all are. :)
I'm curious about your previous trans experience. When you where younger, were you trans masc/man instead of trans nonbinary? It could make sense if you were leaning male but then pulled back because it didn't feel right. 
I always knew I wasn't a girl, but being a boy only felt a tad better. I'm so happy to have gone down my journey to understanding and accepting being trans nonbinary. I don't do hormones but I have had a few surgeries and I love my body now. 
It's ok to considering changing parts of yourself that make you dysphoric. Even if you never change any of your ""labels"", it's ok to pursue what will make your body feel more like a ""home"" you want to live in. Please try to break up with this toxic person and find a gender therapist.
(funny we're name buddies now ^^)

i see... i think you are doing it right. taking time to think and sharing your thoughts with other people and your therapist. that's really good 👍🏻

i'm sorry that you're afraid of their reaction... but i guess when you're not hanging out with them it won't bother you that much anymore... i think if you're having other people you can count on, you will be okay :)

i'm happy for you that you changed and feel better about it now ^^ it really feels like you're going to be fine ☺️
probably she will.
I'm not being arrogant or wishing u bad things.

I'm someone who passed through a similar situation, but, he didn't saw me in my transition (my ex, that I did want to marry and blablabla).
When I told him, the first time, I was bissexual (years after, understood me as pansexual), he thought it cool. But when we broke up the first time and after a long, we came back and he knew, cuz I told him, I dated 2 girls, he got out of his mind. He used to say that I was confused and felt really bad about me having an affair with 2 girls while we were away from each other.
when we came back, he used to be openly bifobic to me and transphobic to others. 
I know that one of his cousins is trans. And he always have been the type of guy who thinks this is a bullshit created to put ""great and sweet"" people in a confused path.

I told a little about me just to say u: people who are openly lgtbqphobic, specially transphobic, they will not accept u as who u are. and depending on how they were raised, it gets worse.
u can try, talk and see what happens. but, we are not talking about ""she likes potato's and I like strawberry"". we are talking about ur self being and yes, she can shame u. in front of many people. or use u as a token to show how benevolent and lovable she is.
my ex always embarrassed me towards my sexual orientation. and used to use me as token for a fat poor lgbtqia person he was envolved.

don't be afraid to go.
if u want to talk to her and see how she treats u... it's upon u. 

hope she don't do anything bad to u or disrespectful.

if u wanna talk, my dm is open!
Seriously, I rarely tell my parents all the details of my breakups.
When I was younger I came out as a trans man to my friends and family, but after some years I started to question if I was non binary transmasc (agender, to be more specific). In any case, all this time I transitioned socially, I legally changed my name and all (and I'm glad I did it because I absolutely hate my dead name). But I wanted specially to undergo top surgery. I was really planning on that, it was my dream of life, I even emailed a doctor from my city asking for information). But when I found out I exclusively like women (after thinking I was bi for a long time), I came out as a lesbian. At first, I did still stick with the label non binary. For me it wouldn't make sense to call myself a straight trans male, since I resonate a lot with being a lesbian. My mother was so happy, she said out loud that she was glad I ""wasn't trans anymore"" and ""I'm so happy you love your body now"". What I think happened to me was: I tried to suppress my desire for transition and my different perception of gender so I can be more accepted and just be ""normal"" like everyone else. It kinda worked, but now I'm feeling dysphoric again and having trouble with how I perceive me. All this time I didn't stop wishing I was like the transmasc folks who have done the surgery nor stopped seeing myself in characters while have more masculine physical features. Right now I see myself as idk nothing? I do would like to be like a more tall, full flat chested with a deeper voice, but at the same time I see nothing about myself.
I'm so sorry your family and partner have been so negative. I'm no contact with my family and it's the happiest I have ever been. I know that no contact isn't the best route for everyone, but I realized that the relationships with my family were unbalanced in what I got out of it compared to what they expected me to to put into it. Nobody should feel required to be in a relationship that causes harm.... sorry for the tangent! haha  
What I came here to say is actually this: I am so very proud of you. I don't know if you realize this but you have taken some pretty big steps recently to look at what you need for yourself and what you need from a partner. Whatever you decide to do, even if it's nothing, please know that someone out there has a lot of respect for how you're addressing some really challenging issues in life. I hope that doesn't come off as condescending, I'm just speaking from experience and my experience is that where you are right now isn't easy, but here you are looking for advice and support. I support you."	121w0mq	NonBinary	351	0.99	2023-03-25 19:15:08
So tired of “subtle” transphobia/nonbinary-phobia	"I always come across people that claim to be allies, yet they say things that are transphobic but in a (not-so)subtle way. I had a friend talk about a plus size model (who’s a trans woman) winning the beauty pageant and he was like what are your thought on this? Mind you he sent me a video of a transphobic person’s point of view and I’m like “dude, this guy is obviously transphobic in the video”. And he’s like “yeah I know that but look at the video” and I’m telling him I’m not watching a video on a transphobe reacting to that. And he lowkey wanted me to agree that things are getting “too woke”. But again ✨subtly✨. He also claims there’s a “war” on masculinity because “manly men” (aka his version on toxic masculinity) are becoming too feminine. And then when I talk to me people it sucks cause I use they/she/he pronouns and I’m amab nonbinary/genderfluid. So they see me as a man and just use “he” the entire time and get mad when I correct them too much. *sigh*. Well at least that first friend I have kept distance from him so that’s good. And I’m trying to only talk with people that are actual allies and not claiming to be and doing transphobic things.

Edit: forgot to mention that I changed my pronouns to she/they after a while because I was getting so annoyed of him exclusively using “he” and now he would still use “he” a lot and that was my final straw"	"People who act like they want to be allies trying to get trans people to give our blessing to some transphobic nonsense is such a weird thing.  Like they know it's wrong or they wouldn't be asking, but they're hoping we tell them ""no, you're right, it is definitely getting too woke, and also your gaming experience should definitely take precedence over human rights, it's fine if you send your money to that terf.""  Like our primary purpose as a trans person in their lives is to offer absolution for their bad thoughts and decisions.
Last January I was camping with my brother, his wife, and their two kids.  Nieces were cuddled up against me watching the campfire, I felt safe and loved and decided it was finally the right moment to come out as nonbinary. 

Then my brother and his wife started making fun of a neighbor kid (like 5, apparently AMAB and living as a boy) whose favorite thing is dressing up as Elsa from Frozen and dancing and singing around the house.  

A year later and I still haven't even started to crack the closet door open again.
Although I'm loathe to ever link to Twitter (especially since The Muskening), I feel like this series of tweets sums up the 'culture war on manliness' that your supposed friend was going on about:

[https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1572713537910476801?lang=en](https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1572713537910476801?lang=en)

It's a series of clippings from newspaper articles bemoaning 'manly men becoming too feminine' from the following years:

* 2020
* 2018
* 2004
* 1997
* 1984
* 1977
* 1965
* 1950

In other words, bigots rarely get new material. They just re-cycle the oldies due to lack of creativity.

This friend of yours doesn't sound like an ally and doens't even sound like a friend, really. I mean, you know your relationship better than me, but a friend should build you up and respect you, not do this sort of crap to you.
Bro yes. I use they/them, my mom calls me E like i want her too but doesn't they/them pronouns and doesn't try to understand .
This makes so much sense. Literally I felt that and I didn’t know how to explain it. I told him “dude I’m not listening to that, it’s a transphobic guy talking about it” and he kept on insisting like “yeah but just watch it I wanna know your perspective” and I was honestly getting so mad and he kept insisting so many times. He always does this sort of subtle stuff that I find it hard to call him out on. It’s so infuriating and it’s honestly exhausting at this point. I have kept more distance from him for now cause it’s hard to just not be friends with him all together at once. So I’m keeping a lot more distance for now
Somehow a lot of my aquaintances are allies for gay people but are highly transphobic. It is pretty mutch socially accepted to do so and I don't really know why. My dad and his girlfriend talk like this a lot. And being non-binary is a whole other level of being hated.
People talk hatefully so openly and make each other hate others more just for existing and just for the sake of bonding. I can not stand up against these people. I usually just sit silently and scream internally for help.
I don't think I'm strong enough to step out of the closet. But staying in here is so painful...
Oh lordy, my partner has a pal like this. Literally on Tuesday his pal sat there talking about Sam Smith's new music video and about how ""he doesn't want his son to see this kind of shit."" ""But if women want to do this or lesbians then it's all okay."" Like no that's not okay, not in this non binary household. I tried to educate him but it's exhausting trying to do that all the time.
100000% agree. I was scrolling thru tiktok, and there was this one that the overall talking point the user was making was really whatever, but out of nowhere he started going on about “people’s kids these days are coming home identifying as TREES” like gender/etc was not AT ALL what his whole tiktok was about yet he had to go on some mini tangent to shit on trans and gnc people? In some ways, the “subtle” or like passive transphobia feels worse than blatant forms; at least when it’s blatant, it’s easy to point out, but this type feels more insidious and harder to fight.
Ew. People like that probably also think abuse is only physical, too. 🙄
So much of this is what I'm getting from my own family members and it's pissing me off. I haven't been around my family a lot until this recent breakup from a long time relationship and it's just making me wish I could find my own place sooner so I didn't have to put up with this shit. I know they're ""confused"" but it would make more sense if they would actually want to learn and listen when I talk to them. I'm still trying to figure myself out lol.
I just recently made the discovery that I’m a trans man and not non-binary, and I noticed a very subtle shift on how people treat me. It’s so annoying because people shouldn’t have to be binary to be respected and loved, love should come from everyone. Your friend needs to see the error of his ways, but definitely think about if your mental health and mental energy is worth educating him.
I think what annoys me most about this kind of thing is no other minority is expected to provide insightful and informative commentary on the conceptual implications of are own existence.

No one expects random black people to provide oral university level essays on KKK speeches. They don’t stop being black when they fail to convince racist that racism is bad
Well the point of he/they/she is that you don’t mind either. Maybe try to tweak that a little bit.
Watch the video for respect of your friend and right down what you didn’t like and all the things your friend might have not noticed; also is good to try as much as possible to see other peoples side even if they’re “wrong”. Communication is key, don’t close your mind.
sounds like a loser
yo fuq that guy
Wow that is a very accurate analysis of what goes on in their head. You’re right, they just kinda use us to say I support you but… and then proceed to indirectly shit on us cause it makes them feel more comfortable and gives them credibility of being like “hey my shitty ideas work cause I said I support them so I’m safe”. That’s like when people say “no offense but” and then proceed to say the most offensive thing and think it’s okay cause they said no offense
Exactly, I have met so many people that are like ""I'm an ally, but..."" or ""it's hard nowadays with pronouns so I'm just going to use the wrong pronouns"". Like, if ur transphobic just say that no need for (not so) subtle queer-bashing.
Yeah, either that or they're thinking more like:  
 > My ""friend"" is just silly & confused, but I'm too close to them so they won't listen to *me* telling them to get over this gender nonsense already.  
 >  
 > So I'll send them this video where the Really Smart Asshole makes all the points I'm to afraid to say out loud. Tough love by proxy, the ""hard truths"" they need to hear, without me being the one to confront them about it.  
 >  
 > Then my ""friend"" can realize their deviancy and get back to being normal, and I'll never have technically given them cause to get mad at *me*. Once my ""friend"" changes themself to my liking I'll consider them a friend instead of ""friend"".

I think a lot of these people think they're being subtle when they send us this transphobic crap with a ""yeah I know, but just look at the video"" explanation, and that the transphobia on display in the thing they're urging us to experience somehow isn't *them* being transphobic at us. 

That somehow ""Hey, I'm not the one saying these things to you, I'm just the one requiring you to listen to them"" makes their assholery ok.
Yeah, this. A hundred times this. Like, I can't prevent you from buying that stupid game. And I wouldn't if I could, because I respect your freedom. But if you choose to buy it, you are objectively helping a billionaire who uses her platform to harm and restrict the freedom of people whose only fault is to freakin exist. And if you can't bear hearing that, well that's a you problem 😡
it’s sad to see people, especially family members, so programmed into the way our government wants us to be that they make fun of people for being happy. the only thing we can hope for is that enough people get educated on gender. but like they say, you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. those who want to learn would’ve already tried
Very useful thanks! Yeah I figured this “war on masculinity” is the whole “bring back manly men” bs where men aren’t supposed to be doing house work or act “feminine”. I’m so tired of hearing that cause literally nobody is telling men to stop being men, it’s just telling eggs that it’s ok to be a trans woman, or nonbinary etc, but also to the men in general that it’s ok to ease up on the toxic masculinity, and to chill out with everything they do not being manly enough or whatever.
Definitely going to save this link, thank you for sharing!
I think it's just an endless cycle of kids passively picking up on gender roles and expectations, growing up and finding out that reality is different from what they're told, and then believing that those childhood stories were actually accurate meaning that reality must've become worse.
I feel for you. It really sucks all we’re asking is for the same rights cis/het people have it’s not too much too ask
I can’t start hrt or go by my pronouns in my house cause my dad is highly transphobic/homophobic unfortunately.
Glad you shared your experience. It’s not easy being closeted. Even when some people know it’s hard to stand up for ourselves cause sometimes it seems like the world is against us. Yes I have talked to some trans friends and they agree that for some reason cis/het people are more uncomfortable with the concept of being trans and/or nonbinary than concepts of liking the same gender (sexuality).
I think the difference comes from time: for example, Seinfeld was before my time ('89-'98) but there they coined the phrase ""\[something is gay\], not that there's anything wrong with that!"" and that sentiment of ""there's nothing wrong with that"" was pretty pervasive growing up. But only for homosexuality; transgender people were exclusively invoked to be the butt of a joke. More specifically trans women (I can't recall anything transmasc from that time at all).

So people like your dad have grown up during a time where gay acceptance was a big thing but not trans acceptance. Non-binary has barely even scraped the mainstream. So good and bad news:

* Good: trans acceptance progresses at a much faster rate than gay acceptance did, thanks to the internet and to the path having been walked before.
* Bad: the current state of gay acceptance is still lackluster. Gay relationships are extremely rarely depicted in popular media, last year there was a big conservative ""groomer"" narrative surrounding anyone LGBT and there are many people still afraid to come out as gay. So trans people have to catch up on something that's not even finished.
God, I so relate with this… they get so drunk in their aversions that this tiny closet seems a little more comfortable. I’m questioning now and the idea of being out, at least in Indiana, hell no. They already know anyways as I don’t have an intuition to mask perfectly around cis-men.

I’ve tried everything with masking and the only thing that has worked is massive aloofness, which then I get criticized for being self righteous. It’s, like, I’m just not allowed to exist. And feeling this for all of my life has really been a freaking mind fuck.
anddd this is the reason I deleted tiktok- never again.
Literallt though. 🙄
And then they say they’ll listen but when you tell them they get mad again and don’t want to hear it lmao.
Oh I’m sorry I forgot to add more context. My pronouns in reality are he/she/they but I only use she/they when it comes to people like this. I specifically asked him NOT to use “he” pronouns and he still does and then gaslights me into saying he’s “trying” even though he’s really not cause he’s known I’m genderfluid for almost a year now.
I mean yeah it’s not about the video exactly, it’s just that he does this every time. He always shows me something slightly transphobic and wants me to see what I think. But when he talks first he always agrees with the transphobes to an extent and it really pisses me off. I understand not knowing some things are transphobic and willing to learn and understand it, but he basically wants me to feel like trans people are too much without directly saying it idk how to explain it
We got in another fight and this time it went pretty sour. I stopped caring anymore and if he doesn’t want to be friends that’s his problem not mine. I’m done being gaslit into thinking I’m exaggerating asking for something as basic as pronoun usage
Literally though. My friend does this all the time and keeps sort of rolling his eyes whenever I have to correct him. I sort of excuse it but I’m tired of excusing transphobia
The thing is though that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, dogs are less stubborn than humans.
We live in California, so it's not the government as much as a general culture of cissexism.  But I have friends and acquaintances in Texas, and there it really is the government.  :-(
It reminds me of the same BS Douglas Adams parodied 44 years ago in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*:

“In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.”
You're welcome. 🙂
Awww I’m sorry to hear that :( I guess cause nonbinary is less known it’s less accepted in society. Cause human logic is oftentimes: “majority=correct/ethical” even if it doesn’t make sense.
It’s not all bad. I don’t use the app but when I was figuring myself out, I looked up genderfluid tik tok compilations and nonbinary tik tok compilations on YouTube and I was like “Wow! I didn’t know you can be this gender, wow! I didn’t you can dress as a girl AND a boy and feel like both” so that literally helped me so much. But yes I agree, there is still a lot of toxic things on that app and homo/trans-phobia.
Exactly! It's an infuriating cycle of bullshit!
This always happens. Like  seriously u gotta get over it if u want 2 progress bc more and more ppl r coming out.
lmao. i love that. so true
I was confused that you meant me but I realize you meant people like him lmao.

My friend got mad and blatantly misgendered me	I feel bad, and I know I shouldn’t, but my friend, olivia, and I got into a fight and they purposefully and disrespectfully misgendered me. I tried to forget about it but it was not something I could shake. I have worked so hard to move away from that and seeing someone I trust like that say something like solely to insult me felt terrible. It is okay to quit being friends with this person over that?	"Yes. Being mad doesn't give someone a pass to be transphobic.
Yes it is completely okay to cut ties over that. It is completely reasonable to be upset and offended by someone showing that they clearly do not respect you.
That's a person literally using what they know about your vulnerabilities as a weapon to hurt you.
Absolutely. There is no excuse for misgendering someone on purpose in order to hurt them. That's straight up transphobia.
""Just because you're upset or irritated with me doesn't give you the right to so blatantly and *intentionally* disrespect me like that. That's not ok in the least.""

Tell them that at least and if they give a real apology and make amends, intending to never do it again, then keep them. If they double down, move on.
Yup. A true friend /ally will still use your pronouns when they’re angry at you.
It is never acceptable to purposely misgender someone, even it you are mad at them or don't like them.  Even if someone does something immoral or wrong, that doesn't justify disrespecting them as a person.  Example, we don't intentionally misgender trans people who are in prison, even if they did something wrong, they still deserve to be respected as a human being.

It is absolutely understandable to be upset about that and not want to be friends with someone who only respects your identity conditionally.
You do not misgender someone to punish a person. There is such a thing as too low, and that is it.
Accidentally misgendering someone is one thing but doing it purposefully as an insult is something entirely different. I'd put it on the level of using a racial slur.

Sometimes people do stuff out of character when they're angry but I'd probably say that's going too far.
Yep. Because what it comes down to is trust. You cannot trust them to be kind, and you cannot trust that they *actually* accept you. People who weaponize your vulnerabilities for their advantage are toxic people.
i'll go a little against the grain and say that the correct choice here is whatever is right for your comfort, and nobody can tell you that but yourself. if this instance is enough that you never want to interact with this person again, that's completely your right
i had this happen to me, my ex-friend was mad at me and kept using my deadname, even saying “it’s your name isn’t it”. cut em off, they are disrupting your happiness and who you truly are. put yourself first.
Yeah because they view your identity as something that they can use to hurt you and are willing to hurt you if you upset them
YES! It is a-okay to end a friendship over something like this.  No matter how much someone dislikes you or has a disagreement, it is not okay to misgender you or use your deadname.  There are people I absolutely loathe and I use their preferred name and pronouns because you don't have to like someone to give them basic respect.  This ""friend"" showed that they only respect you when y'all get along.
I'd cut ties over that. It's one thing to accidentally misgender someone when you're getting used to someones pronouns, but to intentionally do it to a ""friend"" just to hurt them, nah. They'd get the yeet if that happened to me.
That’s a shit and transphobic thing to do, gendering someone correctly should NOT be conditional. Without a sincere apology and change in behavior, I personally would not be willing to continue to be friends with someone who did that.
Imo it’s one of those things that shows that they either 

A) don’t respect your identity and the mask fell off

B) were trying to hurt you and went for the thing they knew would be painful, which is horribly mean

If they are a close friend, it’s worth discussing with them if you’d be comfortable with that, but remember that your comfort matters. You are allowed to ask why they did that, and not to be satisfied with generic things like “I wasn’t thinking” or “it just slipped out”. And if they apologise, you are allowed to take some time before forgiving them/not forgive them at all
I'm so sorry this happened and that they betrayed your trust and hurt you. It's perfectly okay to end the friendship
That person isn't your friend. Correct pronouns are neither conditional or to be earned. They are a basic human right. That person is fucked
Completely okay to cut ties. Weaponising your gender, knowing how difficult it is to accept and be non-binary, is very low.
Thats not your friend.
Yup! Snip snip that bitch!
Yes it is. They don't get to be transphobic just because theyre upset. That bias doesnt come and go based on a mood. If they attack you with it when they're angry, theyre still thinking it when they're not mad. Screw that.
My sister did that to me when she got mad but she called me by my dead name
ABSOLUTELY. Olivia cannot call themselves your friend and disrespect you at the same time. Every time Olivia becomes upset with you, are they going to misgender you? You deserve better than that. It is possible to be upset with someone and still respect their humanity. That’s, like, bare minimum.
I don’t tolerate misgendering people ever. Even if that person did the most terrible thing imaginable (doesn’t apply to you, but just in general). Like, I’ve had fellow enbies tell me they misgender people who did terrible things to them, which is totally understandable, but also, our gender/ lack thereof is NOT retractable. Purposefully misgendering someone for ANY reason just shows that you are still perpetuating cis norms and the myth of the gender binary. It really makes me mad. So yeah, cutting ties is justified I think
I had the same thing happen to me to the point where they referrred to me as ""whatever"" which may not seem big but we'd had multiple conversations about the respect they had for me, so to see it go out of the window over a small spat just showed me that they had negative feelings over it that they never expressed and were now showing how they really felt.. that's how I took it, anyway they're blocked now
When I came out to my soul sister of about 20 years, she said she didn't believe me and she wasn't going to be using my pronouns. I said, ""okay then I don't need to have you in my life. "" unfriended her on everything, and that was that. 

You deserve respect, and if it's not given, then they don't deserve your friendship 💖
[removed]
Who you are isn’t conditional. If you started calling this person by the opposite gender just because you’re mad at them, it wouldn’t make any sense. So being mad isn’t an excuse to misgender someone. And if this friend thinks it is, then there is no issue with breaking up the friendship. They are being transphobic, and think it’s okay because they’re upset. That is not okay. You can try to educate them, but if they don’t want to learn and grow from these mistakes, drop them. It’s not worth the pain, and there are plenty of other people out there who will respect you no matter what. You won’t be destroyed without this person in your life. Do what you feel is best for you and this friendship, but don’t feel bad if you decide to drop them as a friend. It is reasonable to be upset with them for misgendering you, and if they think it’s still okay after a chat with them, then they will probably do it again and aren’t a true ally or supporter of you.
Question here no disrespect but is there a difference among friends or others in an argument (not sure what the fight was about) from misgendering someone or calling them an a$$ hole or other derogatory word?  Meaning you got an a fight they call you names and it's over. While I am not supporting name calling hurtful speech is hurtful speech not sure  if one is more hurtful than the other?  Ex:( I am using terms here loosely for brevity) Say a MTF gets into a argument with a cis woman cis calls MTF a man, mtf calls cis a b@tch, again is one less or more hurtful than the other? To me no just move on, but would be interesting to here others perspective

Absolutely it’s okay to quit being their friend. That’s a really low thing to do and you deserve so much better than that— fight or no fight
of course people shouldnt misgender you for any reason and its perfectly fine to cut ties what they did was wrong
This happened to me this summer and I haven’t spoken to the ex-friend since, and I don’t want to. People’s respect of your or anyone’s gender should not come from how they feel about the person in the moment.

They used your vulnerability against you, something they know hurts you. A friend should never use your “weaknesses” as a weapon. 

It’s very similar to when person A opens up about their insecurities, say, with acne, and person B uses it as a weapon to get back at them. 

My answer: if they didn’t apologise, do not take them back. If they did, you need to evaluate whether you’re truly able to forgive them because, chances are you’ll probably never trust them the way you did before.
That's nasty of your friend. There's a difference between heat of the moment anger and vindictiveness. Your intuition will fill you in OP. Fwiw I'm sorry they did that to you.
Absolutely. Identity is not earned. If someone uses that as a weapon it is really fucked up and they don’t deserve your time.
It shows your friend is a transphobic pos. They only see trans people as their trans identities when they like them. Me and one of my ex friends had a fallen out. I hate him. I wish him the absolute worse. He’s a shitty person. He’s trans ftm. Doesn’t mean I’m going to go out of my way to use she/her for him. It doesn’t matter how mad you made your friend. Nothing can excuse that.
They’re not being a kind person so yes it’s absolutely okay to cut ties with someone for being intentionally cruel to you.
Definitely. Doesn't sound like they were much of a good friend to start off with.
Olivia sucks, dump them
It is a completely valid reason to stop being friends with them, being mad doesn’t give right to misgender somebody 👍
That isn't your friend anymore! Get toxic people out of your life exactly when they show you who they really are.
People should ALWAYS respect other peoples identities, no matter the circumstances. If she’s willing to misgender you on purpose because she’s upset, she doesn’t respect your humanity or who you are.
They need to APOLOGIZE. If it's a sincere, heartfelt apology accompanied by action then that's the best chance of them being your friend again. If they do anything but, then they're not a true friend and misgendering ain't cool.
[deleted]
Ugh thank you. It’s really disappointing and i felt paranoid because i’m finally becoming comfortable with my gender & with my family/friends so I wanted to make sure I wasn’t doing too much
This is the heart of it. Do you want to be friends with someone that would purposefully strike you where they know it would hurt the most because they’re upset with you? That’s really shitty behavior.
unfortunately i asked and they pretended it never happened
Very true
That is a really great point. I decided to take a step back for a while but might be worth considering. Thanks!
calling a trans woman a man is soo much more hurtful than calling a cis woman a b*tch. it all comes down to individuals feelings in the end, but petty insults are MUCH different than blatantly disrespecting and actively injuring someone based on their gender identity in that way. they are not the same, at all. petty insults are way different than transphobia, and i don’t even know how to describe how terrible it would feel if someone called me (a transfemme) a man. talk to almost any trans person and they will say the same thing.
“Your friend is using something you’re most vulnerable about just to hurt you? (Btw this is an abuse tactic if you didn’t know) Well *youre* the childish one for not staying friends with someone like that” do you know how stupid you sound?

> we need lgbtq in the 50s but now we need to remove it and all it’s labels 

Jesus Christ are you seriously this idiotic? That’s like saying “we need adjectives in the old days but now we need to remove them and all the descriptive words” like what? Also you are aware anti-lgbtq is STILL and deadly thing? Are we gong to ignore the over sexualization of wlw relationships? Are we going to ignore the lgbtq+ youth being beaten, abused, and kicked out at home for being lgbtq+? Are we going to ignore the fact that lgbtq+ people are still raped and SA’d as a form of “conversion”? What about the murders? Homophobia and transphobia isn’t a thing of the past. Stop acting like it is and stop trying to guilt lgbtq+ people into being tolerate of intolerant people you ignorant pos

Edit: Also your blatant transphobia towards the end proves my point about us still needing the movement
there’s not really a term for being “non-binary phobic”. so we fit into the larger trans category and this is considered transphobia
being trans just means not identifying with your AGAB, nonbinary falls under the trans umbrella, whether you've medically and socially transitioned or not
Yeah that’s true they tried to say oh it was about someone else but I guess deep down now I know their true feelings so you’re right. blocked!
Time to leave and look for some new friends🚪🏃💨🧍‍♀️
Wow that's even worse. Yeet!
yeah that comment made me real mad too then i was just super confused upon checking out their profile and discovering they're a 16 year old enby who uses he/they pronouns. their comment here seemed kinda out of place among their other comments & posts so i'm wondering if maybe they were hacked or something?? idk. odd :/
Enby is still under the trans umbrella tho so it’s still transphobia. If you’ve **trans**itioned away from your assigned-**gender**-at-birth  then you’re **transgender**
Exorsexism is the word
I Have Heard The Term ""Enbyphobic"" Thrown Around, But It's Definitely A Neologism, Not Really Used In Scholarly Circles.
There is the word ""enbyphobic"".  


But it is a subcategory of transphobia.
Objection, Your Honour, I Identify With My AGAB, But Am Still Trans, Because It's Not The Only Gender I Identify With.
Not sure about the context that would make it possible to be about someone else. It may or not be their true feelings about your gender though. When people lash out they choose words that are intended to be hurtful, and she knew that would be hurtful to you regardless of what she did or did not think. 

&#x200B;

This is still very fucked up and not ok in the slightest, and a real friend should not exploit sensitive personal information to intentionally hurt someone. I'm just saying that while things said in anger can reveal true feelings, sometimes they don't, because people are generally a hot mess. At this point it's up to you if you even *want* to try to repair this friendship. If you don't, then it's valid to cut ties and be done. If you do want to try to get past this, then you need to sit down and make it *very, very* clear that this hurt you, and how it hurt you. She needs to make amends, and you might need time to forgive. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry this happened to you, and it sucks.
I’m hoping that was the case
Who cares if it's academic? It accurately describes a pretty specific ""subgenre"" of transphobia, therefore it works.  


Transphobia and enbyphobia aren't the same, ouibinary trans people don't get eternally the erroneous repetition of ""you must choose"" for example.
… babes you are aware that the other genders you identify with…aren’t your agab….so those count as transitioning from your agab….so what they said still applies…right?
I've Never Had That Happen To Me, But Honestly If Someone Told Me I Had To Choose To Be One Gender Or The Other, I Would Just Sing The Entirety Of ""Choices"" By The Hoosiers, Too Good An Opportunity To Pass Up.
I Mean.. They Said ""being trans just means not identifying with your AGAB"". Not ""Being trans means identifying with a gender that's not your AGAB"" (Which would probably be more accurate), But Simply ""Not identifying with your AGAB"", I feel like you'd have to use some pretty weird logic to interpret that in a way in which I, Who indetifies with my AGAB, Am included.
Respectfully, I’m nonbinary, but the only gender I feel any connection to is my AGAB. Like.. I’ll still call myself a girl, I just don’t identify as strongly as I would if I was cis. I don’t feel cis or trans, I’m just like.. nothing at all but a bit of girlhood in me too. I don’t feel a connection to any gender that *isn’t* my AGAB, so I don’t call myself trans because that doesn’t fit me at all. Not every nonbinary person has to identify as trans (but yes nonbinary is still under the trans umbrella, & if someone with the same AGAB & gender as me identifies as trans that’s okay & perfectly valid. I just.. trans isn’t a word that describes me)
Ig they should’ve said “not only…” to better fit. Also, just outta curiosity, why do randomly capitalize words in your comments?
I never once said every enby has to identify as trans. I’m saying non cis gender identities are under the tans umbrella? The person I replied to with my comment said themselves that they identify as trans but identify as multiple genders including their agab as a way to disprove the initial comment (which was that enby is under the trans umbrella, which you seem to agree with so I don’t see what your point is?) and my comment was saying that that what they initially said still applies. Nobodies saying that everyone who’s non-cis *has* to identify as trans, but non cis identities are under the trans umbrella (which, again, you said you agreed with that…so again what was your point?)
Isogender? [here's a link](https://lgbt-pride.fandom.com/wiki/Isogender)
Well, Usually I Capitalise All The Words Like This, But I Try To Avoid That For Long Paragraphs As It Makes Them A Good Bit Harder To Read, About Halfway Through Writing That Last Comment I Realised It Was Getting Kinda Long So I Stopped Capitalising Words, But Also Didn't Want To Go Back And Uncapitalise All The Ones I'd Already Written.
Omg my apologies I actually misread their comment & thought they *didn’t* identify as trans & you were telling them they had to. My bad!

In that case I do agree with you, I just don’t like the notion that a lot of people have that every nonbinary person *is* trans whether they identify that way or not bc of how far I feel from that identity (it seems like you don’t have that notion, I just thought you did when I originally commented)
>themselves that they identify as trans but identify as multiple genders including their agab as a way to disprove the initial comment (which was that enby is under the trans umbrella)

You Seem To Have Misunderstood, I Agree That Non-Binary Is Under The Trans Umbrella, I Was Simply Disputing The Definition Of Trans They Gave.
Ok it just hit me in not sure links are allowed. 🫠

I.guess I'll worry about that if I'm told later.
Thank you! I’m actually fine with just unlabelled/nonbinary but I will give this a look!! :))

Edit: I just read through & that actually describes me to a T haha! I’m gonna stay unlabelled but that’s really awesome! I’m gonna look up the flag now~
Thanks! I think I fit in that category. I also found metagender which I think has a similar defenition.
Why do you capitalize all the words then?
Ohh okay
I had the same reaction, honestly.

I still typically say ""nonbinary man"", which I guess is confusing coming from an AMAB. So I typically refer to this when people need more of an explanation.

Wear all the clothes!
Same! Its confusing but after accepting im NB I stopped caring about presenting masc/butch all the time and just wear whatever now... I even enjoy the womens thrift section now (which is so much more extensive)

Keep being you 😎🤙
You can do it! Look up some size charts in a brand you're interested maybe? Or just do what I did and wing it a bit haha! Took a little bit for me to figure out what was gonna fit me and how (and I'm still not great at it haha). Let's just say the people at the returns desk know me well.
Thank you 😊
All of them!!!
Thank you!! It's funny isn't it, how it comes full circle like that sometimes? I had to first outright reject femininity to realize that no, I actually am feminine in some ways and I can feel good about expressing it in my own way.

Transphobic material being posted here (with good intentions) should maybe be approached in a different way	Hey, fellow non-binary human here who has noticed in recent days other non-binary folk posting transphobic memes, screenshots, etc. Obviously, y'all are doing this asking for support for the way these things make you feel and I am 100% here to gas you up, talk shit about intolerant people or trends, and offer advice and support.  Every time I see one of these transphobic memes or screenshots or whatever though, I get heated.  I am reminded that many in the world are hostile to (my) our existence and I get mad.  The non-binary subreddit shouldn't be the place on the internet where I am most often exposed to transphobia.  If you are someone who needs some comfort or community surrounding something transphobic you saw or heard or whatever obviously that is great and so many of us (including me) are here for that and for each other.  But please consider a like brief description or something instead of like posting the meme itself because it makes some of the people who see it here feel as bad as you did when you saw it out in the wild. Do what you will, I'm here to support and defend you of course, but you're throwing me off my game.	"I totally get you. I think maybe a flair that gives a trigger warning for transphobia might be helpful? That way it’s more obvious from the beginning what it is and it’s easier to avoid if you’re not in the headspace for it. I understand how useful it can be for people to discuss these instances, but at the same time it’s nice to have a safe space separate from all that.
Yeah I wish people would spoiler stuff like that at the very least. I know that people aren’t doing it out of ill intent, but transphobia in my feed is still transphobia, regardless of the poster’s intent.
[deleted]
Well put. I can get behind this fully.
Id hate for something like that to be totally banned when its for discussion purposes, but definitely some sort of trigger warning, or ideally it’d be cool to treat them like nsfw stuff where its blurred.       
Of course providing a link to the material instead of directly reposting it would be a good easy courtesy, i think.       
Tbh, that kind of stuff doesn’t really upset me at all like it used to (not that its not upsetting, of course) but I still agree that if the poster knows what they are posting is transphobic, at the very very least a trigger warning should be used (but linking to the sauce instead is probably way better)
I wish there was a different subreddit for that kinda stuff tbh
i specifically left at least one other trans sub because the majority of the posts felt like they were just people reposting hateful shit they've seen. like even if you're posting it to dunk on it i do not want to see it lmfao
Love this post. Thank you for keeping us cool.
To the lovely souls who want to post things like that, the best place to do so would be nonbinary circlejerk. If you type that into the ol searchio it'll come up. I can't remember if it's spelt a certain way and I ain't checking.
I completely agree. While being blind means I don't have anything to go on but the url of the posts, knowing that it's transphobic things without even having to check it out in the first place would be better.

I can definitely agree with everyone here, this kind of content can be really bad, and in a way I'm glad I'll never ever see it.
Legit, I often find myself just skipping through posts like that because I just don't want that on my mind most days.
And spoilering.
This is probably the easiest and most effective solution, imo.
I too would hate for it to be outright banned. I think a lot of your suggestions would work well and accomplish the goal of keeping most people happy with the way the sub is.
I think linking instead of just reposting the image is a great idea.
Transgender circlejerk is good for if you want to make fun of that kinda thing. I get the blues easily so I don't want to see sad shit as much so even if they made a flair or a nsfw kinda dealio it would be awesome.
Also r/arethecisok. It's supposed to be for things that are absurd, not just straight up hate. But it's definitely more of the latter.
Combination of flair and spoilering would probably best. Because I sometimes click at photos JUST because they're blurred and I'm curious 😅

This subreddit has gender bias.	"a mod got mad at me for not thinking a picture where my stomach was showing would be nsfw, locked my post and said it was my only warning. but when I scroll down, I see pictures of other non-binary people wearing bikinis. The only difference is I’m afab and they’re not.

I really hate being non-binary and still get sexualized for being afab. I just wanted to post a selfie I felt confident in, but instead I get people in the comments acting like cis incel narcs. This subreddit is ridiculous."	"[deleted]
i scrolled down to see an amab person with their full torso out. this is really disappointing that you got treated like that
this has been something that frustrates me about this sub. i'm totally ok with the nsfw rules being really strict since it's an all ages space, but it is super unevenly enforced. amabs and trans masc people can post things that afab or trans femme people cannot. that defeats rhe purpose of being recognized as nonbinary.
Breasts are seen as wrong to this sub. Whether someone is amab or afab they're considered NSFW, and yet I see amabs and afabs with top surgery going shirtless all the time. If we're all NB then why are ""masculine"" chests allowed but ""feminine"" chests are not?

It's pretty ridiculous that mods are gender biasing their actions.
Can we come up with a cool name for a new sub? Cuz to be real I wish people posted things other than selfies...
That's really disappointing. I saw your post and it really wasn't that scandalous lmao, I've posted pictures to a similar degree and had no such warnings. If the mods want to be super cautious with their nsfw tagging then that's fine, but you have to apply it to everyone. Such a shame bc this sub has always been so nice to me, but you shouldn't be treating people differently depending on if they're amab or afab
also would love to see mods try to explain themselves on this
agreed, I've definitely been policed for my body in a similar manner as well. one thing I noticed is that people are afraid to speak up (including myself) because this is such a large online community for us, but frankly that doesn't mean we should be putting up with bullshit. I've starting sharing my photos on r/androgynoushotties if that's something you'd be interested in also
There is r/enby subreddit I don't know a lot about it but from searches, it exists. Just anyone is curious.
I just looked at the post, there was nothing wrong with it. Mods suck
I feal sorry for you and yes there is a devide sadly
Didnt know this... will probably leave then
I'm in a pretty cool NB Discord group.  Also a Trans group on Facebook, that is largely transmasc, I know that isn't the same, just saying.
Really sad to hear this. ): I’m sorry that happened.
That's fucked 😞

I thought your picture was really cute! <3
If you're all good with discord (and over 18) you're welcome to our server, https://discord.gg/VkSZfWmbhG
If its the pic I saw, I think it mightve been the bottoms that did it rather than the rest. 

But the bias is still there when it comes to chests.
I really thought a space run by other non-binary people would be free of something like that, but I guess not 🤷 I feel you on that though. I wish there was more spaces available.
yeah, I saw that and had the same thought. I scrolled for a bit out of confusion, and I saw so many examples. bikinis, sexual captions, areolas, people bending over & you can practically see their entire breasts. which isn’t bad, but felt like it surpassed what I had posted. 

I would understand getting the warning if I was at least in a sexual pose of some kind, but I wasn’t. instead it just felt like a double standard and I was worried I was overthinking. thanks for acknowledging it, makes me feel a lot better to hear other people say it too
Don't forget the afab top surgery pictures that are constantly posted as well.
exactly what I was thinking. how can a non-binary space separate based on body type? what’s the point of even being non-binary if that’s how the community will still see me & others like me? entirely disappointing. an evenly enforced rule wouldn’t bother me.
“Breasts are seen as wrong to this sub” wow yes yes yes
There was a point I had to ask myself if I wanted top surgery because I truly wanted it, or if I just wanted it because of the expectation. it’s hard to tell the difference sometimes.
I’d be down for this, lol. would love a healthy mix of selfies and interesting discussions, balanced by people who treat other nbs with the respect we deserve
I’d love that too. I tried tagging the mod under a person’s post who was also wearing revealing clothing, asking why they were allowed and I wasn’t, and of course they ignored my question completely. just locked my comment again & said it was unacceptable for me to be “trying to start an argument on someone else’s post”. 

I would message them personally, but I think they owe a response to the whole community, not just me. but it’s always a miracle when mods take responsibility for being discriminatory
I get that, I honestly didn’t think my concerns were going to be noticed with so many people in this sub. But it’s clear from people’s responses that this is an issue we care about, so that definitely counts for something. 

also thank you for sharing that sub, I’ll use that one from now on 🥂
awesome, thank you for sharing this
I agree 🥲 you literally can’t even see my chest.. would love for a mod to explain it to me
yeah I’m done with this sub too. already threatened to ban me, but there’s no use in continuing to post here after that
thank you so much 😭❤️ I appreciate hearing that
Sadly there is still discourse of ""validity"" and sexism even among the trans community yeah, if someone were to ask me a single dress code for everyone regardless of gender would be good (like, either stop everyone from taking photos without a shirt/top cover or let everyone etc) not that that matters really....
i saw your post and i also think it's fine. it's not at all a sexy pose. they should either ban it for all or allow for everyone
of course. good to know my body isn’t acceptable unless I pay thousands to an institution to change it
I wish I was exaggerating but there's a lot of praise for breast hate, hiding, and removal that goes around.
of course!! if you look in the about section for that sub I think there are more subs linked for more masc/fem presenting enbies etc
No problem.

I made my mother cry, does anyone know how to comfort her?	"I am Non binary and I told my mother as such a few days ago. She did not take it well and the past days have been icy. We were in the car and she asked if I was mad at her. I told her yes, and explained that I felt disrespected and was angry at how she had responded. We argued for a bit but finally got to a place of understanding, and she asked me if there was anything else. I asked her to stop calling me her daughter and I think that was the last straw. She started to tear up but composed herself quickly. I gave her a hug but it doesn’t look like she feels any better.

I feel awful and want to comfort her. I wrote her a little love note and plan to make some little origami flowers and bake her favorite cookies. But I feel like I would be buying her off if I did that. Am I overthinking it or should I do something different? I hate that I hurt her, but what’s done is done, and I’m in disaster relief mode.

Any help appreciated <33"	"If you didn't say it already, you may want to be sure you're clear that you're still her _child_ even if you don't want to use the title ""daughter"" anymore.

Try to focus on the word while making sure she understands that the parent/child relationship is still there. As you phrased it here, ""stop calling me your daughter"", _could_ be interpreted as a breaking of the relationship, not as a changing of the terminology. Especially in a conversation that's already charged, and where you've already admitted you're mad at her.

Other than that, give her time, but be strict with boundaries. It's not your job to comfort her, but she's your mom and you sound like you want to help. Just don't be guilty about it, as her pain isn't anyone's ""fault"". It's something she's got to go through, and you can empathize and help her as her child, but it's no one's _fault_ that she's hurt right now.
Sometimes it just takes some time.  I know it’s not necessarily the same, but when I first came out to my mom she started crying because she has this notion that I wasn’t going to have the pretty white wedding dress she always imagined for me.  I told her that even if I hadn’t come out, I was more likely to wear a suit to my own wedding.
If you want to make her feel better you can do those things, I think that's thoughtful, but don't feel like you need to comfort her if she's the one that doesn't understand, but expecially respect you. 
For example, if she's just shocked and worried about you and your relationship, your letter, cookies and origami will make her understand that you are still the same person (but more aware of yourself) and you love her. I she's sad because you are not cis and she feels like she failed in parenting you for that, or something similar... I wouldn't do it in that case
I don't know what you should do, but I can tell you that I think that your mom loves you and she just needs some time. And I think that in time things will turn out alright for both of you in your relationship. That's just my guess based on what you wrote. I don't know what you're feeling, but have faith in each other!! Never goes wrong.
Gift giving is a valid love language and along as you don't go overboard with opulence. It's not buying her off! It is a sign of care love and affection!
Everyone is different, and feelings are complicated, so sadly there's no easy answer.

One thing to keep in mind is that this is big news for her, and that for your whole life, she has seen you as her daughter. This spans far back to well before you have any memories, and she has monyhs and years of memories with her baby girl that she likely now feels are tainted. She is going to be mourning that loss, even though she still has you. That's likely something only time will heal.

Patience is one of the biggest things you can give, and that goes both ways. Hopefully she has that same patience with you as you discover yourself more. I really hope you find your balance with your mom. All my love to you.
Not all tears are necessarily tears of sadness, sometimes just an overload of feelings and thoughts just result in crying.

Let your mother know you love her, and that you know she loves you. Keep it up with the hugs and other signs of affection.

Something that might be comforting to her could be telling her you've always been and always will be her kid, just not her daughter.
When you come out to someone like a spouse or parent, they are having to deal with a lot of complicated thoughts and emotions around how they see you. Processing that stuff takes time and it's not fair to expect that they're gonna be fully on board in a few days. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a little peace offering and acknowledging that this is a scary and confusing thing for her. It's OK to assert your identity and your needs, but it's also important to recognize that the ""mother daughter"" relationship as a concept is very important to some mothers and has a lot of stuff bound up in it. Telling her you didn't want to be called her daughter any more was a moment that was very significant in terms of what it meant (or she imagined it meant) to her as a mother. She can't yet look forward to what she's gaining in your relationship because she still had to understand and grieve what she's lost.

All of this applies even IF the person you are coming out to is very accepting in general of queer identities and concepts.
If she doesn't respect you then it is not your job to comfort her.  She is crying because you do not conform to her cisheteronormative view of the world and she sees that as a bad thing.  Why is that deserving of comfort?
If you have come to a place of understanding and you all just feel a little rocky with the whole interaction I think doing something nice for her to show and tell her you still love her is okay and isn’t buying her off!  

Hard situation I can imagine the weird feelings in the air about the whole argument and information sharing. It actually sounds like you did a really good job. You were clear, firm, and I think loving with your note and feelings. Can’t ask for anything more it’s just hard for some people to hear and process.
I feel this with my parents I had to break it down that I’m still their child. That no love is lost I’ll always be their baby. But I found out the gender that I’ve been told to present as doesn’t feel right anymore. That the only thing that changed was how I see myself and how I want them to view me. So that could help, while also given the gifts so she understands.
I think those gestures are great and aren't buying her off. You are showing that you still love her and that you care about the relationship you have with her.

I also want to +1 the point of making sure she still knows you're her child and not wanting her to use the word daughter is about that word (presumably) and not about you feeling like she's no longer you mom or something like that. Explaining that it's about your gender identity and not your relationship may help her understand and make it easier.
In your mom's mind, her relationship with you is tied up with what she perceived as your gender. She's lost the ""gender"" part of it, and it probably feels to her like she's losing the relationship along with it. It may help to explain that you're not her daughter only because ""daughter"" implies ""girl"". Ask her to think of how she feels when she thinks of ""my daughter"". All the warm feelings of love and care and memories, and ask her to put all those feelings into the word ""child"" instead. You are still her child, she is still your mother. The only thing that's changed is a word.

I'm working through a similar issue with my dad. He was always proud of his two little girls (I have a twin sister), and I've explained to him that I'm still his little girl, I'm just his little girl who isn't a girl. If that makes sense.
It's weird that she puts you in a situation where you need to comfort her.
Sending you love 💕 you are not responsible for her pain nor is it your responsibility to comfort her. Please do not feel guilty or regretful for sharing something so important with your mom. Humans need time more than anything, both of you do. Do not feel burdened or charged with the duty of being her therapist. It would be much more worth your time to focus on what you are feeling now, independent of her reaction and emotions! You did a big thing, and you are further asking in your path! Focus on what that feels like. 💜
Try to educate her on what Non-binary means WITH FACTS and how you fall into it. Sometimes it is just a lack of understanding and we shouldn't lash out at those for not fully understanding.
From the story as you told it, it doesn’t sound like you did anything wrong. You just told your mom your gender and she had a confused reaction to it which made you feel angry. Then you explained how that made you feel. That sounds like emotional maturity. Without knowing any other details it sounds like your mom has beliefs and emotions of her own that she needs to sort out on her own time, and there isn’t much you can do about that. My mom is going through sort of the same thing.
There is NEVER anything wrong with cookies and origami flowers omg. Go for it, it's absolutely darling. You don't owe her an apology and I hope you don't dream of making one, but acts of love are always good!

It's okay that your mom feels like crying. It doesn't mean you did anything wrong. It just means she's taking you seriously! I bet she has a lot of feelings attached to the idea of your mother/daughter relationship. I bet she doesn't even HAVE an idea about what a mother/nonbinary child relationship could feel like. She always thought she knew what was going on with your gender, and now she realizes she didn't. Loss of certainty hurts. There's no getting around that. There's just recovering from the surprise, reaffirming the relationship, and moving forward into a bright future where you both get to know who you are.
Your parents job at this point is to love and support you. 
She should look to people who are not you to process her feelings about gender. 
You are not obligated to comfort her in this time.
Get her some T and an aromatase inhibitor. That'll make her not cry as much ([/s](https://toneindicators.carrd.co/#masterlist))
If she's the type to stress over crap like this, she's probably the type to be bought off like that. Just tell her you're still her oldest/youngest/middle/whatever you are child and she's still your mum all the same
Never comfort transphobe. They are not worth it and it's about our existence not their feelings. You didn't hurt her. You told her something important about you and every good parent would have be there for you. Supporting you. Not making it about herself and her feelings. People who react like that don't love you. They only love the idea of having daughter. People who need time ask it. Don't tantrum like a toddler.

If she comes to you and want to ask questions to understand it's different thing. I would answer her. After she apologized without you asking it.
Hey, you don't owe her anything. You are not responsible for her happiness, you are responsible for yours. She needs to understand how you feel and know that person she thought you were, is not who you really are.
Oh, she needs more time. As a parent myself, it would feel like I missed out on something, that I should’ve known/guessed already somehow, that I wasn’t there for you while you were going through something, that you’re moving somewhere I can’t reach/don’t fully understand - there are so many things I can imagine relating to. I think crying is a genuine gut reaction and one that would be normal for any parent at first. I hope you both figure it out together x
Coming from personal experience, reassuring her that whilst you’re not her ‘daughter’ you’ll always be her child and that you do still love her even though it can take some adjusting on her end, can do wonders!! 
As others have stated she likely just needs some time to process this, congrats on coming out as well btw it’s an incredibly brave thing to do from your end and I have mad respect 🫂
Oh I never thought of that! Yeah I think she might have interpreted it that way too :/
I’ll try my best to reassure her. Thanks for the advice <33
Adding on here, this was really hard for my mom too when I came out. We wound up sitting down and googled something along the lines of ""what to call your nonbinary child. We found the term Sprague, still not entirely sure what it means but it made both of us laugh and so that's what we go with now! 
 
While I'm sure the initial loss of a ""daughter"" is hard, no one is really losing anything here and it's a moment for you two to build together. 
Best wishes OP
Such good advice. I wish I’d known this when I was going through it!
This is actually really good advice. OP were here for you regardless of the outcome.
Thanks for the advice! Yeah I think she’s just confused right now :/
Thanks so much!! 💕💕
Thank you so much <33 I’ll try my best with the patience :]
Even my mom, who is pretty supportive and has always been a queer ally, had some hard moments when I first came out. She always wanted a girly daughter (I tried) and she had to let go of some of her dreams for me when I came out. She never really blamed me for it though and now has new dreams for me. Coming out can be rocky for everyone even though it’s not anybody’s fault. Hopefully over time things get better :)
I think she is just shocked more than anything. It’s really big news for her. Though you are right about the conforming things. That’s what we were fighting about before she started crying
Yeah that makes sense. If you have any tips on how to show her that, that would be great! Also good luck with your dad <33
She’s my mom though, and we’ve always had a rocky relationship. I just don’t want to kill something so new :/
Thanks so much : ] <33
Thanks. Good luck with your mom <3
Oh she loves tea! That’s a good idea thanks 💕
Thanks <33
Thanks so much! 💕💕
I hope so! Good luck <3
When we get scared our hearts can close down. Always helpful to have someone help you keep connection!
I understand. My mother and I also were having trouble with each other after I came out. 
In my situation she had a ""griefing process"" but she came around while I stayed with my girlfriend. Maybe your mom is doing the same. 
Make sure to let her know that you're still her child. But you're not her therapist, if the situation gets too much for either of you, spend some time apart from each other. It helped my situation at least
Thanks friend
Are you being goofy back or did you not get the joke?
Yeah we’ve kinda been “coexisting” in a sense. We don’t hang out as much but she will still play cards with me and stuff

My friend once called me an “ethereal space deity” and that’s been my go-to response since then
Me: Sometimes.
Them: I mean what's your gender?
Me: I'm a villain.
Them: No, I mean how do you identify?
Me: Evil.
Them: No, I mean what's in your pants?
Me: Doom.
In grade school a really young kid asked me, ""Are you a her or a he?"" I replied, ""You don't need to know!"" After being misgendered quite a bit I was over it and got snarky (back then I identified as female because that was all I had ever known). Today I would probably answer with a simple yes or no.
THE LAST ONE IM SCREAMING 😭
Or just say eldritch abomination. My gender identity is too complex for a mortal like you to comprehend. 😎
“From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the blessed machine.
Your kind cling to your flesh as if it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call a temple will wither and you will beg my kind to save you.
But I am already saved. For the Machine is Immortal.”
Where’s that vine where the person is like “don’t ask me if I’m gay, straight, or whatever. I identify as a *fucking threat*
I usually try to look as confused as possible and just say ""I don't know.. ?""
“Is that some human thing?”


“I’m a [insert star sign]”

“In Christ there is neither male nor female.” —Galatians 3:28

I quite like the no or yes answer, I always kinda feel like ‘yes’ is a good answer for gender fluid folk or might be a boy or a girl, and ‘no’ more towards envy folk who are not gender
My favorites are ""yes"", ""no"" and ""you would like to know that, huh? ;)""

or just walk away or stare into their soul

Usually gets the conversation away from gender pretty quickly.
“I’m your mother’s/father’s future spouse”
“Sorry, I’m not familiar with the concept.”

“What are those?”
“Wouldn’t you like to know”
I once walked into a gas station and was greeted with “sir,” and as soon as I spoke the clerk said “oh, I mean ma’am” to which I responded “that’s sir ma’am to you” and carried on my way.
""No, just high""
When coming out to my school’s admissions counselor who wasn’t familiar with non-binary, I said something along the lines of “it’s under the transgender umbrella, except I don’t feel very strongly male or female, more of a ‘gender X’ situation” 
I know that definition doesn’t fit every non-binary identity, but it was the most straightforward yet professional way I could think to put it, being on the spot
I come from a skittles family (mostly consists of rainbow members 🤣) I've never been asked but I have my answer ready lol I identify as chocolate... When they reply huh or what?! I say her/she lol my rainbow 14 year old find this hilarious 😂

I didn't know what the Magnus Archives was until I saw your comment. I looked it up and it seems like something I would enjoy. Thanks for accidentally introducing me into something!
All the time and they're super awkward about it. There's an almost visible wave of confusion spreading in all directions when someone isn't sure how to gender me. 

'Madam... I'm sorry, sir! Or is it madam..?' - at this moment everyone who was listening kinda peeks and checks me out because **they need to know**. I usually answer 'it's ok' and just let people call me whatever they want. It only confuses them more, but in my culture it's weird to interact with strangers a lot, so they just give up. I kinda got used to it tbh.
Yes. Ive only had it asked to me once, but it was asked to me nonetheless. It does happen.
Long before I knew I was non-binary, I once had a substitute teacher ask me in front of my middle school class if I was a boy or a girl. You could tell it kind of slipped out and she wasn’t trying to be mean, but you can imagine how everyone started laughing and joking about it after that. She did apologize after class though, and she sort of scolded the kids she heard making jokes.
I tend to find it’s mostly little kids who (offten) have very stereotypical veiws of boy and girl
Yes.

Have you met my friend 11-chichillas-with-a-tommygun?
Yesssssss congrats. TMA is great. 😁
Nice, dont get too attached to anyone
Oh, I love the approach of just soothing them as opposed to answering at all — it's okay, honey. things are confusing sometimes, aren't they? *pat pat*
I do try to give more explanatory answers to little kids asking. They deserve to be educated about gender even if their parents won't do it for them. 🙄

Is it normal to cry over dysphoria?	"Basically what the title says: is it normal to cry over dysphoria? My mom says she can’t deal with the crying everyday anymore, and I feel bad. 
I (they/them) am a non-binary person who often gets dysphoria, mostly top dysphoria. I know I probably can’t get top surgery when I’m older as it’s becoming more restricted in America, and I don’t want to break my ribs so I don’t wear my binder everyday. I have no “dysphoria outfits” either because currently we cannot spend that money. And since I don’t know what to do, I cry. Backstory: I cry frequently. Depression, anxiety, sewerslide, etc. When I am mad. I don’t know what to do, so I cry. And I cry from dysphoria and not being able to have a flat chest, anti-trans laws, and the prospect of probably never having top surgery. 
So, is it normal to cry over dysphoria? How do I handle it?"	"It is 100% normal. It sounds like you are overwhelmed with negitivity, your body, politics, and now your mom. You NEED to cry. Don't hold it in. Just because she can't handle your emotions doesn't mean you shouldn't have them. She needs to do her best to comfort you, not try to get you to bottle it up.
Alternstive title: Is it normal to cry when passing through a negative and emotional sensation?

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Also yes, but now I'll explain it. 

Here the problem is not just you are passing through dysphoria, nor that you had depression, anxiety, nor other negative emotional problem. The problem here is that your mother is already frustrated over it.

Yes it's normal to display your emotions, and even more, to let it flow if you can, as bottling yo everything sometimes can be more troublesome for the person, and that is even without having another mental/emotional problem.

Now if we add the other problems you have, is an even less reason to not display your emotions. 

As I mentioned above, here the problem resides on your mother. Now before commenting it over I don't know much about your mother nor how she treats you except for what you put in here, so this may cause confusion or problems when approaching, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt and have the most broad actions attached to her.

For what I can read, your mother doesn't have the problem specifically with your dysphoria, nor with your crying. The problem I can see is that she has the problem of not knowing what to do, not how to act when you are passing through a negative/difficult time, which you can often manifest as a cry. Maybe she already did what she could before reaching a point where her own problems made it in to a bad point, as you mentioned before, you don't have spare money to use, so meds or things that could help both your mother's an your mental health may be out of the reach.

Yes, maybe she is over with trying to endure it, maybe she tries to but don't know what to do, and in the end displays this action because she doesn't know how to act... As you try to let go of negative emotions she stresses because doesn't know how to help and tries to stop what she thinks is the source, in this case you. So no stressing over it for her...

This is not healthy for any of the people involved, and should try to reach a better point of understanding between the involved people...



Now that is assuming that your mother is just over or having trouble with the panic of what to do.. I don't know how is your mother outside of it, or what is on her mind. In any case my recommendation would be to go to a person with the right credentials to help you get better, but without a hate towards your existence. This may help you and your mother both in the short and long run, but will cost you money.

I really hope this gets better soon, and that with just a close talk between both of you improves, but if not, I hope you can endure until the opportunity of an improvement comes.
it is 100% normal. Crying lets all the negative things leave your body for a short while. Being sensitive to your own body and the world isn't a bad thing, trying to hold it in is. If you want to find different ways to regulate those feelings, go for it but not because someone can't ""handle"" you crying. Crying is a natural response to any and all things that make us feel terrible, cry all you want sweetheart
Absolutely— trans guy here. I would cry almost every day some weeks before top surgery and T. (And I figured myself out right after Dump got into office.) Even before I figured myself out I would cry for apparently no reason I could tell, which was in hindsight dysphoria related. 
Also, if top surgery is what you want I know you will find a way. There are states with actual Medicaid that pays for affirmation surgery. Just got my meta in NY. Be strong, take courage from the community. Things absolutely can get better. You will find a way to make it happen. Hang in there!
It's not only normal it's very beneficial you gotta let it out. This world is crazy and keeping that all inside just makes it harder
Okay, hear out the whole story, the world is a sad and fucked up place in some ways, most of which you already touched on, and yeah, life is hard.

However, you can usually find sollice in friends and within yourself. Learning to love and accept yourself is hard, but learning to reach out is even harder. For the long term you can indeed get top surgery and that will help. But for the short term a good solution might be reaching out to friends. Being vulnerable with them. This is hard, super hard, it will be something that you might not want to do, but once you reach out and they offer a comforting crying shoulder that helps so so SOOOO much. 

I know life seems difficult, and stuff is hard, and you're fully in the right to want to cry all that away, it's only natural. Friends can help do much in alleviating the stress, pain and anxiety of life.

Best of luck to you ❤️💜
It’s completely normal. Crying is perfectly natural way of expressing yourself and your emotions. It is so important that you feel and process your feelings and let them out. Do not repress them.
>So, is it normal to cry over dysphoria? 

Yes. Sounds to me like an absolutely reasonable emotional reaction to your circumstances.

>How do I handle it?

I don't know. \*Hugs\* The US isn't the only country in the world, though. And people flee persecution with the literal shirt on their backs. Not saying that you should, but just to point out that, even if it may seem impossible to you where you are right now, it might be a goal worth fighting for. If this political situation spirals further out of control, you might have a serious case to make for asking for asylum outside of the States.

That's long term. In the here and now: are there things that give you comfort other than physical stuff?
Yes, it is. Let yourself cry. It's okay to cry. Lots of people have cried those tears. You aren't alone in this pain.
It's good to cry, you need to feel those emotions and cycle them out. Next you should find a way to get a therapist or counselor. It's not easy and you may even have to shop around for a while but it's something that can absolutely save your life.

Gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia are frequently entangled and are very confusing and difficult burdens to work through on your own. Especially if you're still in your teens and your body is going nuts with all kinds of hormonal fluctuations.

Things can get better, they probably will, really. We just have to try hard and refuse to quit on ourselves.
It can be normal. Your feelings are valid. Feelings aren’t facts (for example I sometimes feel dumb) but they are real. It sounds like you deserve support to process your feelings.
People end their lives over disphoria…

Yes, people cry over dysphoria, I’ve been transitioning and I still cry over dysphoria, just today I cried about bottom dysphoria. It’s a lot better now, I used to stay in bed all day, now I can at least go out and dysphoria comes in “bursts” instead of being ever-present.
Yeah it's normal. I have cried over it a few times myself so I get it. Dysphoria sucks, so it's understandable to be stressed about it. Crying is a normal and good way to release the stress, it's not good to keep your negative emotions bottled up.

 As for how to handle it...maybe you can try journaling. Just write out all your sadness and anger. It helps a lot since it's a nice and healthy way to let out intense feelings
It's totally normal to cry, over any emotional pain.  Also - when you get older, there will be a place to get top surgery.  Somewhere in the US, or at least somewhere else in the world.  You will get top surgery.  There's something to be said for realism, but when you really want something, you can always get it.  That's been my experience, at least.
It’s totally okay to be struggling with those feelings. In terms of feeling better about your chest I have personally found tape binding to be what’s best for me. My skin can handle it and I don’t have to worry about the effects to my ribs and can wear it for a couple days at a time. If you can, maybe research it a bit and see if it could be an option for you. Admittedly, I don’t live in America so I can’t comment on the anti trans laws you guys are dealing with, I just know it’s fucking horrible, I hope you guys come through it okay ❤️
I'm Gonna Say Definitely Yes, It's Normal. Believe You Me If I Could (And I Knew It Was Safe) I'd Be Crying Over My Dysphoria Most Every Night, Unfortunately Try As Hard As I Might I Can't Cry More Than Just Like Getting My Eyes A Tad Bit Wetter Than Normal...

Dionysus, the god of wine and madness		"I am a Hellenistic pagan, and I have sorta started also viewing him as the patron god of trans folks, considering before he became a god he was a young girl.
Stunning. Absolutely stunning!
You look amazing
*The Lighting Thief Musical has been summoned*


“Just another terrible dayyyy! At camp half-blood where everything’s the worse! I’m the god of wine and I’m dying of thirst”


Also, Dion is also the god of transgender and intersex people (:
I don't usually say this but....be my joyfriend😳🥺
I love it and you look great! Dionysus is one of my favorites even though I'm not much of a party or wine person lol
I also think of him like that! And his later form is much much more masc than his earlier androgynous youth appearance. 

Last fall, between the equinox and Halloween, I went to a festival called Wicked Woods. On the way there my friend told me the story of the Bacchae, because I had made this costume. You may already know the sorry, but for those who don't,

It begins with Dionysus (Bacchus) approaching a wealthy king and declaring himself as the god Dionysus. The king takes one look at the slim effeminate person and says that he is no god. Twice more dionysus comes to offer his blessing, but the king denies him twice more. The final time Dionysus says, ""I am Dionysus, do not deny my divinity"". But the king denies him still. So the god calls all the women in the city to a massive party out on the mountainsides. They dance, drink, and ignore the calls that they return to their homes. They begin to act violently towards the men who try to come and take them back. They drive the men away. 

Now the king is obviously very bothered by this. He wants the women to come back, because the city is at a standstill without their labour. So he decides to take matters into his own hands. He disguises himself as a woman, and infiltrates the party. He is amazed to see the women dancing ecstatically, chanting, howling, and generally having a wild time. He climbs a tree to try to spy on Dionysus, and murder him to end the spell. 

But he falls out of the tree, and a branch rips the scarf away from his face, revealing his beard. The women fall on him like hungry wolves. They attack him, they tear him limb from limb. 

So from then on, a tradition was formed. It was considered unwise to deny anyone who claimed to be Dionysus, because the god of revelry was, paradoxically maybe, not to be taken lightly. 

So after I my friend told me this story, my reaction was of course to immediately declare, ""I am Dionysus, do not deny my divinity!"".  My friend told me to be careful, and laughed, and called me Dionysus. 

At the festival, as the sun set on the evening of the first night, and the first pounding beat burst out of the speakers, I felt an intense feeling overpower me. I began to dance, and I was filled with wild, exuberant joy. I have gone to many festivals, and I have been happy, and euphoric before. I've always considered dancing a form of spirituality, a form of prayer. But that night was different. I danced like I couldn't stop, and loved every second of it. 

My friend is the one who's really pagan. But I've never felt closer to belief in something supernatural than I felt that night.
Thank you so much!!!
☺️ thank you!!! I put a lot of effort into making the crown
Dionysus is the only representation I disagree with in that series. I like that he did something a bit unexpected, but my conception of Dionysus is more as a queer party loving irresponsible nature/fertility/revelry god. I don't feel like Riordan's representation captures that
I believe that Dionysus sent a blessing your way that night. You may have earned his favor lmao.
Different depictions! I love those! Because everyone is valid to have their own thoughts and feelings. I just like the musical more than the books (movies lowkey kinda suck) but yes, I love your depiction of Dionysus, I’m probably being a little bit biased because George Salazar plays Dionysus so, yeah- but your depiction of Dion is totally valid!!
Wait – what musical???
The only version of Dionysus I like are the greek myth and musical version. Musical because I love George so much.
The Lightning Thief is also a musical! It’s a good musical with a good soundtrack, Dion is not shown as a god, really, but more of a grumpy summer camp instructor but like, I like- love him coz George Salazar plays him, so yeah-"	jlil7m	NonBinary	121	1.0	2020-10-31 13:43:39

Latino school wants me to cut my hair, unless I wanna make everyone mad ill have to say bye to my self esteem		"I want to make everyone mad. If my hair makes THEM angry, then they should probably start thinking harder about what is worth getting mad over.


sorry you're going through this, and wish you and your luscious locks good luck
Let them be mad. Your self-esteem is more important than some stupid schools image
ill say que les jodan no me pueden obligar a nada
[deleted]
I’m so sorry they’re making you do that😣
Make everyone mad! It’s your hair it’s your choice how to keep it. Keep your confidence either way friend!
For anyone curious, I've decided I'll speak to the principal who's a psychologist about this, I joked with friends that I want rights for long haired people but yeah I'll actually try to discuss that possibility. Also keep in mind I'm in one of the worst countries in South America so we're not very organised when it comes to administration and school boards aren't quite a thing. Be the change you want in the world I guess
theres only one human whose opinion is important - yours:)
do whatever makes you happy and dont care about other humans opinions about u 💜
So make em mad. What can they do
Keep the hair, you look gorgeous
That’s so fkt up. Please don’t comply. I understand your not wanting your mother to do battle, but your mental health is important too. You are important. Gender norms are fluctuating. Write to your school board or city commissioners. Write to Lambda.
Well you look really pretty/handsome :)

Te ves muy bonita/guapo (i cant speak spanish very well lol)
I honestly don't care about what the staff thinks at all, I just don't want to make my mum go through the trouble of dealing with them
Eso es lo que he estado intentando pensar y llevo semanas ignorandoles pero ayer me dijeron que si no me lo corto no me dejan entrar
I tried that yesterday and that day I was told I wouldn't be allowed in if i didn't cut it (I'd been told to cut it many times before) and other classmates have given in because they were told the same
Is your mom supportive? Because this is the kind of thing where your mom absolutely should go to bat for you.
You seem like a good kid. Sorry you have to go through all of that
Eso suena ilegal la verdad,  comentaselo a tus padres si eso

She is, she's one of the few people I'm out to but I just wanna make it easy for everyone else rn
Si es de México tengo entendido que no pueden obligarle a cortarse el pelo, espero que tengas apoyo OP.

Editado para corregir.
No idea, I believe its mainly mandated by the owner of the school who is an old ex military dude, so yeah :/ ""boys"" must have short hair
Ok, then I'd like you to consider this from an outside perspective. Lets say you have a good friend, maybe a sibling? Someone you care about, who is in your care, and is being bullied/mistreated. It would be some effort to help them, would you prefer they just put up with the mistreatment, so you don't have to go to extra effort? Would you want them to acquiesce and not tell you, because it'd be a bother for you? 

Tell her what's going on, be honest and then she can decide what would or would not be too much effort.
Meh, ni cerca, estoy en un se esos países que nadie se acuerda que existe en Sudamérica
I certainly wouldn't like that, I'd step in. My mum knows and I've talked to her now about my idea of simply discussing it with the staff, it's not an uncommon thing that we need to take strict care of our hair for school here and it is a private school so yeah, not the most favourable situation for my side.  She's simply insisted I do something about this but she's not pressuring me to cut it and that's more than I would ask for honestly
Lo que pasa es que en México también es muy común que las escuelas o obliguen a traer ciertos peinados a sus alumnxs, hubo un caso donde se probó que no había ninguna razón por la cual tendrían que obligar a nadie a traer un corte de pelo específico y de ahí se ha podido liberar un poco de esa norma tonta."	t6q161	NonBinary	109	1.0	2022-03-04 18:52:10

OKOKOK so I spoke to my mum and sister and dad in the car about non-binary! My mum said she doesn’t understand it (we wasn’t talking about me) we was just talking about it in general because I mentioned me getting mad over someone invalidating my friends pronouns. Took a while, but I asked what - (2		"She would do if I was non-binary and they joked about kicking me out, anyways after that joke (I was laughing nervously) she said no I’m joking, I would sit you down and ask you to explain it to me since I don’t understand it. I kinda felt relieved and then she said “your dad would probably kick you out” and then she asked my dad and he said no he wouldn’t but he’d be confused
When I came out I texted my mom .

There's Google for them to figure shit out when they get confused as if we're not already confused our whole lives
You've planted the seed, now let it grow
Well those jokes definitely aren't terrifying at all.
Alternatively any older lgbtq+ people you know can be really helpful as well. Person works better than the internet because a person can act adaptively.
AGREED
Yes yes, I’m so excited now I know she’s like okay with it. Just gotta wait now
LITERALLY MY FACE WAS LIKE 👁👄👁 but she has dark humour like me
Though as an older queer, this only works if we're someone the parents know and respect.  When the kid is the one reaching out to us, the only effective thing we can do is give them advice on how to talk to their families.

Also, please only seek us out for help if you're actually willing to accept it.  I've had so many people come to me for help with stuff like this and then turn around and not actually be willing to accept the very assistance they asked for.  We're people too, and it's quite frustrating and hurtful to be sought out and then quickly dismissed.
Right like just reaching out to the thousands of plus sources that are out there and ready to help them with the same experience
There's dark humor and then there's cruelty. Making ""dead babies"" jokes is dark humor. Making those jokes in front of my mom's friend, who's had a stillbirth, would be cruel.

I would joke about kicking a kid out when they weren't around, and that'd be good dark humor, but joking about it where they can hear would be cruel. But then I'm not gonna be a parent (I'd be unacceptably bad at it) so maybe there's something I'm missing.
Yes fortunately I have an elder queer who I know and respect and will listen to.
Me and my mum literally go deep, it’s not everyone’s thing- but me and my mum we make really dark jokes about stuff. It’s just how we cope, especially when we don’t know what to say random dark things just pop out, it’s not wrong if I don’t find it offensive at all, I know my mum and I know when she’s sarcastic and when she’s actually serious, I was shocked yes, because I wasn’t expecting it at all.. but we all laughed the entire car ride home, and we spoke seriously when we got home about what it meant  being non-binary and she hugged me and she said even if you was I’d still love you, you’d still be my child. Parents/kids cope different with different things some don’t make dark jokes and some do🤷‍♀️
Life it it really affected me I’d say something to her but you don’t know me and no one knows how others cope or what others find funny, it’s not cruelty- cruelty is making dead baby jokes because that is horrible- especially if you’re talking to someone and you don’t know their backstory"	qzqzbg	NonBinary	102	0.97	2021-11-22 17:40:43
Non-binary and still ok with others being binary?	"Sorry for the poor title! Didn't know what to put.

There's a social scientist in my area currently going on a rampage about how non-binary people are the LGBTQ community's equivalent of flat-earthers. That we are harming the LGBTQ community and any progress made. That non-binary people are actually misogynysts and transphobes in disguise. That we don't really exist and have just descended into madness. He says there's science that backs up what he calls a favt that theres a biological binary. He's claiming that non-binary people want to get rid of the categories of man and woman altogether. He also says people pointing out that some Indigenous cultures acknowledged third or more genders is racist appropriation. His solution? Everyone just say they're androgynous instead. 

I find everything hes said about non-binary people to be absolute bullshit. Personally, I don't have a problem with those categories of man and woman existing, I just don't feel like I belong in either of them. And I'd love if the binary system broke down, but I can see how it can be useful to a certain extent given how our societies are structured (again, I'd love if those structures changed).

 How do others feel? I'd love to shut this guy up, because it seems like he just doesn't understand non-binary people to begin with and is just putting us all in a box of wanting everything to be non-binary.

*Edited for clarification.

**edit 2: thank you everyone, for your responses and for sharing your thoughts and views! Made me feel more confidant, because to be honest I know this guy is saying what some people think, and that deeply upset me. Ive been having trouble coming our ti some people specifically because i know they think like this guy. So thanks, i really appreciate all of your input. I feel less crazy and alone. You all are awesome and beautiful!"	"That's a bunch of nonsense. Of course I'm okay with binary gendered people. Why wouldn't I be? Gender is a spectrum with a lot of variations, and I'm fine with however others want to describe their own experience of that.
Seems very akin to bi/pan erasure but for gender rather than sexuality. Bisexuals are still often told that they are 'really one or the other' or 'choose one already', as though both, all or one are perfectly valid.

He's the one harming the LGBTQ community with his narrow-minded bigotry disguised as concern.
Theres all sorts of wrong about this.

I personally don't care if people adhere to the bianary. I think, in some ways linguistically, culturally and biologically it can be useful. That being said, just because there is a small minority of people who are outside the bianary, either biologically, linguistically, culturally or otherwise, they (we) are still valid, and real, and in no way does that fact ""ruin"" it for others. And ultimately it's all a system that we humans created to accurately communicate with eachother. Language and culture changes all the time, science makes new discoveries all the time and is constantly being updated. 

I don't understand how this person cant understand that biologically there is actually a lot of variety in sex and not just in humans. I don't understand how people in general can't separate that gender and sex are not the same and will not always line up with each other. I don't understand why people are going around saying Non-bianary people existing is ""anti trans"" and ""ruins the movement"". This isn't the first time I've seen this perspective either.
He's comparing nonbinary people to flat-earthers without realizing that in this scenario he's the one behaving more like a flat-earther 😑
>He also says people pointing out that some Indigenous cultures acknowledged third or more genders is racist appropriation.

I don't have a different gender system in my indigenous culture, but jeez, has this guy ever talked to an indigenous person in his life? One of the main conflicts of colonization is the one way street of people from minority cultures having to adopt the customs of the colonizing force. If the values and societal systems of indigenous people were even slightly normalized, that'd go a long way in reducing the constant stress I feel just trying to *live* in this world.

Pointing to another society with respect and the intent to validate and learn from them is not appropriation.
To be fair, I do wish we got rid of the assumption everyone is either a man or a woman. I’d much rather we assume non binary unless specified otherwise and that the default pronoun would be they. But then I have absolutely no problem with people identifying as men or women either cis or trans. I’m just sick of assumptions based on looks. And I feel like having a neutral default would get rid of that. Again, neutral default doesn’t mean no men or women. It just means we don’t categorize based on first impressions and ask.
Wow. Lol a lot to unpack. 

1. There are no facts in science.  Only theories with evidence to support them.  Nothing is ever proven in science. In fact science wants people to challenge the status quo and test out theories. 

2. I think he’s confusing gender and sex. Sex is an ecological classification that is used for science and understanding.  For example whether one person has a womb or not may change their medical care. 

Gender is tied to sex as sexual characteristics inform our self identities and how we feel about our sex. Gender is widely based on cultural and religious standards or traditions that a person more with certain features who usually possess. 


3. That being said , there are tons of new studies every day and most data is fairly new so we don’t actually know all the answers to these questions. 

4.  Even sex is not binary there are quite a few situations where someone’s sex does not fit in the binary.  So I’m this he is wrong. Yes the majority of people can be neatly out in a box but there are folks that don’t. It’s not inclusive to ignore these folks and say they don’t exist. 

It sounds like this person is quite judgemental and not very safe.  Perhaps be curious about the scientific evidence. Ask to get a link to the peer reviewed papers this person is referring to.
Sounds like a lot of truscum talking points frankly. These people aren’t usually worth arguing with - they will not change their mind no matter how much facts and logic you can throw at them

Edit: though I do agree with you, I’m fine with binary stuff existing (and think it’s probably helpful in most cases) as long as you don’t make me have to fit into it (how hard is it to just have a third category?)
What the actual fuck??  There is absolutely no evidence to a biological binary, only the contrary.  Intersex conditions exist.  Some species have whole hemaphrodites or literally change sex as part of their natural life cycle.  Nature as wild.  My one anthropology professor was just going on the other day about how she sees sex as more of a spectrum.  

And no, I don't want to get rid of the categories of men and women, I identify as non-binary more because I'm a mix of the two than don't want them at all.  I just want it recognized that I don't fit neatly into one of them and it shouldn't be assumed that just because my sex is female I have to be a woman.  Biology =/= gender, gender is a social construct.  The only thing that's really important as far as biology is the bits you have and what that means if you want to be involved in natural reproduction.
Acknowledging gender variation across different cultures isn't 'racist appropriation' - if he wants to talk racism, someone needs to point out to him that the gender binary was forced upon indigenous people.

He's not entirely wrong about wanting to get rid of the categories of man and woman - we want to end the gender binary, and that may well end identnties man and woman...that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Basically he's just ignorant and enbyphobic.
I wish we didn’t live in a world so filled with gender based stereotypes and “rules” 
But I respect how anyone wishes to identify, and whether cis, trans, gnc, any binary or non-binary identity I will make sure I try my best to always get pronouns right 

Just don’t be an asshole
Its wack to think that biology sticks to a binary. There is always divergence from the standard in nature, as is the laws of science.
""I like dogs and cats but personally I'm a bird person""

""Wow I didn't know you wanted to **kill all puppies and kittens,** way to set the movement back""
I'm so tired of people in prominent societal positions talking about things they don't understand. 

The idea that indigenous cultures broke the binary should be proof enough that being non-binary is very valid. Yet here we have this ""scientist"" sharting into the wind.
Sounds like an egg or someone who has been traumatized and punching down. Pretty pathetic either way.
Being binary just like other things may not be right for me but that doesn’t mean it’s not right for others and I respect them for it.
A “social scientist” totally ignorant to the history and impact of social structures surrounding gender? You’d have to be a pure misogynist or just simply not know your shit *at all*. Like seriously, does he have *any* formal education in social sciences?
What a bunch of TERF nonsense. 

None of it is true, but to single out one of the most emotionally persuasive argument: Nonbinary people (or whatever is considered to be the ""fringe"" of the community that day) are not, have never been, and will never be the reason people are bigoted against LGBTQIA+ people. 

No one in human history has been like ""Well, I was *gonna* be an ally, but then I saw some people saying that there are more than two genders and now I hate the gays again"" and meant it sincerely. Either they're a bad faith actor actively trying to drive a wedge between different parts of the community, or their ""allyship"" has always been phony, conditional, and worthless.
I'm gobsmacked... we have a lot more intelligence than flat-earthers for sure 🤣 how hilariously ignorant of that man.
This doesn't sound like a person that you can inform or improve.
This is so off base I'm not even sure how to respond. Just everything he's saying is completely off base and he's the one doing harm, not nonbinary folk.
I agree. Like I don't feel like anything and always assumed that's just how people feel... most of what we feel one way or another is just the construct put on by our gender. 

Like just be who you want and I accept that.
Who the fuck gave that child  the idea that they were a scientist dna is bimodal
Non-binary people aren't transphobes or misogynists - A trans woman.
Not only gender, but also sex is on a spectrum, its just that biologicaly most of us lie close to either ends of the spectrum, and gender obviosly doesnt always match that.
I love how people always bring up ‘biological gender’ or the ‘biological binary’ as if intersex people don’t exist. And not only that but intersex people are as common as natural redheads. Human biology is just as fluid as gender. This guy’s argument is stupid.
i’ve 100% gotten this, & it’s 100% the worst possible take, every single time. literally nothing people like that say is factual, or worth listening to.

binary trans people are part of our history, as are fellow non-binary people. anyone that sees non-binary identity as an erasure of binary trans identity instead of a valuable & equal facet of overall queer identity is absolutely making a bad-faith argument & trying to cause trouble.

also, most non-binary people actively support binary cis & trans people, bc liberation from strict gender norms heals everyone, regardless of their gender identity. something people say a lot to me is that, in the process of proving a non-binary body can look like anything (for example), we’ll also prove that women’s & men’s bodies can look like anything. that’s a good thing!

obviously, some struggles are unique to us as non-binary people but, to a large degree, we’re all in this together.
Okay. So I'm okay if someone wants to identify me as female because I'm AFAB. But it's not how I feel personally, not all the time anyways. Sometimes I feel male, or a combination of man and woman. Non-binary isn't just nothing. I think it is synonym with genderqueer. It can also mean both, neither, or a combination of these things. It's an umbrella term. And meanings can change over time.
Being against the binary as a whole is not what Nonbinary is.  They're two different things and I'm sick of people conflating the two
Biological binary? Boy I’ve got some news for this social scientist. Intersex people exist. 

I’ve got some scientific news. There are always outliers and variance in every scientific analysis. Always. Even if the data tends toward one or two main groupings. There’s always data outside of groupings. 

The existence of gay and straight people inherently means that bisexual people exist (or people who aren’t on the spectrum at all!).

The existence of two binary genders inherently means that a whole host of nonbinary people exist, as well as people outside that spectrum. 

This is just a form of transphobia, IMO.
....So, where's the actual, you know, ***LOGIC*** that non-binary people would have some sort of ""issue"" with binary people? This feels like someone just wanting to shit in the gumbo and stir the pot so everyone can argue. What a twerp.
I agree. I think a lot of us just want to be respected. We just also want to be allowed to exist and be ourselves. 

Everyone is an individual and maybe some people want to destroy the binary but it’s not the goal of all non-binary people.

The person the OP is describing sound like they are being intentionally insincere and trying to stir up trouble and anti non-binary sentiment.
Yes, thankfully he's rightfully receiving a LOT of backlash from the community.
When I see it from people also within the queer community it is especially galling. These people 'pulling up the ladder' after they've got what they need is 1) incredibly shitty behavior 2) directly undercutting people who helped fight for their rights 3) won't even save them from the fash like they think it will.
I also don't understand, especially why he's trying to use science to back up his claims when, at least my personal belief is that you can't scientifically quantify gender identity.
Not to mention what about agender folks like myself. I don’t experience gender identity. I never have and have no interest in it for myself.   Like is he trying to say that I experience it but just am not aware?
Pretty much, yep.
Thanks for your input! And I'm sorry about the constant stress. I'm not Indigenous, but I am racialized in another way so I get how living in this world can be overwhelming. Another added layer of bullshit to face.
I totally get this! I try to get rid of the gendered default in mt head, althoufh don't always succeed.
Good idea to ask for the sources, I will look for those! Thanks!
Thanks for this! Yeah I think he really confuses sex with gender. Your anthro teacher sounds cool!
Absolutely, and keep in mind this is a white Western European saying this. 

And yeah, that's often a political goal. But I think he's ignoring the fact that this is just how we feel, political goals aside.
Ending the binary is pretty phobic against binary people. It's not harmful for men and women to exist whether they are trans or cis

Wow blocked, I guess I'm evil for being a binary trans woman sorry for oppressing you. As for the ""anti racism"" getting rid of man and woman is the equivalent of arguing to get rid of white people to stop racism or get rid of gay and lesbian to stop biphobia
Yeah, and it's not that hard to not be an asshole lol.
Not enough divergence to be legit in his eyes. -_____-
Yeah, I think someone who just can't handle the consequences of shitting his harmful views when he's a teacher and makes some of his students feel disrespected and unsafe. He cries woke cancel culture when it's really accountability.
Same, I think that's common practice here.
He actually does. And to him, we are actually the misogynists. I really don't get it. It seems it started during the beginning of the covid pandemic when he also got all anti-vax.
Yeah and I also don't hear much backlash, if any, from within the LGBTQIA+ community.
Right! I know 1+1=fish! :P
He says he's open to discussions. He just doesn't like that when he shares his views people says he's discriminating. Truth hurts.
It's a lot, for sure.
Yeah, icdont see why that's so hard to respect.
A well-respected university, unfortunately.
Thanks! He thinks we are transphobes because we confuse ""actual trans kids"" and disrupt their transitions, or some bs like that.
I think unfortunately the person I'm talking about is being very sincere. He is gay and a member of tbe queer community and genuinely believes what he calls ""woke nonsense"" around non-binary identities and importance of pronouns is harming any progress the queer community has made. 

He's been blogging about it a couple years now, but has spoken more publicly in the mainstream media since his job is on the line. Confusing consequences with canceling.
Ye that person is messed up. 

In the past the (white) gay and lesbian community used to marginalize black ppl and trans folks bc ""they are making our fight harder and we want to only focus on one thing at a time, we are almost accepted but including 'blacks' would ruin that"".. they were right that inclusion would slow down progress for white binary gay/lesbians but that's them using their privilege to jump ship at the last minute and degrade the ppl that helped them get there - black queer trans women who started the riots for example.

Sure it's true that nb folks fighting for their rights impacts other trans folks who fit the binary.. but it's for the same reason listed above. Binary trans folks are more readily accepted than nb ppl.. some binary trans folks hate nb folks for ""slowing things down"" I'm sure.. but those are loud fringe groups not most trans ppl.

Also I don't think many nb folks hate the existence of men and women as genders.. we can respect people's identity but not for into that group.

My final point is going to be that whoever is doing this research is a quack. Human phenotypes aren't necessarily binary, and we don't test genotype (genetics aka xx vs xy chromosomes) to determine sex we look at the phenotype at birth(body parts). Humans naturally have a ton of variation in both primary and secondary sexual characteristics development.. studies I've seen have identified up to or possibly more than 30 phenotypes. Although genotype usually determines phenotype it's not always the case.. there are lots of cis men walking around with xx chromosomes who don't know it. Similarly, there are lots of cis women walking around with xy chromosomes unknowingly. There are cis men with penises who naturally have breasts, there are cis women with very enlarged clitorises that are quasi penises.. etc.
100 years ago scientists were measuring people's skulls in order to determine their capacity for criminality or justify white supremacy and society generally said, ""OK, seems legit.""

Just because someone claims to be a scientist doesn't mean they aren't also a quack.
It also, based on what we know about biology, makes MORE sense that nonbinary people would exist than that we wouldn't. If humans have a sense of gender, and nature (including humans) is prone to random mutations, and biological sex can be included in those mutations resulting in physical traits that aren't strictly male or female, and you believe binary trans people exist, why the heck would other gender variations not exist? Just cause it's not typical doesn't mean it's fake.
'Anti-racism is the real racism!' /s

No, ending the binary isn't 'phobic' against those with a binary gender identity. No one said men and women existing were harmful. 

Ending the gender binary means opening up the concept of gender to include the whole gender spectrum, rather than being represented as only men or women. It also challenges the idea that afab equates to female/woman and amab male/man, which is a benefit to intersex people and binary trans people like you too. 

Although it stands to reason over time restrictive heteronormative gender norms will end, we may see a genderless society in the future as a result. There's little reason to intentionally maintain the gender identities of man and woman as the roles they are meant to represent aren't really needed in society. 

Edit : geeze, no one said you oppressed me you ridiculous little person. You've now twice jumped to victimhood when no one here has done anything against you, think on that. You weren't blocked, but that edit on top of your initial reply clenched the deal.

**NO ONE IS ADVOCATING FOR GETTING RID OF MEN AND WOMEN!** 🤦‍♀️
That’s… not at all what anyone ever said. 

“Getting rid of the binary” doesn’t mean binary men and women won’t exist, it simply means getting rid of the idea that ONLY men and women exist.
It’s just same old transphobia repackaged. They said that shit to binary trans people when they joined the community.
That’s a shame that he is sincere in is intolerance. 

Having a queer mindset or world view is about accepting people’s sexual and gender fluidity. 

At least he hasn’t accused us of making anti-binary space lasers yet…
I don’t see how pro nouns affect anyone negatively c
Lol true!
>Just cause it's not typical doesn't mean it's fake.

This!
They may try and take our legitimacy but they'll never take our anti-binary space lasers
Shhh..... those are top secret! :P
Me neither. It's a small step towards respecting someone, not asking to change someone's whole belief system.
Don't worry, they won't find out and even if...
We can deal with it.
Just like we did with Project Attack Helicopter.

Those fools still repeating the ""joke"" WE spread. Ignorant of the fact that it's actually a cover for OUR attack helicopters equipped with the finest anti-binary missiles the trans agenda scientists could come up with!

Got attacked and kicked out for being non-binary	"
UPDATE: the DA refuses to press charges. 




I'm in a bit of shock still because I didn't see this coming, so I guess I'm just here to vent. 
I'm writing this from a friend's couch where I've been sleeping since Friday. This is Wis. where there's a huge alcohol and DV problem. 

Tldr: my partner's brother went HAM and is now in jail. All because he is dealing with his own gender and projecting that on me because I've been out for years. 

CW: violence and transphobia, ofc. 
.
.
.


Preface: I'm openly non-binary, on hrt, had surgery, all the good stuff I've enjoyed. I've been staying with my partner's parents since my car wreck. They offered and I always enjoy hanging out with them. 
 I'm waiting for it to get out of the shop but it's taking a long time. When my car is fixed, we planned on moving back to CA where we met. The car definitely put a hold on that. In the meantime, my partner (trans woman) and I are living with her parents near her brother's house.

 Her brother came out as genderqueer but hasn't changed pronouns or labels so I'll be using his agab masc labels, as he prefers them. Let's call him C. 

Her family are liberals but definitely performative.  That day, her other sibling bragged about buying a PS5 just to play the Hogwarts game, saying it's okay because she's a social worker and helps trans people daily. 🙄 That sibling also misgenders me behind my back and mocks my clothing, saying I look homeless. I also get mocked for being from a Muslim family.

So, C. came over, drunk as usual, and wanted to talk about his gender. 

The irony is C is a HUGE transphobe. I have gotten mocked for wearing ball caps and t shirts and not being girly enough for him and the rest of the family since I've been here. He is often very verbally abusive and transphobic to my partner. 


Now, I never really trusted him because he and the dad always laugh about how he shot a pedestrian (with a stroller) in the face when he was 15, on a dare. He got community service and my partner got blamed by her fam. because she's the older sibling. I remember his wedding in Sept and how the speeches were laughing about the incident. It made me sick. 
 But I was never scared of him because he's not that big and I guess time makes you less vigilant. 

Friday night, he came over as a peace offering and bought food for my partner and me. 

He vented about not being accepted as genderqueer by friends, and began to project these feelings by misgendering me and mocking my pronouns. The hypocrisy was too much and I got upset, told him to respect my pronouns and stop mocking my clothing choices. So we got into a verbal argument, then he got violent and threw me against the TV, furniture, just rag dolled me a bunch. He pinned me down and immediately pushed his thumbs into my eye, as my partner struggled to get him off me. He broke her finger by pulling it backwards and got lose, went right back to going at my eye. 

I was angry af and we fought, but since I'm much smaller than him, of course I kept getting rag dolled. 😅

He didn't stop until I got a large dog bone that was near. 


He refused to leave so I called the cops. As we waited, he called his parents and lied that my partner and I had attacked him and he was a victim. Her parents ofc believed him. 

They showed up and took statements. He was belligerent with them and it took 3 hours to remove him from the house. He cussed out the cops, kept being transphobic about my partner and myself, and kept laughing hysterically about the situation. The PD  took him to jail that night and I got kicked out by the parents (who wanted me charged with assault for fighting him off). 

He'd told the police (misgendering me of course) that if I wanted to ""dress and act like a boy [he] could beat [my] a** like a boy."" He laughed about pronouns being a joke and me being sensitive for correcting him and getting angry when he purposely misgendered me that night. He said he couldn't be in trouble because he'd bought us food and is queer himself, plus ""pronouns aren't that big of a deal.""

Went to the ER after this. Yup, my partner's finger was broken. I have bruises and scratches, am sore but generally okay. My eye is bugging me still but meh, Dr said it is not damaged. 

 My partner got blamed by her family for the incident. They're mad she didn't lie for him to the cops. 
They told her to break up with me or get lost, so she chose the latter and we are moving out today and staying with some family out of state while we wait for my car repairs. 

This has been such a physically and emotionally hurtful event, and I hate seeing my partner hurt like this by her own family. I blame alcohol, but I know that it's her brother's choices that did this. 
I felt bad for calling the cops because I felt it escalated things, but when I found out her finger was actually broken, I knew it was the right decision.


✨
Update:
Not that it matters.. ...
In some kind of conspiracy theory, my gf's family has convinced themselves that I manipulated her into setting C up by provoking him into being violent so he could catch a charge. Truly mental. 

As an Arab-American, I didn't expect my Muslim-immigrant family to be so supportive when I said my gf and I had been in this incident. But my parents drove +17 hours to come get a hotel with us and help us move.     
... ^_^"	"Oh my god, I’m so sorry you went through that. 

And you absolutely did the right thing by calling the cops. 

One of the aspects of an abusive and toxic home environment is the desire “to keep it in the family” and not involve outsiders. I had a roommate once who left their kids with me while they were at work. Their parents came over, assaulted me, broke into the home and took the kids. Their family was so fucking shocked and angry when I immediately called the cops and the parents were arrested. 

You did the right thing to both call the police and move on from this situation.
That situation really sucks. Don't blame alcohol. Alcohol lowers inhibitions, not changes people to be violent. My recommendation is to never be around that person again. 

Don't feel bad about calling the cops, abuse shouldn't be tolerated, and the parents behavior is reprehensible.
I'm so sorry to hear that happened to you and your partner. I hope your eye and her finger recover quickly ❤️

You handled that situation very well. Calling the cops was the right choice and getting the two of you out of that situation is important too. I'm proud of how you handled it all and wish you both all the best luck with moving 🤍💛💜🖤
Honestly sound like a hate crime. Even if he says he’s genderqueer ( kinda sus) like he thought he can get away with hating you and your gf and trans people cause he’s queer. 
I’m sorry this happened to you. Hope you and gf are fount good
Sorry that this happened to you and your partner. You got assaulted for nothing and your partners brother is trash. The fact that he feels comfortable to shoot people and laugh about it says plenty about him and the parents who look past his behavior. And you made the right decision, hope you and your partner feel safe and are feeling better right now.
If you have the opportunity to get some therapy, this sounds super traumatic. Might check if there are victims services in your area. This is terrible, rest and feel better.
Yeah I've never been violent when I drink, so that's a good point. I suspect cocaine was also involved, but at the end of the day it's who he is as a person and no drug excuses that.
All I found in Madison were costly resources but yeah we definitely need to talk to someone. I'll call trans lifeline again. 
It was a traumatic event fr. Thank you for your comment."	117dkxj	NonBinary	93	1.0	2023-02-20 16:55:27

Can I vent for a minute about my child's experience?	"My 6yo came out as non-binary. He uses what she calls ""mixed up"" pronouns. She's been saying he's not a boy or a girl for over a year, and put a lot of thought into it. 

Nearly everyone in my child's life has been warm and positive about their identity, so I feel like I can't complain when I know other people have it so much worse, but... I also really want to vent for a minute.

1. My kid went back to dressing like their AGAB for a while after other kids were rude and it breaks my heart, but I am really anxious about accidentally putting pressure on her to wear something so I'm trying to leave the ball in her court. She wore GNC clothing yesterday, though, and the other kids were cool, so fingers crossed that he gets back into it because she seemed so much happier in it.*

2. My FIL sent easter candy labeled ""HAPPY EASTER DEADNAME"" when he's never ever ever sent candy with a specific name on it before. He apologized, and maybe I should let it go, but I'm still mad.

3. I'm trying not to obsess over this aspect of my kid's life but with all the anti-trans bills it's hard not to focus on it.

4. My child said that they wanted to do something that physically their AGAB can't do (extremely specific narrow case) and I hated having to explain that the science isn't there yet to make that happen. Crushing a kid's dreams is never fun.

5. I am trying to give my kid space for this to be permanent and space for this to be a phase, if that makes sense. Just validating who she says he is and not trying to plan her future for him. I realized that I would be embarrassed if my kid announced that they weren't non-binary after all and I'm trying to let that go - so what if they change? We all change.




(* Yes I know, boys can wear skirts and girls can wear cargo pants, but realistically there are gendered associations with certain clothing.)"	"It always makes me happy to see such supportive parents. Sounds like you have your kids best interests in mind. We need more parents like you around.
I have a little non-binary kid too and I definitely hear you on all this. Mine goes very much for femme-styled clothing and it's difficult for people to disassociate that from using she/her. They're in a support group a social worker from the school district runs and even the binary trans kids in there do it regrettably often. Letting it both be permanent and potentially a phase is something I try to keep in mind too. I worry that the overwhelming number of people who use she/her for them even when they really really should know better will eventually make them think they should just use those pronouns and/or identify as a girl, and I'd struggle a lot if they did decide they were a girl because it'd be so hard to tell whether it was completely, idk, authentic or intended as self-protection.
I'm sorry that had to happen to the both of you! People can be asses. From my perspective, you're doing an amazing job for your child!
You're doing great!  I'm an adult but my mom thinks I'm being dramatic and attention seeking by identifying this way.  It's so nice to see you show so much empathy for your kid. <3
Thank you for posting this.  I'm a parent of a 13 yo NB kiddo and have just begun encountering the same frustrations and situations.  

 *Just validating who she says he is and not trying to plan her future for him.* 

Gonna use this as my mantra this week.
I really sucks to have your child treated unfairly, and you have every right to be annoyed, frustrated, or upset by it. Just keep being the awesome, supportive parent you are and keep advocating for your awesome kid!
I think you’re doing a great job he’s lucky to have you there’s an artist called DJ sprinkles who makes beautiful music and uses the same changing pronouns
I think you’re doing a great job as a parent! You’re being supportive and letting your kid explore without feeling like they have to stick to anything or worry about losing your acceptance. I’ve been out to my own parents for four years now and they still get mad at me for trying to correct them on my preferred pronouns. I honestly think that just knowing that you are there for him and accept her as he is going to mean more and more to them as she gets older. You’re forming a health perspective on gender and individuality early on and even if other people in his life try to force her to be something she isn’t, you’re what he’s going to remember most.

Just heard my Dad and uncle making fun of people who use they/them pronouns. I’m not out yet	My aunt was talking about a nonbinary person she knows and my uncle was being an ass about it. Then my dad chimed in with something super transphobic and that stung. A lot. Luckily my mom and aunt got really mad at their husbands for being dicks. My mom almost outed me though, so that was an experience. I’m currently in the basement of my aunt’s house crying my eyes out because now I know that my dad will never accept me as nonbinary even though I’m his first baby. My uncle and dad were calling everyone who defended they/them pronouns “sensitive” because they care about helping other people (and me) feel comfortable in their own skin.	"I am so so sorry. You are strong and you are loved.  Biological family can be tough like that, and you will find people to love you the way you should be loved.

❤️
That’s very shitty. It is possible for people to learn and grow and change for the better, but it’s also not your responsibility to make that happen. 
Take care <3
*hug*
This is the fucking worst. I'm so sorry, bud. Just know that they're wrong <3
Sending hugs if you like hugs. That sounds horrible, but now you know his true colors and you have no obligation to come out to him.
Im so sorry the men in your family are like this. My dad did similar until my sister had a chat with him and explained the science behind gender identity. Hes now trying his best to use they/them for me.

Hopefully its one of those things where they learn for you when you come out but I suppose you know them best
Hi I used to play in a highly competitive team. They constantly talked shit about lgbtq people and I argued a lot with them but they wouldnt Listen and didnt care. Then I outed myself to them and they were really supportive and never used this slurs again in my presence. They  even try to use they/them pronouns for me. The moral of the story is that some people are biggots but still actually care about people and are willing to change for them. 
Sadly I left the team anyway because of the racism 😹.
god i’m really sorry abt that :( i understand that. i’m pretty convinced that my dad (and probably most of my family, for that matter) wouldn’t accept me either based off of his shitty stances on other issues, and i’ll be glad to get away from him. i’m glad u at least have the support of some ppl, and i’m glad that ur mom and aunt stepped in. i hope that they’ll realise their ignorance and come to learn eventually. either way, u have every right to distance urself from them or cut ties if possible. prioritise ur safety. take care of urself <3
(hug)
My mom said I should have jumped in to educate them. Yeah, they’re never gonna listen to me.
It’s also not your job. If your mom’s going to be your ally, she can educate herself/respectfully come to you for pointers, and then *she* can work on educating her transphobic family members from her position of safety. You need to focus on taking care of yourself in a hostile environment.
I agree you *could* do that, but if you don't it's still not on you that they have those crappy views. That's hard work and you are not obligated to do it."	rnz6mm	NonBinary	77	1.0	2021-12-25 01:07:44
A bit NSFW but hearing my preferred name called out during sex is extremely validating!	"Posting from my throwaway/vent account because I'm shy lmao

I'm nonbinary but I'm not actually out to my partner yet. 

A couple years ago, I met a group of really cool people online--she was one of them. They started calling me by a nickname derived from my screenname and I really liked it and now go by that name on almost every site I'm on. When me and my gf started dating, I of course told her my birthname, but she rarely ever uses it. She calls me by my nickname aka my preferred name almost 100&#37; of the time unless we're messing around and she's pretending to be mad at me or she's talking to my parents.

We met irl for the first time a week ago and while we were having sex, she called out my preferred name. I CANNOT TELL YOU how much I loved that omg. Extremely, extremely validating. And she doesn't even know it's my preferred name yet! It'll make things so much easier when I finally have the courage to come out to her lol"		8xmd1w	NonBinary	71	0.98	2018-07-10 06:41:38
cis people really don't understand dysphoria	"I've been trying to get a hysto and top surgery but I'm stuck in bureocratic hell. But the thing is everytime I bring up the topic, everyone is like ""but regret!!! and body positivity!"". Doesn't anyone CARE how distressing this whole ordeal is? That I wouldn't go through this hell if I didn't have to? That the topic is so upsetting to me that just talking about it brings me to tears? How can everyone be so inconsiderate it's mind blowing

don't you think that if I could accept my body as it is I would have done it already?

and I still have to get a note signed by a therapist. I have to be judged Worthy or else I won't get the surgeries I need for my mental wellbeing. I'm scared shitless that they won't accept it. I talked today with my therapist (can't be her the one doing the note for bullshit reasons) and I thought she understood me but no, she even got mad that I kept talking her out of the ""but accept your body"" talk

cis people are really something"	"Try find a different therapist who understands dysphoria it is frustrating when people who never suffered dysphoria don't understand.
i agree, which is exactly why we need more trans people sitting at the table, weighing in on important decisions that validate the trans life-experience. we get put through so much gatekeeping & red-tape for things that are quite literally life-threatening. 

and then don’t even get me started on the general public’s unawareness of trans people. i’m so tried of educating cis people/defending myself and right to exist within this body, within this identity.
I'm so sorry you are going through that. My partner is recovering from an unrelated-to-NB hysterectomy, and just got both letters for top surgery (MHP & PCP). Living in a blue state like Washington makes it a lot easier.

We've had great help using the patient advocates that many community hospitals / some insurance companies have. Their may be trans health advocates that are independent from these organizations, too. If you're not getting the help you deserve (as every human deserves), then I encourage you to find more resources so that you don't have to do this on your own. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm telling you ""just work harder"" or something, it's just that we didn't know these resources were available until a while through all of this. Having to navigate the medical system as part of this process is so cruel, take care of yourself!
I've yet to find a local therapist that understands my chest dysphoria. One told me that I should love myself because I'm considered attractive by society's standards (G-cup, relatively fit, hourglass figure) but I can't stand my boobs. I definitely want something done about it, but I'm not sure if I want top surgery or just a reduction, and I wish that I had a therapist that could understand those kinds of struggles. Well, a therapist period, I got ghosted again.
as a cishet myself (with all the support for you and others OP) it is hard for me to even imagine dysphoria. same as it is difficult to imagine what period cramps feel like, what pregnancy does to someone. Our perception of the world us shaped by experience, and cis people have no experience with dysphoria...thats why those who decide need so much ""proof"". they are doing their job to their best ability, but they simply cannot know what you feel. and about the body positivity thing... well, they dont know dysphoria, but they still try to understand it. and even though the difference is very obvious for trans people, on paper dysphoria resembles body-positivity-issues. i'm not saying they are right to say what they did, they should know better in 2021. what i try to say is that they dont, and they still try to help, they are just misguided by lack of knowledge and good intentions.  
as for your note from the therapist, i am sure that there are therapists that support you, are knowlegable and willing to help you. just make sure to find one thats LGBT-friendly. just because they're educated doesnt mean they're not human, and sadly sometimes humans go against better knowledge.  


i wish you the best of luck and success.
100% this, nothing about us without us
I would ask where I could do this kind of stuff I lived in Europe or the USA. But you gave me a few ideas so thank you!
I really don't expect them to understand it, but I'm deeply hurt that the people that is supposed to support me don't have an ounce of sympathy for my pain. That was what my rant was about

but I do appreciate yout thoughtful reply!
i think in their own twisted missunderstanding and unknowing way they tried to help...they just really suck at it >.<"	pxiib4	NonBinary	69	0.99	2021-09-28 23:17:09
Came out to my lesbian girlfriend as NB.	"I was SO scared. Biologically I'm female, but I've never felt comfortable with my biological sex, and it always stressed me out. After a lot of denial I accepted the fact that I am not comfortable with the gender I was assigned, I am still figuring things out, so for now I identify as NB. 


I have a very loving gf who is a lesbian, she's the sweetest, but for some reason I thought she would be mad at me for identifying as NB, I even thought she's break up with me.


Welp, came out to her today, and she completely accepted me! I've never been so happy... she says she supports me 100%. We live in a very hateful and transphobic country, so she said I should be a little careful when talking about my gender identity, but I'm still very happy. She's lovely. ♡♡"	"I'm so happy to hear this! Happy day for you indeed!

Misgendered... by my mother.	"I'm nonbinary (born AFAB, they/them pronouns). I came out and I I had to explain literally everything.

I always thought my mother was supportive, she always asked more about the community, to try and be a better ally. But today she blurted out, ""you ***ARE*** a woman"". I've previously explained the pain and dysphoria deadnaming and misgendering do. And she still said it.

It cut me like a knife, and I don't know what to do.

For some more context, she was talking about ""specifically in the eyes of healthcare"", but it just shows she lacks the knowledge that trans-healthcare is a thing, or fully understands that people ***who are not women***, may have a vagina or a uterus.

I feel like I should be mad at her.

But instead I'm just I'm so disgusted with myself, I've never been so fully reviled by myself before. I hate my own mind. I hate my body. I hate myself. I don't even want to keep breathing. I can't speak up or say anything, my mother is proud and won't admit she's done any wrongdoing, she's already gone back to acting like she hasn't said anything wrong, because in her eyes she hasn't.

That's it, I just needed to blow, thanks for reading.

EDIT: Thanks for the support, everybody. I decided I need to have a long discussion with my mother, and how she phrased her words. I think she understood the impact her of words, and how it affected me. She said she still can't fully understand what I feel inside, and I don't expect her to be able to, but she apologized to me for what she said, and how she said it, as well as how it made me feel. Thanks again everybody, for the support. <3"	"Oh my god. I'm sorry you went through this. This is an unacceptable way to treat someone who's trans / non binary. I am going through my own tough time as well, my own family or rather whatever small contact I had left with them evaporated.

They didn't accept my coming out. They outright rejected it. I was told that I'm mentally sick, that non binary isn't a thing. That I should get a therapist to stop not conforming to my assigned gender at birth.

And yeah, it hurts like hell.

If you want to talk, my dm's are open.
This sounds like a really unpleasant situation, to say the least. I'm sorry you had to go through that. You are valid and your feelings are valid and even though it may not feel like it right now you matter; you mean something.
Is your mother your doctor, or your health insurance? If so, her opinion on your medical care and situation doesn't matter. Feel free to tell her so.
I’m sorry your mom’s a dick."	yuyagg	NonBinary	66	0.96	2022-11-14 12:44:54
I wish they/them pronouns were more normalized	"I hate that you can’t be non-binary and stealthy. With binary trans people, there is a possibility for them to be stealth and no one knows they’re trans. But even if I do the same thing and move away when I’m older and get a name change or something, it’s still obvious whenever I tell someone that I use they/them pronouns. 

I just wish that they/them pronouns were way more normalized in society, and that they weren’t a big deal, because every time I would want to correct someone I don’t know about my pronouns it would basically be like coming out. But with binary trans people, they could give their pronouns and still be thought of as cis. Arghh I don’t know I’m just really mad that it has to be such a big deal if I want to be called by the correct pronouns. 

(btw if it sounds like I’m hating on binary trans people, I’m not!! I’m upset at how society treats they/them pronouns as such a big deal, and that binary trans people usually don’t have to deal with that)"	"[deleted]
It's funny because I was just having this thought. Ive been out for a few years online and a few months irl and I've hit this weird conundrum where it feels amazing to be out and be me... But feels frustrating to have to come out over and over and over again.


You've constantly got to ask people to address your correctly and there is no 'passing' way to enby outside of 'confusing' people on your gender by being andro (and even that can be erased if you've got an overly masc or fem voice). So the only way to get your pronouns used correctly is outing yourself constantly or wearing a literal 'name tag' with your pronouns on them (I actually do have a they/them button but I usually only wear it at conventions where I feel safest, otherwise it's just on my tablet carrying bag)
You know what? The thought that people always will gender me. No matter how far I transition and no matter if my dysphoria (when it comes to my body and looks) gets close to 0, which it sadly never will, people will still try to call me either man or woman. I hate how big of a deal everything actually has to be if you're not in the binary. And I suppose it is understandable and not something I can force society to get but it's still a large source of my dysphoria.
It sucks to be marginalized in a way that feels total and permanent and inescapable. To exist in such a state with respect to an oppressive society fills me with all the stages of grief all the time. It can be confusing if you're a product of the assimilationist culture of empire that teaches that you can have privilege if you toe the line. But there are many people to whom assimilation has never been available. Us enbies, as you point out, are among them.

My only advice is to do the grief work, stay safe and get organized. Don't accept our marginalization as ok. But do accept that it is inescapable and that we have no choice but to protect ourselves and build each other up. Not being able to assimilate or pass our way out of our marginalization gives us superpowers. I'm not happy about it, but in order to make the most of the time I have been given I choose to do something positive with it.
Agreed. I want to stay stealth at school, but also want to use they/them
Agreed :(
Literally! You could be signing up for a Amazon account or some shit and they'll ask about your gender. Like does it really matter? Does this have any baring on the situation at all?
>They/them

I just corrected a questionnaire today, that only had male female option - I'm Cis myself, so I asked the person who made it, to add ""other"" as an option. But after that I have been questioning myself - was that the right option. So looking away from the ""Why even gender it"" - what should be the option to choose? 

The person behind the questionnaire thanked me for the correction, and asked if she should put Nonbinary in - and I was not sure that it might still exclude some, so I said that other would be a safe way to go to make sure, that everyone was included.
This is why I almost feel a little bit opposite of OP (but at the same time totally understand them?) I can't pass as andro, so using they/them pronouns sometimes – and letting people know this too, whether directly and proactively (uncommon), via a button, when asked, etc. – helps me feel like I can at least start to be ""NB enough""... even though the whole concept of that is pretty BS in the first place (but the imposter syndrome is still very real). It can feel performative to an extent but also is pretty validating, for me!
It's all for demographics and info – so they can advertise better and ultimately rake in more money, of course.

Destroy gender(ed stereotypes)! Destroy capitalism!
Oof on the ""feeling NB enough"". I'm considering starting to choose other/X/non-binary in future forms but it seems scary for some reason, like I have to put the right thing and if I'm not really NB someone's gonna come for me lol"	e5tmjg	NonBinary	67	0.97	2019-12-04 04:14:18

Does anybody else dislike smiling because you feel like it misgenders you? My smile has always been a source of dysphoria for me. Working on my happy, not-mad-I-promise, face.		"Yessss and idk how to make any face besides 😐😕☹️ that’s the pose I do in all selfies😩😩😩 lmao. I’m glad other ppl feel this too. I love your selfies btw I think you look really cool :] and not mad at all!
I understand this 100%
YES. I feel really weird when I see myself smile. As a kid I was always pressured to keep a ""pretty smile"" as I needed to ""look cute"" so I can't smile for photos, it feels forced/artificial just like it was back then.
I like your smile
Yup, although I didn't much think of it before! I always think of adults telling child-me: ""smile sweetie!"" and ""you're so pretty when you smile"".

No one every said that to my brother, not one single time.
YESSSS. I feel like my smile TOTALLY gives away my AGAB and idk whyyyyy.
i am EXACTLY the same way lol
Uugh same! Thanks for the kind words. It's easier for me to pull this off in a selfie than irl though.
I'm glad somebody else does!
I can relate to that for sure. My eyes would always reflect how I was feeling too; uncomfortable and gave off an, ""am I doing this right"" vibe.
Thanks, but I'm not smiling in either of these.

"No. Nobody is ""transing"" the tomboys."	"The current popular argument amongst anti-trans bigots and assorted TERFS uses the ""heartfelt"" stories of adult women who grew up as tomboys to fear monger about the possibility of girls being ""funneled"" into lives as trans men. This is something that has never happened. It's also totally contrary to the entire ethos of being supportive and accepting of trans people and everyone.

So, this essay might seem unneeded. The idea I'm debunking is obviously flawed. However, I do think this idea of ""*how would my childhood be different growing up with trans acceptance*?"" can open some scary doors for some people (and some wonderful doors for others) for a certain type of person it could be a very effective argument. I wrote this to dissect in detail how and why it fails.

Let's just say, this is a question I've asked myself. But, I concluded that such acceptance and education about the variable nature of gender would have \*helped\* me. I'm sad that I didn't have access to it-- even though I don't think my life would be radically different, I could have avoided some emotional suffering and confusion. I want that for everyone. Trans positive, informed childhood isn't just beneficial to trans kids. It suggests a better relationship to gender for us all.

\-----

I don't want to link to it, but a TERF group has a video up where a woman talks about how she thinks growing up today she'd ""end up"" being a trans man.  You see, she was a tomboy, what if people mistook that for her being trans? (she worries)

Let's walk through it.

Imagine a ""tomboy"" a young girl with no interest in anything ""for girls"" she dresses like a boy, does boy stuff. And, because sexism exists, she isn't looking forward to being treated like a girl or a woman for all her life. ""I don't want to be a girl!"" she even says.

Let's even imagine that all this makes her parents wonder if she might be trans. What would they do at this point? Probably ask ""are you uncomfortable being called 'she/her'? Do you not want to have your girly name anymore? What’s going on?” This changing names, pronouns and how you participate is called ""social transitioning.”

For trans kids and trans tweens its really all they are asking for. Just use different pronouns, recognize the change, let them try it out.  So, let's say this girl says ""yeah, I want to be Billy not Jane."" since she thinks this will address her feelings. (This is assuming her parents aren’t able to get to the bottom of her real feelings for some reason. Let's make this the 'worst case' scenario of being mistaken for being trans.)

Is she now locked in to being a boy forever? 

Will she be dragged to a hospital?

Obviously not. 

So, she tries out the social transitioning.  The name change might not feel off but I'd imagine for a tomboy who's fundamentally mad that girls aren't treated as well as boys ... being called ""he"" will probably feel... off. 

And this is where, for many reasons some, change their mind. And that's totally fine. The whole damn point is to free people from the constraints of gender rules not to just move people from one restrictive box to another.

But, let's imagine our tomboy *hides* how she feels about the pronouns feeling off. So they move on to talking to a psychologist and doctor as she's getting older.  What happens now? There is a lot of talking and opening up to be done.

# ""I hate being a girl. The world isn't fair to girls. I wish people would take me seriously even though I'm a girl. I'm a tomboy. If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I'll do it.""

This isn't what being a trans man sounds like. This is what hating sexism while being a tomboy sounds like. 

""Do you want to have a man's body?""

""Do you want facial hair?""

""Do you want a deep voice?""

The effects of hormones are well documented and explained to anyone who might take them. People take hormones because they want those well documented effects. ""tomboys"" don't \*really\* want to be boys. Many trans people don't even take hormones. And it's not like any little girl who likes to play in the mud is going to be fast tracked into hormones. The choice is up to the person taking the hormones.

I think some people imagine that parents could just misread signs of questioning about gender and decide to BAM *put* their kid on hormones the way that kids are sometimes put on ADHD medicines. This isn't how it works. We are talking about people aged 17, 18, 19 and up making these decisions-- after YEARS of social transition and talking about what they really feel.

If anything the whole process might be over cautious. I've heard many trans people complain that others think ""it's only a phase"" which can be really patronizing. 

There is a ton of pressure at every step to *not* go forward. This isn't something that can be accidental.

Of course, this whole discussion omits non binary people.  Part of what makes a ""horror"" story like this possible is the idea that gender has to be binary. You need to be ALL GIRL or ALL BOY. Even though that's obviously not how people really are. I think that some of us who relate to this idea of growing up as a tomboy. And ""hating being a girl"" would benefit from simply knowing that people can be non-binary. Even if in the end you don't decide that's who *you* are just knowing that people exist on a spectrum through gender is a liberating idea.

How much better off so many of us would be if we could grow up with such an understanding! If we could ditch this idea that there is only one right way to be a woman and one right way to be a man?

Not only is this better for trans kids it's better for all of us."	"thank you for the description; it's really nice to see it written out in a way that makes it abundantly clear that this slope isn't slippery at all
“If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I’ll do it”

No cap this is what largely broke my egg. I’m transmasc nb and incredibly happy. Not a tomboy. I’m not on T and I don’t plan to go on. The dysphoria I feel is 90% social - people treating me like a woman or a girl. Going easy on me when we play sports. Holding the door for me, calling me ma’am. Asking me to participate in the societal game in ways that I don’t want to or can’t fully because I’m not. A woman.

I’m not saying I dont like your essay. Tomboys and Trans Males need to be treated better in childhood and deserve to have their needs met. I want to share my experience because, regrettably, TERF’s arguments require so much nuance and effort to tear down. All the best. 🤍💛💜🖤

Small side rant: I also want to share bc it feel like so much dysphoria talk is centered on physical body traits and mine is so centered on others perception of me. It makes me feel pretty pushed out of the conversation; like I can’t relate to other trans people so well.
Thank you so much for this post!
I wasn’t really a tomboy. I didn’t dress like one or really act like one. The only thing that was necessarily “tomboy” about me was I liked bugs and looking for bugs and stuff. That’s it and now I’m a nonbinary guy. You don’t have to be a tomboy to want to be a guy. Girls can dress however they want and act however they want. They can be tomboys but that doesn’t mean they’re boys or men. And it doesn’t mean they want to transition. I agree op!
Coming from the trans fem pov I want to be a tomboy. I’ve always had envy for tomboys. I am definitely not a man
What I always find bizarre is how easily they think cis kids’ identities are utterly obliterated and overwritten by people being accepting and supportive of trans kids. I grew up at a time when just being gay was seen as sick and dangerous, and being trans was a best a hilarious joke, but I’m still trans, but we’re meant to believe that cis identities are so fragile that merely saying it’s ok to be trans is enough to change who they are? Like how the hell do they think people work?
I didn't want to put it in the essay but I think some portion of the people freaking out over this might be happier if they had a real nb path to take.   


But I do think there is a difference between thinking “If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I’ll do it” AND ""I don't want to be treated badly because **I am a girl**."" and just thinking “If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I’ll do it” AND ""I don't want to be treated badly as girls often are.""  


Fundamentally tomboys are girls, and are more invested in still having that respected even as they totally fail to meet any of the expectation for behavior.   


Though these things can be blurry on the edges.  I honestly can't say if I knew more about what nb was when I was younger if that's where I might have gone. I think probably not. But it's not like gender is always some essential immutable quality. I think this scares people. There is this subtext with LGBTQ identities of ""we can't help it, so being a jerk to us is wrong."" This is an easier idea to defend when bigots attack.  


But it's still wrong to be a jerk if a person \*can\* ""help it.""
holy shit you just captured so much of what I feel!!
social dysphoria is so powerful and is such a large component of dysphoria. I feel you on this one."	wqx4bz	NonBinary	53	0.96	2022-08-17 19:02:13
Rant about cutting my hair and getting invalidated	"
For context, I came out as non-binary to my family a few months ago, it... didn't go well. In short, I was told it's not real, they didn't need to label it before, you're just a ""boyish"" girl etc. and I crawled back into the closet real fast. We've been acting as if nothing happened since. My dad and brother acting as usual, but my mom making sure I know I'm a ""girl"", a ""beautiful young woman"" all that fun passive-agressive shit.

Now, I cut my hair today, real short, and I look GOOD. I've always had long hair and finally I cut it. They were a bit suprised but my family has been giving me compliments about it. My brother and my dad going for the  usual ""it looks good"" and I saw them make an effort to be gender neutral about it (french sucks). However, I guess my mom saw an opportunity. Telling me how it would look great with a girly look and makeup. I clearly made a face because she corrected herself and added that it looked good without makeup too. (Not the point but okay) She spent the rest of the day giving me these ""compliments"" but twisting them so it would imply I'm a woman. Even asked if it would be okay at my job to have hair this short. Had to remind her men work there too, and we all wear nets....  

I'm really mad, it made me doubt my choice to cut my hair, made me disphoric as shit and ruined my mood for the whole day, but you know what? Fuck that. I'm not letting her poison this, I'm happy with my hair, I love how it gives me the androgynous vibes I've been wanting, I love the freedom and control it makes me feel. 

I was hurt, but now I'm more motivated than ever to change my look and explore how I present, to be happy with myself. I'll fucking do it out of spite, you don't get to pretend it's not happening.

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I don't really have anyone to talk about these things with, not my family that's for sure and I don't really have friends so this place is the best I got."	"DUUUUDE France is so hard with this stuff, womanhood in France is super fragile I feel you, I'm half French and my (French) mum was always trying to erase my ""boyishness"" . I had to take lots of babysteps and I think it has a lot to do with French society and how we're supposed to look young and thin and modern all the time!!! First I came out as queer (at the age of 20), then a few years later she FINALLY took me shopping for clothes in the men's section and I was just so happy and thanking her for being such a ""modern"" mother and I think that compliment helped her feel like she was still a ""good French mother"" as long as she was modern and didn't let her child become a gremlin lol. Babysteps. I'm so happy you cut your hair and feel comfortable with it. Bonne chance!!! <3
I'm glad you're finding opportunities to love and celebrate yourself even when those around you aren't being supportive.
""if it would be okay at my job to have hair this short"" this isn't the 1950s.
Totally feel this, as this happened to me recently too with coming out and cutting my hair short. If u ever need to talk I'm a good listener and I understand what you're going through 💕
You may regrets to cut you hair because you don't like the style, but please don't regrette cuting them because someone else doesn""t like it. The first personne who should like your style is yourself. Glad that you feel motivate to change your look, go for it, explore, test and enjoy

PSA: Be careful with what information you share online.	I had joined an activist group with the impression that they would only be emailing me, but I was just sent physical mail as well. If I had known that I would be sent a letter with a big fat Mx. on the cover, I would not have put that salutation on my profile. I haven't heard anything from my parents about it, but I know they saw it and I'm afraid that my mom will get mad at me someday and use that information against me, as she has done that before. She is better now than she used to be, but I am still afraid to risk it. Please stay safe y'all.	"That's terrible, I'm sorry :( they should have explicitly stated that they would be sending you physical mail, or give an option to only receive emails.

never forget that cis people are just as obsessed with each others' genitals; they just take for granted that they get to know that about a person, based solely on appearance	"for when it just feels so creepy and targeting to be asked about your organs: **they truly believe it's information they're entitled to** and they're mad it can't just be presumed by appearance (they even get mad at cis people who don't visibly perform their binary gender ""properly"", etc.). 

so if it ever helps you to feel even a smidge better: the creep isn't personalized, it's just that people think that's data they get to have about every other person, period. they just assume they already have it about cis/binary people so they don't ""need"" to ask. they don't realize they've never needed to know in the first place.

I get mad that people make me feel that my experiences as a woman are invalid because I chose to transition	"I grew up the “girl” in a “boy” family on my dads side and all the stereotyping that came with it. I experienced my boy friend group in 2ndish grade using “X-ray vision” toys to see through my shirt. I struggled to find my place as a woman as I felt it was all wrong but what I needed to do. I was complimented for being in STEM as a female student, which actually made the decision to transition harder. I wasn’t allowed to play traditionally male sports because it was unsafe to be a girl around all those boys and men. I’ve been hit on in front of my mom at the age of 14 by a man. 

As I have grown up and entire being has been influenced by being a woman. Now at times I feel I’m expected to ignore that because I present masculine. I have watched women get saluted and applauded in my science field while I wonder if there is any support for non-binary people. People are so concerned with getting women in STEM that the gender binary is making me feel unwelcome. I am not a man, I will never be a man, and I don’t always get treated or have the privilege as a man. I have struggled just as any other woman, Latinx, gay, or disabled person has struggled, because these have all been my identities. Just because I chose non-binary instead of just woman discrimination doesn’t mean it’s not gender discrimination and it’s own struggle that should be acknowledged."	"I feel this. When talking about my “womanly” experiences, I usually say “As an AFAB person”. I feel like the Fake Trans (TM) when i still utilize things meant for women. Using the women’s bathroom, selecting female on a site that only has two gender options, or even applying for things that are set aside for women because there are no spaces for us. And then to be told that our experiences don’t matter it’s just... it’s super frustrating. Especially for me, as a parent, and people tell me I’m trying to take something away from women when I encourage people to use gender neutral words around pregnancy and parenting. It’s wack fam
I'm sorry to hear this. Your pre-transition experiences are 100% VALID and anyone who tells you otherwise is being an asshole. As a matter of fact, there are so many articles and think pieces and such out there that showcase the unique perspectives and experiences of people who transition. The erasure you're dealing with is basically prejudice, as you said. Also, as a person in STEM, I TOTALLY get that feeling of alienation when everyone clamors for women in STEM. It's good, but not good enough.

What do I do? My parents don’t want me presenting as non binary. PLEASE help.	"I don’t know what to do. My mom hates me using they/them pronouns, dressing androgynous, & using a different name. It’s torn our relationship apart. She keeps complaining about it and yelling at me for it. I can’t go on like this. But I also don’t wanna go back to presenting as a girl…

I just need unbiased advice. I usually go to my mom for advice, but obviously that won’t work in this situation, she thinks being non binary is a choice for me. If I don’t go to my parents I usually go to my friends, but my one friend is biased because they hate authority and I don’t wanna tell my other friend about my parents’ transphobia. If I go to another sub I’ll just get transphobic comments, thus why I came here.

I’ve always been super close with my mom. I’m close with my dad, too, but not as much since he’s always working. I have AMAZING parents, my mom always took me to do fun things and gave me a wonderful childhood while my dad worked hard to provide for the family. They’re great people and I hate upsetting them. 

However, they don’t like me being non binary. They say they support trans people but that there’s been such a spike in the population of trans people recently and think it’s just a trend. They don’t think I’m really non binary because I was such a feminine child. They think femininity/masculinity (that or genitalia if it’s a cis person) determines gender. My mom doesn’t get non binary because she doesn’t understand why we can’t just pick a gender (girl or boy) and stay with it. I’ve given up trying to explain this stuff.

On one hand, I could keep presenting as a girl, using she/her and my birth name, and dressing feminine until I’m an adult. At first I thought I could just wait until I live on my own, but then I realized that’d just cause a bigger drift in our relationship. I’d have to wait until they die, which might not be for another 60 years (they’re in their 40’s) and I don’t wanna have to deal with dysphoria for that long. Plus it would be kinda wrong to celebrate their death by becoming androgynous. However, this might be the only way to save our relationship. 

On the other hand, I could just continue going by Moth, they/them, dressing androgynous, but then I’d have to deal with the constant fighting and my parents being mad at me every day. I can’t stand it. No, they won’t “come around to it eventually”, it’s been the same damn thing ever since I came out at the age of 12. Sometimes people just don’t change. I >!attempted suicide!< because of their transphobia, so if risking their child dying won’t change their minds I don’t think anything will. They correct anyone who calls me Moth, they refuse to use they/them pronouns, they don’t want my sister to know anything about my identity. My mom says I’m making myself look ugly when I dress androgynous. But looking androgynous stops me from feeling dysphoric, it makes me euphoric and confident. 

I don’t know what to do. I hate this situation. I wish there was a way for everyone to be happy, but I can’t even think of a solution that makes ME happy. >!And I can’t kill myself because my parents hid anything I could hurt myself with and I don’t wanna risk another failed attempt & ending up in a psych ward again.!<"	"Put yourself before your parents. Period.
Moth. Your life is worth living. Death will not make you happy. 
Right now, you need to put your life before their happiness. What they are doing is attempting to force you to conform to their limits. This is not ok. You may feel stuck right now. You may feel trapped, with no light at the end of the tunnel. But things will get better. 
I’m 33. I came out as non binary very recently, so I was never In your position. But I am spectacularly deeply at war with my mental health, so I can safely say IT GETS BETTER! Maybe not today. Maybe not for a little while but it does get better. Talk to a dr about your attempt! They can help you! If they are not supportive, find a new dr! Your life and health come before everything else!
As for your family?
Maybe start by telling your sister? Tell her so she knows who you are. Tell your friends. Get a support group going. Use your name and pronouns. If you are old enough, look for support groups at your local library, or community centre. 
And Moth, most of all, know that you are a part of a huge community that will love and support you. Contact your local distress centre if you feel you are going to make another attempt. Please please live Moth. The world is better with you in it. Hugs.
I'm sorry to say this but your parents are unfortunately not amazing. They can't accept and respect their own child. You deserve to be yourself. You deserve to have your name and pronouns respected. You deserve to be loved just the way you are.

I unfortunately don't really know what would be safest (both mentally and physically) for you to do. But I want you to know that none of their upset is your fault. THEY are causing the rift in your relationship with them.

Offering you a parental hug in case you want one, Moth.
As someone in a similar boat who can't afford to move out: You unfortunately may have to deal with it. At school (college) and work, I can use my name and pronouns, but at home they refuse and we just don't talk about it. It minimizes the hurt while keeping me safe.
hello moth! first off, i’d like to give you a big warm hug and ask you to take a deep breath with me. my name is pluto, and i used to be a really feminine child and my parents also haven’t adjusted well. my mom specifically, but my parents are a package deal. i’ve been out and using my name and pronouns for almost four years now, my mom still doesn’t use either of them. i’m not sure how old you are, but it gets better. not the relationship, unfortunately, but life in general. 

i haven’t lived with my parents long term since i came out, because i was already away at college when i realized what i was feeling. it seems like you live with them and you’re young so things are going to be very different and very difficult. right now, i think your main goal should be staying safe and making an exit plan to move out. will dressing androgynously put you in physical harm’s way from your parents/adults in your life? emotional harm? what about dressing feminine or exclusively masculine? what would happen if you refused to respond to your deadname? if you corrected your parents in public? ask yourself these questions and be truthful about the answers. what is the safest way for you to *survive* right now? after you figure that out, how can you save money? chores/job/etc, stash that somewhere your parents can’t touch it. if you can, open a bank account they don’t know about. otherwise, do your best to withdraw small amounts of cash here and there where it won’t look suspicious and keep that in a safe, locked location that only you know exists. and for this i’m talking you buy something at a corner store after school and withdraw 5$ cash too, then stash that away because you can play it off as another snack/drink/whatever. 

now that that is in place, we can focus on the relationship. mine with my parents is different than yours, so all of this advice might not apply especially because my safety/survival plan is different from yours. i limited contact with my parents as much as possible, i only talk to my dad but he is very supportive. for you, i’d think about who you can reach out to for support. are there friends you can hang out with after school? you don’t have to tell them about anything you don’t want to, but it can be good to just be away from home. it would be a good idea to find someone you can confide in, even just asking your friends and providing trigger warnings for them to make informed decisions. does your school have a counselor or a teacher you can confide in? remember they are mandated reporters so while you can speak freely, it is not entirely private if you pose a threat to yourself/someone else or you are in imminent danger. 

if you still find yourself in pain at home, carve out a space for yourself. transform your closet or under your bed or another space, even a drawer, that is entirely yours and your own little escape. keep happy things there and create a safe mental space. try your best to ignore your parents as much as possible when they aren’t respecting your identity. is it worth packing a change of clothes in your bag? can you dress feminine at home, but when not with family (work/school) dress in a way that’s comfortable? 

i’m sure there’s more advice i can give you, my dms are open, and i’ll even be your someone to vent to. i’m not a therapist, im not a professional, but i am here and i do care. consider me your new parents/big siblings/ trusted friend, whatever makes you most comfortable. 

another big hug,
a planet who cares about a little moth
I think it’s a matter of safety and level of relationship you’re willing to have with your parents. Since you’re living with them, for safety reasons it might be best to use your birth name and pronouns at home, and amongst friends and supportive people in your life use your chosen name and correct pronouns. The ‘dressing feminine’ might have wiggle room? Like a middle ground of sorts? At least while you’re still living at home. 


Once you are no longer dependent I think it’s up to you now you prefer to live your life. Personally, I couldn’t live to please my parents in that way, even at the cost of straining that relationship. My personal values are that I keep the people in my life who love and respect me as I am, and I give that same respect back. (I however also don’t have any sort of cultural or multigenerational connection to my parents, so I don’t have anything to lose but them if I ever needed to cut them off. Luckily my parents are overall supportive even if they still don’t get the pronouns consistently and stuff.) So my advice would be thinking about what’s most important to you, knowing that there isn’t a solution that will make everyone happy, which does suck.  My personal move would be once living on your own, do as you please with name, pronouns, and clothes and be out to whomever you want, and when around your parents either allow them to use either your old name or pronouns, and dress how you want and make that boundary of ‘this is how I like to dress and I will not be changing that to please others’ or something like that. And like others said, there is love in found family and queer communities and even ally friends. Your parents are only two people of so many who can be part of your life and love you as you are.
In this situation I would say to present how you want to around the people who make you feel safe, and when around people who don't accept you, let them think that you've stopped. btw, your name is really cool (Moth) I had that one for a while and it's a very good one :))
Hey Moth. This sucks so hard. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

This is not unbiased advice. I chose to cease all contact with my family over twenty years ago, have never regretted it, and have been infinitely better for it. I’m more of a “let the bridges you burn light your way” kind of gal. 

But that’s not always for everyone. 

You have a lot to consider before choosing the right path for you. I don’t know all of the details of your situation, but I think you have three general options. 

1) Are you living with your parents? Are you financially dependent on them for resources or tuition? If so, you may choose to continue tolerating this. For now. When we’re young, parents often will try to exploit the power dynamics to coerce and control their children. It’s horrible, it sucks, but it is almost certainly temporary. This won’t last. Do what you need to now to stay safe. 

2) Burn the bridge. Cut off or decrease contact. For me, I had to leave my family, because the person they were trying to force me to be was killing me. I wasn’t that person, and the only way I could become the person I am was yo walk away. When I was a child, I thought I had a great relationship with one of my parents. But therapy and growth has shown me that parent was complicit in the abuse. You can only have a relationship if there is trust, accountability, honesty and equity. I get it may be hard for your parents. But if you tell them what they are doing is hurting you and they don’t stop, then they are abusing you. I’m in my forties. It’s not that old. They should do better. You deserve better. 

3) Try to maintain and heal the relationship. Preferably with family therapy. 

If you “save the relationship” by denying your identity and causing harm to yourself (and to be sure, your parents are absolutely causing you harm right now that you may very likely spend years reversing and healing) that is NOT a relationship. 

Hang in there. You are beautiful and special and there are people who love you and there are amazing, wonderful people you haven’t even met yet that will love you.
As someone who got to figure this whole thing out before nonbinary was a thing, I wound up going the nonconfomist route,  and formed my debating points accordingly.   

 My debate points (arguments) are that nearly all of the things associated with the binary have damned little to do with our reproductive configuration. 

Having a gender blurring mix of those affinities, tastes, etc. make us better able to adapt to the changing demands of our world. 

In the far past,  that mix served like an insurance policy facilitating adaptation in the event of the loss of a spouse.  Of course back then life was a bit harder and riskier. People were more interested in surviving than fitting into some idealized image.

Repressing, ignoring or otherwise denying those characteristics puts undue stress on us psychologically. It's developmentally counterproductive, if not destructive. 

But enough talking points. 

Your parents love you and want you to succeed in life.  Their tastes and sensibilities happen to match the cis/binary world view.  Their belief is that to succeed that you need to fit in that binary.  Like I implied in  my first sentence,  nonbinary Is still something only a decade or two old.

But I would also be surprised if even they don't have characteristic(s) that go against their gender stereotype.  They're just not as pronounced as ours.  And they will claim their nonconformity as  outdated, not associated with the opposite gender, or otherwise conforming to their stereotype.  

But they are there and can be used to plant the idea that nonbinary-ness is more a matter of degree and not an alienating difference.
hey, first, i want to say i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. your story sounds pretty similar to mine. i was “lucky” enough to not realize i was non-binary until college, when i was out of the house and had more freedom. i’m sorry you’re feeling so trapped and unsure.

you deserve to be seen for who you are. i’m not going to condemn your parents, because though i think they are wrong for treating you the way they do, i understand it can hurt for people to shit on your family when you love them. i just want you to know that there is NOTHING wrong with who you are. do not question for an instance if you have caused this rift or if you should just try not to be non-binary. this is NOT your fault. it is incredibly hard, especially at your age, to truly believe that your parents might be in the wrong. i think we spend so much time trusting them as children that even as we grow, it is difficult to believe that we are independent people whose identities and also choices deserve to be respected, but they do. you deserve respect.

i was living at home during the pandemic, while coming to terms with my gender. it was…. complicated. but, something that has worked for me was wearing smaller, less noticeable things that helped me feel confident. are there some gender neutral things you can wear that won’t upset anyone? just because your parents are shoving you into a girl box doesn’t mean you have to wear frilly dresses. lots of cis women wear things that aren’t straight out of a 50s catalogue. get some straight leg jeans that help you have a more masc frame. buy some baggier tees (sure, maybe throw in a little pink somewhere). can you manage to get a more gender neutral haircut? at least until you move out and can run to a safe space, i would maybe drop the subject directly for the moment. i am so sorry to say that, but you should always keep yourself safe. but maybe the way you can feel more comfy for the moment is through your appearance. i think you can get away with more than you might think. 

ultimately, you have to be true to yourself. i’m so sorry the pain this is causing you. at the end of the day, if your parents don’t come around to you being non-binary, they will have ruined their relationship with you whether you stay out or not. will you ever really be able to have as deep of a relationship with them, knowing they can’t accept who you are? as much as it hurts, you have to be you, or it will hurt you more than they ever can

lots of love and hugs
I’m a parent to a non binary child and let me correct you - your parents are NOT amazing, Moth. I’m sorry to say it, but THEY have caused you to attempt suicide. Your own parents, who are meant to support you through everything, have driven you to be suicidal, and want to give up on who you truly are. They sicken me.

You say they support transgender but everything you have written shows otherwise. They merely give it lip service - it’s a case of it’s ok for others, but not for their own family. They are transphobic and they don’t support you whatsoever. You need to cut them out for your own mental health, immediately. It’s hard, I’ve done it myself, both for me and for my children. But you need to put yourself first in this and live for yourself. This is NOT selfish, this is survival. You need to forget what they did for you when you were a child - that was their duty as your parents. They were meant to do that. End of story. They’ve now dropped the ball and you need to remember that you are the important one in your story now. Not them. You owe them precisely nothing, especially when they aren’t supporting you and your mental health and your *life* is at stake.

So you do what is right for you, and you walk away. You find your own family in the form of friends who do love you and support you. You prove your parents wrong, and you live your best life. You do it with your head held high knowing you’ve done nothing wrong - they have. They lost you, not the other way round.

They have failed you honey, and as a parent I am so sorry you’re having to deal with this. It is so so hard to cut family out. But it is so so much harder to live with toxic family who are putting you at risk. Love yourself first. Them being mad and yelling at you, being transphobic towards you, to the point you wish you were dead, is abusive. Let that sink in - your parents are abusive. You are well within your rights to walk away. Save yourself Moth. Don’t let them ruin you and your life. You deserve so much better.

Please take care of yourself. 💜
Hey Moth! Firstly I’m so sorry that you’re experiencing this. I actually came out to my parents this week and they hated every minute. I’m 24, so that’s amazing how you are so strong (me assuming you’re younger). Anyway, I love my parents too and it’s really hard. I would suggest doing everything you can for yourself right now even if it means drifting apart. You can try to rekindle with your family in the future and that may work. But you will ALWAYS have yourself so please give yourself love and grace in these hard times 🤍❤️
First of all I really like your name! moths are awesome! and you should definitly talk with a therapist or school counselor about this and get some help. I'm sorry that you're feeling this way and that your parent's are total asshats. You deserve accepting parents. What you're going through is really rough but just know that you're not alone and there are great people out there willing to support you. Sometimes just having a bunch of ally friends makes being yourself easier. Parents should love their kids unconditionally and it always baffles me that that all goes out the window the moment their kid comes out as trans. Just know that things absolutely *will* get better and this is not worth killing yourself over. Think about things in the long term and even doing small things that validate you like the way you dress when you're out away from your parents or subtly wear trans colors might help. I'm sorry your parents are like this and I hope your situation improves.
Alright, I'm going to be as honest as I can with this reply. I'm not sure if everyone will like it, but I'm not trying to cause problems here, just trying to give my honest take on the scenario.

The truth of the matter is, as long as you live with your parents, you will never have complete control of yourself and who you are. Especially, if they are providing you with things like a roof over your head, food in your belly, and clothes on your back. If you're literally depending on them to live, you'll never 100% be free of them and their thoughts/feelings about your gender.

And, while I would love to say ""just be you! Who cares what they think?!"", that's also not realistic. Because, as you said yourself, if you try being open around them, it causes arguments and pushback and all that sort of stuff. So, while not being open about your gender is poor for your mental health, I would assume the fighting and such doesn't do you any favors either. You are essentially stuck between a rock and a hard place. In your situation there is no perfect solution, here.

Now, once you get to a point that you can be out on your own, that's where things start to differ. If you're able to stand on your own two feet, and they still don't accept you then, then you go from there. In that scenario, you might have to limit your interactions with them. Maybe just holidays and such, if being around them too much is too taxing for you. And if that's too much, then you might have to cut them out of your life. That's also a harsh reality that might come to pass, but I hope it doesn't. I hope that you and your parents can find some sort peace, eventually.

**As for what you should do right now:**

The only solution I can really think of is basically having to live a double life. Inside the home, you follow their wishes, their rules, and all that. Outside of it/not around them? You be whoever you are.

**And before anybody comes at me about all this:**

Understand that I know what I'm proposing sucks. But if anyone has a better solution, I'm all ears. Because I think all of us need to understand the reality of the situation. If this person is living with their parents and living off of their parents, there is much they can do without fear of being kicked out, for the least without fear of fighting all the time. And that's not going to be a good environment for them.

And yes, I do understand that hiding who they are basically from certain people isn't good for them either. But again, rock and a hard place. Unless the OP can just magically live on their own and never have to deal with their parents again, or their parents magically come around, I see no real solution to this. Best I can offer is some sort of half measure / middle ground, which I know, sadly isn't, much.

I wish you the best, Moth. And I hope things go better for you. Either your parents come around or something. Just know that there's plenty of people here that support you and I'm sure we'll try to do the best we can for you 😁
Be safe at home. Part of that is going to be trying to mitigate any misgendering giving you gender dysphoria. If you can find a therapist that is supportive and get your parents to pay, that would be ideal. 

It sounds like you are not financially dependent so the most productive use of your time until you finish high school is possibly finishing said high school with the best marks you can muster. This way you’ll have an easier pathway as an adult. 

Are you hoping to do post-secondary education (college/trade school/university)?
I know this isn't what you want to hear, but head down, battle through, get to 18, move out, and then cut them off. I know the idea of that is likely painful, but there is no saving of this relationship - they have actively chosen to set the terms of you having that relationship with them as crippling, agonising dysphoria. There will be people who love you as parents out there. You will have that love and that support you need to have. But you will *never* get it from your parents. They have made that *very* clear. You have a shot at a happy life living as your authentic self, but *not* with them in that life.
Something that my (amab) sibling did to convince my dad that something androgenous was actually something that manly men wore was providing pictures of celebrities to use as examples of why he wanted long hair and to wear the color purple, for example. It still took a fair amount of convincing and sibling support that ""men wear this too!"", but my dad eventually gave in.

Perhaps you can try to pass off some androgenous clothing as fem to your parents by trying to convince them that it's a trending style among women and try to find some examples of celebrities you can present to prove to them that what you're choosing to wear is actually fem?

Best of luck, friend!
Jokes on them, no matter how you dress, you're still ""presenting as non-binary"".

In all seriousness though, I'm very sorry your parents arent supportive. This is all horrifying to read and I do hope you get out of that situation asap. I know I would never want to salvage any relationship with people like like that. If they're literally driving you to feel suicidal, your safety is absolutely the priority. If you can try to avoid more conflict and focus that energy on making plans to move out, you'll be much safer. I promise life gets so much better once you're free from fanily members like this (personal experience).

Sidenote: Moth has gotta be one of the coolest names I've seen here. Great taste :)
If your plans include injuring yourself, ask for psychological counseling and take therapy with your parents.
There’s no one way to be non-binary
But if I do that means having to deal with us drifting apart & them being mad at me all the time and yelling at me, which still results in me being depressed all the time.
Thank you. I know death won’t bring happiness, but it’s better than this 😅 I’ll try not to resort to that though. I’m not allowed to talk to my sister about my gender and stuff, but I could tell my friends! Thanks for your support :)
Other than that, though, they’ve done everything right as parents, and I don’t think it’s fair to diminish that because they don’t understand/like me being non binary.

Thank you, though. I don’t know if it’s necessarily their fault, but I’m glad to hear it’s not mine. I was always the “easy child” up until recently, but now I feel like I’m just causing them problems. So it’s nice to be reassured that this isn’t my fault.

Thanks :)
Alrighty. I could probably keep using my name and pronouns outside of the house, but I guess I have no choice but to dress feminine :\ thanks for your input!
Honestly, I know your comment is older than mine, but I just want to say this is what I really was shooting for with mine. And you laid out some of the finer details I couldn't think of at the time, so that's awesome.

Just basically here saying I appreciate your reply, even if I'm not the OP. It's just good to know there's people with some really well thought out, and well-meaning advice on this subreddit. 👍
Peace at any price is not peace.

A few more talking points Moth, perhaps you can try having a sit down conversation that gender is a spectrum and our definitions changes over time. Look at what defined a man/woman in the early to mid 1900s, submissive housewife, working man. Now look at how much things have changed. Explain that you fall somewhere on the continuum of gender (with what it means to ""be a man"" on one end and ""being a woman"" on the other). Also nonbinary does not mean androgyny, it's just how you feel most comfortable expressing yourself.

Perhaps you could also discuss that it only appears to ""be a trend"" because 1) we have a better understanding of gender identities (more labels to help describe ourselves to others beyond just saying ""I don't feel like agab"") and 2) society is at a place where people feel safe/comfortable coming out. Other cultures recognized genders outside the Binary long before nonbinary was wildly used.

So what if it's ""a phase"" for you? (Not saying it is, but as another talking point) your parents should still be compassionate and supportive. Would they react so strongly to how you dress if you had said you wanted to appear tomboyish? What if you're aesthetic changed to a ""goth phase""? Clothes are clothes and hair grows back.
Thank you! I love moths, too :) and thanks for the advice!
I think that’s what I’ll have to do. Thank you :)
I want to go to college for entomology, but my mom says I’m too dependent on her and won’t be able to go off to college/live in a dorm because of my anxiety, so idk if that can happen
Alright, I’ll try that! Thanks! I’ve always hated taking care of my hair when it was long, so that’s usually my excuse when I ask for a haircut
In the long run it will be less miserable than pretending to be something you aren’t. You’ll have to figure out how to get away from them if they cannot change to accept you. Painful reality of being trans 😔
It also means you have the opportunity to build a chosen family with people who will love and accept you for who you are. Your parents are causing you pain by not accepting you for who you are. Embracing who you are may be painful at first but in the long run it will bring you so much more joy than you can imagine. Regardless of the choice you make I hope you know that I’m rooting for you. The world is a better place with you in it!
And remember, it gets better! You are worth loving and living! You belong here, as yourself. As Moth. ♥️♥️♥️
Are you sure they did everything right? Maybe they conditioned you to never question them?
I've been in your exact shoes in terms of having otherwise decent parents. If you hold off your own personal happiness for the sake of maintaining a better relationship with your parents until you're 18, you're just going to be miserable until you're 18. It sounds like you're not optimistic about them changing their minds regarding your identity, so in my opinion there's no point in making yourself suffer by presenting as fem any longer. 

At first it can feel like you're inconveniencing them since you normally haven't caused any distress for them. They may be confused and frustrated by the concept of non-binary people since they don't understand it that well. But I would remind you that your identity is not a choice. You are who you are, and you prioritizing your well-being through living as yourself should not be an inconvenience to them outside of the time it would take to adjust to using your name and pronouns. It's a rough adjustment for everyone involved, but you don't owe them femininity because they raised you. Be yourself. Hoping things will get better for you!
I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm sorry you feel like a relationship that was important to you is drifting beyond your reach.

But I say this as gently as possible: a parent's ONE fundamental job is to love and accept their child for who they are. To love, support, and build their children up so that their children can go on to live happy, fulfilling lives of their own. Is food and housing security and fun experiences part of that? Sure. But the most critical thing anyone can provide (or withhold) from a child is love. And your parents are withholding that because you're no longer meeting their every expectation.

You said it yourself, whether you fully recognize it or not -- they're willing to make your life so miserable that you tried to end it in order to avoid growing as people. They're willing to put their peraonal comfort and narrow minded worldview ahead of you mental, emotional, and even physical wellbeing and safety.

So they aren't amazing parents. And they never were. They just SEEMED amazing when everything was going the way they wanted. Because amazing parents would find a way to accept you for who you are, even if it didn't come naturally to them and they had to work at it. Amazing parents wouldn't push their child to self-harm for ANY reason; and if they somehow did it without realizing, they would immediately be seeking to get you help and correct any behavior or environmental patterns that contributed to it. Amazing parents would love their child no matter who that child was, rather than the IDEA of the child they wanted to have; which is exactly what they're doing by trying to force you back into the box of who they want/expect you to be. Amazing parents would TRY.

And I'm so sorry you're having to deal with the disappointment of learning just how un-amazing your parents really are on top of everything else you're going through right now.
Don't be concerned about causing problems as you are doing nothing wrong. It doesn't matter how well they raised you if they don't respect you as a person that makes them terrible parents. You are totally valid for not liking them for that reason just as you are totally valid from dropping them from your life when you move out.
Oh, yeah, I didn't put this in my original comment, but you definitely shouldn't blame yourself for any of this.

You are just trying to live your life. Your parents' sensibilities and comfort is on them. Sadly, you have to deal with their feelings, because they use them in a way that impacts you. But their feelings are not your fault. Their acceptance or lack there of, is on them, not you.

Honestly, just try to do your best and know there are people who care about you in this world, alright? ♥️
Maybe also if you can and is safe to do so , you could keep with you a shirt or something for you to change one piece of clothing when you already left the house, in a bathroom. Any piece of clothing that aligns more with yourself. Then when you were to come back , change again. I know it sounds like a lot of work but it's still an option to consider I guess.
You're welcome. If you need anything, you can hit me up on here. My Chats are acting weird right now, but you can message me, if you need anything. Best of luck to you ♥️
How many more years until you graduate from high school? 
Can you apply to schools outside of your region to facilitate moving out.
There are SO many femmes with short haircuts that may look fem to your parents that you can use to validate your hairstyle choice!

The amazing thing about gender presentation is that it's all just a construct and based on social norms of the time period. And in these days, there are many types of short ""fem"" haircuts that are definitely also andro ❤️. Like seriously, there are women that can make bald look fem and they're GORGEOUS!
Fr! Better they respect you and see you for who you are than live this pretend life where they're happy but you're not  (you as in OP)
That’s a good idea! Thanks!
I’m currently in my sophomore year, I graduate in 2025. And I’m confused how that would help
Well I suppose I was thinking that if you only apply outside your region, they’d have to let you live on your own while in university. 

It sounds like you have some time before that happens. Pros and cons to that, I guess. More time to make sure your grades are as high as possible, and to research colleges/universities. But also more time in a home where you aren’t being fully accepted as the beautiful person you are. 

I feel for you, OP. 

My parents weren’t convinced I was LGBTQ+ either. That was painful. But they were otherwise supportive and emotionally nurturing. 

Do you think you could find a group for trans youth or a community clinic with trans support in your area for the emotional support while you are living at home?
Ps. My parents came around. They just needed time and more exposure to other parents with LGBTQ2+ kids. I’m 39 now and still in therapy to deal with old wounds. 

I very much hope you can get some counselling to help you mitigate the hurt from your parents’ failure to accept this part of you. It can make all the difference in the world."	1282xyr	NonBinary	44	0.95	2023-03-31 23:03:07
Rude guy in discord server inadvertently made me really happy!	"So I was in a discord server chatting with some guys and one of them speaks up and is like ""your voice is really pissing me off"" I ask him why and he says ""because I can't figure out what you are!""
This guy knows I'm non-binary, and this was really rude, but I couldn't be mad at him because I was so pleased that he couldn't tell my agab from my voice. So, weirdly happy right now!"	"Let the spite fuel you! May the anger and confusion only add to your androgynous power!

No one takes being non binary seriously and I'm sick of it	I go to a all white right-wing School and they hate everything that is different, not only do have to deal with being the only black student in my grade but I have to deal with dumbass comments about gender. Only a handful of people know that I'm a non binary trans masc but even just sitting in class here's the dumbasses going on a rant about how they can't be pronouns or one person can't be multiple people. And these people talk to me like I'm going to agree with them and get mad when I snap and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy. I couldn't even come out to my parents without my dad making a joke and I told them I'm not open with them because they can't take me seriously. It's always she/her and I fucking hate it. And I'm tired of people treating non binary people as a fucking joke	"I just wanna say I feel you and I’m sorry about what you’re going through
I feel this
yeah, it really sucks. hopefully if we keep being loud about it though then the next generation will have it a lot better. sorry to hear your frustration, hope it gets better for you mate
I'm sorry to hear, I feel you on that one, I come from a similar background, but know it'll get better.  You can do this, you are amazing and valid, I'm proud of you

Referring to a friend using all pronouns: is using he/him okay?	"I have a friend who came out as nonbinary and has told us that they use all pronouns. So far everyone has been really supportive and I'm so happy for them!! I've been using he/him for them while some were using she/her, a lot less were using they/them but some still do. I thought all was fine. However, in a recent conversation, with other friends we were talking about our enby friend's plans for university and throughout the conversation i was repeatedly using he/him. I noticed i was getting weird stares...? I got called out quite aggressively for my transphobia because i was using the wrong pronouns. Honestly, i thought i was going to have a heart attack then and there. I was hurt and the last thing i wanted was to come off as transphobic.

I explained that i wasn't trying to be so. I only explained that since they were using all pronouns, he/him would be fine?? But then i was only confronted with the argument that referring to them simply as he/him meant still seeing our friend as a man. That i had to use other pronouns as well. The problem I'm seeing is that people who call our enby friend using she/her don't get called out. But they aren't cycling through pronouns either. And I'm just so confused and ashamed... I'd understand if our friend had told us not to use he/him. But when they came out... they said they were going to use all pronouns. 

Have i been hurting my enby friend all along? What does it mean when a person is using all pronouns? Does it mean we get to refer to them as whichever pronoun or does that mean we have to be using all pronouns consciously? When i said they were using all pronouns in my defence, did i even have a ground to stand on?

I'm using they/them now because i don't want to be hurtful.

In the case that i may have been gravely wrong this whole time... HOW TF DO I APOLOGIZE 😔?

EDIT: I reached out to my enby friend to ask directly, and they said they meant it when they said all pronouns were okay. He/him was just fine to them and people could either cycle through different pronouns or pick just one. We were pretty much on the same page when they first told me about it.

Talking with each other again, they realized (me as well) that ""all"" means differently for many people. It's really not anyone's fault and my friend isn't obligated to know everything all at once. They pretty much assumed that all means, literally free for all, use what you want.

We did all talk, including the group that called me out. Ofc, the aggression from before didn't sit well with my enby friend especially since it was on their behalf. Bit awkward 😕 😶. Everything was cleared up, at least.

No, not everything's fixed yet because we're all still licking our wounds -- and we're kids so we hold grudges 😓. We're just trying not to make our enby friend feel like it's their fault so we're trying to keep things under wraps. They just came out, this should be about them not us. 

So maybe i feel a bit miffed, especially after seeing the replies to this post. We could've talked about it instead of singling me out. They were pretty mad too. I feel moreso right now, knowing that things AREN'T AT ALL clear cut. Maybe i make myself feel better by imagining they get coffee grounds in their coffee when they order at starbucks... but that's not my enby friend's problem anymore. 

Thank you guys for being amazing people and helping me out. I'm still learning."	"Plenty of enbies use he/him pronouns. Your friend said ALL pronouns, right?  Besides...if it's a matter of respecting your friend, then it just comes down to what they want to be called...not what others think you should call them. 

Just talk to your friend and ask if he/him pronouns are okay. Whether it is or not is up to your friend in this situation.
I'm assuming your friend is AMAB.  When people only use our AGAB pronouns it's easy to perceive the situation as them only seeing us as our AGAB.  It doesn't mean what you were doing is transphobic, but it does happen to be the same behavior transphobes engage in, so it's easy for people to assume transphobic intent.

It's an unfortunate awkward situation for you because you definitely got a free pass to use he/him when you were told all pronouns are okay, and without understanding the experience of non-binary people trying to explore pronouns they haven't been stuck with since birth, you couldn't have known that using only he/him would be perceived differently than only using she/her.

As an AMAB enby I had to drop he/him from my pronoun list to get people to actually put in the effort to use they/them or she/her instead.  And most of them use she/her every single time even though they/them is right there for them to use.  I'm okay with it because I'm transfem but it's not lost on me that virtually everyone in my life chooses the binary option and ignores they/them.  

I personally don't mind if someone uses any of my pronouns all the time, but it's kinda nice when it gets changed up every now and then.  As a transfem, they/them would be a nice indicator that they recognize that I'm non-binary instead of only seeing me as a trans girl.  

If you like to use their AGAB pronouns and they haven't dropped them from their pronouns then you should be able to but I'd definitely recommend rotating with others just so your friend sees that you are respecting their non-binary identity rather than ignoring it. You may also want to ask your friend how they feel.  Maybe they would really prefer to have them rotated.  Or maybe they have a slight preference.
No, you’re in the right. You’re friends are being insensitive. Cis people tend in my experience to misunderstand preferred pronouns completey. Your friend says all pronouns, so then that’s it: al pronouns are good for him. THATS IT. there’s no secret tricks. Theres not a secret right answer. Whatever your friend says is correct is correct, and deciding that something else is actually the right answer is SO infantilizing it drives me up the wall. I feel invested because I’ve has this argument. I prefer he or she, but in a gender neutral way and people OFTEN go to they/them, which is so ao absurd to me. Just LISTEN to the things that your friend says!
Have you asked your friend what they think about you using he/him pronouns primarily? What she thinks is much more important than what anyone else thinks since it's his identity. 

When I was in the process of coming out, I debated using any pronouns and decided on they/them exclusively because she/her/he/him pronouns would cause me to be extremely dysphoric. When I eventually told people that I was nonbinary, I made it explicitly clear that I only wanted they/them pronouns. I imagine your friend has been through a similar process, and knows what they are and aren't comfortable with. 

With all that being said, I would ask them directly about what they would prefer - if they do state that she would prefer certain pronouns over others, then I would apologize for the confusion and start using his preferred pronouns. 

Sidebar: I think it's nice that you came here to ask about how to be a good ally. It can be hard to come out, and I'm sure your friend will appreciate your efforts to try and create a safe space for them.
Pardon me for saying this, but I think your other friends are virtue signalling and need to check themselves. Your friend said ALL pronouns. 

However if you are unsure... Just ask that friend... I highly doubt they expect you to switch pronoun types every three sentences some shit. I am gender fluid and I would have a hard time doing that. Also conversationally constantly switching pronouns would get confusing...
I'm afab and use she/her and they/them pronouns. For me personally, I like both to be used interchangeably. Other people I've talked to who use multiple sets of pronouns have felt similarly. Basically, if someone uses multiple or all pronouns, you typically want to not just stick to one set of pronouns, especially if you default to the ones that match agab. If someone only uses she/her with me and doesn't also use they/them, I feel like they still only see me as a woman. That being said, you didn't know and I don't think you were deliberately trying to be transphobic. From this point forward, use all pronouns. You could even ask this person if she has a preference. Sometimes the pronouns I like to be used for me depends on how I feel that day. I hope this helps and gives you a better understanding of how to use multiple sets of pronouns.
All pronouns mean all pronouns it's nice to see some variety at times (I used to use all pronouns now just they/he) - if they weren't offended, it is not your cis, straight friends (assuming they are either cis or straight but anyway) place to be offended on his behalf when he specified ALL pronouns.
it really depends on the person, so i think this is a conversation that should be had with your friend (like lots of others have said).

some people use all pronouns or and want them to be mixed up, some use all but have certain preferences, some use all and have no preference whatsoever.
all pronouns means all pronouns, those ""friends"" of yours are morons
If your friend said all pronouns…why are you only using one set?
the first thing you should do is ask your friend if you only using he/him bothers them. If they say yes, just say you misunderstood and apologize for that. 
In my experience when someone says they use all pronouns it could mean anything. Maybe they don't care which pronouns you use for them, or maybe they mean they want people to use all pronouns with them. 
I think what matters the most is how your friend feels about that.
One of my friends, AFAB, uses she/they pronouns, explained her perspective to me. For them, professionally (we worked at the same school last year) she prefers that I just use she. But around friends and family, alternating back and forth between she and they makes them feel seen and valid for who they are. 

If your friend uses all pronouns, maybe ask if they have a preference. If you’re not comfortable with that, I personally would just go with they/them.
It's not you. I personally default to they/them, which some binary folks are actually not okay with at all, so I can understand your struggle. The first time I discovered someone that uses all pronouns, I honestly got excited because it's a lot of fun to change the pronoun being used when discussing the person. My advice would be to try to mix things up It may not be easy, but after a while, it can become instinctual. I used to fear meeting someone who uses neopronouns since I had no fucking idea how to use them grammatically, but someone I saw on TikTok has a sibling who uses Xe/hir pronouns, and the sibling explained how to use it and I am so grateful to hir that xe explained it.
They said they were cool with all pronouns, really. And that i was more than fine. We're going to be talking about it tomorrow, enby friend included. Still feeling thoroughly shamed 😅 but i guess it's good to clear things up.
They said they were really cool with he he/him~ though they liked all pronouns equally. I think we're gonna have a talk soon, because my friend didn't appreciate it all how people were being forced to forego certain pronouns when they, themself, clearly said all. The fact that the response was aggressive, and done so for their sake clearly didn't come off too well.

Sucks that we're all in the same circle too...
With this, my official pronouns are he/they, but I tend to introduce myself with they/them pronouns in queer friendly spaces since the not so friendly spaces default only to my AGAB. 

But, OP, it’s entirely up to your friend how to refer to them. If they are good, you are good.
Hi! Yeah, we're all going to have a discussion about this because my friend is kinda going through a similar though process like yours? We're all in the same circle and they didn't like that the call was aggressive too.
I use they/them or she/her. Though I prefer they/them. As long as it isn't he/him, I'm good with whatever. I definitely think you should ask your friend how they feel. Also remember that he could have changed his feelings or thoughts after coming out. As such, don't be ashamed! It wasn't intentional, so there is no need to beat yourself up about it. As long as you're making your best effort, being considerate and apologizing when you know you messed up, and are not making a huge deal out of your mistakes and causing your friend to feel like they need to make you feel better about it, then you're going to be OK.
Thank you! I might just stick with my enby friend for now. The study session turned sour very fast and i don't think I'm up for hanging out with the others after what happened.

We're still all meeting together with my enby friend just to clear things up (they stand on all pronouns being okay with them). But after that i might just skedaddle.
Because they said all pronouns were okay. This is my first time having a trans friend. Not everyone automatically assumes that when they say all pronouns work, one is supposed to consciously cycle through them.

From the response I'm getting, it genuinely depends on the person. There's nothing apparently inherently wrong with using he/him. It's wrong when they say not to use it. Or when they tell you to use all and but you refuse to cycle. It depends. It's not clear cut.
I'm such a fucking nerd. Idk why I find pronouns fun but I do.
That's on your friend to correct the others, then. If he tells you he/him is okay, he should tell them to leave you the fuck alone.

Now, as a he/they enby I know that when you have a binary pronoun and a gender neutral pronoun, the binary one will be used WAYYYYY more because people generally find it easier. Sometimes that's disappointing. But it's not EVERYONE ELSE'S fault for using a pronoun you told them is okay. 

So if he does say ""please stop using he/him so much"", you should respect that, but it's not your fault for using it before.
If that's the case, I'd try to use all pronouns equally :)
The real answer is to ask your friend politely and then LISTEN TO THE ANSWER AND BELIEVE IT.
I already asked and they're firm on being okay with all pronouns. But we're all meeting up tomorrow because they didn't feel too good about what happened between me and my other friend. 

When they said ""all"" we both were working on the assumption that any pronoun would work for them. It's clearly not like this for all people and my friend's having to clarify that tomorrow so people don't unfortunately fight about it.
That's perfectly valid - from what I've read of your other replies, it seems that your other friends are the ones who are not being very good allies. The reason I say that is because it seems that a lot of people think they should speak for others without taking into account how infantilizing and embarrassing it can be. Being agender, asexual and autistic, I have no shortage of experiences with people speaking for me without my consent, and its exhausting to have to correct people's assumptions all the time. 

I also get angry when people dogpile onto others who may not know the subtle nuances of certain situations, as I  have been ostracized many times for that exact reason. I find it extremely unproductive and much more likely to turn someone away from learning more about the community at large. I personally love talking to people about my experiences (like right now, lol), and I love listening to others as well. 

Regardless, I hope further encounters that you have with this group is much more positive, and that they have learned to not speak for your friend.
we were on the same page, my enby friend and i. i edited the original post above to include the missing info\~ the response to this thread has been incredibly enlightening.
I did! That's what i was talking about in my previous response. We're all going to have a discussion tomorrow because my enby friend both didn't like how one pronoun was being isolated from the rest and how the callout was aggressive and done supposedly for them. I think they felt pressured on that last part.
That's great then. It sounds like you handled everything right. I hope your other friends learn a lesson about not being so righteous about other people's business.
Yes thats right. It sounds like you’re being thoughtful and paying attention, good friend.
I might just hang with my enby friend for a while 🩹✌. Confrontations like that just tend to leave a mark on me. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, though :) i think this whole thread has been teaching me a lot about the many nuances of using all pronouns? Some i think mean ""any"", some people mean ""use them all, or just use they/them"", and from research, some use all pronouns but with specific people. I'm still learning.
I'm rereading your initial response, and i think the reason about the whole confusion is that using ""all pronouns"" means differently for many people.

It's nice to get the reassurance that me and my friend were on the same page. And that there isn't inherently wrong with picking a pronoun when they say all is cool.

But for others, when they say all pronouns, they mean to say that they don't want people picking just one. In the hypothetical instance that my friend did mean for all of us to cycle thru differently p.nouns, the clarification would've been missing.

However since, my friend, themself, is new to this, the specifications of saying that they'd be using and were cool with all pronouns, didn't really come to them as necessary.

And honestly, that's so fvcking valid. They're not obligated to know everything all at once. 

I'm learning that ""all"" means differently to many people. And either they clarify from the beginning or the people around them ask..."	121i8da	NonBinary	36	0.95	2023-03-25 10:53:11
My grandma got the exact same haircut as mine	"I got my new haircut, it’s like short on one side and long on the other side, and because of the Chinese new year tradition thingy, I have to visit my grandma right after.

I was so nervous. Normally Asian parents are not very accepting of these things, and everything would go horribly wrong if they decided to get mad about it.

But to my surprise, my grandma got the exact same haircut, and she asked me if I’m fine with taking photos, because her hair designer doesn’t know how to do the back design and my hair design is perfect for this. Of course I said yes, and I’m so happy. I forgot I have a really cool grandma lol."	"That's awesome! Your grandma sounds fun
Cool grandmas are awesome! Congrats on having one!
What a fantastic grandma and how cool that you have matching hair. My kid teases me because my hair started getting shorter and shorter to match theirs. But they have a cool look.

anyone else angry	i was talking to my therapist the other day and ive been on T for a couple months now so he asked me how im feeling about top surgery and like... i have been thinking of it as an inevitability for about a year now, since ive been binding and i like the silhouette it gives me and binding isn't a permanent solution/does damage your body over time. but on the other hand, would i feel the need to bind most of the time or remove my breasts if they weren't so heavily associated with womanhood? probably fucking not! also, it's a major surgery and it's expensive! this is some bullshit y'all!! i still might get it someday but im mad right now and really conflicted 	"As someone who's transition had to be fueled by estrogen instead of testosterone... let me just say, I certainly have had many many times when my breasts caused more dysphoria than the alleviated too.

People are funny.
I am currently in the midst of appealing my insurance's decision to deny my top surgery. They want a BMI of 35 and I am at 37 (based on the waiting list for my surgeon, I'll be well below 35 when the time comes). 

The reason for me wanting top surgery is dysphoria but it's social dysphoria. I hate that people see my chest and automatically see me as a woman. I hate that my students will say ""we you sound like a guy but..."" and gesture at my chest.

I don't hate my boobs and I don't really have a problem with them. I hate how they make other people react to me. If getting that to change means undergoing top surgery, then so be it.
YES, YES, YES! Hey world, listen the F up: WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PHYSICAL BODIES TO FIT YOUR RIGID IDEAS OF GENDER IF WE DON’T WANT TO. My body, my business. End of story. How I may appear on the outside, whatever curves and shapes are present or missing, you need to have respect for who I am inside the shell. Non negotiable.

Oddly, I feel pretty okay walking around the house without a shirt on, and don’t have upper-body dysphoria during sexual intimacy. However, when I put on a shirt and go out into the world, I am constantly self-conscious and hyper aware of how that shirt fits. Thanks, social norms.
S A M E
Yes!! I'm not medically transitioning whatsoever atm (probably won't ever, but not completely sure) but I still relate to this so much. Most of the time I want to bind because my chest makes people automatically perceive me as a girl, not because I have a problem with my chest on its own. I'd probably be more okay with my chest if it didn't make it so easy for strangers to gender me.
Yes, let the hate flow through you!!! We will do away with these strict gender associations eventually.
Yes! And I will continue to be angry until there is nothing left to be angry about.
My therapist's dums wasn't surgery related, but they did ask me, amab trans non-binary, when I was going to start presenting full time as a woman. I had no words.
[deleted]
that's the truth 🙃
right like??? i feel like what was social dysphoria before has over a couple of years morphed into regular ol dysphoria and i'm bitter 
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL!!! My partner and I are NUDISTS for fucks sake and just... sometimes I don't want people to look at me and automatically see ""girl""
thats kinda how i feel, im on topical t that u put on like deodorant and i have to wait for it to dry before putting a shirt on which has regained me a modicum of comfort with my chest, but if the shape of it is visible in public it's like 'NOPE' 
ohhhhhhhhhhhh thats shit :( did they realize that wasn't ok? 
i do bind correctly now but have some damage from wearing my binder for too long at once in my first year using it. my impression is that it will only get worse over time.

i'm mad about the way western culture (and others but i'm in america) treats breasts, basically, because it makes it really hard for everyone (including myself) to see them and not immediately think a) female and b) sex, which makes it hard for trans folks, and tbh cis women also, to make peace with their bodies. i don't spend all my time being angry though haha, i don't have that kind of energy 
I guess not. They also said in a subsequent session that they didn't really understand all the non-binary stuff, pronouns, etc. (again, speechless). This from one of the most highly regarded gender psychiatrists in my area. I didn't really like them anyway, as their thinking was too black-and-white, too matter of fact, too in my face, made to feel like I was some kind of idiot. I went to them initially because I needed his ok to start hrt (at the request of an old school endo, still stuck in the 50s). I realise now that I don't actually have to jump through all those hoops, so things are much better now. 
damn. you'd think someone who has supposedly studied gender that much would understand people not wanting to be a part of it lmao"	7ep1f7	NonBinary	36	0.94	2017-11-22 07:04:34

my mom deadnamed me on purpose	I don't know what it is about parents and feeling like name changes are like the biggest dig to then as a person. i guess I understand why she would be hurt but I put myself in a very vulnerable position telling her I want to change my name and she got mad and made it about herself. now I have to live with the fact that she'll never see me how I wish her to see me and her love for me in merely conditional at best. this really sucks tbh.	"Personally, I do think it is about love. For instance, I asked my wife to use they/them pronouns and a different name for me before I came out to everyone else. So she would use they/them in the house and she/her in public. She NEVER mixed it up. Legit, I’ve been out to her for two years and she’s misgendered me twice. I’m 100% certain that if you make a concerted effort not to misgender someone, you won’t. It’s a choice. How much effort is someone willing to put in to respect you and make you feel loved?

It sucks, and I’m really sorry. You’ve got to draw boundaries with her for the sake of your mental health. IE, “if you keep calling me by my deadname, I will leave the conversation.” And if that’s not enough you draw a stricter boundary, “I’m not talking to you until you can call me by the appropriate name.”
My mother is the same way.   Going on 3 years.  Getting ready to start demanding the use of my legal name.
A birth-name is a gift. If that gift no longer serves you, fits you or brings you joy, it is okay to discard it. The gift-giver should take responsibility for their own ego and consider if they would rather you were happy and living authentically or if they prefer that you suppress your happiness to keep them comfortable.
Whatever they decide is beyond anyones control but theirs. 
Fundamentally, no matter how difficult they find it to adjust, you are living your life for you - not for anyone else.
Don't think it has to do with her love for you

It's hard for parents when their kids start changing because it's not something they're familiar with and how they raised you

An example is my facial piercings were an adjustment for my parents because it changes what's been familiar the whole time they had me
I feel like I'll be able to do those boundaries once I'm able to move out but I still live with my mom and that's a hard thing to do. I might just shut down on her and leave it strictly to business only just until I can get out.
I just woke up so ngl you had me in that first half lol. but yeah since I posted this I've been rolling with it. despite everything I've come to terms with that of she refuses to acknowledge this part of me she's going to lose me when I move out. but that's bc of her actions not mine.
I wrote this post in a fit of emotions, but my mom refuses to use they/them pronouns, and has a history of abusing me emotionally so like. I wanna believe it's not bc her live is conditional but the way she acted before all this tracks with her behavior now so. yeah.
I’m so sorry, that’s a shitty situation to be stuck in. Reach out if you need support 🤍
I can understand that. Now I have more context
yeah sorry about that haha. there are times she's been supportive but there are times where she's just straight up rude and transphobic (she doesn't like being called cis. she thinks it's offensive). she has untreated narcissism and I already have BPD so the mix isn't healthy what so ever. it's too the point where my dad - a 21 year retired Marine - has more respect and love for what I'm doing for myself then my mom. but idk if that even matters at this point"	wf3bxr	NonBinary	36	0.95	2022-08-03 10:45:43

This post just made my day and I agree that enby people are just that good-looking.
Relatable, especially as someone who is part of a lot of NSFW subreddits lol.
Meanwhile I'm just feeling like shit as a very bad looking and very masc (unfortunately) enby...

My friends putting up with me changing between a boy and girl almost daily	I just love my friends for putting up with me constantly correcting them when my pronouns and gender change. It's daily, sometimes twice or three times in a day, and they never get frustrated or mad at me. Some of them even thank me for correcting them. I'm so glad I have such a loving group of friends. Just wanted to share my love 💕	"Honestly it can mean so much to people when you do that. When I first met my girlfriend, she was genderfluid and would switch between he, she and they almost daily. I’d make a point to message her every morning to tell her good morning and to ask what her pronouns for the day were, and would make sure to use those and help let others know, too. It was a simple thing that became routine to me (this was before I’d realized I was transmasc, so at the time I was just an ally) and it made a huge difference in making her feel valid and accepted. Sometimes something as simple as using the correct pronouns or gendering someone correctly can mean the world to them.
that’s awesome!! i’m glad you have such a good support system <3"	p8v0vg	NonBinary	37	0.96	2021-08-21 16:59:35

not my sister supporting Ms Rowling, UGHH.	"so..my sister is going to buy Hogwarts legacy. yaayyy/s

So. My big sister(18) is an avid fan of Harry Potter, so she had tons of merch and stuff. That has never sat right with me, because Rowling has flat out said that every penny she gets proves that people have the same beliefs as her/support it. 

So, obviously she has been waiting for HL for a very long time, and I've gotten sick of it. BECAUSE I'M LITERALLY ENBY?! when I calmly told her(1st time) she just went: ""*I won't fall for your guilt tripping*""

I tried telling her that Rowling is A NEO NAZI (she hasn't flat out said it yet, but the whole plot of HL?! do I really need to explain this!?) And she is still holding on.

I understand that this Franchise has helped her through hard times, but this is unacceptable.. She says she accepts me as enby, but she keeps misgendering me. And her caring more about a game that is made by a woman that hates my very existence feels like a slap on the face. 

So I snapped at her, sending tons of screenshots from twt about HL and she basically said(paraphrasing, can't screenshot because it's on Snapchat) ""*it's just a game dear.*""

It's not.

It's fucking not.

How should I tell her this? Will she get mad at me? I think she already is tbh.."	"
There might not be ethical consumption under capitalism, but there is absolutely abominable consumption.

It's a common misconception that any interaction with the most intentionally oppressive or actively harmful & hateful companies/producers (which Rowling is, full stop) is negated or unavoidable 'because capitalism'. 

There's a difference between needing to buy food to eat, and giving money to a corp that funds ""conversion therapy camps"" or lobbies for anti-queer legislation (as Rowling does, VERY effectively I might add). That's bad, mkay? *Don't fund your oppressors.* Pirate anything of JKR's you think might be of value... and then ask yourself what value you find in her inherently bigoted narratives. 

The weakness of buying from our abusers is a bad thing. *They have nothing to offer that you need* and cannot find from another source.

In the case of Rowling, the content we're buying is literally the same content that oppresses us. It's not a matter of wanting a good game or story from someone who happens to be terrible; it's the same canon that's full of the same stereotypes and prejudices her world is based upon. 

Hand-waving it off as ""oh let people enjoy things"" forgets that it's totally possible to find a fiction franchise that isn't fundamentally the most racist and bigoted shit to come out of the late 90s. It ignores the question of, *wait, why exactly is this bigoted bullshit something you find enjoyable*?! It ignores that there's even a way to interact with such things that don't put dollars in the pocket of the richest shitbeast ever to buy a castle and then whine that people knew her address (by which I mean piracy or transformative fandom or the million-and-one ""Magic School"" narratives that AREN'T racist or sexist or transphobic as fuck).

""Oh but I have to!"" is no excuse, because Sis really, really doesn't, and neither does anyone else. I'm so tired of seeing that as a smokescreen when what people really mean is simply ""I want to keep my access to this thing more than I care about the harm it/its seller is doing.""  

That's all anyone means when they tell you they'll support Rowling financially: **they want her product more than they care about the damage it does**. Whether or not the buyer is in denial about the harm it does (which is common enough that it's even trickling in here, where Rowling apologism does not belong), or are just as bigoted as Rowling is and are rooting for her to succeed in her efforts -  none of that actually matters when the money directly goes to prop up anti-trans legislation.
You said your sister is misgendering you -- maybe if she respected you more, you wouldn't be as outraged over her interests. But the fact that she treats her nb sibling with disrespect AND also proudly consumes fascist propaganda would similarly anger me.

I would talk to her about how misgendering you makes you feel, and that you would like her to try harder to use your pronouns.

You may not be able to change her mind about her interests, but that doesn't mean your viewpoint isnt valid.
I think I understand your feelings. When I’m passionate about something I really want my family and friends to agree with me. 

But you can push too hard and go to far. I’ve found I’ve done that and I don’t get the results I want. Rather the other person may dig in deeper and I end up even further away from convincing them than before. 

My best advice for this kind of thing is to try to come up with a succinct strong short argument. Let the person know how you feel about the subject and how it affects you. Then once that is delivered they will have to decide for themselves. I think it’s ok to periodically revisit the topic maybe after months of time have passed but otherwise you just got to let it go otherwise it won’t turn out well. 

If you stir Tom Riddle’s name around it doesn’t spell Voldemort is spells JK Rowling!  I really liked the books when they came out. Harry and Ron were literally turned into girls in one of the books. People can transform into animals!
So it’s quite a twist the author now spends so much time and money going after trans people.
You don't own her. She's a fully autonomous being who is separate from you. She has the right to spend her own money on what she chooses, it's not like *you* actively supported the project so your personal boycott still stands.

Tell her straight up about the misgendering and how that's hurtful. 

But she's not into Harry Potter because the author is a cunt.
I'm sorry you have to deal with this but keep in mind that your sister isn't doing this to spite you or because she agrees with rowling.  Be angry at the author and the book series but not your sis.  Just because she consumes HP media doesn't mean she hates your existence and while it could be seen that by her purchasing merch is indirectly supporting transphobia and shit, that's probably not what your sister thinks when she buys merchandise.
There are many things I boycott for similar/same reasons:  Hobby Lobby, Chik-Fil-a, JK Rowling, etc.  

They are against my views and my identity.  However, I know many people who LOVE Chik-Fil-A, or Rowling's work.  They are allowed to enjoy what they enjoy.  Hell, the ESA kitty I adopted was named Harry Potter.  First thing I did when I brought him home was to change his name (he's now Felix).

I understand your argument, but you are a bit caustic with your sister. People will have differences.  Sometimes they will like things that are harmful to you.  But it boils down to respect.  Let her know that you cannot support HP and JKR for reasons stated and then try to understand that this is her 'safety tool'.  It supported her.  She has her reasons for wanting the game.  

As for her misgendering you, that's another argument entirely.
I recommend focusing on how she treats you and drop the fight over the game for a while. But you should not accept mis-gendering.
Her misgendering you is definitely a conversation you need to have but besides that no matter how shit of a person Rowling is, just because your older sister bought a hp game doesn’t mean she’s invalidating your existence. Warner brothers has the rights to it anyways and Rowling is already a millionaire. How she spends any of her profits from hp is her choice and on her. It is just a game. Unless your sis enjoys any of its problematic subtext it may have there is literally no reason to make this much a fuss over it. It seems like you care more about boycotting Rowling than your relationship with your sister tbh.
She's basically telling you she supports you while pissing on your head and calling you a baby for complaining about being wet. Fuck her. I'm really sorry you are having deal with that. And I'm really sorry how many people are dismissing her actions as ""she can like what she wants."" There is sooooome nuance to the ""supporting HP"" debate, but it's an undeniable fact that JKR is a bigot and uses her money and influence to actively harm trans people.
All im gonna say is that people can like something without supporting the person who made it, for example, chik-fil-a is friggin bomb but the people behind it suck
To be fair, I have a hard time not buying some HP things (I still go to the studuo tour in Leavesden for example) and I'm obviously nonbinary... It's not as simple as just straight up not consuming these things. Don't get me wrong, I'm trying to work through it and tell myself not to but Harry Potter means the WORLD to me, the studio Tour is my safe space and I've grown up with these books which have quite literally saved my life so it's hard man 😭

So the two- buying the merch and her support for you- may not correlate. I mean, it sounds like she's being quite mean, so maybe start from how she's directly treating YOU and then address where she spends her money.
Honestly, I won't stand for this.

And I'm saying this outright, because I've seen too many trans folks bashed into the ground because they loved Harry Potter.

Noone has the right to tell people what they are allowed to love, and noone has the righ to make people feel bad because of what they love.

I grew up with the hp universe, and it's not because of what the author said that I'm immediately going to stop loving it. If someone is really thinking that just because hp then we're supporting her anti trans bullshit, that's their problem not mine. I'm allowed to live the way I want, and if that includes hp then so be it. I won't stand for someone trying to boss everyone around, just because of one thing the author said, simply because I'm able to make the distinction between what I think, which is that I don't care for the transphobic bullshit she might have spewed and continues spewing, and her honestly complete crap argument that if you buy her work, that means you entirely support her as a person, including this transphobic crap.

I left the lgbtq+ sub exactly because of that kind of crap being spewed every other day or so, including one person who outright left her fiance because they saw Harry Potter books in his library. But the worst was the community literally driving away someone who was having great fun making hp related things by hand including wands, and shaming them for it until they had enough and left.

So, I will most definitely not stand for this guilt tripping, be it directed at me or at anyone else.
If it's 'just a game' she can disregard and not play it. Same argument when gay marriage came in and since civil partnerships existed, homophobes said gay people shouldn't care because marriage is just a word but if it's just a word why should they care if others get to use it?
It's not a very good game, countless developers, as I'm sure you're aware, have said how basic at best the gameplay is. 
 Tell her to buy a different game that hopefully doesn't have an awful jewish stereotype as the antagonist
I think you have every right to be upset. You told her how you felt and she decided to ignore you and give money to a nazi that wants trans people dead. Now you know where her priorities stand but there’s nothing you can do about it unfortunately. You have to let her be but now you know her true colors.
The game is also antisemitic as hell, the whole thing is just problematic all around

There’s no “separating the art from the artist” when the author is alive, profiting and using the money to finance anti-trans/anti-lgbt politicians and organizations and spreading violent anti trans rethoric on her platform. Trans people die because of shit like this
I really dont get how people separate the art from the artist so much! Doesnt make much sense in my head, once a discover the artist is an ass I start disliking all their art automatically.

But you know, MOST people seen to do that... so I try not to worry too much about it, have other priorities to disturb me.

But hey, I feel you, my big sister has the exact same thing with hp series, I know it can be frustrating, but let her have her cringe likes and dislikes, nobody is perfect. The most important is if she is around you to support you through life.
I came here to say this is way less nice words!! Obviously you both are young (the fact that she's your \*big\* sister, and she's 18), but if that was a value of hers, she would put that above buying a game. My fiance loves HP, for no other reason than the story and world, nothing about the author. So when I wanted to buy him something HP themed, I found a local crafter to make me something, as opposed to buying something commercial. JKR doesnt get any $, and my fiance still gets something cool for the franchise he loves. 

At the end of the day, soon enough she will be out of the house, and hopefully you will too. She is going to have those values and beliefs, knowing that you are sensitive enough to make logical choices about what you choose to consume means you will have some better karmatic energy than her!
Mhm! That is why I mentioned that in my rant. The ironic thing is she has no problem with saying the right pronouns on my genderqueer friends, but if it isn't my friends (aka me or a trans influencer) she keeps misgendering them. Especially transfem people.. yeah that doesn't sit right with me.
This!
for sure.  i am enby and unfortunately still OBSESSED with harry potter and have been my whole life, probably always will be. luckily- a lot of the actors in the movies are really good trans allies and super supportive even tho jk isn't!

I'm sorry she keeps misgendering you tho, that is something I would have a conversation about with her.  But if the game brings her comfort, that doesn't necessarily mean she agrees with jk rowling.
This 👆🏽
Definitely be mad at the people who fund abusive organizations. Giving money to Rowling = funding anti-trans legislation. She's very transparent about how much of her money she donates to TERF lobby groups.
I agree the misgendering isn’t on but my point still stands
It's a common misconception that any interaction with the most intentionally oppressive or actively harmful & hateful companies/producers is negated or unavoidable because capitalism. There might not be ethical consumption under capitalism, but there is absolutely **abominable** consumption.

There's a difference between needing to buy food to eat, and giving money to a corp that funds ""conversion therapy camps"" or lobbies for anti-queer legislation (as Rowling does, VERY effectively I might add). That's bad, mkay? *Don't fund your oppressors.*  Pirate anything of JKR's you think might be of value, or learn to cook a picklebrine cutlet yourself. 

The weakness of buying from our abusers is a bad thing. *They have nothing to offer that you need* and cannot find from another source.

 In the case of Rowling, the content we're buying is literally the same content that oppresses us. It's not a ""tasty"" sandwich from a bigot; it's a shit sandwich from a bigot full of the same stereotypes and prejudices her world is based upon. Hand-waving it off as ""oh let people enjoy what they enjoy"" forgets that it's totally possible to make a good sandwich yourself or find a fiction franchise that isn't fundamentally the most racist and bigoted shit to come out of the late 90s.

tl;dr: ""Oh but you have to!"" is no excuse, because you really, really don't. I'm so tired of seeing that as a smokescreen when what people really mean is simply ""I want to keep my access to this thing more than I care about the harm its seller is doing.""
Thank you. I mean I can see why it gets seen as me being overbearing, or controlling even. But this happens to revolve around our very existence. The ironic thing is, my sister and I are POC, Muslims at that!(I'm an atheist but ehhh details) and JKR kinda hates POC people -
...shit. oke, like I said before, I obviously don't like Rowling. But harassing people who waste tons of hours of work!? 

Look I wrote this in a fit of rage. Yes I still think my sister shouldn't buy it, but harassing others for their passion?
Because they're selfish and they want the product more than they care about the harm its narrative does, or the harm its profits enable the creator to do. In the case of Rowling, where the bigotry is baked into every aspect of her storytelling, and where every penny she gets she proudly proclaims to be support of her TERF ideas, both are harmful.
You worded that better then i could! Thank you!

But yeah I’m nonbinary and hp was a huge thing to me growing up and while I’m not the most avid fan anymore I’ve been waiting for a game like this for so long!!! Im excited about it and life has a tendency to kind suck between work and etc so having something to be excited about in a fan genre is awesome!!
Im going to buy the game. Ill feel guilty about it sure. In the grand scheme of things and if the world was a perfect place i wouldn’t. I can make excuses about all the not hateful people who have put a ton of work into the game but yeah it still also supports someone i know is a terrible person with a lot of money. 


Also sis misgendering you is a different situation all together. If she says she supports you but also misgenders you and it isn’t just a ‘slip up once and a while’ then that isn’t real support. Hell I’ve had slip ups now and again but its just that and then i make a renewed effort to do it correctly and not make the mistake again."	10vkoq9	NonBinary	36	0.69	2023-02-06 22:45:08

Cis people pretending to be trans*	"So I was at work tonight and I wanted to go to the bathroom. I see that the women's bathroom is occupied (one toilet per bathroom, I associate more with my feminine side than masculine so if there's no gender non conforming bathroom I go to the women's bathroom). So I wait and one of male coworkers leaves the bathroom, I was a little shocked because I wasn't expecting him to come out of there. He said ""oh I'm non binary"". This made me so happy, and I told him ""oh yo same!!!"" And then after a few seconds I asked him ""really?"", He said ""no I'm not but I'm glad you are!"". That made me feel like I was lied to and like I was violated in a way? 

I'm not out to many people because I fear they won't take me seriously and my mom is extremely homophobic so this made me feel really mad. I came out to this cis man who pretended to be non binary for a moment. And what's worse is that he is gay so does that make him feel like he has more of a pass for this than people who are straight? Ugh. Like what do cis people get out of pretending to be trans*?"	"Someone I work with insists that he is non-binary and that he can 'identify however he wants', which is true....but I know he's doing it to make a joke out of me and everyone I work with agrees.
Ugh oh my gosh, sorry that happened to you. That has happened to me, but with the word gay. I was like hey same, and he was just like uhhHhHh.,.,..,
Since they're single occupancy, he was probably embarrassed to be ""caught"" coming out of the women's and made a ""joke"" as an excuse. If he seems like a generally a decent person (i.e. if he seemed sincere about being happy you told him about yourself) this could be an opportunity to educate. But only if you feel that there could be benefit to it.
Reminds me of my first time attempting to come out to my mom. I was trying to explain to her I wasn't a girl and whatnot...Very poorly.

To which she responded ""Yeah, me, too. I think we should break gender roles."" And I was like ok, that doesn't sound bad?

So then I tried to explain the dysphoria aspect and...Well...She told me there was something wrong with me and no ""woman"" should feel like that and that my cousin had schizophrenia so that's probably what I have, too...

That was terrible.
Maybe he's an egg.
My sister pretends to be a trans ally. She makes money selling feminizing drugs and promoting trans issues. However, my sister calls me homophobic slurs at home and sexually abused me when she was a teen. I want to report her but no one would believe and she’s a financially successful mother. Also, if people found out. About my identity I wouldn’t be safe.
God, what an asshole. I'm sorry you have to work with him
When people do shit like that, I like to over-cater to them. I ask about all sorts of details about what makes them uncomfortable being treated as a cis person, pronouns, social dysphoria, dysmorphia, the whole bit. If you make a big deal out of it and are overly sincere, it can make them think a bit, or at least annoy them back. It’s kind of like saying “identifying as a gender actually means something you douchebag”. This game is especially fun to play with attack helicopters... poor dears, they just want to fly...
Why do people do that? I don't get it. Do they enjoy mocking LGBTQ folks or is it that they just don't use their brain at all to overthink their actions?
Oh yeah I started with ""What pronouns do you use? Shall I use they/them for you"" and I then had to explain using they/them in the singular and then he laughed and said ""Yeah sure do that haha"". So infuriating."	ecnn2c	NonBinary	34	0.93	2019-12-19 03:46:58

RANT: My mom keeps forcing femininity on me	"I'm not out to my mom (bc she will obv disown me if I do) and she's just always forcing me to be feminine. Everything that makes me happy and euphoric makes her mad. When I cut my hair she mocked me and when I shaved my head she didn't talk to me for for two whole months. She's always been after me to lose weight cuz ""girls shouldn't be fat"". She keeps implying that there's something wrong with me for being bigger in size. Even when I've constantly insisted that my health and my vitals are all good. She shames me for eating at all. Like always making comments about how much I eat. And I've honestly been working out in secret since the beginning of this year when my therapist recommended it for anxiety. She doesn't like my makeup and says I do too much and look like a ghost and I'm just so sick of her not accepting me even when I haven't told her I'm non binary. It just sucks so much I hate it and I hate her.

PS: not looking for advice just wanted to rant and get some validation maybe?"	"Gosh she sounds like such an abusive person. I hope you can get out of there soon ♥️
Yeah she sounds terrible. Sorry you have to deal with that. There is nothing wrong with you. 
You don't have to be anymore or less feminine then you want to be.
I’m so sorry. That’s horrible. I’ve seen a lot of people fall into eating disorders due to their parents focus on their weight."	owefrb	NonBinary	30	0.96	2021-08-02 13:23:56
Wouldn’t it be great if we could petition for the use of epicene (gender-neutral) pronouns unless referencing someone who has specified their gender, WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT WAY TO DO IT ANYWAY🤦‍♀️😭😭😭😭😭	"For example, in this book I’m reading ‘When Love Meets Fear’ by David Richo (I am NOT knocking the book. I love this book.), there’s a line that says:

“I believe in myself as a man/woman who handles what comes his/her way”

Cool, this book was written in the 90’s, it was a while ago, I get it. But it was literally written with anyone in mind, and in instances where it is written for anyone in mind, gender is not relevant to it or even a factor into the purpose of the written thing, why do people get so stuck on this? ESPECIALLY when by doing it it’s now grammatically incorrect AND more of a schlep to read ANYWAY??? And hey presto, we’ve made another bit of information meant to benefit all innately exclusionary. Even if that’s not the intention. 

“I believe in myself as a person who handles what comes their way.” 

What’s with the use of unnecessary words, pronouns and punctuation? While true, this sentence in particular isn’t too long, if I had a sentence like this for every time I used epicene pronouns in my dissertation I would have had A TOME honestly. It can make a sentence disjointed and far less fluid, and I’ll tell you as a person with dyslexia it can become a really difficult read if every second sentence is “he/she goes to the shop and he/she buys the milk that his/her daughter/son needs for his/her breakfast”🫥🫠🆘

Then of course, while trying to understand this disjointed sentence you realise that you aren’t really relating to what it’s trying to say anyway because you don’t identify with what’s used. Because you identify as They and Them. 

I don’t know about you guys but when I was coming to terms with my identity I would find it really hard to read past that. Not because I was mad and offended, not even coz of the dyslexia (although that obvs does contribute), but because I would feel ashamed and unable to relate. In the midst of my confusion and unwarranted guilt that I was somehow being offensive and doing society a dirty (in the words of my ex: “WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME YOU FEEL LIKE A TREE?!” I should hope not, I’d get chopped down and used to make up for all the paper wasted on unnecessary, limiting pronouns and punctuation!😡😩😂) being constantly met with endless streams of HE/HER/SHE/HIM/HIS/HERS/DAUGHTER/SON/GIRL/BOY/MAN/WOMAN/MAN/WOMAN/MAN/WOMAN to my non-binary, dyslexic brain was immensely taxing.

And if THEY (wow, look at that) just used the grammatically correct epicene pronouns the sentence would make far more sense, wouldn’t be a schlep for people with learning disorders, AND wouldn’t be exclusionary to ANYONE because it is in itself innately inclusionary. The way it’s meant to be😌

WE ARE WASTING TIME, PAPER AND FEELINGS. 


P.s.
This book (When Love Meets Fear - David Richo) is really very good. It’s a self help book that deals with neurotic/unchecked/unhealthy fear, how to process it and find your genuine self underneath. I find it especially helpful for those of us who’ve been abused and experienced childhood trauma/ weren’t cared for adequately by our carers. It’s really taught me how to love, accept and mirror myself, reparent and rebuild my foundations, and identify what behaviours were conditioned into me by my abusers and what is actually me. And has made dealing with my phobias (agoraphobia is one of them) far easier to boot! My shadow is a much healthier homie now🥹

It has little To Do sections with visualisations and thought experiments, and yeah it’s just a really good book (just don’t mind the Ye Olde Fashioned way of writing sometimes😅). 

Love you All!💖"	"Our tendency to categorize things is a weird habit, not sure where it comes from, but I observed it while working for an artist making physical objects. People would come into the shop, and exclaim ""Rabbit!"" ""Batman!"" when they would get to the object they couldn't name, they would make something up depending on how the object looked.

I found this to be extremely annoying, but it is a behavior I have noticed that people tend to do with gender as well. ""A man!"" ""A boy!"" Or whatever they think that the person is. 

I can understand that this works in certain situations. The square shaped block goes in the square shaped hole. To remember what foods are safe. Etc. 

But when it comes to gender, it becomes problematic for the reasons you listed, and I think it *would* be better not to assume.
Who was the publisher? Most of the major publishers afaik back in the 90s still required his/her for someone of uncertain gender. Which—as you stated—was total bullshit, though I suppose a nice change from the previous ‘inclusive he.’ If it’s any help, a lot of them have switched now to using singular they for uncertain gender. I think… who’s the big romance publisher in the states? Harper impulse? I think they might still be on he/she since it doesn’t come up that often in fiction I guess. But idk. Most have switched now. Cause you’re right, it’s bs.
Singular ""they"" wasn't popularized until quite recently. The slash (man/woman, his/her) was actually pushed by feminists because before that the singular gender neutral pronoun was ""he."" It's annoying for the modern reader but if it was written in the mid 90s it makes sense that it wouldn't be using what we now consider gender neutral pronouns"	ybbe63	NonBinary	32	0.94	2022-10-23 07:39:21
my boyfriend found out i’m nonbinary	"well, he more realized on his own than found out haha. i was super nervous when he asked me if i’m a “they/them,” lol 💀. i asked if he was mad at me for not telling him and he said no, i asked if he still loved me and he said of course.

i’ve been wanting to come out to him for months but couldn’t bring myself to 😭💀 him realizing that through all my “joking” statements about not being a girl or a boy was amazing to me because he could’ve easily ignored it😭💀.

he now puts in effort to make sure to stick to using gender neutral terms for me. when i told him it’s fine if he misgenders me he said, “i know but i want to get better at it.” MELTED. he also told his friends because he doesn’t want them calling me a girl 🥺.

i’m really just sharing because i want y’all to know there will be people who love and accept you, and will validate you without a second thought:) love 🫶🏼💛🤍💜🖤🫶🏼"	"This is lovely, I’m so glad your bf is working hard to be supportive and help you feel safe and loved. My husband had a very similar response, too. Acceptance and love is out there. There are good souls out there. Stay strong, friends. 💗
I’m really happy for you!! My relationship of two years recently ended because I came out to my ex :// I’m very happy your story ended differently and I hope someday I can find a love like that 💛
Cool story. I'm curious, how does being NB influence your personal style?
i’m glad you had that experience as well!! lots of love 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼

Gotta love homophobic parents	"Today I was explaining to my very supportive 10 year old sister (ray) what me being non binary means, my mother overhead and got real mad saying I was ""giving ray ideas"" and need to keep that stuff to myself. Its not the first time I've gotten homophobic comments from my mother and it seems she can get her head around me being pansexual but non binary is ""too odd to be real"" apparently.

Just thought I'd have a lil rant about it and wanted some suggestions from my fellow lgbt beans about how I might get my mother to understand more

Much love :) *exits in rainbows*

(Also posted in r/lgbt)"	"Ask your mother if she loves you. If she says yes, then by default she must accept you for who you are and who you will become in time. Your gender choices hurt know one. If there is still intolerance towards you after this conversation you now know your being lied to when your told your loved by her. Btw most parents use their children as an extension of themselves,  they wrap it up in cute little phrases like "" thats not how we do it in this family"". Etc. Good luck. And I love you.💚💛
I have homophobic parents as well. It's been a big challenge to find ways to relate to them. They visited Colorado and actually stopped off to meet the Baker guy who refused to make a cake for a same sex wedding. Yep, they got a mug, went to lunch with the guy... it was a pretty hard blow. 

And you know what? They LOVE me! They love me so much and they're terrified I'm going to hell. Ugh it's rough. 

I've managed to figure out a working relationship with them over the years because they are my parents and that attachment never went away. I live half way across the country, I only return home on the fourth of July (no big holidays), I have a strong LET'S  CHANGE THE TOPIC move. I also stopped visiting for two years and had to skip a very meaningful funeral. It was really hard. 

Eventually you get to choose how you interact with your fam. Here's a few tips
1. Make reasonable expectations. I can call my mom and talk about chipmunks and the grandparents farm. I don't seek their approval.
2. Make healthy boundaries. My boundary is no holidays because they will have others around them who back up their bullshit and I'm not dealing with it. If they push my buttons too much I get to.. 
3. Take breaks whenever you need it. From a conversation, the room, them. This could look like structured interaction too. Oh, I have to talk with you? Ok, we talk about laundry and the weather. 
4. Get support and love from others. Don't rely on them for that. 

And hey! It's actually amazing that they're behind you being pan. That's a great start. It sounds like she does love you, and there might be something there to salvage. Take your time, take your space, make your tribe.
oml im so sorry bb! i have a homophobic stepdad and im too scared to say anything, but power through!
Thanks :) nice to finally find people who get it"	cvmbeg	NonBinary	29	0.91	2019-08-26 10:39:41
Shaved My legs for the first time	Having smooth legs feels really nice. I’m feeling very euphoric with it, cause I really like not having that much hair. Also, it took a while. I have mad respect for anyone that’s been doing that regularly. Like, It took up 75% of my shower.	"Congrats! Even as a transmasc myself, having freshly shaved legs does feel real good. If you plan to shave regularly, it won’t take you quite so long next time with less hair. And you’ll get faster with practice :)
Oooh I hope you got to do the sheet thing where you slide your fresh-shaved legs in between the bedsheets and wiggled them all around..! It’s the “skirt go spinny” of leg-shaving.
Welcome! There is not turning back now!
It does look and feel great, but is so much work!
I did, it felt amazing
Yessss I always make sure I line up shaving on clean sheets day, it’s the absolute best."	10ty9ah	NonBinary	31	0.96	2023-02-05 02:13:53

When you get misgendered in a strangely affirming way 🤔	"For context, I’m on low-dose T. Today, as I was picking up medication at the hospital, I accidentally cut in front of this older woman in line and she was like, “This young man stepped in front of me...excuse me, young man!” Internally, I was like, oh shit, I think they’re talking about me...I’m not a man tho...but I’m also not that mad about it??”

I have only passed as male maaaybe 2 other times in my life? I’m 5’3 with a petite frame so it’s kind of hard to look masculine. Today I happened to be wearing an oversized men’s button down with baggy Dickies. My hair was also freshly cut super short in the back & sides. I think the combo of outfit + hair + mask really helped me to pass. The nurse even called me “sir” LOL

I just wish T had kicked in and made my voice deeper cus I could only sustain the illusion for so long before the nurse started asking me questions and I had no choice but to speak 😂"	"it happens to me a lot.  it feels kinda nice lol
This happens to me at work a lot. Im amab, but I dress feminine and have really long hair. I get called mam several times a week. The euphoria is palpable
Any time I get gendered not the way I was ASAB is a beautiful day. Or when people get confused - I have succeeded!
Hooray for you! :D

I was ""young man""d by a random guy for the first time ever a few weeks ago and couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear for the rest of the day :D

I didn't even understand that I was the one being addressed but there was nobody else that he could have said it to, so I finally turned to him, got asked for a cigarette and when I answered ""sorry, I don't smoke"" he looked kinda confused bc my voice is decidedly not young-man-like at all but it was still my highlight of the week!"	m7dnw7	NonBinary	28	1.0	2021-03-17 23:27:18
Married with kids AFAB just discovering I might be non-binary.	"I'm having a ton of trouble sleeping right now as I had a conversation with a friend that basically led me to think I might be non-binary. I came out as bisexual in the past year after repressing it for years, but I think there may be more to it now. Sometime in high school and college is the earliest I can remember feeling that I felt more masculine some days. Maybe it had something to do with my first jobs being working on farms. I don't know. I like farm machinery and leather. \*shrug\* But I know sometime in college I started imagining myself with a penis occasionally, and it happened more often as I got older. It's like I wonder what it's like, but I don't really want one in the end I don't think? I'm just so confused.

On top of this, I'm not sure what to do about my husband. I haven't told him yet because I didn't really have a chance to tonight and even if I did, I'm afraid. I love him and I want to be with him, but I just don't know how he'll take it. He was okay with me coming out as bisexual as long as it didn't mean I wanted to leave him, but I'm not sure he'll understand non-binary as much. He's a very straight male, and generally tells me to do me, but this may rock his world and not in a good way. He's also going through a bit right now with work and the quarantine, and I'm afraid he's going to get mad at me and blame me for making his life even more complicated. We have 2 young kids on top of all this, so I'm really at a loss as to what to do. I have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday, and I know from previous conversations that she handles gender issues, but I just don't know what to do until then. I'm just scared and confused."	"i’m not a god at advice but here’s a little something. 

gender is confusing as hell, it’s so closely tied with our mind and our body at the same time that they get all tangled up with each other. it’s confusing to express yourself and it’s confusing to Be yourself. 
if you’re nonbinary than you’re nonbinary. of course it’s going to be different for your loved ones because maybe they weren’t expecting it or maybe they dont know much about it yet. but they love you. and since they love you they’ll work alongside you to help you be the best possible version of yourself that you can be. 
yes gender is confusing but it also opens a door to another level of understanding humans. of being able to represent to your children that they can be safe in expressing and experimenting with their own gender identity. 
it’s hella confusing and it’s hard to get the right answers because the “right answers” are unique to you. it sounds like your therapist would be a great person to talk to about coming out, explaining things and understanding yourself better. being able to communicate how youre feeling in your body and in your gender identity is the biggest step in solidifying your identity. 
and while it may seem like chaos right now because of this realization, it will calm down. and your gender won’t always be some scary abyss. 

i know i’m just a teenager. but from one enby to another, you’re gonna be alright. you have a spectacular community at your back rooting for you. and we’ll be here no matter what.
I just wanted to give a quick update. I talked with my husband this morning after getting a bit more sleep. He actually took it very well. His response was that he wishes he was in a position to support me more, but with everything in the world going on and the extra work stress that's lead him to update his resume, he's not certain he can be there emotionally for me as much as he wants. Which I totally get. It's why I have a therapist. He actually reminded me that we have some non-binary friends, so I contacted a few and one, in particular, has been insanely amazing. I'm at the point where I'm feeling a bit more excited about finding myself in all this. And a couple of other friends I've told have also been really understanding and will be there to support in any way they can. I'm feeling a lot better now than I did in the middle of the night, and I'm super happy that I've been met with so much support in this. <3
Heard! I discovered my nonbinariness at 34. Married to a cis het straight dude and we have a kid.

This non-binary gender thing is an unfoldment and it's okay that it's not totally clear right now. You've taken the huge step of telling yourself you are listening to all of you. Hooray for therapy next week! 

You've found a safe place here! There are a good handful of us AFAB enbys married to cis dudes with kids. It's a super hard time for us in particular to find community cuz this pandemic makes it HARD TO GET A DANG MINUTE JUST TO YOUR DANG SELF with the whole housebound-with-kid[s]-and-spouse thing. We're here and we're real! We exist!!
31 married AMAB here. I realized I wasn't strictly cis this December, and it took me at least a month and a half to figure out what that meant to me, and then work up the courage to come out to my wife. She's very open minded and accepting and loving, and also identifies as bi, so I was fairly confident she would accept me, but it's still difficult revealing something like that to someone when your lives are so entwined. (Sorry for that run-on sentence. Yikes.)

I'd say take your time, figure out how you feel about yourself, but make sure you tell him. Chances are he kind of already knows (everyone I've outted myself to has basically responded with ""oh...yeah that makes sense okay."" or, as my wife responded, ""yeeeah I already knew."" I didn't even know there was such a thing as nb-dar)

But as long as you keep this to yourself, that anxiety is going to exist in the background of your life everyday.

Sorry if this is poorly written, I'm trying to spit it all out before my break ends at work, lol. I'm here for ya though if you need to talk.
Thank you so much for your words and support. I didn't realize how much I needed to hear it from others.
I hear you on finding it hard to get a minute for yourself. Seriously, these kids are driving me insane! Thank you for your words and support though. This is definitely very confusing and figuring out where I fall in all this is going to take time.
Thank you for your words of wisdom. I actually talked to my husband this morning. I'm going to post an update shortly."	h83fwo	NonBinary	27	0.93	2020-06-13 08:13:58
Came out to wife	"So firstly i feel amazing, i finally feel like i have found who i am! 

Bit of backstory: A few months ago i had a discussion with my doctor because i was feeling depressed and down and had gender dysphoria around my chest area but nowhere else and felt like i was just existing. 

I had been having those feelings for a long long time but i wasn’t sure what to do as i’m married and i was torn between losing everything i have and living happily in body i could love.

I put the feelings to bed but then yesterday my wife and i had finally reached a point where we both knew something was bothering us, it ended up with us agreeing that we where being distant with each other to the point of feeling more like roommates than husband and wife.

After lying on the bed depressed i just sorta came out with it and said i’d talked to the doctor about gender dysphoria, obviously she was shocked and didn’t know what to do but after the initial shock she wanted to help me.

I told her everything that had been going on and my thoughts and feelings, things i had done including trying female hormones etc. the only thing she got mad about was the hormones as she said she felt i lied to her and they where her red line. 

We cried and chatted some more about what we could do to help and set some boundaries around certain things. 

Anyway we woke up today and she has just been the best, we had a lovely pamper day and she wanted to help me feel more feminine and help my dysphoria, she helped remove all my body hair (i think she secretly enjoyed the waxing part) and then she gave me a manicure and pedicure and painted my tor nails for me, i feel so comfortable in my skin now. We finally sat and discussed clothing and how she can help with certain things. 

Basically she is going to support me in every aspect she can but her red lines are no hormones as she doesn’t want me to grow breasts. I absolutely adore her and have so much love for her not just throwing our marriage away, i just wanted to post somewhere how lucky and free i finally feel!

TL:DR Came out to wife, she supported me and made me feel amazing!"	"Why would SHE not want you to have boobs or get hormone therapy tho? It's your body???
Good for you for taking that step. And I'm glad she's supportive. 

I have a red line for myself which is that I won't do anything that's not reversible. (It took me a long time to even get a tattoo).  I'd never do hormones or surgery or anything like that. So I can understand her view on that. But growing my hair, painting my nails, stuff like that makes me happy.

Of course others will have different perspectives on the above, but that's just my two cents. 

Remember, it's a journey, not a destination. See where it takes you and be thankful you have a supportive partner.
I’m not sure, i guess that is a step too far for her at the minute, as much as i’d love too it would cause me some issues with work etc as well, maybe in time i can revisit it with her but i’ll take my small victory tbh
I believe because she is straight. Although she feels happy that OP feels more comfortable and she wants to be supportive, she may not be totally comfortable being in a queer relationship. Just a guess, I don’t know them.
Holy shit, are you completely detached from reality? It’s a fucking spouse. I wouldn’t want my wife to have a dick or lose her breasts. I fell in love with her physically just as much as emotionally. I don’t want to lose that part of her, and that’s a COMPLETELY expected and reasonable way to feel.
That's fair, I hope you're happy :)
Yes i think this is her reason, it’s a lot for her to come to terms with right now, i guess in future she may be more comfortable, question is what will i do if in future if i am still really uncomfortable about my chest and she still doesn’t want me to use hormones?
I feel amazing right now, i want to ride the high as long as i can :)
That’s tough. I think open and honest communication between the two of you is all you can really control right now. Stay positive and know that when you reach that point you will have a community here that can help you get through it."	xkh4k4	NonBinary	25	0.91	2022-09-21 21:09:42
unsupportive parent revenge	"i don’t know where to talk about this so i choose here. hopefully you folks have a giggle. 


alright alright. i’m non binary, and specifically gender queer. my pronouns are they/them. i am AFAB. i’ve had this suspicion since i was super young, but only within the last year have started coming out to my closest friends. i knew my mom wasn’t going to want to hear it, so i never told her and sucked it up. 


five or six days ago, my mom and step dad started laughing about how LGBT+ is getting so complicated. they were referring to LGBTQIA2S+ specifically, and asked me what each letter meant. then they started asking “isn’t queer a slur?” and i said “yes it is. don’t say it, it’s not a word for you”. they then asked me why i was allowed to say it. and i said “because i’m queer. actually- im double queer. i like all sex organs and i’m gender queer.” they started asking me what gender queer was. 


i explained to them that i identified with they/them pronouns, and that i was their kid / step-kid rather than their daughter / step-daughter. they started laughing hysterically, and insisted that gender queer wasn’t a thing. i explained to them that i’ve actually had relatively serious reactions to being misgendered and pointed out that a couple days ago i left work because every customer i served in an hour called me ma’am. 


my mom said “people have slipped up and called me sir. it doesn’t bother me.” and my step dad nodded along. so, since then, i’ve been calling them anything that isn’t their pronouns. mom has turned into sister with he/him pronouns and step dad has turned into mother with she/her pronouns. you wouldn’t believe this, but they got pretty mad about it pretty quick. crazy how people don’t like being misgendered. 


i work with my mom sometimes, and obviously kept this shenanigan up at work. she told our manager, and he gave me a long talk about how it’s rude to call people things they don’t want to be called (while calling me a “smart girl”.. talk about irony). essentially, i told him to get fucked. i already had my two weeks notice in so i figured i didn’t have much to lose. 


my parents are still refusing to use my pronouns, and i’m gonna go change my name in a few months just to double piss them off."	"Well played.

Am I not non-binary… I feel non-binary but I don’t because I like pink and cute stuff		"You can be nonbinary and wear cute stuff! I wear skirts n leggings all the time.
Gender expression doesnt have to be the same as the gender you identify as!! I use he/they pronouns,,  but I love pink things and wearing pretty dresses! Any way you feel and present is 100% valid 🥰💛
U maybe gender fluid it falls under non binary. U look cute btw
I identify as gendfluid non-binary honestly but I switch between a lot of non-binary genders. Tho I do go in the binary a bit

Surprise Ally	"So I came out as enby (AFAB) a few months ago at work. Everyone was nice and supportive and even asked my pronouns. At the time, I was still really confused on everything, so I told them to use whatever ""he/she/they"". Fast forward to now, and everyone still calls me ""she"" EXCEPT the one person I was worried would react badly. She's your stereotypical southern girl, the guns and trump type. But shockingly, she's started referring to me as he/him lately and messaged me privately asking if that was ok and if I got mad when they used she/her. Told her it's fine, and I really appreciate her trying to make me feel comfortable. Idk, it just makes me really happy to have someone respect me like that. 😻"	It’s always nice when that one person you think isn’t going to be accepting tries their absolute hardest to be accepting.	puokfo	NonBinary	27	0.97	2021-09-24 17:30:09

Just getting this off my chest	"Hi there, 28 they them pronouns here. 

My boss and I were discussing correcting coworkers about my pronouns and she said something that made me kind of uncomfortable. She said that maybe the reason why some people may have problems using my pronouns because they feel as though they're calling me an it. At the time I was kind of mortified so I just kind of nodded or something but I'm mad that I didn't say anything now. 

One of my friends at work whom I really love otherwise was having a hard time remembering in particular. I had a brief one on one conversation in which I explained I wasn't mad but please could she use my pronouns correctly. She apologized and agreed to try to remember. Then later on in the week we had this awkward conversation about my recent job switch to a less public facing position. I was explaining that part of the reason I took the job was because being misgendered over the phone all day was effecting my mental health. she was like..."" You know this is a problem you're going to have your whole life, right?"" And was talking about how I couldn't be hurt by things like that and how she wish she could learn more sensitivity from me and I could take on some of her toughness. 

My coworker is a POC and I know she meant all of this kindly and from a place of solidarity of people who share minority status. My boss was probably just trying to help by explaining a reason why people find using my pronouns difficult. intellectually I can acknowledge this. But it really gets tiring when people keep telling you that you aren't allowed to be upset about something that is genuinely distressing. 

They them pronouns aren't even that hard. I'm not trying to tell people they're bad only to be more mindful that our perceptions of someones gender expression don't always match their identity. I'm growing frustrated with people telling me to be patient when what I'm asking isn't the world...only a tiny effort. 

I feel stupid and embarrassed and sad. "	"That really sucks, but yeah, a lot of that is why I just tell ppl I'm pronoun indifferent, because even though it bothers me to be she'd all the time, it'd bother me more to be also be reminded each time that they aren't respecting who I am. If I don't tell them they can't disappoint me, right? *sighs through space-time*

That said I think it's awesome that you are confronting that, it shows a lot of strength that I hope to build up to one day. And I hope your co-worker and boss get with the program soon, and in the mean time take care of yourself
You shouldn't be made to feel stupid for expressing who you are.

I've started wearing a they/them pronoun pin ([this one](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/2602/products/EnamelPins__0002_TheyPronounPin_1024x1024.jpg?v=1480617905), from Autostraddle), which is small and looks unobtrusive and classy but is still visible enough to be a subtle reminder. So far it's doing a good job. 

Good luck with your coworkers! They/them is *definitely* not like ""it"" and should be quite easy to implement in an English language context. They'd use the same words if they didn't know a person's gender, right?
I am not your coworker, or your boss, but I want to apologize on behalf of people like myself who are fairly new to learning about the gender spectrum. (I've only recently been questioning my gender and learning more)  I have ADD and a terrible memory and I have trouble remembering people's names, so pronouns are (for me) another thing to struggle to remember.  I've been watching some non-binary youtubers recently and although I 100% want to be respectful about what language I use around people it still feels awkward for me sometimes.  I joined the transcord this morning and reading the rules terrified me, because I'm so scared that anything I say might be offensive to someone.

Anywho, the point is that I want to apologize again for people like myself who struggle with pronouns and proper language usage, not because we're being intentionally disrespectful, but sometimes it takes some getting used to.

I hope I came across clearly and not offensive in any way.  If I said something wrong, please let me know, and I will edit this.
I haven't made any steps concerning pronouns yet but I had a similar problem when I changed my name due to a history of abuse. Some people only remembered the new name when I started referring to them with a wrong name. :/
I came out to my friends a few weeks ago. I'm sharing a similar experience.

I go by they/them, however they're all getting used to using they/them. The other day a guy friend (Cis, white, possibly straight, however very understanding) And he got a tad bit upset that he didn't really have anything to call me (We have banters, and at times I'll call him ""boi"" and he'll respond ""girl"", except now I'm not a girl so lol)

And he means well but I suppose the change is very different? We use pronouns in a lot of our language. 

It hasn't really been the first time. I'll be called a she, or he, and people will go ""Oh shit I'm sorry""
Or they'll question why I go by They/Them. And it'd be easy for people to just take what I identify as for face value.

I don't want to tell you to be patient. Cause that basically sucks. But I can tell you that the first step is respect.

And from what I've read, they respect you, and your identity. But they're confused + insensitive, and your friend is kinda right, YOU know who you are no matter how you sound or look. Others might not. That doesn't give them an excuse to say what they say...but it does mean people aren't going to understand you from the get go.

You have every right to be upset, and if it causes a lot of issues for you, you have every right to tell everyone at your job about how you feel. Possibly explain your identity. You don't have to give personal information and all that shit, but it absolutely helps if people understand you enough to know why they need to adress you as they/them.

In activism you have to speak on why the way you're treated is important to you. People wont make a move, or understand, unless they see things from a different perspective.

Don't have to stand up and scream, but simply asking people to understand sometimes doesn't help them understand. Especially if they're willing to learn.

Be unapologetically you. And make sure people know what you are, and understand it. That's what stops the problem. 




What strikes me is their comments start out fine. ""I think people's misunderstanding of pronouns is making them invent weird reasons to not respect you."" Sounds fine. But what the boss SHOULD HAVE said next was, ""But don't worry -- I explained that it's totally not the case and reminded them that it gets easier the more they practice."" The boss laid the problem at your feet instead of being a boss. 

Same thing with your coworker. ""Wow. You must have to deal with that everywhere forever."" Yup. But follow up with, ""Now I see what a big difference it can make to have your coworkers, friends and family always use your correct pronouns and even correct others! I'll do my part."" But yeah, instead it sounds like, ""Your life sucks and you can't control it. Bye.""

I'm so sorry that so often advocating for ourselves actually opens us up to more traumatic discourse as people feel free to tell us their weird thoughts. You deserve better. 
I think you can always revisit the conversation with your boss. Tell her you wanted to circle back to the conversation about your pronouns now that you had a chance to think  about it further. 
My boyfriend (who is trans) tells me, always at the wrong times, that I'm gonna have to get thicker skin. It's frustrating. You're not wrong in your feelings about it. I hope things get better for you.
There are definitely days where I have to pick my battles and I don't have the energy to correct folks. Not saying people who are pronoun indifferent aren't valid because they are but for me the reason I came out was to be authentic as possible because not being that way was hurting me. They them is the only thing that feels right. Going full blast and damn the torpedos is not  for everyone though. It comes with it's grievances as you can see. Good luck to you in your transition, I send you courage and love that you can overcome any obstacles in your way. 

Thanks for the support. : )
Even just getting it right 25 percent of the time would make a world of difference to me because it means that people are attempting to remember/use my pronouns correctly. I get that it's scary but honestly, even catching yourself after you mispronoun and then using they/them is fine for me. 

Trans people aren't the pronouns police, I'm sure if you just try to catch your mistakes you'll do just fine."	a3jv76	NonBinary	25	0.95	2018-12-06 03:06:53

"What were your ""early signs"" you weren't cis that are laughable now?"	"For me one of them was when my buddy got top surgery and I was like ""hmm yeah I'd do that"" like casually get major surgery nbd might delete later. But ya know. I'm totally still cis. 

The other one was when I was in high school my friend group started a joke that I had a dick bigger than any of theirs (I hung out almost entirely with guys) bc of a comment a classmate made in a failed attempt to insult me. I super leaned into that like ""HELL YEAH IVE GOT A PENIS"" and it lead to me thinking ""hmm yeah I wish I was born with one of those. Not enough to get surgery but if it just showed up one day I wouldn't be mad"" Totally a cis girl tho. 100% no question."	"""I'm not a <slur> I'm a goth, I just like skirts and lace and makeup because I'm a goth. I'm not using goth as a cover for anything""

The late 90s were a wild time.
As a kid I was obsessed with the idea of being ""one of the boys"". I remember when I was 7 or 8 years old I went to the dentist and they let me pick out a sticker afterward. I found a big tie dye sticker that said ""Boys Rule!!!"" and I wore it very proudly the whole day. After that I stuck it to a shelf in my bedroom. I am 20 years old and that sticker is still in my childhood bedroom. I also clung very tightly to the label ""tomboy"" as a kid, and rejected traditionally girly things like princesses, pink, even having female friends.

I also (unironically, to my embarrassment) insisted throughout junior high and some of high school that I was *not like other girls*. Turns out that was because I wasn't a girl after all.
I stood to pee as a kid for awhile hated dresses, n conviently lost one earring all the time.  My gf asked looking at a pic of me as a kid""is dat yer brother"" lol I'm more surprised I'm not a trans man lol just nb oh n forgot I spotted short hair til my transphbic mom made me grow it out by force, n I did the whole bib overalls no shirt til I had tits then the smallest bikini that didn't feel like clothing I could lol
Had a dream where I woke up with a flat chest and was overjoyed. Was still at the point of doubting whether I was *really* trans.
This was back when the first Hobbit movie had come out, and it was still considered the shit. 
I used to go to Ren Fairs with my friends.
So, my best friend and I decided to go dressed up as Bilbo and Thorin Oakenshield. Since she is the size of an actual hobbit and allergic to sfx glue, I would be Thorin.

So, there I am, dressed as a royal dwarf, majestic beard and all, confusing the living daylights out of people about my gender. It felt amazing.

I never forgot that day and never stopped wanting to have a beard, but haha nope I'm totally a cis womanz! Haha...
Always wrote fan fiction with a self insert character that had the ol' ""a girl disguised as a boy"" trope 😂😂😂
As a kid tried to pee standing up. It got everywhere, dad was not happy lol. 

Moment where it all clicked was 20 years later when I got a typically masculine job doing prescribed burning (Australia) and I never wanted to take off my uniform. High vis shirts, work pants and boots, sweaty and covered in soot. Felt amazing.
In elementary school I actually prepared myself to tell my parents I wasn't a girl because I didn't fit into gender norms. Then in middle school I did the old ""lemme create my mansona lol"" and privately dressed in drag in high school, complete with mascara stubble. I ended up having a dysphoric meltdown on the bathroom floor pre shower because my legs didnt look feminine enough to me (I've always hated to shave). I even wrote a post that I kept up for a few days about how I didnt really identify with my assigned gender. All of this I always just swept back under the rug until last year. I was like ""I love and am SO PROUD to be a woman!!!"" Like, no? How confused.
I never played with girl toys, never befriended girls(like close friends), refused to wear girly things, cut my hair short in 7th grade, started wearing basketball shorts and plain T-shirts. I can see why now lol
Probably that I wanted to use power tools when I was single digits old.
i’ve always been confused by gender. my own and the concept in general
Constantly looking at women's clothing and saying, ooo i like that, not for me though, for OTHER women. Like, i could aesthetically like something, know that i would objectively look alright in it, but be disgusted at the idea of myself wearing it.
Found masculine presentation incredibly unpleasant, shopping for clothes and haircuts traumatic, literally wished to be a girl for a while (I was dense, ok?). Towards the end of it I was just doing all this performance because it was what I thought I was expected to do, not because it was me.
14 year old me. ""wonder what it's like to have boobs"" Makes home made breast forms, ""this is amazing, I love it! must be a fetish right? better not let anyone know about wanting to be a girl"".... 14 years later, ""well fuck, I've been a girl the whole time?""

Teenage me feeling super uncomfortable with typical masculine talk and disappointing girls who thought I'd be more aggressive/manly, was probably another sign. I also would fit right in with groups of girls probably more easily than I've ever done so with a group of guys.
I felt the last sentence. Like I’ve considered it but some things that would come with being a man I don’t want so being non-binary is good for me

My social media coming out	"I was misgendered a WHOLE lot at the NYE party I was at last week, and the next day I was overcome with a tidal wave of depression and dysphoria, felt really invalidated. Most of the folx at the party were well aware of my NB status, and were even misgendering me before anyone even really started drinking.

That made me real mad. So I tapped into Righteous Enby Fury™️, and came out on social media in spectacular dramatic flair.

In said post, I repeatedly said, ""repeated occurrences and I'm blocking people."" Esp re: transphobic or enby-phobic commentary or content. Or if people just plain don't respect my identity.

I capped it with, ""I'm Non-Binary, and I'm fucking Proud.""

It felt really good to just, blast it out like some sort of banger of a song with a massive subwoofer in my hypotheticalforthisanalogy car. Cause I was pissed that my friends had made me feel like that, and I will NOT be letting it happen again.

I get slipping up every now and then. I get that being drunk makes that easier. But, again, it started before alcohol had touched ANYONE'S lips.

But I did tell my followers and friends I'm not heartless, and I'll forgive genuine remorse, but I'm not playing about the phobic, toxic shit. If anyone, regardless of how close they are, simply refuses to accept my identity, I'm cutting them, blocking them, and never speaking to them, again.

Cause I won't be disrespected in this.

Sorry, I'm still feeling the Fury, and I'm full of Pride, and I wanted to share this with everyone here in case someone needs solidarity in their own struggles with their identity not being respected. You can live through me, vicariously. Be validated by my boldness."		elyvz1	NonBinary	25	0.96	2020-01-08 21:05:56
I tried coming out	I tried coming out to my twin and she told me I was weird I said that I was non binary, I go by they/them and she was like your gonna be one of those people me and my girlfriend think thats weird and I just shut up and left because shes supposed to be my biggest supporter and obviously not and I’m hurt I later told her that I don’t like my deadname and I want to go by jaime and she said you can call your cat that not yourself don’t change your name my family will go crazy if they found out that I was binding even tho I’ve been binding since 10th grade and I’m in college now but idk I’ve been going through it lately getting mad for no reason I guess its cuz I know i can’t be who I want to be around my own family and friends… idk I just felt like I needed to get this off of my chest ig	"I am so sorry that happened to you, Jaime. Even if your family isn't supportive, I'm sure everyone in this sub is. We love you, friend.
As a fellow non-binary person, Jaime, we as the collective love you and we are also proud of you, what you did took incredible amounts of courage so just remember, you are you and nobody can say otherwise. Have a great life Friend, I wish you many happy days!
Don't let your twin set your identity! You are valid, live your truth.
thank you 🥺
I find it all the more ridiculous that she has a girlfriend and still thinks she can patronise OP. Kinda fucked up imo. Don't worry, Jaime, people will accept you one day, just keep at it 😊.
Sadly marginalized people will still marginalize people.

OP, hopeful with time your sister will come around. It might take some time to process and think differently now that it hits closer to home. And if not, #@$% em you'll make a new family. A chosen family.

"""You're not a dude, right?"" (and other femby rantings)"	"Disclosure: AFAB, sapphic queer, generally chapstick-femme presenting/passing

I love football. I've always loved football. I wear a Patriots shirt every Sunday during the season. Today, I'm at a new bar, shooting shit, drinking Bloody Marys and having a good time. The guy next to me and I hit it off and we continue chatting sporadically throughout the game. He's impressed by my knowledge of football, invites me to his place to ""watch the next game"" and I accept. We go to his neighbor's, watch ball there, head back to his place to get more intimate and after I flip him after having me pinned, he asks... ""Wait... you're not a dude, right?""

I froze. I got off of him. I was in a state of shock I've never been in before. I'm proudly out as bi, but my gender is more of my own subject at the moment. The wave of hatred as ""you're femme presenting but know about sports so  you must be trans"" hurt. The "" you're a \~lady\~ but are obvs masc enough to be a ""man"" which makes this ""\~gay\~"" hurts. Being semi-clocked was the most painful, hurtful thing I could have imagined. This was **not** flattering. This **WAS** transphobic.

**MY GENDER IS MY GENDER**. THERE ARE MOMENTS I LOVE IT AND MOMENTS I HATE IT. But you, *cishet of all cishets*, don't get to make me feel like this. You see my masc (the few among many) and disown me for it because your own masculinity is so fragile. My femme means nothing and my femme means EVERYTHING. I am raging. I am hurting. I am mad. I am sad.  I am so fucking rattled that I don't know which way is up. But that being said: Fuck you, transphobic piece of shit. I was living my best life. My football team won. My jersey has never fit me because of my physical build. I AM STILL QUEER. 

My passion for football is not my gender. My lack of makeup is not my gender. My orientation is not my gender. IF YOU'RE INTO ME, THEN BE INTO ME. If I'm too ""one of the guys"" for you, don't bring me home. If I'm not high-femme babe enough for you, don't bring me home. But if you can have a good time with me for 3 hours, chill for a minute more, then freak out when you've got *a bad bitch who knows what's up* about to ride you like ANYTHING... YOU'RE GONE. 

This has never happened to me before. I've never felt it. Dysphoria rears its head but mainly is kept in check (and has very fortunately never happened in a sexual encounter...prior to this.). I'm bi. I'm queer. And suddenly, I'm (more than my usual dose of ) unsettled by dating cishet men. Today was hard. Tonight will be hard. And I am so very lost.

&#x200B;

My queer siblings are people I will always go to bat for, but in this moment I find myself benched, winded, and on the DL. If you've got a spare moment of love, I will hold it tightly."	"Feeling your pain radiating right through the screen.  Just got back from hanging with other trans folk and it is so healing.  I’m not feeling very articulate at the moment so I won’t try to do anything other than say you aren’t alone and I’m glad you came here and sought out community because that is the way forward.  Sending all the warmth I can muster.  Hope you can feel it.
You are a badass. Sending love, because you are awesome, and deserve better.
It will be OK. That is a really horrible thing for him to say. *hugs*
Felt this hard, sending all the love back doubly hard.

Also, “sapphic queer” is the perfect label, I’m stealing it. Much thanks! 💕
how was him checking that you aren’t a man before you had sex transphobic?

People disrespecting my identity in fights	"I am agender and prefer they/them pronouns, but he/him is also fine. I’m from Germany, so sadly I can’t really choose they/them as my prominent pronouns although I identify with them 100%.

Yesterday I had a rather rough discussion with a classmate on WhatsApp. I addressed myself with the male version (derjenige) and she straight up came back addressing me with the female version (die Einzige).
I don’t understand why people think it’s okay to just use the wrong pronouns for me. It happens especially when people are mad at me. They slip up with my dead name, my pronouns and all. It just feels like they still think of me as this other person and it feels like a secret weapon to use against me in a fight. They don’t even realize that they loose the entire argument by using that line.

But to be honest nobody in my life except for my partner really uses the right pronouns for me. They just avoid saying them to my face. I’m growing tired at knowing they all think of me as a girl still.
Y’all have some tips on how to deal with this?"	"No advice unfortunately but I know how you feel. Also German here. I also cringe when I‘m in male mode and I‘m still called by my female name and they call me 'she'. I don’t want to blame any people who you argue with but it seems to me that they either slip because they’re not fully accustomed to your new name and preferred pronouns so that they use it without thinking or they really want to hurt you and think they know how. If I were you I wouldn’t continue the fight the moment they begin to deadname your or use the wrong pronouns and tell them they can come back as soon as they are willing to respect your person.
These people are just making fools of themselves by using such low-hanging fruit in a fight. Really? Disrespecting someone's identity to prove you're the right one?? You're just proving how you're an asshole. Disregard those people. It is more important to them to win a fight and insult you then to come to an agreement, which is what arguing should be about.

I'm sorry this is happening to you tho. It stings to be constantly invalidated. It helps to find good people who respect you even if they don't like you.

At least this way around the person insulting you just proves they're an asshole. The first time a person very close to me used my new name, it was during an argument unrelated to me being non-binary. And that insult stung. It was directed and purposeful. And a bitch move"	z8kzgb	NonBinary	24	1.0	2022-11-30 07:30:35

Just gushing...	For a long time, I was constantly doubting myself. It was driving me mad in an indescribable way. I knew there was something different about me. I wasn't like the other girls, with their social media and hair braiding. I liked gaming, and found what boys were doing to be much more interesting. I came to this realization and was desperate to find an answer. I was searching everywhere, but nothing seemed right. I felt like when I found something that was similar, I forced myself to abide by the definition. It was like I was longing for an answer so badly, I would change myself to find it. I wanted a definition. Some say that they don't like labels, but it was the exact opposite. I wanted a label. Very badly. I kept on searching, everyday the doubt growing stronger. Finally, the magical term came on the screen.  I had never seen it before. I looked into it. This time, it was exactly what I was looking for. I doubted this label too, thinking it was just another one of me forcing myself. But, after a few days, I noticed it. Exactly what it described playing out in my own life. I was overcome with more than joy, it was pure bliss. Than it came to me. It may seem plain as day to some, but it was an amazing thing I realized. A label should fit me, not the other way around. I can't tell you how liberating that was. Instead of forcing myself to find the similarities, I was finding them pop up on their own. It was magical. It was an ethereal bliss. You have no reason to read this, but yet you are. Thank you, I had to get this of my shoulders.	"It's very nice to read stories like yours. I'm happy that you found a label that feels right. 

If you don't mind, what is this label that you like so much?
I really resonate with your story! I only found the NB label about a week ago. Before then I'd just decided I was a girl who didn't fit gender stereotypes, but it didn't 100% fit. I grew up playing video games and felt most at home in a group of guy friends. This label feels a bit more like home. As a result of my newfound confidence I'm finally chopping my hair short soon! Glad you're feeling happy friend <3
I relate to this as well (kind of). I thought I was a girly-ish girl, but when I started going by a gender neutral name and cut my hair, a lot of the depression I had before went away. When I tried on a button-down shirt it felt even better. That’s when I realized I didn’t feel as much like a “girl” anymore. It’s great that you figured out whatever label you are using!
Feels so good to find words that fit 😻
I resonate with your story too but from the other direction.   I think I was this originally before the term became common.   Then many years later like 20 or so.  I am reading about me in these labels.   I resonate with gender fluid and non-binary.

I grew up in an environment where reasons for why I was doing or the way I was were demanded of me.  Back then I didn’t have the label so I used the next closest thing and it was horrible and coming out as that had the opposite effect. 

So I welcome my non-binary gender fluid label because it is something I can point to and say I am this and this is why I am the way I am and need to do these things.
Wow! thank you all so much! This means a lot to me! <3

No one cares about bathrooms at my school and it's awesome	I just love how transphobes would hate my school. We don't live in a trans friendly country but our bathrooms are very far away from one another so a girls bathroom might be on a different floor than the boys and so on. No one wants to go to a different floor just to go to the bathroom (just stalls also) not even cis people. So we all go to the bathroom that's closest to our class. Which happens to be the boys. In a class of 31 girls, 2 boys and my nonbinary arse. And the teachers are so mad about it but can't do anything to stop us. But none of us care.	"Shoutout to my male philosophy teacher who went to the girls bathroom to get water when the boys bathroom just a few meters further across the hallway.
it was the same in my high school, because it used to be a boys' school before (blergh) so there was only one restroom per floor
Same case for my school. It was made in the 1800s. 

There's 2 restrooms on the ground floor but not on any other floor. And to acces the other one you have to go outside and then enter a different part of a building. Or go through the teacher's lounge which is a no-go.

My dad's old highschool was only for girls but that one is being renovated currently."	yy7ffn	NonBinary	21	0.97	2022-11-18 01:24:39
Is it weird to tell someone that they give you gender envy?	One of my friends gives me mad gender envy, and I was wondering if it would be weird to tell her. It’s not like I’m dying to tell her or anything, just wanted to make sure it wouldn’t be too weird if it came up in a conversation.	"it really depends on the person i think, i'd personally be uncomfortable if someone told me this but i'm also uncomfortable with the concept of being corporeal, so 😂
It'd depend on the person, but you could probably wrap it up in a compliment like, ""I love [x y z part of] your look today, I wish I could express [fem./masc./other/all/none] like you do""
Depends on the friend, I think. Generally, I think it’s a bit awkward because it turns gender into a commodity/a “thing to have”. Just say you like her style, vibes, confidence, etc. be more specific
I guess you can thank her for supporting you
Saying that her style or vibe is inspiring or something would probably be a lot better than expressing envy. Also I've definitely prefaced compliments with ""I don't know if this is a weird thing to say, but..."" before, when I haven't been 100% sure about a nice comment, and I'm pretty sure I've only had positive reactions. As long as it's just an unusual compliment and not a genuinely strange or invasive one I feel like that's typically fine tbh
I think I'd be flattered. As an andro enby it would be quite validating if someone liked that enough to envy it, usually my appearance is met with no comment.
Do they know you’re genderqueer? Probably no.

Are they openly (especially if they present) queer? Then no.

Are neither of the above true? Well it’s maybe weird but not rude or harmful unless she’s a closet trans man or something that makes her present in a way she doesn’t want to be.
Online it isn't a problem people mostly sees it as complement but idk how irl people would react
As others have said, it depends. I know my best friend (cis lady) would probably really like it if I said she gave me gender envy, but if someone told that to me I’d be more ambivalent, because I haven’t really hit my gender goals yet.
Oof. This statement made me question a lot. I got butterflies…
I wouldn't add the 'I wish' part personally. They might end up feeling bad if they think you're seeing them as an unattainable standard, they might think they're making your mood worse by being around, and it's making the compliment more about you and they might feel like you need reassurance if that makes sense.
Like I said, I’m not actually, like, dying to tell her this or anything. We just talk about things relating to the LGBTQIA+ community regularly, and if it came up in a conversation, I just want to make sure it isn’t super weird
Yeah, she knows I’m NB, and she herself is gay
I see what you're saying! That's a great point. A lot of nuance and caution is needed for sure.
Yeah if you already have that common ground it's probably fine, as long as she's comfortable with her own presentation. Especially if you kind of soften the wording a little bit."	wxgpbl	NonBinary	21	0.97	2022-08-25 15:08:04

Why are people are so weird about gendering clothes??	"Edit: Ignore the extra are in the title-
Sorry in advance for the long post and if the paragraphs get messed up, I’m posting from mobile!


Posted a bust of a mlp character, no clothes or anything visible, and this guy decided to comment on it. Copy/pasted from the conversation.

Them: “Hey I think your art is amazing bro and make sure to keep up the good work but I have a question why do you draw some male characters in female outfits? I don’t have a problem with it it’s just a little odd”

Me: “Ok I’m not even going to ask why you posted this on a mlp drawing.

Clothes don’t have a gender.”

Them: “Ok I see what your saying but if a boy dresses like a boy and I’m not saying it’s bad he could get made fun of and possibly made fun of forever and also that’s why I think some people shouldnot be wearing girl clothes 

And just out of curiosity what does it mean when you say clothes don’t have gender because some clothes like skirts and dresses aren’t meant for boys and were never meant for them that doesn't mean I have a problem with boys dressing in dresses that’s their business but what do you mean by they don’t have gender when they kinda do ?”

Me: “The entire concept of “X clothes are for boys and Y clothes are for girls” is ignorant at best and trans/enbyphobic as hell”

Them: “ok sorry didn’t mean to get you all mad but I’m just making a point cloths don’t have a gender (well they kinda do but not like it used to be) I say it’s of if a boy wants to dress like a girl and also there are people that aren’t transgender and they wear girl clothes so how is it transphobic “


I just,, idk how to respond at this point. Why do they care so much? What is it with people and clothes?? Why is it such a hard concept to understand that people can wear whatever tf they want and categorizing things as “boy’s” or “girl’s” is stupid as hell??"	"Wait until they learn about the history of high heels
I hate when people are like that about clothes. My parents are like this and it drives me nuts.
An update: well they turned out to be transphobic as hell. Idk what I expected.
If they care that much about possible gender alignment of clothing in an mlp drawing, they’re either a neck beard or still in middle school. Either way, not something I’d worry about.

your joy is their poison	"And now? the Daily Shaming! We've combed tiktok to find people who have FAILED to CONFORM! Look how much they fail to fit in. Aren't you glad that you fit in enough not to be targeted by us? (or *do* you fit in enough? maybe not! better watch to find out!)

* First up here is a video of a man, but he has on a DRESS. Like a WOMAN! Unimaginable! Everyone should wear the correct outfit for their gender. It's not fair that while we're responsible *other people* get to just run around having fun.
* Next up look at this girl! She's FAT but she says she's PRETTY! Impossible! What if this catches on?? People who haven't earned the right to be happy might be happy? Then only we at the Daily Shaming would be unhappy and how is that fair? It's not!
* This one is a non-binary person but they look more like one gender than the other as far as we are concerned. YES our opinion matters. Non-binary people must wear gray jumpers and CLEAR lipgloss-- pink is not allowed.  We at the Daily Shaming are already confused enough.  Please stop confusing us it's scary. STICK TO THE UNIFORM.
* And now we have a father who loves to braid his daughter's hair! Is this DAD or is this MOM? This guy has too many muscles for this activity. And now we are getting confused again. Please stop... Why isn't he worried about what the other guys would say? Why isn't he scared of being called gay?
* This next one says they are TRANS! Look how happy they are? HOW? We at the Daily Shaming still remember that time the water polo coach said that we ""swam like a girl"" and now people are running around being trans without a care in the world. Western civilization is crumbling.
* So many people WANT ATTENTION ... but who is paying attention to The Daily Shaming?? No one thinks to ask THAT. We are the real victims. Wanting attention automatically makes you bad. More people should pay attention to us saying this. Maybe our truth bombs are just too real?? That must be it. We are NOT crying right now you take that back!
* And now for a little BOY helping his sister with her MAKEUP. HE puts on makeup too! Madness! There is no end to all these people just... doing whatever they want... what gives them the right?
* This person said they are DISABLED and talked about their wheelchair but now they are STANDING. That can't happen. We on Daily Shaming can't think of any reason why that *could* happen. No, we have not thought about it for more than a few seconds, but why would we need to?

The Daily Shaming might just seem like mean spirited voyeurism, but we'll now try to convince you that what we are really doing is somehow saving free speech and preventing SOCIAL DECAY. You better keep watching and you better keep track of all the things we don't like or you could be NEXT. If we don't do our jobs more and more people will just do whatever makes them happy and... be happy even though they're supposed to feel BAD. We at Daily Shaming work so hard to fit in... it's not fair that our suffering means nothing. You can't just say ""well I don't want to do it that way"" you have to do as you're told! These are just the hard truths of life. Even if you do everything right, you still might not be happy...OK? NO. We are not crying again! We just have a very bad cold!🤬😢

Am I nonbinary? What does it feel like to be non binary?	"I’m mad confused. I’m a dude. I used to be pretty transphobic in the past but I started watching some trans youtubers (Sam Collins, Noah Finnce) and I’ve made a few trans friends and they’ve helped me to understand that being trans isn’t, like, weird. 
Recently I’ve started having thoughts that maybe I might be some sort of trans. I don’t really like the thought of that, but I know that if I ignore these thoughts then they’ll probably get worse. 
Most of the time I feel pretty good being a boy, but sometimes it feels wrong? I don’t want tits or anything, I know I’m not a woman, but maybe I’m not a man either?
Its weird because sometimes I see my body in the mirror and it’s not like this intense dysphoria feeling like I hear about, it’s just like “Thats not what I should look like” “That shouldn’t be there”, like I should have bigger hips or thighs or different shoulders or “bottom parts”.
Am I even feeling gender dysphoria? It’s not like I wanna fucking tear my skin off it just so wrong. Like thats not what my body looks like in my head. Thats not what my body should look like. 
I think I might start to go by he/they pronouns, or maybe I’m fucking stupid and thats a huge mistake. Probably a terrible idea to ask Reddit for advice but I don’t really know who I could talk to. 
What does it “feel” like to be non binary? I’m so confused."	"I can relate to your emotions. I was unsure of my current gender identity, and my husband and I felt the same way.

We met through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates).
I actually had a somewhat similar thought process when I realized I'm nonbinary. I'm AFAB but I never really felt like I was a woman but I didn't want to be a man either. Feeling nonbinary is exactly that - you just want to kinda exist outside normal gender bounds. I've always hated gender roles, and once I learned about nonbinary identities I thought they were really cool. I didn't immediately realize I was nonbinary, but I think reading some nonbinary perspectives and a (fictional) book about a nonbinary person by a nonbinary author really helped me realize. To specifically address your question, I think the biggest part personally of feeling nonbinary is just ""feeling like just me"", doing everything regardless of gender and typical gender expectations. Like that my actions and physical presentation aren't feminine or masculine, I'm just trying to be me, even if the actions are typically described as fem or masc. Idk if that makes sense but hopefully it can help a little.
It’s hard to describe what it feels like to be nonbinary, even for nonbinary people, because like, how would i know? It’s how ive always been. 

Similar to you, I didn’t think i had dysphoria. But I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror or in photos after about age 11. I just looked, and felt, wrong. I’ve realized as an adult what i was experiencing was dissociation. 

I never really thought “i want to be a man” or “i wish i was a man”, even though 4+ years into transition im a very masculine person. If anything, i wished to feel right as a woman and I couldn’t understand why no matter how hard i tried I couldn’t seem to do it right. 

I didn’t want to be trans, i just eventually had to accept that i was. If i had to describe the earliest way i thought of my gender differently, besides not recognizing myself (which I didn’t recognize at the time was tied to gender at all), it was in my late teens/early twenties when friends said if i had been born a guy i would be exactly the same—and that felt right. 

Dysphoria is a complicated feeling. And we feel it differently, not only from each other, but in different ways over time. It might help to focus on not wanting to be something else—but wanting to be yourself, and express yourself fully and freely. Which may mean exploring yourself and your gender identity and presentation in order to discover what that is. A lot of us do the same thing as kids—when we get old enough to start to dress ourselves, style our hair, make choices about our appearance…we’re experimenting with our gender presentation, in many ways. But that’s not just something for kids to do. As adults we can do the same thing, around gender or new hobbies or new social circles—how we’ve ‘always been’ doesn’t define who we are or will become. 

Take care :)
A lot of what you describe feels all too relatable and are the sorts of things that led me to question my gender as well. I'm assigned make at birth and always just assumed I was a guy. Or a boy. Or a dude. But being a ""man"" always felt off--upsetting, even. I'm ok with my physical form most of the time, but ever since I was a young child, I would occasionally see myself in the mirror and think, ""the person I see on the outside doesn't really match how I feel inside.""

So yeah! Try some stuff! Switch up your pronouns, play with your physical presentation, try on a different name. And go with what feels right and makes you happy. Gender euphoria is just as important an indicator as dysphoria.
there's no harm in experimenting with your gender! if you try out new pronouns or a new label or whatever and find out you like it, good for you! if you find out you don't like it and you're actually cis, that's good too! either way you'll only learn more about yourself :3
Heya, first of all: good for you on changing your mindset, and I'm sorry you're going through this shitty feeling.

Going through your post it reads a lot like how I started going through my self discovery. I am AFAB, now non-binary or a man (haven't figured it out fully yet but hey). Some people have always known, but some people haven't. Looking in the mirror and not seeing the person that you are but some other form is very weird and a shitty feeling. It doesn't always have to be the same level of intenseness either. Calling you non-binary is something you will have to figure out for yourself. You could always try different pronouns with a few people you trust or referring to yourself with he/they, they/them, she/they or neopronouns! See how it feels. It will feel very odd in the beginning, but as you get used to one or the other you can decide what's comfortable for you. If you like to change your name, do that too, try it out!

Being non-binary is different for everyone however. How intense you experience dysphoria or euphoria, what is nice and isn't. And keep in mind you don't need to figure yourself out in a week. It can take months or years, and every time you discover something that triggers dysphoria or euphoria, or even a less clear feeling or something totally different, it's a learning experience. I hope you'll be able to figure this out fam!
Nonbinary quite literally is that feeling that something, anything, no matter how seemingly tiny or insignificant about the gender you were assigned isn’t working for you AND that the other binary gender won’t work either. That’s it!
>""I know I’m not a woman, but maybe I’m not a man either?""

That's not an uncommon thought/feeling for nonbinary people. Not all nonbinary people feel that way, and not all people who feel that way identify with the term ""nonbinary""  (some may feel they're more agender, neutrois, or a number of other terms), but that definitely puts you in the ""outside of 100% cis and gender conforming"" territory.

>""sometimes I see my body in the mirror and it’s not like this intense dysphoria feeling like I hear about""

You don't have to have intense body dysphoria or any body dysphoria at all. Some people have mild. Some only have it for certain body parts. Some don't have it at all and only have social dysphoria. (They're fine personally with their body but don't like how the world perceives them and their gender.) And some people only have gender euphoria (see the bottom of this post.)

>""“Thats not what I should look like” “That shouldn’t be there”, like I should have bigger hips or thighs or different shoulders or “bottom parts”. Am I even feeling gender dysphoria?""

It would not be wrong to classify that as body-based gender dysphoria, but it also wouldn't be wrong to classify that as body dysmorphia. We need more information.

Is there a gendered aspect to it? Does it feel wrong because of gender reasons? Or because of other reasons? Like it should be different simply because it's too big/small/whatever and not because ""this doesn't feel right, gender-wise""?

>""Like thats not what my body looks like in my head. Thats not what my body should look like.""

Okay, what SHOULD your body look like? The answer to that (whether you give it here or prefer to just figure it out for yourself and not share) may help you figure things out. And WHY should it look that way? How do you want other people to react to it and/or treat you when it looks the way you want it to look?

>"" I think I might start to go by he/they pronouns""

You can always try it in a safe space for a bit (possibly outside your everyday life, like in a chat room or something) and see how it feels. Nothing says you have to change forever.

I hope this helps.

One last thing...

Just a heads up to dispel a common misconception: you don't necessarily have to have gender dysphoria to be nonbinary or trans. You can just have gender EUPHORIA when you think about yourself as (or do something different than) the gender you were assigned at birth.

You can be like ""I like being a guy just fine, but the idea of being a girl makes me so happy."" or even ""\[...\], but the idea of being something not a guy or a girl makes me feel good.""
I feel you, my guy. Both my partner and I have gone through long periods of gender questioning and often coming to wrong conclusions. For me it flet like everything was wrong with my body, the person I saw in my head and the person I saw in the mirror were almost irreconcilably different, so I started going by she/her and got on hrt. Then I started to feel like that was wrong too, so I stopped the hormones about 7months in. I spent the better part of two years hidng from my identity before eventually coming out as non-binary. About a year later I got back onto hrt with a much healthier relationship with my identity and gender identity as a concept. That was almost a year and 3 bra sizes ago and I haven't looked back. All this is to say that experimenting with your identity is valid and if you're not sure, just remember that you don't really have to be. Just be you and do what feels right.
Nothing began clicking for me until I was exposed to the word “non-binary”; I had a journey of further excavating what that means for me. But there’s no checklist of items you require to be. Some people don’t experience dysphoria, for myself my dysphoria was hidden in my peripherals and I couldn’t see it for what it was until I was actively looking at past experiences and how it matched up to what I was learning (I started diving into queer theory, nonbinary/trans representation and history). It took time for y journey to learn to articulate what was depression, what was disassociation, and what was dysphoria. Perhaps you’ll find success by leaning into sitting with yourself and try vocalizing some of these ideas, and see how that affects you. It wont prove anything necessarily, but it’s about finding what aligns with you.    

And ask your trans friends. Community can make a huge impact, whatever it is you discover
First off, grats on being open to changing your mindset! This is a safe sub, I don't really go out into the wide expanses of Reddit lol.

Second, it's completely normal now that you're not holding up rigid gender roles to have questions, especially once you find it's not so much two boxes as a full spectrum of options. It's why you won't get one answer about what it feels like, because everyone's in a different place (and we also get a lot of questions of ""what does it even feel like to be a man or woman?"" y'all we do not know, it's why we're here lol). And it may even fluctuate over time as your experience changes.

Based on your description you might want to look up genderfluid or genderflux (the lgbtiaq+ wiki is a rabbit hole of options, fair warning :) )
Thank you for saying your experience. As someone else trying to figure out their own gender shit I've been having a lot of anxiety around the idea of being a woman. I'm AMAB and never quite hated being a man but It never quite 100% fit. I had an interest in femininity but never considered myself a woman per se, just a person who liked femininity. And the idea of being a woman isn't really comfortable to me and I've been trying to work out if that's transphobia or just the simple fact that I am not a woman.  And my biggest thing lately has been saying ""I just want to be me. I just want to feel like me. Whoever that is"". I've definitely connected with a lot of enby people's stories and hearing how they think about their gender and I definitely think I connect with a lot of it. So just....thank you for sharing your experience
Hey! What is the name of the book you read?
hello i know this comment is a bit old but the depression, dissociation, dysphoria thing resonates with me rn, would you be willing to share any books/things etc you read that helped you learn more ab what you were feeling?
The book is called I Wish You All the Best. The author is nonbinary too. It is a high school setting just to let you know, but it's a great book and I highly recommend it.
As I recall, I found the link in a NB discord (since shut down) that had a resource center. I began there, and then was also researching the history of Matilda (the musical) and how it was relevant to the then developing debacle regarding Jagged Little Pill’s move to Broadway. I was working on a production of Head Over Heels so to me it seemed all interwoven for me at the time.

I love my sister!	So she's nine. And she's still learning about the LGBT community so she doesn't know my pronouns but my mother who hates the LGBT she is homophobic and transphobic so yea. Also thinks pronouns are fake... And my mom got mad at me for wearing a hat cause apparently makes me look like a boy and my sister said she can wear whatever she wants and you don't need to tell her what she has to wear. It made me so happy! she stood up for me cause I wanted to wear something :))	"Same with my daughter (I'm not out) but she knows all the flags, her fav is NB (of course it is) age 10.

Am I asking for too much?	"I like being called as she/her and wearing ""girl"" clothes but I don't want to be seen as a girl. That makes me feel incredibly bad because I'm agender.

I can't be mad at people for seeing me as a girl because I look like one, I know it's not their fault. I don't want to come out to every single person and be like ""Hey, I'm not actually a girl, but keep using feminine pronouns and adjectives without seeing me as a girl, even if I present as one"". People can't do that, I make everything so difficult for them and I'm sorry. I just don't want to be seen as a girl anymore, but how can I ask for that if I present as one? I'm so sorry,,,"	"There's no solution to this -- I'm in a similar position. But advice: Just confide it to those who love you: they're the ones who will understand, and they're the ones that matter.
Feeling like you will always be viewed as something you don't identify as just for wearing what makes you feel secure in your identity is an awful feeling. People will definitely see, and appreciate you for who you are, and how you express yourself, now, I think people are a lot more aware, looking like a girl, doesn't mean you ""are a girl"" it can also mean, you are a rocking agender with a killer style, personality, etc. ❤
I totally feel this. Although I don't dress like a ""girl,"" at work I use my given name, which is very feminine, and I have a high pitched voice and while I don't mind she/her pronouns, I feel like no one ""sees"" me for who I am there. At least at home and with friends and family I can be myself and they get me. 
You're not asking for too much to be seen and heard. Just because no one you are around has questioned their gender and they don't understand you, doesn't make you invalid or less worth being you."	j466m7	NonBinary	20	0.96	2020-10-03 00:25:27
Today I saw a trace of my facial hair while going over a photo and it made me so mad I smashed a wooden board with my shovel. I'm starting to think my dysphoria is getting worse.		"If you haven't tried waxing, it's really good as it lasts longer than shaving and you don't get the shadow. Get facial wax strips or just cut some normal size ones down. Make sure you get the ones with the soothing aftercare wipes (or just use baby oil). You could also get a facial epilator. Be sure to exfoliate though cos waxing can cause ingrown hairs, and black skin is more prone to them too. But it may be a good solution.
I'd have totally done the same."	hc7o4i	NonBinary	19	1.0	2020-06-19 20:01:24
Should I bother to try and bring it up?	"So I realized I was gender nonconforming/genderqueer/nonbinary about four years ago. I always knew I wasn't trans, but I've never felt ""female"", more just nothing. I have the words now to explain how I've always felt.

This realization happened in the course of a fight with my spouse. A child at a school I worked at was outed by a volunteer parent made employee mid year and she sent a staff wide email saying that because of a trans gender 7 year old going to our school all of the girls were at risk of rape in the bathrooms. Never mind that the kid was using the single stall bathroom in the nurse's office to make herself more comfortable.

I was livid. My husband asked what was wrong. I explained and he got mad at me. ""I agree with the coworker. That family is abusing their kid and they are going to grow up messed up.""

I got even more angry, said I felt like that as a kid, and I feel like I grew up messed up. Apparently this threatened his fragile masculinity and he screamed at me. We had never fought like that and haven't since. I've definitely wanted to leave since then, but can't yet.

So that was a long introduction. I've been working at a different school for the past two years with two great guys. It's very small. My older coworker explained he doesn't care for the transgender stuff because he doesn't believe in gender norms anyhow. He feels masculine, but has performed ballet, and humans are kind of dumb for ascribing gender roles to the things we do anyhow. I can respect that because I feel much the same way. We talked after I came out to him.

My younger coworker was more sheltered and was talking about arguing in a college class that gender is set by chromosomes and there is a binary. I discussed and shared a lot of resources with him, but he got uncomfortable and shut down. He didn't bring it up for a while. Then he was helping me set up my classroom this summer and mentioned his fiancee's sister was going into 9th grade. She was coming out as nonbinary and he and his fiancee were struggling at being supportive. I told him I was nonbinary and we just talked a little bit, but it made me feel so happy!

I spent a weekend with them at a MagicFest event. I noticed one of the organizers had their pronouns under their name tag. However they physically presented as male and had a feminine name and she/her pronouns. Apparently the Magic the Gathering community and Wizards of the Coast has a lot of trans and nonbinary people and my older coworker mentioned this later. We started talking about the organizer and I said it made me happy to see them use their desired name and pronouns.

My coworkers were like, ""Yeah, that's fine, but why? Why go to the trouble if you aren't going to try and look the way you say you feel on the inside? It's weird.""

That was several weeks ago, and at the time we were walking and I am slow and can't articulate my thoughts well while moving. Nobody owes them ""passing"" and that's what they were alluding to. I present female because my stupid body would be hella uncomfortable to really try to ""pass"" as male. I'm not male. I'm not female. I'm just me and I wear what feels and looks nice. Plus, a dress is one less piece of clothing to not get dirty.

I don't know if I should or how to bring this back up, but it's been in the back of my mind. I love and trust my coworkers and think they will understand and be supportive over time. I told my husband I've felt like separating since our fight and he said he doesn't understand why I don't feel female, but he loves me, and is sorry he screamed at me. He doesn't get it, but if calling myself nonbinary makes me happy he just will ignore it."	"The thing that irritates me the most is your husband said he would ""just ignore it"" 
That is not a person I would want as a partner!
My partner is bi/polyam and I support her! I have even made friends with her boyfriends and she is seeing a girl that I dated when I was 19(we still get along well) so I do not see why he can't support you! I hope the best for you! 
As for your coworkers I you could try this really great episode of Bill Nye saves the world on gender and expression
I just hope he has a better outlook if any of your littles are GNC but I am sure you are equipped to handle it! 
Best of luck
I'll look the episode up!

With my husband, it's my second marriage and I'm not being abused so... I'm resigned? We have three kids and are trying to work stuff out.

First husband started cheating and using meth so competitively I'm in a much better situation. Trying to have patience with my now husband :/
It is on Netflix 
I am glad you are in a better relationship!

Holy shit I think my parents are transphobic	"So I'm non-binary, living with both my parents and my little sister. It all first started with little stuff, like calling me by my deadname or by female pronouns. I was like ""Meh, they're just not used to it, it'll take a little time"" Then my sister started to do efforts on this, but it got even worse with my parents. They keep on getting mad or sighing/rolling eyes when I asked to be referred as they and that my name was Ash. They say ""C'mon [DEADFUCKINGNAME], stop being annoying and help us instead of talking shit!"" They also said to ""cut the bullshit"" when  I was complaining about the lack of enby rights in France (that's were I live and you have to choose between make our female on your ID and stuff). My mom also seems to be a part of the TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist). I always knew she was a feminist (more like a feminazi but eh), but not at this point, not before she started saying stuff like ""you can't be trans AND be against sexist clichés, because gender identity is just a bunch of clichés"". Then I brought up the whole ""J. K. Rowling is transphobic"" thing, and they were like ""Maya Forstater did nothing wrong, plus I'm sure you don't know the whole story (at this point they were just trying to prove me wrong, fucking childish)"". Oh and also, my mom refused to get me a chest binder (because I'm trying to look a little more androgynous) for Christmas, cuz it ""was a shame, I'm soooo pretty and feminine"", or she was ""scared it would hurt"" (she even said that people who said it didn't hurt were probably paid by a brand, like wtf?!). None of my parents also want me to shave my head (my hair is already pretty short, but I wanna change my style), but that may just be not wanting me to make stupid decisions that I'd regret (which already happened a couple of times '^^)
So... do you think they're transphobic?

Sorry for the long ass post too haha"	"I would just shave your head without their permission.  They don't own your body.  Similarly, I would see if you can maybe have a friend order a binder for you and pay them back or something like that.
If your parents say transphobic things and do transphobic things then yes, they are transphobic. All you can do is decide what your boundaries are and then assert them.

If you don't know how to assert your boundaries you first need to state them aloud - ""I will not be referred to by deadname, my name is Name, please use it"" and then whenever they are crossed you need to state them again but this time with a consequence within your control ""I've told you to please not use deadname, if you do it again I will leave/hang up/etc."" If they push back or of they cross the boundary again you need to follow through with the consequence. 

If you are unable to assert your boundaries for some reason (financially dependent on them or afraid for your physical safety or other similar reason) then you need to find ways to stay sane and work on getting to a place where you are able to maintain your boundaries. 

Remember that you deserve respect, and that your boundaries are not negotiable, you belong to you and no one else.
Argh, so sorry about that... best of wishes
Yeah, your parents sound pretty transphobic to me. Get out as soon as you can and never speak to them again, would be my advice. I mean, maaaybe they'll get better one day, but it's not your responsibility to try and make them better. Your job is to take care of yourself; their issues are just that, their issues. I'm saying this as a NB person that ran away from my parents, and honestly it's so freeing to get away from a toxic environment.
Okay that’s it Ash, I’m your mom now, do you want some cookies? Maybe a warm cup of tea when you get home after a long hard day.
About the binder, my only close friend (the only one I trust about money or kinda personal stuff) lives on literally the other side of the country, and he's 14. So I don't really know how to pay him back (unless if he talks to his parents about it, and I don't really know how he could explain that lmao) And about the hair... I'd have to save A LOT of money because the only hair dresser I can reach on my bike is EXPENSIVE. Tho I'm gonna try, what are they gonna do when they find out? Ground me? I don't even go outside
The thing is that I'm a minor, and will be for 5 years... so I can't really leave, except if I just go to a friend's house for a while, not they'd call the police and I'd get in trouble...
Might be worth looking around for cheap hair clippers to just buy, if you haven't already? If you want it the same length all over I reckon you'd be able to do it yourself
You can leave the room? Even if they follow you, just as a clear signal that their behaviour isn't acceptable. But don't do that if you fear reprisals. Always mind your safety first.
That's the problem, I'd want something like really short on one side, and kinda long on the other

AITA for being mad at my friend for kinda outing me to my lesbian P.E teacher?	"basically I was trying to explain gender dysphoria to my friends and one of them went up to our P.E teacher and asked ""what is gender dysphoria?""... I was mortified. I was explaining it to them so i felt like she knew what she was doing when she asked... anyway my P.E teacher looks at me with a raised eyebrow and says ""i think it's something to do with not knowing who you are or how you feel about your gender and body. right?"" ughh I got really mad at my friend after that and she said ""isn't it fine? like she's gay..."" umm yes but like I was going to come out to her in my own time. 

please tell me what you guys think about this."	"No you're not the asshole. That was horrible of your friend. The teacher being lesbian doesn't make her safer. Gay cis people are often just as transphobic as the general population. It put you on the spot about a very personal and politically controversial topic. I'm sorry this was done to you :(
NTA but from the way you describe this interaction, it’s possible that your PE teacher doesn’t know you’re not cis! Cis people are often much more oblivious than we realize. But still, I’m sorry your friend did that to you.
Not at all. Outing someone without their permission is never okay
Poor child. I agree with you 100% it doesn’t matter who it was, it was your truth to tell.
thank you..

my P.E teacher is gay...
Even still! Gay cis people don’t think about gender the same way we do, especially those in different generations.
makes sense lol

I was going to come out to her but idk now? 

do you think this is a good opportunity?
If you’re ready to come out and feel safe doing so, then yeah! The fact that she had an idea of what dysphoria is shows that she’s at least aware of transness, and since she’s gay she’s probably less likely to out you to others, especially if you ask her not to. 
Good luck!

I’m just venting right here about my main language and the country that I live	"Hi, by the title , you probably guessed right that I’m not a born english speaker, my main language is Portuguese and we don’t have a neutral pronoun on the formal language that is actually neutral(the neutral pronoun is the masc pronoun), which sucks, so , the non-binary community created a lot of new pronouns to replace the masc one, and because of the internet, one of the new pronouns has been popularized.

Now you have an idea of what we have in hands, let’s get to the venting/rant

The cis people, have been making fun of it, saying that no one need this, and having stupid “arguments” about like how this pronoun will affect the illiterate people, and a lot of non sense. Some school appeared to accept the pronoun, but the cis got mad, and now they are CREATING LAWS TO PROHIBIT THE SCHOOLS TO USE THE NEUTRAL PRONOUNS TO COMFORT THE NB CHILDREN 

LIKE WTH???!!! I really don’t get why do this 

And this thing is getting worse, because one state has approved this law and another 15 states can get this law as well( we have 26 states)

I never felt this humiliated(idk if this is the exact word) in my entire life"	"My first/main language is Portuguese too, I get you. Even an attempt to respect someone's gender (specially when they are nonbinary) gets people angry at you. Wth? What for? I'm not surprised since people around have always been like this to stuff that doesn't revolve around them but it still gets so frustrating. If people felt the need to create it then yes, people need it. I wasn't that aware of the law tho, I just searched it. This is all so backwards, it's so hard imagining continuing living here as the person I am
it’s sooo frustrating, but to face this world I got your back sibling, stay cool and stay healthy, you’re valid no matter what
Thank you and same, I've really not been around this kind of support much haha"	qee84d	NonBinary	18	0.93	2021-10-23 21:42:50
Sibling came out as NB, we are worried how bio mum will take it	"So, I have four younger siblings. 2, 8, 10 and 14. Youngest is half sibling with dad and stepmum. 8 and 9 are stepsiblings and the 14 year old are 100% biological. Therefore only one who has to see bio mum. Thank god. 

The 14 year old came out the other day. I am so so so happy for them. They gave me preferred pronouns (they, them in English, de and hen in Norwegian) and new name (Robin) they want to try out.

Dad, me and stepmum must admit we weren't exactly very surprised. Both me and stepmum are pansexual and stepmum messes around with gender expression a bit so we sorta had already guessed. Was just waiting for them to say it. Dad was also really happy that they felt safe enough to come out. 

Bio mom will be a bit harder not cause she is technically a bigot but because she is very ""accepting"" and ""cool"" and ""good mother"" and ""supports LGBTQ+"" so ""it's fine to make jokes"". She pretends to be supportive depending on who she is with. Secretly a massive Swerf. Bit of a Terf as well but she doesn't speak about that around us cause we get so pissed off. Her Swerf news are a new discovery for us. Just sort of to give you humans an image of her. 

Also I sort of experimented with gender and identified as genderqueer a while at 14-16 but bio mum got mad when I wore a sportsbra (wasn't allowed to get a binder even if I was to pay for it myself), told me ""you already don't like how chubby you look, this just makes that worse"". Dad and stepmum called me their son from time to time and I enjoyed that a lot. 

To Mum's LGBTQ+ friends she acted super supportive and sort of showed me off. But when her not LGBTQ+ friends were there she made fun of me and the terms etc. Along with other behaviour at that time I gave up and now trying to identify as genderqueer or anything just gives me flashbacks and anxiety so I've given up. 
I'm really scared that's going to happen with Robin. I want this to be a positive experience for them and not something traumatizing. I don't want them to end up not feeling like they can identify as NB because of bio mum. I don't give a single fuck if they identify as a male, or female or genderqueer or something else in the future. Shit changes and sometimes one has to experiment but also wouldn't be surprised if they identified as NB forever. 

They have told me they are worried cause Robin remember how she treated me. I've gives some arguments for if/ when she does the ""it's a phase"" thing (That if it is or isn't is irrelevant, that's how they feel right now and it costs zero kr to respect their kid). 

Also their birthday is in a few months. I'm buying flag and pins and nail colour in NB colours+ their favourite colours. And have told my bf (after asking Robin ofc) so he doesn't use wrong name or pronouns. But all the NB merch in the world won't stop the trauma of bio mum being an ass. Any idea what I can do? Both regards to bio mum but also generally how to make this a good experience?"	"You're doing everything right. Just be supportive and offer to talk to bio mom with them or be there for them afterwards. Unfortunately as much as we want to protect people, sometimes we can't.

They could also try hiding it from your bio mum.
Talk back to biomom for them. Leave the room as soon as she starts trying shit. Encourage Robin to do the same. Sounds like she knows better, but she doesn't want to do better. So, show her the consequences of her actions. Be a bigoted asshole, don't get to talk to your kids."	fo2ses	NonBinary	19	1.0	2020-03-24 10:19:19
An amazing friend experience :)	So I have a friend from high school who’s also non binary and I was catching up with zim. After catching up a bit I told zim that I go by any pronouns and one of zir response made me so happy. Basically I personally still identify as male and feel a connection non binary, kind of like a demiboy type deal but I’m still figuring it out. Anyways I have a huge feminine side as I told my friend and ze literally said these exact words “Awesome, I’ll keep that in mind! Thanks for telling me and trusting me. You still good with “my man” and “my dude” and stuff? Are there any gender neutral or maybe feminine terms you’d like me to use?” The feminine terms mentioning idea part just gave me a spark of joy inside which I guess is euphoria. Ze is also the first person I told this since I’m not entirely out to people I know in terms of my gender expressions but thought I’d share this amazing moment :). I told zim that I don’t mind masculine or femininine terms but I would really love feminine terms but I’m cool with either and won’t be mad	"Cute story! Also, props on your ze/zir usage.
That's so nice! Supportive friends are the best
Thanks Ze goes by ze/zim/zir so of course I’m gonna use those :)
They sure are :)
Oh yeah, it definitely \*should\* be a baseline. I just meant you are proficient at it.
Thank you!! I never really used them before so I had to research some examples on how to use them, glad I did good with it :)"	105v1tu	NonBinary	18	0.96	2023-01-07 17:53:23
How do you know if you're non-binary? I am confused. Even if I were, most of my acquaintances are cishet and probably wouldn't take it seriously. Should I even bother figuring it out?	"Hello good people,

I am still confused as to what I am. My native language only has a word for sex but not for gender, so even the concept itself is as recent as my learning of English.

I am happy with my sex, I know I am a female. But I don't feel any particular gender. Like you're just born with either set of genitalia and that's it, what else is there to discuss? But since I'm comfortable with my sex, does it mean that my gender is also female?

But I'm tired of people telling me that what I do is not feminine, that I have a masculine vibe, and like, I just don't fake my femininity or masculinity you know? I'm not mad to be equated to a man, I am upset that people feel the need to criticize some of my characteristics because of my sex. I just like things I like as an individual regardless of what gender it is attached to. Women are more likely to tell me so than men. ""You should be more feminine"" why the heck should I be more feminine if my sex is woman? How can I be more feminine than being a literal woman? Should I ""come out"" just so that people would leave me alone?

I like make up, video games, martial arts, pop icons, I don't like fashion, I'm always slouching, I love drag, my clothing is either pretty neutral or very eccentric, sometimes masculine (tracksuits, male t-shirts bought at the kid section cause they're cheaper and have video games on them) sometimes feminine (skirts and dresses, floral prints), I don't like taking pictures of myself, I don't always shave, does it mean my gender is not woman?

I don't mind being called a different pronoun or being mistaken for a dude when I'm dressed particularly bad. I don't love it either, I just literally don't care. In fact, I kinda like it when people don't use female pronouns by mistake because it mixes it up a little bit, and for some reason I like that. But I definitely don't want to be a man or be qualified with male pronouns all the time.

If that helps, I am also pansexual. I find gender ambiguity as attractive as male or female genders. Am I non-binary? Should I even bother coming out to my friends from a culture where even homophobia is still rampant and being gay illegal? They probably never heard of non-binary. 

I'm just very confused and have no lgbtq+ friends to talk to in real life. 

Is gender like a diagnosis where you just explain yourself to experienced people and they tell you what you are? 

Because if it had to come down to how I feel, gender is literally a social construct to me and I don't ""feel"" gender, but I like being a woman. Gender is like culture to me. You don't have to be French to enjoy cheese and it's not because you enjoy cheese that you are French, but I don't feel any particular nationality on the inside, I just know I like cheese and German sausage and have a French passport that I like, and I'm tired of people telling me I should be less German.

Can someone enlighten me? You don't have to straight up tell me if I'm non-binary or not but any directions would be appreciated."	"if you like being a woman, just be a woman. if you'd be happier as another gender, you can be that one too. 

gender is not a diagnosis. it's an internal feeling with respect to the gendered world around us. things like bathrooms, colors, scents, etc, are all gendered, and they construct gender ""boxes"" that we determine how we fit within or if we do at all.
Not to make things even more confusing, but it sounds like you might be gender non-conforming.  You can identify as a woman but  be disinterested in conforming to traditional roles.
hi! i hope you are doing well. i wanted to add my perspective in if it helps. i identify as nonbinary/genderfluid, so my gender rarely aligns with my sex. but, i still identify as female since i am comfortable with my sex. so even if you are comfortable as a female, you don’t always have to identify as a woman! i wish you the best!!
some terms you might like (and could look up online to get more perspective): agender, bigender, pangender, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, demigirl or demiboy,  genderqueer 

best of luck discovering yourself friend:)) I haven't come out to nearly anybody in my life as genderqueer, but just knowing it for myself has made all the difference in feeling comfortable with who i am. there's no pressure, no need to put a word on how you feel, and there's absolutely no wrong way to be you. looking for labels like nonbinary and genderqueer are more for you than for the people around you, and if you feel that they would help you understand yourself, keep exploring!!
Sounds like you might be agender - put simply, that's where you don't have any gender at all
Thank you so much to everyone who answered! 

I have come to the conclusion that I am agender/non-binary, and that my pronouns are she/her and he/him. I will come out to who I am comfortable enough with. 

I hope anyone who is confused or questioning can benefit from this post and the lovely answers.
“gender is not a diagnosis” i really like how you worded it. also you are allowed to express yourself in whatever ways you want to. your gender expression =/= gender identity. if you’re a really masculine woman, you’re a woman. if you’re a fem inclined non-binary person, you’re non-binary. if you feel comfortable identifying as a cis woman, no matter your expression or pronouns people use on you, then great :D but if you want to talk more, you can always come back here or my messages are open <3
Thank you for your answer.

I am happy being a woman as a sex. 

But I don't care about the boxes and like things from all the boxes. I like the female sex but I don't like *just* the female box, you know what I mean? Is that what agender is?
Is that something that falls under the umbrella term of non-binary ?
Thank you ! I'm glad someone relates to my experience
Thank you so much ! 

I have come to the conclusion that I am agender/non-binary, and that my pronouns are she/her and he/him. I will come out to who I am comfortable enough with.
Yes, that's the conclusion I have come to, thank you!
Thank you so much, this is a lovely response and exactly the precision I was looking for <3

I just might message you actually, I have a million questions.
I’m not OP, but I’ve been trying my best to understand non-binary identity myself and this was helpful! I’m a cis woman who’s currently quite feminine in her gender expression but went through a very gender-nonconforming phase as a teenager. Even then I was 100% comfortable and happy with being a girl and being called she/her so I’m sure I’m cis. But I’ve learned more about gender identity since then and realised how others’ experiences are very different, so I’ve been trying to understand as much as I can.
From what I can gather, non-binary refers to your gender identity - your internalized experience. Gender non-conformity refers to your gender expression - how your appearance, behavior, etc. deviate from societal gender norms.

From what you've said, I'd say you're certainly gender non-conforming: things like your choice of hobbies, clothing style aren't influenced by typical male/female norms. Whether you're non-binary is up to you: do you feel comfortable as a ""woman"", or do you feel that that doesn't adequately describe your internal experience?

Edit: I'd like to add that coming out as non-binary or gender non-conforming might help people understand why you don't feel drawn to typical feminine stuff.
Yes, probably.  Agender certainly is a non-binary identification.  There's a lot to unpack and even in English there isn't a complete and widely agreed upon set of definitions.
I feel comfortable with myself, but society doesn't seem to. 

Someone mentioned agender and it is something that resonated with me because I have no idea what you mean when you say do you ""feel"" like a woman, like yes I feel my sex, but beyond that I just feel myself as an individual. I don't think I have an internal feeling of gender, I wasn't even aware it was a thing, I thought cis people were just people who conformed to their assigned gender at birth out of convenience, I didn't know you were supposed to feel comfortable with something beyond your biological sex being gendered. 

Thank you very much for your insight, now that I have realized my gender and pronouns, there is so much it explains.
Alright, thanks!"	omgtnq	NonBinary	17	1.0	2021-07-18 01:17:45
I don’t think my dysphoria is valid vent	Ok so I’ve known I’m not cis for like 4 years now and I’ve always felt kinda sorta vaguely uncomfortable with the top parts of my body (I’m afab nb, identified an genderfluid for a while but don’t feel like the label still fits me as I came to a realization that I don’t have to be a boy to have dysphoria) but it wasn’t that bad. I’ve experimented with binding a bit during those 4 years but there’s only so much a binder from AliExpress can do and I didn’t feel like I was dysphoric enough to justify buying a good binder. Around December last year I bought myself an actually good binder and when I saw myself in the mirror I’ve felt euphoric for the first time in my life. I’m also a big lesbian so I like my body purely aesthetically, I just feel a deep disconnection from the top part like something is wrong when I feel that I don’t have a flat chest. My dysphoria is subtle and it hadn’t made itself visible until I’ve realized I’m nb but it adds up to the other mental problems I have and I’m more depressed than usual on the days I can’t wear my binder, also usually can’t accomplish anything on those days. All this and I still feel like I’m not trans enough to justify a top surgery (I’m 18 so can’t really get it rn bc I’m not out to my parents and they would think I’m making it up to feel special either way, thinking more about the future). Before the binder I thought I could live without an top op but after buying it I realized I want the surgery really bad and every time I came across a post op pic I felt this sharp twinge of jealousy. Today I stumbled across a fb post where trans people recommended clinics that perform the surgeries in my country and they went on about the process of the surgery in detail. I just felt terrified of it all and thought again that my dysphoria is not valid enough to go through this. I’ve been thinking about it all day. Idk I’m just really scared that I’m telling myself I have dysphoria just to feel special. Has anyone felt anything similar to this? I’m looking for any kind of support but I don’t have any nb friends and all of the binary ppl I told this didn’t understand. Sorry is the post is chaotic, it’s late and I haven’t slept much for the past few days but I feel like I will go mad if I won’t get this out of me.	"Holy shit how did you get in my head...? This has been exactly my thought process and it sucks!! It really does! I don’t even really have anything helpful to say because I haven’t been able to help myself out of this mindset yet, but just know that you’re definitely not alone in this 😔
I was like this for literally years. I kept trying to convince myself it wasn't a problem and that I wasn't experiencing dysphoria in a way that a trans person would. Dysphoria for me is way more subtle than I imagined it would be, so yeah, I got depression and anxiety about myself but I seemed to find myself disgusting instead of directly thinking about ""I am a boy"".

I accept that I'm trans most of the time now, although part of me will keep questioning whether any of it is real or why I care so much. I then have to remember that my generalized anxiety cleared up for the first time after I came out at work. I still have a lot of anxiety about being trans but all the stupid little unrelated things, like social anxiety, just stopped happening. I use that as evidence to myself that this is a real thing to me, even if I can't explain why I feel this way.

Your dysphoria can exist even if the surgery scares you. I don't intend to have any surgeries ever -- spent too much time in the hospital when my husband got sick and never want to go back there unless they force me. In any case, I feel so much better with a binder that I don't think top surgery would help further. I used to think this disqualified me from being a true trans person but my definitions are a lot looser now. Things are messy in real life, surgery is justifiably scary, it's completely up to the individual what choice you make since there are probably tradeoffs in any medical treatment.

I'm going through this about hormones at the moment. The tradeoff is that my husband might stop being attracted to me, and that's a big deal to me. If it wasn't for that I would be overjoyed to start T but this complicates things.
Oof, seeing your post actually made me feel a bit invalid (though of course that wasn’t your intent and not your fault!!), because my 24 year old ass was like “they knew they weren’t cis at 14?? Am I really just lying to myself??” Especially since I don’t really feel dysphoria (that I recognize as such, anyway). Euphoria, on the other hand...

And like the other commenter I don’t have much advice for you besides the fact that I’m pretty sure every non-binary, trans, etc person on the planet has questioned their own validity and thought that they were just being attention seeking or whatever. 

But really, that’s just what The Man wants us to think about ourselves. Because we *are* a little bit special, and even though that specialness often gets us in trouble more than it gets us any “good society points”, it also makes The Man jealous because we have something that they don’t. Because we can be a member of a community that many people aren’t a part of! So The Man tells us we’re just shitty little attention seekers, because it can’t stand that non-binary and trans voices are just as loud as cis ones now, and in some places, much louder!! 

The whole attention seeking thing has always been funny to me anyway, because, like, do any of us actually know a trans or non-binary person that actually *wants* attention? Who seeks it out in that pathological way that some people need attention and must cause reasons to get it? Everyone I know, including myself, would rather have zero attention at all than way too much of it. Of course there are people like that in the LGBTQ community, but that’s just because every type of person there is can identify with LGBTQ, not because LGBTQ peeps are inherently attention seekers or even more likely to be attention seekers. 

I think that if you’re asking yourself “am I doing this for attention?” you already have your answer: probably not. Because a person who *is* doing it for attention won’t question their desire to be at the center of that attention and to get that attention by any means necessary.
You definitely have dysphoria. People are dysphoric about different things and how they experience dysphoria/how strong the intensity of it also differs from one person to another. While you may think your dysphoria isn't as strong or intense as others, there are some whose dysphoria is almost nonexistent compared to yours. And I don't think you should even compare the intensity of how you experience it with others because it seems like it's pretty strong for you personally.

I don't really experience that much dysphoria, and when I do, the intensity of it is very low. But I know that doesn't make me any less valid than those that do feel it strongly or those that don't feel it at all.

It's valid. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise that what you feel isn't true or not strong or good enough. Because you handle it and experience it way different than them.
I feel this so much. You're not alone at all, and it's pretty clear that your dysphoria is both real and valid.
Heck, just knowing that I’m not the only one feeling like this is like kinda comforting?? Thanks for sharing,,,
> The tradeoff is that my husband might stop being attracted to me 

That’s the single #1 biggest reason why I’m not actively searching out hormone therapy :\ 

My partner is the absolute love of my life, but he doesn’t really find non-binary characteristics that attractive and he’s scared I’ll stop being “his girl” (we call each other “my boy” and “my girl” as pet names, like, “You’re my boy!” “Aw, you’re my girl!”) and I don’t know how to explain that I’ll *always* be his girl even if I’m not, y’know, a woman
Kdkjjsbshsjsbshsv oh my god this made me tear up a bit, it’s so heartwarming, thank you. I get caught up easily in the mindset that nobody cares and it’s pointless to reach out for help bc I’ll probably get hurt even more by trying and that makes me forget that people are nice, especially in the lgbtq community. I think I’ve been lacking this sense of community due to the self isolation. 
Also: I wouldn’t worry about the “me realizing stuff really early” thing, I was basically raised on the internet and I don’t think I would ever figure myself out if I hadn’t landed on some trans forums by an accident haha."	g9b95g	NonBinary	17	0.88	2020-04-27 22:44:48
saw a couple of tiktok about neos that made me mad	"It was a couple of tiktoks going through lesbiansnowwhite's videos and going on about how these neos are a mockery of trans people and that they're not transphobic and the usual stuff.

1. You are transphobic since these are in fact trans/nonbinary people using these pronouns and you're making fun of them or invalidating their use of pronouns which can increase depression in trans/nonbinary indivuals

2. Gender isn't a simple case of boy, girl, neutral and neutral-fem/masc. I sometimes words that vaguely relate to something can help describe it better. I know myself being genderfluid that not all days I know my gender or pronouns. Ze/zem gives me good euphoria on most days because of this and describing my gender as liquidy because I know I have a gender but I don't know what is because it doesn't quite fit into any gender box helps me understand myself better, same with describing it as mer or alien because that helps me feel more comfortable in my body.

So why is it so bad to let people use pronouns relating to that gender expression? Simply because it isn't bad they just are transphobic.

I just hate it when these videos pop up in my feed and jump-dysphoria me. Sjdosk"	"it’s so annoying when i see these videos on my fyp. as someone who uses neos i genuinely do not know how they think i am somehow “damaging” the image of trans people and how i’m “taking things too far” even tho that’s what people used to say about nonbinary people and they/them pronouns. it might also be due to the fact that a lot of the time it’s neurodivergent people using neopronouns and xenopronouns - i mean they think we’re weird and cringy anyway but my autism literally makes me feel gender differently to neurotypical people. i use these pronouns because  i feel like they fit me better than then usual he/she/they, which is literally no different than using any of those pronouns. 

i’ve also heard them say that we’re just “making up words/pronouns at this point” well, buddy, you’re gonna be surprised when you find out that that’s kinda how every word came about. shocking i know. 

i’ve genuinely thought about completely deleting tiktok because of this cause these videos are just so draining to watch.
I deleted tiktok, it served me all LGBT content and most of it was crap. I do get that some people legit make up ridiculous pronouns to make a joke: nor/mal, your majesty, etc. but neopronouns in general have been used since the 1800s. If they actually wanted to make a decent criticism then they wouldnt just be picking out people to mock, its just all about get views.

DAE hate gender specific terms (e.i ladies, gents, guys, gals etc) but also don't mind them?	"It's weird. Today I was sitting with a friend who uses she/her pronouns and someone refered to us as ladies. It made me feel a little mad for a second before realising this person knew I was nb (They weren't calling me a lady in a derogatory way that's just how they like to greet people). 

But also today I was asking a male identifing friend what I should wear later this week because I like to prepare and he said 'it must be a woman thing' (in reference to organising outfits) and it made me upset because he doesn't know I'm nb. 

It's like people can call me female gender specific terms as long as they know I'm nb and they aren't doing it maliciously? Anyone else feel like this or am I just picky lmao?"	"That's not picky at all, it's just knowing the intent behind how you're being addressed, and you have a right to know if you're being disrespected or ridiculed or not.
I hate all of them except guys
Yep! I really hate gender specific terms and I hate even more when people say ""that must be an \[insert gender\] thing.""
My friend likes to greet people with “hey lady” and I hate that so I asked her to use gender neutral terms. And she did. She knows I’m nb so it was fine.
I feel like guys has become a gender neutral term, along with dude and bro

"""she/they/he just wants attention"" Deep dive into why people say this and what it means."	"I just saw the story about Demi Lovato who has asked to move back to ""she/her"" pronouns from ""they/them"" -- I don't know anything about Demi. But, I thought it was nice to have a story about someone not being totally sure and changing back. Hilariously, the same people who got mad at her for the first change are mad again. I probably should have avoided twitter comments, they were pretty ignorant.   


There was one comment that I saw over and over ""She's just doing this for attention."" This comment really jumped out at me. You could say it felt like \*I\* was being attacked each time I read this. It's an accusation I'm really scared of. It's hard to think of anything more horrible than being told that I'm doing things ""for attention.""  


I had to back up and examine my response to all of this. Because being a little more cool headed it's not the meanest thing that could be said about a person. Everyone wants attention. Why have I learned to read this as some degrading insult.   


(Reading the words on the screen I could \*hear\* the way they might sound when spoken. The contempt, the dismissal.)  


So, one of the things that makes this hurtful is how it belittles any person's desire to figure out who we are. It makes it seem like questioning, and not being certain are a kind of failure. Then there is also the contempt. This is more a matter of tone.  These words can convey that one is taking up too much space, or worse that one isn't worthy of space, or patience.   


The hilarious thing is if I ever worked up the nerve to use different pronouns or a different name. And Told everyone. And then slowly... realized ... nope. This isn't it for me. Attention would be the last thing in the universe I'd want. I'd just hope that people could not be too mad, I'd hope for patience.    


So why do people say ""She just wants attention?"" I'm not talking about just Demi. I'm talking about all the times I've heard this.  I reacted to the story because the words were so familiar and ... raw even.   


Maybe that's why it's such a gut punch. It's the absolute opposite of what one wants.   


(about me: cis, bi, from the bronx. I'm not out. Tried and gave up when I was young long long ago. Just trying to understand that. )"	"I just want to clarify that Demi just added she/her pronouns and still uses they/them as well. The headlines on the media are wrong and clickbait.
I mean I hope that everyone on this sub knows that ""attention"" has nothing to do with it. She's seeking her truth like the rest of us. Day by day, hour by hour. It's just that her platform is so visible that anytime they make a change, it's immediately under scrutiny by millions of people.

And what if they ARE doing it for attention? What's so wrong with that? Sometimes people need attention in specific areas of their lives. She's not hurting anyone. End of.
Bruh. People turning back to their original gender can happen. They can’t assume that she’s doing it for attention since those types of occurrences happens.
It's just another way to defecate on people for doing things they don't like/don't agree with.

I mean, when someone becomes a born-again Christian, nobody says they're just doing it for the attention, and when someone leaves the church and becomes an atheist, they don't say that.

(It's possible I'm wrong, of course...)"	weur35	NonBinary	17	0.91	2022-08-03 02:43:34
Things Have Been Awk Since I Came out to my mom	"Oof. Alright. Alright, let’s go. So I decided the other night to come out to my mom as nb, and while the reaction wasn’t terrible, it wasn’t great either. She went through the whole series of “I’ve always seen you as my daughter” and how I’ll always be her daughter, but she respects how I feel but she can never change her pronouns for me or the way she refers to me, and that I have to respect her too. That I can’t be selfish and expect her to change how she sees and references me, and it’s disrespectful of me to expect that of her when I’ve been her little girl all her life, blah blah. 

I thought she was getting better though, she told me she had looked up some nb tiktoks and brought up instances from when I was a kid to now, saying I’ve always been a bit of a mix in regards to my gender expression. But she still won’t switch pronouns and lately I feel like she’s actually been harping more on feminine terms of endearment for me.

Case in point would be this morning. I was getting dressed for work and she comes in, sees me, comments on how pretty I am. Now I like being called pretty but lately my dusphoria has been bad since at my new job I’m constantly given she/her pronouns, and I’ve been masc leaning for a good while now. She looks at me and repeats “do you feel pretty?” In a way that feels like she’s egging me on, and so I kinda was just like. Nah, I actually feel handsome today. 

That just made her blow her lid. She kept telling me how it wasn’t fair of me to expect her to say that kind of stuff, “oh come on”, ect. And I was so frustrated I just told her to drop it and I couldn’t wait to move out and I left the house. It’s so draining. I hardly said anything and yet the cis get so mad. At 24 I shouldn’t have to deal with this, and one day I’ll be on low dose T, but damn it’s just a constant struggle."	"Your identity is important, it is in no way selfish of you to expect that she try refer to you correctly. Just because she doesn't understand should never mean that she gets to be disrespectful toward you. At the same time, I can understand how for people who have only ever known two things, it can be hard for them to accept your reality. I feel like reminding people while trying not to make a big deal about it works the best for helping them get used to it. Best of luck, keep standing up for yourself :)
This is honestly the big reason I could never come out to my parents as non-binary (or bisexual for that matter). Ever since I was a kid, my parents would comment on anything that I did that deviated from gender norms. Sure, they let me get dolls and more feminine clothing, but it was always something that they commented on as if they regretted the fact that I was deviating from my assigned gender. Even to this day, if I do something that slightly deviates from my assigned gender, I get comments like ""well your mom always wanted a girl"" or something blatantly homophopic. It's also why I have a tendency to dress more masculine or gender neutral around them regardless of how uncomfortable it makes me. I honestly can't imagine what it's like for you right now, even since I moved out, I'm still very uncomfortable enacting my gender identity even though I know that the fear is irrational. Take care of yourself, and I honestly wish the best for you ❤️
These are just my opinions so you know, subjective.

If you tell someone you're pronouns and that you are enby you can't expect a change from day 0 and it be perfect BUT I think you can expect effort. Trying to honour your wishes and how you view yourself in the world.

From those examples I read it that it's taking some time to get her head round it, it takes time for some people, almost like it's ""let's see how long this phase lasts. A continuous conversation of how this is impacting you and making you feel uncomfortable could help.

Rn I'd suggest time, let you and her cool off a bit. I always think of coming out as like simultaneously really important and then just how we are and telling someone ""hey I feel like this and experience the world like this"".

And lastly but by means leastly, loads of love to you. It's hard to open up, I've only opened up to friends I trust at the moment as I see if this is right for me. At the moment it's sitting well but you know I'm giving myself time as well (I'm just a chicken lol). Lots of love to you and stay safe.
Thank you so much!! I feel the same way, I understand it’s hard for her as much as it’s hard for me, and I can see her trying so it’s a tough situation. But I’m trying to treat it with kindness though it’s hard not to get defensive!
This hit home for me! I’ve always had comments like “well your father always wanted a boy” or just general things like “you walk like a boy” and ect. Jokingly of course, but you can feel the LOWKEY transphobia/homophobia in it. It’s vicious. I think I was blessed only because I came out as bi to them when I was younger, and though I got a lot of flak for it they eventually came around. Now though? My gender is a whole other issue I’m not sure they’ll ever truly understand, especially not my dad, and in my Hispanic family it’s tough to even imagine.
Agree, I think it’ll just take time, and I can’t expect a change super quickly… but I think I’ll have to have more convos with her and see where it leads. We are on stable footing again now, I think the most important thing to me is that I do see there is effort, Even if it’s not at the level I want now. But I’m patient and I just need to be more forthcoming and understanding myself too. Don’t call yourself a chicken!! Coming out is hard and starting with those closest to you (aka your trusted friends) is one of the best calls ☺️ Also wishing you the best of luck!
I can definitely sympathize with that. My dad's side of the family is French-Canadian and super Catholic, whereas my mom's side is Eastern European. Flexibility in sexuality and gender identity are just not talked about at all, or mocked when they do come up. My fiancee is Hispanic and has had a very similar experience to me when it comes to having their family accept their gender/sexual identity. I still haven't come out to any of my family, and although I am technically in a hetero-passing relationship, I am still finding it difficult to push gender boundaries around both of our families.
If I could bottle the love on this sub I would. TY so much. Just in case you need to hear it... you are so loved and valid in how you feel right now. Have a good weekend x
Augh it’s always that awkward tread with family! I actually had a discussion with my mom about my identity, and I admitted that I tended to be distant from most of my fam cause I always knew I felt a little different. At first thought it was BC I was bi, but now I have another later to the cake lol. But while understanding sexuality may be possible for my family, gender not so much. And with those Christian values of which I also relate to you both, it was hard enough with sexuality. I’m starting to come to terms with the fact that most of my family will never know and I’ll always have to present as femme passing unless one day I go on T, and from then on it’ll be a learning experience of who stays and goes. It makes me sad but that’s how it is for my culture and family religion I think. 

I am wishing you the best of luck! It’s lovely to know that you have the support of your fiancé, and they have your support in turn. And I hope one day you get the confidence to explore and enact your gender identity!! It’s a transition, I’m in the middle of it too, but it feels fantastic to just.. explore with gender expression. Clothing, hair, ect… it’s a lovely experience and I am wishing it for you too, whenever you are ready of course!"	phy9l9	NonBinary	16	0.95	2021-09-04 19:45:02
Got harrassed by a transphobic toxic player on a PvP game.	"Sorry if my writing isn't the best- english is my 3rd language.

This just happened today and my fingers are fidgeting because of the sheer anger i feel right now.

So basically I was playing some PvP game (not going to name anything along the story) i was talking to a person there i just met.. You know, basic chit chat.That was until some other player came over and went ""Calm down ladies""  insinuating that we were noisy though i don't think we were- and straight away killing both of us...(for context, i am biologically male and identify as gender neutral/nonbinary)

I shook off the assumption thinking nothing of it though it clearly ticked me off-

So i ironically went ""Hey there buckaroo, i'm gender neutral and you better respect that!"" heading his way.

This is where the toxicity started:

\-""What the f\*ck do you mean , there are only girls and boys that play this"" he said as he started to attack again.

\-""Hey, ngl that's pretty offensive you should stop-"" (after that they went to spawn-kill me when i was afk/typing on the chat, so i normally got mad at this pettiness)

I can't recall what i said but it was just some long tirade about how he's the lowest f\*cking transphobic and toxic player i've ever met on this community and that it's because of dry ass garbage human beings like them that society is so unaccepting of people like us in the LGBTQ+..

A bit later we stopped fighting and he decided to ""talk"" as he said.

I thought that we would wrap things up and just end it but turns out no, what he meant by ""talk"" was literally telling me to go ""rant about trans rights on reddit or something  because this game is not suited for your behavior""In a clear passive-agressive tone as if his hateful comments weren't against the rules in the first place, no sh\*t my guy.

This is like the first time i've ever experienced harrassment for being nonbinary and it hurts like crap tho what i experienced is nothing compared to actual physical harrassment against queer people.

Anyways that was it pretty much,i'm not writing this to send hate to anyone but rather to relieve my anger towards this situation.

I feel much better writing my thoughts down here in this sub since it's full of people who probs experienced the same thing,thanks for reading! :)"	"Saw your post on the game's subreddit, didn't know you also posted this here. Yeah, from this more in depth explanation that's a lot worse that I originally thought. As a fellow non-binary person, reading this sucks. Glad you feel better now though! :D
Yeah unfortunately gaming spaces aren’t the most friendly places to anyone really. Homophobia transphobia sexism racism and like every other shitty mentality are the norm not the exception
I think people should be more aware of their wording and things, but to a certain degree, us queer folks should be able to understand when they aren't doing it intentionally, I mean, I accidentally miss gender myself sometimes. I think his original comment where he used 'ladies' was not an attempt of being rude, it seems to me he was just messing about. However, I do not know the tone of what he said next, so I can't say he was just being ignorant. I strongly believe that a lot of people just don't have the knowledge of the community, and therefore say things such as 'there's only boys and girls'. As a member of the community, I feel as if we need to have a better understanding of those around us too. I feel this situation could have possibly been avoided if you didn't take it so personally. Now, I completely disagree with his further actions, and I am genuinely empathetic, I am sorry they made you feel this way. I just feel there is something both communities can do to make life a little easier. I am very glad you spoke about this however, it was a very brave thing to do, and you were right to do so. Please don't take this comment negatively, I really hope you don't have anything like this happen again. 
(Beau, they/them)
I feel you. There was an article about how the Kennedys gave their daughter a lobotomy, and some idiot compared gender reassignment surgery to lobotomization. Even used the whole ""well being trans is a mental illness. It's in the dmv"". Yeah...but it isn't in the most recent one dude, because that was incorrect to have put it there I  the first place. And this dude was really adamant about argueing his case. I don't get why people feel so righteous shitting on something that has nothing to do with them. If they are so offended that trans people exist, take it up with your god.
I absolutely understand that and i did think about how people around feel,but i really could tell he was clearly against me personally.(??)

I moved on from the ""ladies"" part and didn't take it seriously,though it did sound ironical to them.I just shook it off i guess,but the rest was clearly hateful and against me.

I don't really know how to express it myself so i might blurt out the wrong words since i wrote this while i was still really shaken and upset.

Thanks for the reply Beau!  (the fact that ""beau"" means ""beautiful"" in french really gave me an wholesome vibe reading this lol.)
Thank you, and i absolutely agree!

I don't see how me being myself could affect this person in any way
I completely get what you're saying, I was never involved with the situation, so I can't tell how they said things and the emphasis behind the words. I want you to know that I'm in full support of you, and was only trying to express another side, I feel both communities can learn. Thank you for replying to me!

(P.S, I chose the name Beau for a few reasons, one of them being for it's French translation! It was really lovely to see it being used, and even better to see it made you feel good too :) x)"	gokjdb	NonBinary	18	0.92	2020-05-22 14:38:31
Getting repeatedly misgendered is so frustrating	"Basically as the title says. I'm non-binary (they/them) but AFAB, and it is so annoying when people call me ""she,"" especially my coworkers. I told people when I first came out that it was okay if they messed up at first, but I've worked with this one person for almost six months now and she keeps misgendering me (doesn't even remember to correct herself). I tell her I'm not mad but that I would appreciate it if she made more of a conscious effort because she's been corrected by management now. One of my workers will just call me ""the penguin"" which just feels like another slap to the face since I feel like people see me as an animal or something.  I just wish people would be more understanding and recognize that this is my identity we're talking about here! Thanks for letting me rant 😔"	"Ugh, that’s super shit. I suppose you could refuse to acknowledge them if they misgender you, but that could also come across as childish. Idk there sadly isn’t a way to Ludovico technique people into being better, but sometimes I wish there were. 

Hopefully things will get better in time. Until then, stay strong and know you will always find camaraderie when things are hard.
Part of me wants to ignore her because she constantly claims that her cousin is nonbinary and she can ""get their pronouns right"" but not mine :/"	123pt86	NonBinary	15	0.95	2023-03-27 15:11:31
I think I messed up coming out.	"So a few months back I finally got tired of being called my agab pronouns and my birth name and came out to my friends. My boyfriend has known for a while, but I don't think he understands that I'm not a transmale (with no offense towards them, of course) and my intent is not to transition into a man. This is a story for a later date, but it's somewhat important.

When I told my friends that I'm nonbinary, I kinda got sheepish and told them all they could still my agab pronouns if they wanted along with my given name. I chickened out last second just for it to be convenient for everyone. Yeah, I told them I'm nonbinary but nothing has changed. And it's not like I want it tattooed on my forehead and want to make it always a topic of discussion, but I don't know would it really hurt so much if ya sprinkled some they's and them's in there? 

 Maybe that's selfish of me, but I know it's my own fault, I should have been more firm about these things. Now I just feel bad every time I attempt to correct my pronouns because of the rules I already set. I have to commit to what I said or look like a hypocrite who is just  finding things to be mad at. This honestly feels worse than not having said anything at all."	"Just be honest with people. Tell them hey, I would really prefer you call me blank and use blank pronouns. It makes me really uncomfortable when you don't. 

Your friends and partner shouldn't need anything else. People grow and people change, you are allowed to express that. It is by no means selfish to want people to call you in a way that makes you happy, or at least more comfortable. They should care about you and want to make you happy and comfortable. If they are new to this some patience with then is fair, though in my experience, the more someone cared about me the better they were about gendering me correctly.

I hope all goes well! Remember you are great and you are valid! You deserve to be addressed as you are, and if your identity changes in the future, that is totally fine as well. Life is about learning and growing, we all change and that is ok!
I did something similar when I first came out. It can be hard to be firm, especially when you're doing this for the first time. A thing that I had some luck with is gradually modifying expectations- for example, going, ""hey I know I said (deadname) was okay, but can you try using (chosen name)?"" Alternatively, you can be upfront and just tell your friends you panicked.
There’s nothing wrong with going back and telling your friends that you want them to use x pronouns. They’re your friends- they will understand. But you’re right, you really do have to be firm about these things and enforce it for people to get the idea. Be honest, open and clear. They may have questions, or be hesitant as to how to approach the change. You didn’t mess up coming out. It just takes time for everything to switch over, and some people will definitely have a little bit of a hard time. Just stay firm about what you want, and the rest should follow suite. My coming out was really similar to yours, I remember getting shy and telling people that i wanted he/him pronouns, but a lot of my family/friends didn’t catch on at first and I wasn’t sure how to correct them. I just slowly learned to start correcting people politely and if they didn’t change what they were doing, I spoke to them privately about their behavior and how it made me feel. It’s okay to start fresh with a new conversation. You could explain how you felt at the time of coming out and why you were a bit nervous, and then say what you’d like them to do now that you have it more thought out. You’ll be just fine! ❣️
You didn't mess it up. Your feelings just changed a bit and you got more secure in what you wanted and needed. It's totally legit to go back to your friends and say ""Hey, things have developed a bit since I last spoke to you about it, it'd be really great if you could use this name and pronouns.""

A lot of us have feelings and identities that change over time. I tried out three different names before settling and friends were fine with that. There's no final, authoritative act of coming out, just a continual process.

Yep, not gender related, I changed the name I went by when I was 18/19 and didn’t “enforce it” innitially. When I did, it wasn’t as big deal as I thought. As one friend said, “we love you, we want you to be happy and if you wanna go by x name cause it’s more comfortable, I just want to know what you’d prefer” never looked back at correcting people again. It turns out, I’m not as picky about my name in general, I correct people when I’m introduced, answer with it if they ask, and say no to a few nicknames/variants."	bmh6bw	NonBinary	15	0.95	2019-05-09 08:31:08
Can i truly be a femme afab nb?	"like the title says, I'm afab nonbinary(?) and I've been really confused about my identity vs my expression. I don't feel like a girl and I'm uncomfortable with being ""perceived"" as female, she/her pronouns give me shivers, being referred to as my feminine name feels wrong and I feel more insulted than complimented when I'm called pretty or beautiful. I get a sense of ""euphoria"" from more neutral and masc pronouns and being referred to as more masculine names, for example, I did a prank with a friend where they referred to me as Roman and I really liked it, kind of felt like a rush to my brain? I most of the time feel no connection to my female characteristics (except my thighs, thick thighs save lives) and I sometimes desire to be tall and muscular and generally man-like, I have a lot of gender envy(?) where I sometimes see men and get so mad I don't look like them and if I could choose how I was born I would 100% choose to be a man. But I constantly feel like a fraud since I don't like typical androgyny, I love skirts and crop tops and accessories, etc... Sometimes I want to dress very girly with skirts and corsets and other times I want to wear oversized shirts and baggy pants with a beanie or something, Basically a constant loop of trendy ""indie"" girl vs ""indie"" boy. I always want to be perceived as male and even if I'm wearing a tutu I still want to pack and bind. Because of this I'm soooooo confused if I'm faking it or not, I can explain alot of the things that would make me NB with other things, like maybe I don't want to be manly but just tall and fit, and maybe I'm not having gender envy and it's instead suppressed attraction to men, maybe i like different pronouns because its new and cool? Gender is such a loosely defined concept that at this point I'm hoping someone can just read this and diagnose me with cis or trans or genderfluid or literally anything :("	"do whatever the fuck u want fam

AFAB enbies can be femme and AMAB enbies can be masc, there are no rules
Typical androgyny is a fickle ideal and your clothes have no power over what gender you are.

Be strong and brave and handsome in a princess dress.

Gendered clothing is a temporary and arbitrary concept based on many, many influences of culture, colonization, religion, industry, sexism, and the culmination of a million butterflies flapping their wings. What’s considered masculine clothing at one fixed point can be feminine clothing at another. Liking how you look but being concerned with how it causes people to interpret you is an experience many of us share. Embrace what gives you euphoria, you have this time on planet Earth and spending it unhappy for other people is such a loss. We love you and accept you as you are and as you want to be.
there are no rules and no cops. you can really, truly, do whatever the fuck you want
Yeah, i'll repeat what others have said in the comments, you can literally be how you are more confortable, that's kinda the point here.
There are transmen who are femme af, why wouldnt NB folks be allowed? 😂
There are no rules, just have fun being you. If anyone ever says that you’re “not trans/enby enough,” you have my blessing to punch them."	kk52qv	NonBinary	16	0.95	2020-12-25 20:03:42
Anxiety about coming out - not for why you'd expect	"I've recently made the connection about my gender identity and why I've never felt totally 'right' as a woman but also never 100% wrong as one either. My husband has been unendingly supportive, checking in about calling me certain things, do I still want to be referred to as a wife or not, things like that, and letting me borrow his flannel shirts and tee shirts for my more non-femme days. (Bonus of marrying someone the same size as you!)

I know my parents won't be upset/worried/angry - they're fairly progressive for their age/demographic, and were supportive when I came out as 'not straight'. They are also supportive of my younger sister, who about a year ago came out as NB. (She/her/they/them)

This is where my problem is. My sister gets quite possessive of things she identifies as. I have been privately practicing as a casual witch for about 4 years, she has been publicly for a couple less. When I stopped being so private about it, she was cross that I had copied her. When I asked for ideas on my facebook about how short I should cut my hair, she sub-posted about how she was tired of people copying her. Which is frustrating as I grew my hair til age 8/9 and then cut it into a pixie, then grew it until 18 when I cut it into a bob - 29 now so I am due anyway! She was mad that I came out as not straight first, despite that not even being my plan, I just forgot I hadn't told my mum I had a girlfriend and dropped it into a conversation off handedly. 

I know she is going to be mad when I come out more visibly. I just feel like the one person who should be welcoming and supportive about my gender identity is the one person who won't be.

Just posting for support, and wondering if anyone else has had this too?"	"Quite honestly, she needs to grow up.  How old is she?  A young adult I'd imagine.  She'd being childish.  It doesn't matter how similar you are.  In fact, I'd celebrate having so much in common with my sibling.  More to talk about, really.  But if she can't be civil or kind about your coming out, then she doesn't need to be spoken to until she can be.  Just tell her, ""This is who I am, and if you don't accept it, then we don't have anything to talk about until you can be civil.""  It's like not doing something because  it'll give a child a tantrum.  Do it anyway, and let the child burn itself out.  You'll be happier for it.
If that’s who you are then that’s who you are! I’m sure you’re sister will get over it. Maybe incorporate them into the conversation. Ask them how they knew and tell them that you’re feeling the same way. Tell them before your parents. That way, they might feel more included.
I know it’s not as easy to put into action as to say but you’re not responsible for other people’s feelings. Your sister has no say in your identity. That’s YOUR right to exercise as you see fit. If she doesn’t like it then that’s her issue to work out.
That's totally understandable. BUT. You are not ""copying"" anything. This is who you are. It's always hard to be who you are, but if your sibling gets mad then they are not giving you the respect you deserve, which has been afforded to them. 

Probably worth that discussion if she does that to you. It's not fair, and would be incredibly invalidating for you (at least it would be for me). Family is the hardest to deal with IMO.  I hope this goes well, but don't apologise for it, you are awesome, and deserve your fullest life.
My sister and I are NB and are trying to come out around the same time, and she’s my biggest supporter. If your sister was more mature she’d know how important this is to you, and how gender identity isn’t something you can own for yourself and deny to others."	d85pt4	NonBinary	17	0.96	2019-09-23 12:16:48

"""calling urself trans without dysphoria makes it looks like a choice""??"	"Hi, questioning my gender here. Never felt really connected to ""being a girl"" (im afab). Kinda indifferent abd disconnected towards it. In my childhood I never questioned anything. Just took is as ""oh I have a female body, I dont want a male body so im a girl"". I only started to question myself when I learned abt the many enby identies. I started reading abt it certain labels. Now, that im starting to experiment w/ my gender, I think I'd actually be happier if I were to live as an enby. I mean, I cant as my environment is enby-phobic. But ideally, if I were to be the last person on earth (or if I were to have an accepting environment), I would. I get really euphoric when ppl cant tell my gender (not when ppl bully me bcoz of it ofc). Ive joined some trans servers on discord to experiment w/ the enby label and I think it really fits the way I see myself. I finally feel connected to a gender. 

Problem is, I dont have (alot) of dysphoria. I am uncomfortable looking at myself in the mirror. Seeing my girl-ish face, girls-ish hair, shoulders, chest, waist, hips. But it doesnt causes ""severe distress"". I have little-to-no uncomfortable feeling being refered to as my agab. It doesnt cause me to feel rlly uncomfortable, its more like ""oh this is wrong, but I can still function"". I mean, IRL, I am still female-presenting so I cant really be mad at ppl for seeing me as a girl. When I look at myself in the mirror, I see a girl as well so yeah. They dont know better. Even if I were to change my presentation, my family/friends would still see me as a girl as they just know me as such. Two IRL friends kinda know im questioning, so when they refer to me by feminine terms, it does kinda suck. In this case, they sorta *know* im not a girl. Around them, I cant just slide it away as ""oh they dont know better!"". So maybe the social uncomfortableness will increase if I start to come out. Must say, the idea of having to live as a woman for the rest of my life, makes me kinda sad. 

Ive been talking to some trans folks and some of them say you dont need dysphoria, others say you do. One person said the letter said ""if you dont have dysphoria, you are making being trans a choice"", ""are you transitioning for fun??"", ""you will regret transitioning without dysphoria"". I didnt really had an argument against their statement. 

These ppl even mess with my desires. What if *I will* regret it? What if im just trying to be different? I honestly dont even want to transition right now due to my environment. It honestly sounds so stupid to say ""I dont have dysphoria + I dont wanna transition, but im enby, really!"".

I asked my cis friend why he identified as his agab. He just told me ""oh I have a dick"". If thats all gender is for cis ppl, then maybe im just really reaching here."	">Problem is, I dont have (alot) of dysphoria. I am uncomfortable looking   
at myself in the mirror. Seeing my girl-ish face, girls-ish hair,   
shoulders, chest, waist, hips.

This is literally dysphoria, even if you don't consider it ""severe"". The other stuff you described is also dysphoria. You may have a bit of imposter syndrome going on here. As others said, you don't need dysphoria to be trans, but you already have it? I think sometimes for nonbinary folks it's harder to recognize dysphoria or it's harder to pinpoint because we don't want to be the opposite gender and probably also like some parts of our presentation and/or are neutral about it. It's also more apparent when you change your appearance in some way like a binder, haircut, etc. and then you find that you are experiencing euphoria with this change of appearance.
Trans people claiming that to be trans you need to feel dysphoria are called transmedicalists, and are extremists.

Don't let them influence you. You and you alone have the right to decide what is wrong and what's right for you.

They are also completely wrong in their statement, by the way. The definition of transgender is, to not identify with your assigned gender at birth. Transition or not, you're still considered trans by the simple fact of being non binary.
Hi, it's mostly accepted that one can be trans without dysphoria, dysphoria is not a requirement to being trans or non-binary, and certainly, it does not make you any less valid if you don't have dysphoria. The last thing we as a community should do is to gatekeep people. The only thing you need to identify as trans, is feeling trans. Though I'll say, some non-binary people do not identify with the label of 'trans', but in general 'non-binary' belongs under the 'trans' umbrella so if you feel 'non-binary', you are probably also trans. 

Though, I feel like sometimes dysphoria gets reduced to only the body dysphoria too much. There is also mind and social dysphoria I think. I'm not very knowledgeable I think because I  have little dysphoria, plus I'm also in most situations, presenting as my agab for safety reasons. So, I do get the 'this is wrong but I guess I'll work with it' kinda feeling. The most I can offer you on this is my own experience, I have some dysphoria regarding my chest, but it's more like a slight discomfort around it. I do not like gendered terms surrounding my agab, like 'woman' or 'girl', and I feel more discomfort around that.

On the 'not having dysphoria making trans a choice' though, I'll say that none of us 'chose' to feel the way we do about our own gender, the only choice folks that have little to no dysphoria is making is, to either live as our true happiest self, or to 'make do with' our agab and continue to be seen as our agab. Some people are okay with making do with, but for some of us making do with is more like forcing ourselves. We are still trans, because I didn't choose to feel like my agab doesn't suit me. Plus with that the argument becomes, at what point is your dysphoria enough? At what point are you trans enough? And honestly, I think the happier choice for everyone, including you and me, is really just to say that 'people can identify as trans without having dysphoria, but some people do, and it affect their mental health severely', so that everyone having 0, or 0.1, 30, or 100 dysphoria can all still feel included, and part of the community.
A trans friend told me as I was trying to wrap my head around my gender identity that it isn't dysmorphia that is important. It's euphoria.

I think that's the better measure.

I likewise am AFAB NB, and don't really feel extreme dysphoria. I certainly don't like my boobs and wish to yeet them, but I don't feel horrid because of them, usually.

But getting my first binder and the feeling I got looking at myself in the mirror? I don't care what anyone says, I know how that made me feel.
I (AMAB, 37) lived until about 30 not questioning anything either. Did I experience disphoria, before? No, but that was never on the table as a thing that existed. I was a male, but I couldn't find any way of being a male that didn't feel off. I started looking up ways of presenting that didn't enhance my natural masculine looks, and after a year or so, I felt I identified the most with the idea of being agender, where I don't want to be a male, but neither a female, and in fact I despise being tied to one or the other in any way, and I just want to be alright and present with whatever I feel like doing. I just want to feel alright, to be able to feel alright with my appearance, and my AGAB didn't let me do that, but just made me feel like a fraud. It's hard to get to my age and never having experienced being alright with your self-image, and I've only managed that by incorporating to my life things that are stereotypically of women.

Then, the opposite of what you're worried about happened to me: I didn't consider myself trans because, to me, being trans was a way more complex and intense experience than mine. For me, trans people were just people who transitioned from one gender to the other, or, at most, people who were NB and their feelings and dysphoria were strong enough to go through HRT or alike. Or people who were activists. And then I was called transphobic by some for not identifying as trans, when in fact I didn't identify as trans because of respect for 'actual trans' people. Ironic. And tragic that there're people that will put up fights because of that.

After another while, I understood that anyone who rejects their AGAB is technically trans. That idea did make some sense, I was trans because I had zero attachment to my AGAB and I was trying something else out of the binary, but I wouldn't identify as such because it's not as if I'm really managing to get away from my AGAB for the moment (I'm not the most capable person in the world, exactly).

During this whole ordeal, which took a few years, feelings of dysphoria that weren't there before arose. That wasn't nice, but it is what it is, and it's normal that those feelings enhance as you start trying different things and your feelings towards your body change.

At the moment, I can explain that I'm technically trans, only that my whole feelings in general are lowkey and constantly changing. I identify as agender if anyone asks, because sometimes people ask, but I hate any attention, so it's not as if I go around telling people.

With this I'm saying that you've got to do yourself for a while, see where it goes. You do say you've got some dysphoria, so don't let anyone bully you with that idea that it isn't a choice. Feelings aren't a choice, but there's a choice in daring to try something different that feels alright for you and makes you feel alright, and it's from that choice, that your feelings will change.
*Any* amount of dysphoria is too much. Full stop. But people are putting so much emphasis on it because at some point some asshole decided that the best metric for allowing people to transition was ""how much does this person hate themselves/their life?"" In order for this to be 'okay' they be to be *miserable*. Think about that for a second. That's extremely fucked up. What would make you happier to live in your body? How long can you wear a pair of shoes that are only a little too small before you get a blister?
Truscum's gonna gatekeep. You don't fit their definition so you must be faking, and trying to steal their identity. They need to fuckin' *chill.*
it's not a choice to have a disconnect between our bodies and our gender experience. dysphoria is not required. cis people don't even think about this stuff from what i gather, so just the act of questioning and settling on an identity that doesn't reflect our agab IS being trans. you are valid, your experiences are valid, anyone making you feel otherwise is gatekeeping.
If you do not fully identify as a man or a woman, if those labels don't resonate with you and feel like home, please hear me: 

*You are nonbinary and you are nonbinary enough.*

(If you so choose to use the label!)
You don’t having dysphoria is a blessing. Don’t fall down the rabbit hole I had to with friends saying similar things about non-binary people “cis people playing pretend” attitude.

It’s worthless and harmful gatekeeping. The euphoria is what’s important, it’s not some suffering Olympics where you have to suffer yay much to count as trans.

And you aren’t making being trans a choice. The only “choice” is identifying with that label. A closeted gay person who identifies to others as straight is still gay.

TLDR: euphoria is the key factor of being trans, chase that, be happy and keep killing it!
The claim that dysphoria is necessary to be trans automatically reinforces a binary system. 

Now, while many nonbinary people do experience dysphoria (and you seem too, a little), if everyone **had to** experience dysphoria, what would the ""goal"" for nonbinary people even be? A completely androgynous body? what does that even mean, especially when considering European patriarchic beauty standards (thin, white body with masculinized chest)? 

(I hope what I'm trying to get across is somehow understandable, I'm very much not a transmed)
Dysphoria does not mean you’re trans. You can be dysphoric and cis or not be dysphoric and be trans. Every single person’s experience is unique and don’t let some gatekeepers try and sway you from being your true self
It can take a lot of time to unravel dysphoria if you have it. You don’t need to have it. But you almost might not be able to identify what it is right away it might take months or years. 

I feel like some of the opinions you got from others are a little harsh and tilted. Everyone has issues so I wouldn’t put too much stock in those opinions trying to tell you what you are or aren’t. 

I would listen to your gut. People don’t choose to be trans or non binary just because it’s fun to make life harder. We do it because we need to to make our lives better. Cis people who are cis because they have a dick kinda shows how cut and dry it is for them. Plus everything is a spectrum you don’t have to be trans in the same way another person is trans to be trans. 

Hang in there it’s complicated and can take your whole life to figure out. Don’t let some of the harmful comments you got get blown out of proportion!

PS 

Am I trans enough to be trans?  Non binary enough?  Queer enough?  This is super common for everyone to question from what I can tell. I definitely go through this.
>Problem is, I dont have (alot) of dysphoria. I am uncomfortable looking at myself in the mirror. Seeing my girl-ish face, girls-ish hair, shoulders, chest, waist, hips. But it doesnt causes ""severe distress"".


that's just mild dysphoria. 


that said you don't need dysphoria to be trans. what matters is what makes you feel right, not what makes you feel wrong.
Who cares if you have dysphoria or not? You can be trans (or enby) and not transition at all. Whatever choice makes you happy is the right choice. Even if you don’t transition you are still valid.
Dysphoria doesn’t make you valid and no one can tell you otherwise
ughh transmelicalists annoy the shit outta me, and by the way OP, they are usually not accepting of non binary folks. I wouldn't recommend listening to them.
Not OP, but thank you for your comment. I didn't really consider the social and mental dysphoria, dysphoria but didn't have a proper word for it. It makes sense to think of it like that and I'm having a lightbulb moment.
How can you be dysphoric and cis?
Not liking your body is actually really common. You could be dysphoric about how your butt is flat or how you have a bigger build. It really just stems from the pressure put on people to look like the ideal man/woman
Oh but they wouldnt have *gender* dysphoria right? I understand how e.g a man can feel dysphoric over being misgendered as a woman or a woman feeling dysphoric over their chest after they had their chest removed. But would an afab feel dysphoric over their chest bcoz its feminine?
They could feel insecure in their femininity if their chest is smaller than what is societally considered attractive
Yeah okay but not because they think their chest *is* feminine?

nonbinary friends did you ever had similar experience?	"I met this guy (let's call him david) he is a cis gay man that randomly texted me on discord. I said to david multiple times that I'm nonbinary aroace that he should lower his expectations if he has expectations. David didn't listen and was a very toxic person, he was mad when i didn't replied fast, he tried flirting with me multiple times, he was mad when i said that I'm going out with friends, he was very jelous all the time for no reason.  After 3 weeks of chatting, video calling with david (i know it's a bad decision, but i don't have lgbt friends so i stayed) he asked what gender i was born. I don't know what is the right thing to say in that situation, because i pass as a guy and as a women, people get confused all the time and people just care about it so much for no reason. And i knew if i replied to david that i was born a girl he would leave, if i would say i was born a boy he would stay and probably be a toxic friend. I didn't wanted to lie so I replied that it's not his bissunes, he got mad started saying transphobic slurs blocked me and i can't stop thinking about it. I'm blocked for a week now and i just think about this situation all the time. It was nice to have a friend i could relate to at least. So yea I wonder how many people had similar experience with toxic lgbt members.

Thanks for reading and also (english is not my first language)"	"The trash took itself out! Block him yourself and walk away…you deserve way better as a friend.
Hi there - and first of all sorry this happened to you!  

I mean non binary people get discriminated against a lot, one of the reasons being our society being used to being able to categorise people as either male or female. I'm nonbinary and I still struggle with it...         It seems to me that David is a person that does not want to wrap their mind around the concept of gender. 

You already said, his behaviour was toxic, and I can fully relate why you stayed. 

My advice on this (if you want it ofc, if not just ignore the last part) is to evaluate if you woukd stilk want him in your life or not. I mean how did he make you feel? Did he enrich your life in any way? And if yes was his behaviour and stuff worth it? 

Make a decision and then stick to it. If you decide to not want to interact with him, then block him.



I hope this helped a bit :D
As you said, he was toxic, you don't need that in your life. I'd rather have all straight friends than have one toxic gay ""friend"" that harasses and gets mad at you for things he has no right to be mad about. 

Like Cuglas said, the trash took itself out. I'll be your friend if you need one.
Gay men in my experience have shown me to be very toxic towards us, not all, but still enough. It’s a different form of toxic masculinity then cis het men have, but none the less disappointing ❤️
It’s so hard not to think about stuff like this, not to obsess over it even. But people like David have a lot of problems. They’re hurting in the inside. The things they say and do to you are really about them and not about you at all. So I would just try to think about something else. Don’t waste any more time feeling bad because of that guy. 

If you really want community with other lgbt people, there are lots of other ways to get it. I don’t really use discord so I can’t name any, but you can try looking for lgbt related servers. You can post and comment on this and lots of other subreddits. Idk if the country and city you live in are lgbt friendly at all, but if they are you can find local events to go to, or online groups made up of people local to your area. Most lgbt people will not be like David."	wdap22	NonBinary	15	0.9	2022-08-01 06:56:09
Family members and their hilarious jokes about gender	"Just needed to vent. I’m not out to most of my family. So seeing any of them during the holidays always has me on edge. Went to see my Dad briefly today and my uncle was there. Within seconds my uncle starts telling all of these “hilarious” jokes about using they/them pronouns.
I think what makes it worse, to me anyway, is he is the type of person that, had he known, he would be respectful to my face. If I wasn’t in a room full of people I probably would have called him on it, and I’m mad at myself that I didn’t. Just made me feel really shitty and invalidated, and then worse for feeling like a coward. My struggles with coming out just feel more insurmountable in those moments."	"I'm sorry, that shit is gross. It can be hard to figure out what to say, harder when the person is usually nice, and when saying something means coming out to a whole room of people.
Once he knows, if you decide to let him, I hope he reflects on this."	zuf0gx	NonBinary	15	0.91	2022-12-24 17:58:52

A Predicament ?	"Still getting the hang of reddit so bear with me - but I've been having some intense gender fucked feelings and I was wondering if there was anyone feeling similar?

I'm AFAB and have been out as a binary trans guy for about 5 or 6 years. I ID'ed as nb my senior year of highschool but switched for college, and now that I'm out of college I'm back to ID'ing as nb. However, everyone (obviously) sees me as a boy and recently it's been making me mad uncomfortable. I dont really feel any connection to ""being a man"" and I feel a strong kinship to being ""butch"". I've heard of nonbinary lesbians before and I toyed with the idea that I may be one - However: I still dont feel comfortable with she/her pronouns, and feel much more comfortable being called a boy over being called a woman, so I guess that's off the table.
It's been driving me bonkers!!! I feel like I'm fake trans (which I Know is bullshit)!!

I know theres no right way to be nonbinary and that labels arent everything, but sometimes I think it would be nice to just.... Fit Nicely somewhere"	"You fit right here. 😊

But for real good luck. ❤️
There's a long history of butch lesbians using he/him pronouns! They/them is generally accepted as well, I find. And finding out who you are is not a linear path, either, it doesn't mean you're a Fake Trans (though I feel u oh man). But people like us belong! It'll catch on, we're here to stay.
If you're looking into the gender fuckery in lesbian communities, I'd read Stone Butch Blues. There are nonbinary lesbians who use he/him pronouns, because gender is a wild ride. 
Your identity is completely valid, even if you're struggling with it. I used he + him for 3 years and it felt so uncomfortable for me. I've since come out as agender and pronouns they + them. I'm far more comfortable these days than before.

It's a never ending process of finding what makes you feel best. You belong and I wish you the absolute best. 
I feel this way too. I found that labels made me feel more oppressed instead of helping in any way. That's how I've felt for a really long time and it was a bit confusing to reconcile, to say the least. It's all so over complicated. I decided that at the end of the day, I'm just me. We're all just humans interacting in this big, weird world.
U are very sweet omg. Thank you
I've definitely been meaning to read it, but haven't for whatever reason. Maybe this is my sign to do so, lol. 
You're right abt gender tho. Absolutely wild.
It's nice to hear someone who's gone thru something similar tbh! I just... dont see myself as a man and I'm frustrated when other people see me as such. 
I'll get there eventually. Theres a nonbinary group that meets here and I've missed the past few meetings. I should defs start going again.

Mom refuses to use they/them pronouns	"I've talked to my mom a few times, usually spaced out by a week or so. She knows and 'accepts' that I'm nonbinary, but absolutely refuses to use they/them pronouns for me, just says ""No.""

She brought up the 'grammar' argument which I shut down real fast. She is a doctor and has to gender her patients correctly (ethical guidelines whoo), and genders my trans gf correctly, but not me. I said so and she just said ""No."" She won't tell me why she won't use they/them, and she told me to stop asking. What can I do?

Edit: She is also actively telling my siblings and gf to not use my pronouns and gets mad when they do..."	"I can think of two things to do 
1. Express to her how much it hurts to be disrespected and try to make her empathize. Maybe ask why she uses your girlfriends pronouns but not yours.
2. Flip the script and refuse to call her ""mom"" until she uses your correct pronouns.
I think the second one will probably provoke arguments and may be unsafe depending on your situation, so idk.
I'm very sorry she isn't respecting your pronouns and I hope she changes soon.
Then there's my favorite one to do, keep correcting her with ""they/them"" and annoy her into using those pronouns
My situation is safe, but I'm moving out asap. Thanks for the advice!

Feeling Kinda Invalidated By My Mom	Dear magnificent human beings, my mom just came into my room and was really transphobic and now I feel kinda invalidated. She pretty much walked into my room for the sole purpose of checking that I'm doing my homework and then interrupting me to tell me that I'm just a confused cis girl who wants to feel special and that I'm ruining my own life and disrespecting God (even though she's monotheistic she's not even religious wtf) and giving in to evil and that teenagehood is a sensitive time and it's her job to protect me and this is the first time she's seeing me go down the wrong path. She's saying that she blames my dad and the internet. Not to mention that she refuses to buy me a binder and then gets mad at me for stacking small sports bras. Just looking for some support.	"Your identity is valid.
this is why i hate religion, it sucks sometimes
Your mom is confused. She's going about it in a really shitty way, but it sounds like she honestly does love you and want you to be healthy and happy. She just doesn't understand that your non binary identity is who you truly are, partly because a lot of us go through phases around your age (I'm NOT saying your identity is a phase, but she might think it is), and partly because some older people just aren't used to NB identities. 

She's trying, and not doing as well as you deserve. One day, hopefully, she'll ask you to forgive her for not recognizing this is who you are and supporting you. Until then, I hope you find a support system of friends and other trans/GNC/queer folks in your community. And I hope your mom gets exposed to other queer, GNC or NB people who will help her learn that who and what you are is real, valid and beautiful. If she doesn't, it's her loss. 

Keep being you. You are awesome.
You are amazing :) family or in your case your mom can be extremly difficult I hope that since she acts from a place of love that she will come arround and see that she still has an amazing child who she can be extremly proud of.
You are valid! 

I'm sorry your mom doesn't understand what you're going through - she's probably trying to come to terms with your identity and taking it out in a mean and shitty way. You've at least got the support of a random internet stranger, and I hope your mom can come to terms with who you are and be less transphobic.
Okay first of all, love your username. Fellow aroace enby here:) 

Without repeating tons of things others have said, I just wanted to add another voice saying that's really hard. I see you. You are strong AND you are allowed to hurt. You matter, and so does every part of your story that makes you who you are. 🖤
Thank you 🥺
Thank you, kind stranger. I know she's at least trying, it just kinda hurts. And I really hope she does too. I love her a lot and I know she loves me but there's just so much she doesn't understand.

Thank you so much for your kind and descriptive comment! I really appreciate it ❤❤❤

Thank you, kind stranger 🥺
Thank you 🥺 Also, yay! I haven't seen many other aroaces on this subreddit.
We've probably had different lives and different paths to where we are, but i have a ton of empathy for you when it comes to dysphoria and not feeling beautiful. Sometimes it's fucking impossible to feel like anyone could look at us and like what they see. But they do.

Honest to god (or whoever), whatever you think you look like, the people who know you and know who you really are, when they look at you, they see beauty shining out of you. The only thing that can dim that beauty is shame or fear. When we're brave, when we show our love to other people, and even better, when we accept their love for us, *we are fucking radiant*.

Transphobia in the workplace	"I just need a place to vent. So I came out as non-binary to my work on the 28th. I sent an email at the end of the day and took off the first week of July. I work in the marketing department for a conservative finance firm. I've been here for 8 months and I felt like it was just time to let everyone know. The place seemed welcoming and when I first sent the email I received mostly 'thanks for letting me know' or 'how brave of you to be coming out' kind of emails.   


Good stuff right? 

&#x200B;

Well, 2 weeks after I sent the email I got this from a guy who works in my office.

&#x200B;

 Hi They,

Hope time off was great. I wish they (don't know plural for ""they"") know how I thought before sending me this email. Going forward, please don't put me with these people. I will pretend I didn't get this so i can still have respect for DeeDeeGetOutofMyLab.  


I immediately forwarded it to HR, my boss and my office manager. My boss called me and apologized, HR told me that it's unacceptable and goes against company policy and my office manager assured me that this individual is not representative of the attitude of the office. I wasn't really mad - I was expecting some kind of fallout - but I hate to admit it did break my concentration for the rest of the day...and the next few days.

When My Dad Gets Pissed at Me He Purposely Deadnames Me. What Should I Do?	"Literally whenever my dad gets pissed at me, (usually about stupid shit that I’m in the right about) he freaking deadnames and before I can even respond he says something like “I’ll call you whatever the hell I want”

MY NAME IS NOT A PUNISHMENT/REWARD SYSTEM ITS CALLED BASIC RESPECT. It makes me so damn mad. 

And like I said it’s stupid stuff. I really wanted to use the living room just for like a half hour so I asked how much longer his lame ass war movie is on and he responded For Another Hour. 

So I asked if he could just move to the bedroom for 15 minutes and could continue to watch it and he said no because the speakers are better in the living room which is exactly why I can’t do it at the same time because it’s too freaking loud. 

I asked my mom for some backup and he started yelling “Alright fine [deadname]how fucking long do you want me to turn it off for and don’t even think about telling me wrong name” 

I just slammed my door on him because I refuse to answer to a name that isn’t mine. 

How am I supposed to tell him how much this bothers me when he’s just being an asshole"	"Maybe in a time of calm, you could talk with him about it. Explain how much it hurts you when he does that, and come to an understanding?

Sorry I don’t have better advice. Like you said it’s just a matter of respect, so if he’s not going to respect you when he’s mad...? Idk what to do
Me neither. I tried texting my mom about it (I do better with the written word than speaking) and she basically said to just drop it. So frustrating…
I don’t know if this helps b/c the situation was pretty different, but when I first came out and my parents would accidentally use my deadname/wrong pronouns I would sort of jokingly respond in kind. 

Like:

Dad: Hey “deadname” come do this thing.

Me: No problem mom!

And he would realize and correct himself.

Again it’s different b/c it wasn’t deliberate, but I know how frustrating it is when you feel like people aren’t respecting you. I’m sorry you have to deal with that at home!
Reflecting his harm can be an indirect way to show him how he effects others. It can also be a catalyst for the conversation on how he effects others.

If he has the courage to deadname his child, then he better have the maturity to have the conversation of how he is actively building a distance."	gubf6s	NonBinary	14	0.95	2020-06-01 01:32:59
this is a dumb question to ask but am i non binary?	"soo recently i’ve changed my pronouns from she/her to they/them and i feel much more comfortable being referred to as that (even though i still misgender myself which makes me mad cuz i haven’t come out irl) but of course pronouns =/ gender so i still considered myself cis. 

however i still look at gender differently than most cis people do. warning, it’s kinda weird to explain, i honestly don’t know why i think this, but basically there’s an alter universe where i’m a male. but in this universe i was born a girl, so to me it’s unfair to go by female pronouns because then i’m erasing my male self (???). so that’s why my brain is gender neutral because it combines both of them so it prefers to be referred to as neutral.

but i still like girly things and i like being referred to by female nouns, if that makes sense? but now that i remember, i’ve never really felt like a girl? i’ve always just been myself

sorry if this is a rambling mess. i don’t have anyone to talk to about this. no one in real life is trustworthy enough for me to tell this to and i don’t want to tell my online friends of my reasoning of why i’m questioning because i feel likes it’s not valid enough :/"	"I feel you. but its a good idea to experiment with pronouns, like on here, for example, just to see how you feel. and always remember- you can use multiple sets. You may go by he/she/they, or less common ones too. :)
It comes down to how u feel about yourself. Are woman, do you feel like a boy, or both are dumb you’d rather join the void where we have good snacks.
Oooh I'll bring charcuterie
gender is dumb and stupid. i’ll bring the the chips
Ooooh, what kinda snacks?"	k4crs7	NonBinary	14	1.0	2020-12-01 03:37:51
I Don't Know Where To Begin	"So this is going to be a long one. I'll put a TL;DR at the end.   


I'm 22, and just finally came out to my boyfriend as nonbinary. He is one of two people who know. But he is the first person I have told that it would directly affect.   


I have known that I wasn't just a girl since I was in my early teens. I learned what trans was and thought for sure that that was me. I don't know why, but I knew that it had to be me. I was probably 14 when I came out to my mom as trans. She lost it. She wouldn't allow it. She sobbed and sobbed, and made me feel so guilty. So I did what I always do. I tried to make it easier for everyone around me and just clammed it all up.   


I ended up having to do the same thing about being bisexual when I was 16, because someone in my christian choir group found out and told my youth pastor who told my mom. There was a family intervention, and I closeted myself again.   


Overtime I did realize that trans wasn't quite for me. I didn't really want to have a penis or lose my boobs. I just didn't feel like a girl all the time. I still kept it well squished down. In fact for the last 8 years I've avoided watching videos about it or looking at things. I did on occasion, but felt so much shame and pain that I decided to just avoid it.   


I have a beautiful boyfriend who is amazing to me. I can't believe I've found him. But I've kept this a secret from him too. I thought I could just keep doing this. Just keep pretending I'm just a girl and thats it. But I could feel myself becoming unhappy. I can feel this need to be free but I can't act on it. After all, what straight man would want an NB person for a partner? I really didn't think he'd get it. Especially by some of the things he's said in the past. (to be fair though, I fed into it trying to protect myself.)   


But it turns out, he is in fact not straight. I found out just a few days ago that he is bisexual. I was the second person to ever know. So i only felt it was fair that I told him my secret (he already knew i was bi). He was totally okay with it. He was actually so casual about it it struck me. It was the most anticlimactic thing, right next to paint drying (im not mad about it). I also realized it was the first time I really got to come out, and not be outted.   


  


So now that I know hes okay with it, and that I can do this.... I'm still terrified. I still have so much internal transphobia (I don't think thats the right term. I'm not trans). I've just fought myself about this for so long and now suddenly I don't have to anymore and I don't even know how to handle it.   


I have myself convinced I would be ugly as a boy, that i can't pass, and that people will hate me if i try. I was made to feel like something was wrong with me for so long I still feel like there is. Like I shouldn't be this way. I'm trying to break free. I want to break free. I just don't know how. 

&#x200B;

does anyone have any advice or their own story to share? I don't know where to begin with myself. Feel like I'm trapped inside a body that isn't mine. I don't know how to fix it. I don't even know how i can express the masculine side of me.   


TL;DR closeted NB finally came out to someone in their real life and is having a bit of a crisis over being able to express themselves  
"	"It takes a long time and lots of positive reenforcement to feel strong enough to come out. Rely on strong positive sources amd use that to slowly find yourself. Looking up other NB people, read their blogs, watch videos, soak it in. I know it hurts at first but it will get you thru that fear and educate you. You aren't alone. 

I know you said you aren't trans, but being NB is covered by the trans umbrella too. I am also NB and thought theres no way I could be trans. ""Not trans enough."" In time I found a comfortable place under the term. Even if you don't want to transition, doesnt mean you don't belong. I encourage you to read trans blogs as well, for they all have very similar stories. 

In the end, look to other sources to open up and I hope that makes you feel more at ease with your identity.

You're totally right. I need to start allowing myself to learn, and get comfortable with who I am. It was so scary for so long. I don't have to be scared anymore though. 
This is really insightful and totally spot on. Like i went to downstairs and instinctively closed the tab to here even though hes 1. asleep, and 2. knows. Thank you so much ;u;

Hi! I'm brand new. Just came out to my wife.	Hey! I've been around the block a bunch of times, but here I am for the first time. Today was the fitst day of me deciding to be me.

Just a rant about unsupportive parents. triggering stuff.	"Hi. I'm currently sick of my parents.

Side note, ik my user probs still has girl.sunno how to change that. 

I've asked them to call me Alex and boy were they mad. They said they are offended because they chose my name and they'll always call em that name even though I don't want that name. They say I'm not letting them have any happiness because of the idea of changing my name to something 'boyish' even though it's not either. It's both. They also said they don't believe that shit and I only call myself that because ""some other person decided to be a girl"", that I'm taking away their happiness by taking away the name they chose for me like how my sibling changing how the name was spelt made them sad.

They even thought I needed counselling only for the name change and not the past stuff that happened. 

Fast forward and I being up I'm starting to tell them I might be non binary and they weren't happier. ""want me to treat you like a boy now?! Cus you will regret it"" being one along with the usual ""you'll always be [not preferred name)]. Call yourself that online but not with me.

Continue and I hear something I've heard before that I now see as not good.

""I swear I'm gonna slap you"".

So I snapped and said ""then do it""

Shouted in my face, mum broke us up then proceeded to tell ME off. I even told her this is verbal abuse and wanted to say this is toxic but it wasnt great.

I'm now here, wanting to cry because all I wanted was to test out one name, and to test out they/them. That's all I wanted and now I'm apparently losing respect because of something that makes me ahppy and I'm testing but like.

I don't know what to do. They still call me by the name, they still scare me.

I wanted to move with my friend in the future, but I wanna get out. And I can't leave now because I'm afraid of being independent and i don't know why.

If you've made it this far, thankyou.

I just don't know what to do anymore."	"*hugs.* ❤️❤️❤️
I am so very sorry you have to go through that. I would get out of that environment as soon as possible. If you ever feel unsafe or they say stuff like that you should report it so even if it’s smaller things, you build a repertoire of these activities

In the same situation.
Feel free to DM me♡♡
Speaking from the perspective of a dad here. I can't imagine talking to my kid like that. Can't say I wasn't surprised when they came out a couple of months ago, but I took it in stride. I want my kid to be happy and comfortable in their own skin.

The name thing does sting a bit, though. I'm doing okay with pronouns, but when a masculine name was suggested, I was reticent to immediately embrace it. My kid will pick a fitting name, and I'll roll with it. In my mind, I'll always think of the name I whispered to a tiny infant, though.

I wish for you the same thing I do for my kid. I hope you find peace and happiness."	jcpp41	NonBinary	14	1.0	2020-10-17 05:38:23
Feeling invalid	"Being 5'9 and amab, not having any clothes that really suit my gender and stuff i've just been feeling invalid lately. i have a masculine face and am wide and its just all a bit painful because i am trying it just feels like its not enough. 

Its having friends use the wrong pronouns, or see you as masculine, or just mention that you seem stereotypically like a guy interests wise. Its having your one source of comfort, like your hair, and then being told it doesnt fit your face.

Its all stuff that I cant really get mad at people for, and I know in the hair example they were just trying to help but it still just sucks feeling like im walking around looking like an idiot in order to feel comfortable with myself. 

I just wanna be able to be me without feeling like i have to prove that I am me to others."	"I'm sorry you're going through this. So much around us is needlessly gendered which doesn't make it easy to feel true to yourself. Women and enbies can also have ""masculine interests."" I try to take comfort in seeing people of all different genders doing X thing that is making me feel dysphoric. All genders can have short hair, long hair, wear dresses, wear makeup, wear blazers, etc. Your gender is not just your presentation :)

Pronouns in the workplace	"Hey all, I've been struggling with pronouns lately. 

I came out recently and decided she/they might be a good starting place but I am regretting it now. My closest friends and partner use they/them but every other person who knows I've mentioned pronouns to just defaults to she/her pronouns. I am not mad at anyone.. but it's been bothering me... so I am starting to tell people its they/them when it comes up but I don't feel like its always socially appropriate?  Especially at work. 

 I work at a corporate office job and in general I think most everyone there is a cis normie although I've seen and heard a lot of promotions about how they are diversity inclusive- and even fundraisers and support groups for LBGTQA+. 

I have pronouns in my email signature. I don't really want to be obnoxious about it and its not something that I feel I need to announce or anything. I figure people are going to call me she anyways because its cultural norm at this point... I can tell a few people that I'd prefer they/them.

 But in general is there a good way of making pronouns known without it being cumbersom or awkward or obnoxious?  Flag? Pin? It would just be nice if I got she/her'd less and they/them'd more and the only obvious way I can see is email signature. Advice please?"	"Pronoun Pins have been amazing for my mental health. I’m not working but am in college. As soon as I got one, people started actually calling me my preferred pronouns.
My company gave out pronoun stickers for our laptops! That might be a great option, or a pin. Also, if you use Slack or similar chat options, you might consider adding pronouns to your nickname field there, something I've seen a lot of people do.

I think it depends on the kind of work you do. If you're customer service focused then you'd have to have that convo with every customer, which I could see getting really tiring. However if you're talking about a smaller or more tightly knit group, talk to your leader about discussing it at a staff meeting so you can properly explain pronouns and what it means for you (this is also a great litmus test if they want to just talk the talk or also walk the walk) and what their support would mean to you as well. If you have an HR department you could also see what steps could be taken (maybe not any because it hasn't been brought up yet, but that could be a catalyst for change for your company).

As always, double check your local laws and your company's policies as gender presentation is not always a protected status (it's not in my state but it is at my employer which is why I'm out at work)
[removed]
Just change it in your email and if it comes up mention it. Like yeah making a big deal of it at work probably wont actually accomplish anything. But if youre friends with anyone there, let them know and maybe others will catch on
We use Teams, do you know if that is an option on there? Thank you for your comment!
I am legally protected in my state. Im more afraid of the confrontation. At this point I don't consider it a micro aggression because I have not communicated what pronouns I prefer beyond she/they. 😅 i am just bad at the communication part of it but thank you for adding perspective that it helps others. I think others deserve things and am guilty of feeling like I don't.
It's protected status in my state. I don't really interact with customers. I am more of a background person writing letters and checking that everything follows compliance. I'm new so I am a bit more afraid of making waves than anything, the confrontation of it scares me but legally I am protected.
Based on your profile you only came here to spread hate and insult people. Does that make you feel like a big boy

On with feeding the pathetic troll... 

The workplace is the workplace, you're absolutely correct. Which means you should act professional, this means respecting coworkers and clients. This also means you don't discriminate against people either. 

You must not be great at interpersonal communication, when I'm talking directly to you, I'll refer to you as 'you.' However, if I'm talking about you to someone else in front of you, I'll refer to using pronouns, and refer to the person I'm addressing as 'you.'

What's an odd view to you could be normal to others, they/them is already a common pronoun, even if you lack the basics of English to figure out how and when to use them.

Sexuality doesn't belong at work, yet cis het men seem to think they can talk about it freely. Yet pronouns and gender have nothing to do with sex, but I doubt you have the critical thinking skills to figure this out.

Unlike you, most of us don't hate groups of people. There are white boomers who aren't soulless heartless zombies, that only march to the drum of the far right lunacy.

You probably won't respond to this, because you can't have an original thought beyond what you're spoon fed from your far right overlords.
My gender is not my sexuality... so your suggesting I stay in the closet for the sake of a career and others comfort?... 

Also, people use my pronouns infront of me all the time like in a meetings. This isn't exclusively something that happens when that person isn't around. Additionally I am in a state that protects against discrimination towards gender and sexuality. I'm not ""selling my odd views"" I am in an environment I spend the major part of my time. I deserve respect and that includes the ability to be myself.

This comment is incredibly ignorant.
Im pretty new, so I really don't have any close friends there
That's a good opportunity then - consider thinking of it instead of confrontation as education. It's very likely that they want you to be happy and comfortable at your work, they just need you to let them know how to do so. Giving them a basic understanding of why, examples of what works, and providing good resources or letting them know what questions to ask, and reminding them it's a protected status, that kind of thing. And being honest about 'hey, I know I'm new and this is kind of scary for me but I trust you with this because I like working with you"" is more likely to build trust on your team."	1155pul	NonBinary	14	1.0	2023-02-18 03:29:24
finding it hard to accept myself	"Hello, I'm pretty new here so bare with me on my first post. If you'd wish to not read all of this my questions will be at the very bottom.

I've identified as non-binary for a good while now, and overall it has served me well. I don't see myself as a transgender man, or a cis woman, so it's the closest way to label what I feel. However, ever since I've come onto this realization, I've been finding it harder and harder to tell people that I am non-binary. It's also something I don't bring up at all until someone asks me.

Because of this, I've learned to deal with being misgendered, and the dysphoria it brings. I don't get mad or upset at people for doing this given that it's my own burden to deal with. Regardless, it does hurt. And it's always a challenge for me to come out and tell them about my identity.

I'm convinced that my reason for doing this to myself is because over last few years I feel like the term has become a joke to most people. I'm embarrassed that I'm like this. I wake up so many mornings and just ask myself why can't I be in one of the binaries? I tried for a time to go as trans and fell into a deep depression. And even now that I know I'm NB, I'm still convinced that no one takes me seriously. That they just see some special snowflake who's trying to make up for a lack of personality. But that's not the case at all...

Just as well, I can never vent to my friends who are also NB or transgender. Those who are NB are usually very feminine (I guess I fit more with masculine but I don't ever see that myself) and are okay with the things I'm uncomfortable with. And I feel like I have no right to complain to trans people because they have to go through so much more than I do. So I've never really had a person to talk to about all of this.

I hate being this confused and frustrated with myself all the time. I want to be normal, or at the very least fit into a binary that people understand. But I can't... I tried and I don't want to do that to myself again. 

Is there anyone out there who feels as though they never get taken seriously for their identity? What ways can I over come this feeling and just accept myself? 

Thank you for your time, it means a lot to me.
"	"I honestly know where you're coming from. I'm non binary myself and the most significant thing that has prevented me from being more out is that I feel like people don't take me seriously and think I'm just, like you said trying to be special. I have to remind myself everyday that this is how I feel. I really want to live my truth but it's hard when everyone is telling you that it's a joke. I feel like this comes from the trans community too so I really feel at a loss for community and belonging a lot of time. On top of all of this, it's so hard to correct people's misgendering because then it turns into me educating them on the issue every single time, something I simply don't have the energy for. I get the feeling that no one will ever see me for how I feel and that is bothering me a lot right now. It makes me want to transition even though I'm not sure that's the right choice for me. 

All I can say is that you are not alone, you are not a joke or just trying to be special, you are just trying to live your truth like the rest of us and that is something to be proud of. 
What you said here makes so much sense and is serious. I'm a binary trans guy and my partner and one of my close friends are both non-binary (kinda agender, kinda trans-masculine but they don't feel at home with any of these terms really). I think some of my other friends might be non-binary too if someone were to really press them on it or even just introduce the idea, but we are an older generation (almost 40 and above) and it's hard to find the right language that describes the feeling and still seems resonant with what is familiar to us. 

Given my age, I can see how much can change with each new generation. Growing up I could not have imagined gay marriage and I didn't know there was any such thing as trans until I was in my mid 20s and even then it took the current social debates about transgender issues for me to really understand who I was. For a while I thought I was too old to be trans, but I realized I could only grow old if I accepted myself as trans and lived my life fully. 

I think part of the social issue in regard to non-binary identity is a lack of language and awareness -- such that you have to educate people each time. I do believe that it is coming, it just sucks right now that you have to trail-blaze. I mean that's cool to be on the front of social change and all, but it's also just a lot of work and can be emotionally exhausting. It's so important to have people who get you (like in this space) and affirm what you are going though. 

As hard as my conversations are with my partner and NB friends, they are rich and productive because we can start to excavate the meanings of gender and how it's similar and different for us even though we are all placed under the same umbrella. There's so much we go though that's the same and so much that they struggle with that I don't have to. For example if someone says ""hey ladies"" to us, I can say, in my low voice, ""uh, I'm a guy,"" but that's not an option (or a desire) my partner and friend, and it's not like they want to educate a stranger every time it happens. Or, for example, it takes people some time to change my pronouns, but no one ever said, I can't use your pronoun because it's linguistically incorrect or too hard to understand, like people will often say about ""they."" 

I've stated to think about this difference between us [my identity and my friends'] as ""binary privilege."" I can't shed my binary privilege any more than I can shed my white or male privilege. At the same time I don't get to pretend that my binary or male privilege doesn't matter because it's canceled out by my lack of cis-privilege. I think of them as separate, inter-related things. 

I don't know if any of this helps, but your post helped me explore a bunch of these issues stuff that I'm still wrestling with. Thanks for posting. 

Edit: clarity 

I can relate very well. I feel a lot of pressure to fit into the binary bc I feel like as non binary I just don't exist for most people or aren't understood.
Have you tried talking to your nb and transgender friends? I can tell that I made some positive experiences talking through stuff with non-cis friends even though they are more or less affected by cisnormativity and transhatred than I am. I felt that there is more sense of belonging and understanding than with cis gendered friends. Even though, for example, they don't have a desire to go on T two nb friends helped me with just listening to me thoughts on that.

Binarity is a social construction. There's nothing wrong about not fitting in. Society sucks up completely. But you are valid and alright. I know, that we are the ones who feel all the normative pressure and how hard it is to deal with that every day but I think it's crucial to keep in mind that it's not us what's wrong and to cherish being nb. One thing that helps me are novels about gender nonconforming people, following other nbs on Instagram for the sense of belonging and well, the community on here.
This is something I struggle with as well and I do hesitate to come out to people as I don't have the strength or confidence to argue my validity with people who don't get it. 
I don't really have much to add aside from I completely understand what you're saying. 
thank you very much for your kind words. it's very difficult to live your life as you want it to be when it feels like no one understands. and going through such a change as transitioning is no way to go about it either. but you, and all the other kind people on this subreddit, have already been helping me so much with this just by letting me know that I'm not alone. Surely this will be a long and painful journey to accept myself, but I feel I can manage it eventually.
I can so much relate to that! I feel so similar. Just wanna let you know that you're not alone.
it did help me a lot, and I really appreciate that you responded to this. saying this because I have often felt lesser than my trans guy friends when talking about how I feel, just because I'm not trans myself. so, it's a huge breath of fresh air to see that someone like you cares so much about this issue. and it only helps more that you've have far more experience in this world than I have.
I agree that the lack of education and language is really one of the biggest burdens, and so many people trying to prove that there are only two binaries with ""scientific fact"". and, yeah I do also agree with what you said about the binary privilege. but I would never put my own struggles over someone else's, no matter who you may be. I guess that's more of my own personality at this point now that I think about it, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to shake that instinct of making myself smaller in comparison...
Thank you so much for this! I can get a lot from your perspective.

""I mean that's cool to be on the front of social change and all, but it's also just a lot of work and can be emotionally exhausting. It's so important to have people who get you (like in this space) and affirm what you are going though.""

Thanks for putting into words how I feel. It feels good to experience that others see the exhaustion that comes with all that. I'd say this is the mayor change in my emotional daily life since coming out as nb and I rarely experience that people understand this.

""binary privilege.""

Wow, yes. This term is so useful. Again, it puts into words what I experience (not to have).
thank you very much for responding. I have tried talking with a few of them, but over all they say that they don't experience this sort of thing and then I'm right back at square one. that's actually one of the reasons why I felt the need to make this.
I try to remind myself that the fact that every human characteristic is categorized into ""male"" and ""female"" is nothing more then our social construct. it's very dumb, but we have to acknowledge it regardless of what we feel for it. Do you have any recommendations for those novels about the gender nonconforming people you mentioned? that'd be something I'd actually like to look into.
It can feel that way so thank you 🙂
look what I found: http://flavorwire.com/518203/17-pathbreaking-non-binary-and-gender-fluid-novels

:)
Too bad that they apparently aren't (able to be) emphatic to your experiences even though they aren't making them themselves.

I read ""Drag King Dreams"" by Leslie Feinberg. Ze also wrote ""Stone Butch Blues"". Both stories are really tough which is why I didn't completely read the latter. Drag King Dreams gave me a lot of inspiration and empowerment though, a sense of belonging and helped me to see our struggle as a collective, not an individual one. The other books are in German, unfortunately, but I'm trying to remember some English movies and let you know! 
thank you so much, I'll look for these books next time I go to a book store. or maybe just order them online
You're welcome! If you like let me know when you read one and how you liked it! Would love to hear :)"	6q2lu8	NonBinary	14	0.99	2017-07-28 08:57:37
how does sexuality work with someone who rejects the gender binary?	"how does sexuality work with someone who rejects the gender binary? are nb people more likely to be pansexual? if someone nonbinary is attracted to only a certain gender, does that mean they still accept the gender binary system? what sexuality does that make them? (aside from pansexual, what i know is most sexualities include the gender of whoever is the subject)

i'm agender and i was thinking about my own experiences, then i got madly curious about the subject in general. please let me know if i am being offensive or ignorant."	"The homo/hetero system was not made for nonbinary people so we either have to stretch the words to make them fit or reject them altogether.

I just use queer tbh. It gets across that I'm not straight and it doesn't depend on my own gender as a reference point.
I think it depends on the person, really. Just because I’m nonbinary myself doesn’t mean I reject the idea of the binary in other people. The majority of people are binary, after all. I still consider myself a lesbian because I’m not attracted to guys in the slightest. And on a spectrum of female to male, I’m a bit closer to the female side of the scale (if that makes any sense). It might not be the most accurate term, but it’s easier to pick a word that’s “close enough” than to have an unnecessarily detailed description of my sexuality for everyday use. I’m attracted to people of the same/similar gender as me, which is considered homosexual.
As both a bi and non binary person one thing that I've learned is that language in general is cis and heteronormative. That means that there really isn't language to describe yourself when you exist outside of that. It's hard to do and imperfect. You just try and do your best. It's also incredibly personal.
fem/gyno/gyne- means attracted to women or otherwise feminine people
masc/andro- means attracted to men or otherwise masculine people.
I identify as queer, which isn’t dependent on my gender identity
I don't think being non binary has a direct affect on your sexual preference at all. Just because you identify outside gender norms doesn't mean you can't or won't be attracted to cis people. I'm a non binary AFAB and have only ever dated cis guys (until this point anyway, I've just met another AFAB enby and am VERY distracted)
I identify as ace panromantic. Honestly though it might just depend on the person
If someone asks for your sexuality, just say “yes”. That’s what I’ve done for nearly two years and it works like a charm
I'm ace, but I have romantic relationships. When I was dating a fellow non-binary person, we called each other homo-romantic jokingly. Usually I just say I'm asexual and leave people to deal with their labels and hangups lol
I think you can exist out of the ""regular"" gender binary and still be attracted to people who exist inside it, and I think attraction is just as varied for nonbinary people as binary people.

I could see how some people who are gender-apathetic, agender or something similar may be more likely to be apathetic towards gender as a whole, including in their romantic and/or sexual partners, but I may be biased. I'm agender and I can't really imagine being not attracted to someone based on gender.
I'm bi, which I define as being interested in those with and without genders
I identify as bigender but I still call myself a lesbian, because about the majority of the time I feel like a wlw and I love the identity enough to keep it even while I’m feeling like a nblw or mlw
i call myself straight based on my sex. im afab and attracted to men. it is also called nblm (nonbinary loving men), i guess.
that makes sense. thanks for the reply!
thank you! is it common for nb people to have gender-specific attractions? i guess i'm confused because i thought it might conflict with the concept of rejecting gender binary
femininity and masculinity aren't inherently gendered 😉
I later learned I am actual pan and was suppressing attraction to masculinity because of a heavy sexism against males developed from a young age because I was bullied, and only by dudes, but before I realised the actual situation I thought I was fem attracted.
But, the way I am attracted to masculine people is from a cute perspective

for example, facial hair is fuzzy :P

I really like facial hair, but I think of it in a very not masculine way, so I might actually still be femsensual, but idk
Though I am genderfluid, and a notable portion of the time feel 100% female; I often do fit the binary."	gmzzyv	NonBinary	14	0.9	2020-05-19 23:33:52
Advice: Mom rejecting identity	"My mom rejected my nonbinary identity claiming I was ""forcing my beliefs"" onto her by asking her to use my they/them pronouns. I blocked her number and blocked her on social media. My sister is pregnant with family's first grandbaby. My mom's throwing the shower in three weeks. I called my sister yesterday to tell her I couldn't come because of our mother. My sister said she understood, but our dad (divorced from Mom) later said sister called him crying about it. 

I want to be there for the birth, but I'm not sure how to interact with my mom now. I also feel like a terrible person for not going to my sister's shower. I feel like a terrible child for cutting my mom out of my life. I'm not mad, I'm heartbroken more than anything. 

Has anyone been in a similar position? Any advice at all about this new family dynamic? How do you cope with estrangement from a parent? I don't know how to interact with my mom in a way that lets her know it's not okay to disrespect my identity. The rest of the family is supportive, although they don't quite grasp nonbinary identity."	"oh goodness this is crazy tough. I remember when my family first rejected my identity, it was horrible.. I felt so alone and hurt. If i were you, I'd find your own way to celebrate the babyshower, take your sister out for coffee or dinner, give her a card, get her babygifts, make it about her and how you want to be there. Right now if you want distance that is completely okay, it's so hard to deal with when family won't celebrate something so wonderful about your own identity. For now do what you need to for yourself, we support you 100%.
I definitely feel you. The only reason I keep in contact with my parents is because my younger brother (16) still lived with them, and we're very close. 

Yeah she might come around with time, in fact I'm sure she will. But you don't owe her that patience and you don't need to WANT her to want you. Personally, I could care less if my mother accepts me -- the only reason I even came out to her was because I was 3 months on T and my voice was really starting to change and give me away, and because I have surgery scheduled, and it just felt like a matter of time before it came up. She's a shitty person and a shitty parent, and she would be even if she accepted that I'm a guy. You don't owe your parents anything, and you're not a bad child for cutting her off. There is no such thing as a bad child. She's the parent, she chose to have a kid, and she's choosing to make your gender into a burden, rather than a blessing. 

But if you want to go to your sisters shower, don't let your ma stop you. You don't have to go if you're not comfortable at first, but like... your ma doesn't get custody of all your mutual friends and family. I think you should talk to your sister and ask her how she feels about the thought of you going and there potentially being awkwardness or drama, if that's something you feel comfortable with.
I've had next to no relationship with my father for more than a decade. I see him occasionally at family gatherings but that's mostly the extent of it. 

At those gatherings I'm cordial but not warm toward him. I don't let his presence ruin things for me. Luckily he doesn't  seem to know what to do anymore, and other than trying to be nice in a superficial way, he doesn't bother me.

For coping, I don't really think I've ever felt bad or sad particularly. I never had a great relationship with him. He never understood me.

My situation began with me simply not initiating contact for over a year. In that time he never tried... I think that helped me decide he doesn't care so I don't need to either. Just two different people who wouldn't choose to associate if not being related.

Hope your situation improves and you can find peace with your mom. If your sister is on your side, and understands, maybe she'd be willing to have your back, use your pronouns and help correct your mom publicly. Having extra voices helps a lot.
If you go, Nothing is stopping you from refusing to interact with your mother. ""I am here for -sister- not you. I am aware you have issues with me but I will not be taking away from -sisters- day."" Might be a good thing to have on hand should she try anything beyond casual conversation.
Your mom will come around. Everytime she misgenders you , misgender her and eventually she will use your pronoun.
Thanks for the kind words. Unfortunately, another factor here is distance. I live about five hours from my mom and sister so visiting isn't easy. I'm putting together a nice baby shower package though so hopefully she likes.
I'm not a fan of misgendering anyone ever, and particularly dislike this kind of strategy because it sends the message that you can choose not to gender someone correctly as a punishment. I really don't like Jessica Yaniv for example, and think she's taking advantage of her transness to damage others' rights and advance social conservative causes but I'm not going to misgender her either.
That sounds like a great idea :) I'm sure she'll appreciate it!
She needs to understand, she currently does not."	ej4495	NonBinary	15	1.0	2020-01-02 20:54:25
Can someone please help?	"I really need to get out of my toxic house. I was adopted into this family when I was about 2 and I didn't have much of a choice. I had 3 other siblings that got to stay with our biological aunt. We moved away and now I'm kinda stuck.

My mom is dating this guy and he's way too homophobic and to me that's a no no because I identify as Non-binary and I am a lesbian, but nobody listens to me. I'm literally 14 and I have thought of ending things too many times. Things recently became too much when my mom's longtime boyfriend started having his twin daughters come over for the weekends. Whenever they get in trouble for something they immediately blame me. I never get a say in anything.

Today is when it became too much, one twin was outside with her dad and the other twin was inside with me. She was on her laptop and I was trying to be nice and put the past in the past so I asked her to come and play basketball with me. That's when she dropped her laptop on the floor when she was getting up. I told her it will probably be fine, but then she told me it cracked. I didn't do anything because I didn't want to be blamed. That's when her dad comes in and sees her face and asks what's wrong. She shows him the screen and he freaks out and asks how it happened. The first thing she says is that I was trying to take it out of her hands and I cracked it. Thats when he turns to me and starts yelling at me for it. He is so controlling and he never lets me explain what happened. The thing is he does the same thing to my mom when they are arguing. Now I'm getting blamed for breaking a computer and thats not what happened at all.

The twins team up on me all the time so no matter what is happenening I get blamed because its 2 vs 1. After that I came into my room and on my way up I here him say to the twins good job for sticking up for each other. I swear he is so full of crap and they take after him. He makes me soooo mad all the time I have bruises on my knuckles from punching walls because I can't take it anymore.

Can someone please help me? or adopt me? Something please I can't live like this anymore. Thats not even the tip of the iceberg. If I stay here anymore I might actually try something and hurt the people who actually care about me."	"Please, stay safe. Do you have a teacher you could reach out to? This sounds like an abusive household and teachers are mandated reporters, meaning they are obligated to help get you out of an abusive environment.
Can't you call child services or the adoption agency that you where at? Calling the police is a bit of a wild card, cuz they don't HAVE TO help you and they might not belive you or worse.
What's happening to you is so awful and I'm so sorry. Where do you live? (General area like state, province, etc.) It might be helpful to do some research on what options there are for abused youth, at risk people etc. There are usually numbers and hotlines you can call. Like someone said, maybe talk to a trusted teacher since they're mandatory reporters, if there's a local LGBT+ centre you could contact them and ask them for any help or options for queer youth in difficult homes. If you don't feel up to it you can tell me (or someone you're comfortable with) the state you live in and they could do some research on what options there are and places you can contact and give them to you.

And hey, hang in there. I know things are easier said than done, and it's really fucking hard, I'm also in a difficult home. But there are people who care about you and will help you. The LGBT+ community will always be here for you.
I second this!! Also OP please hang in there. Being a teen in difficult enough and it sounds like you are in a not very nurturing environment. Even though it may feel far off there are futures where you can be your authentic self without being afraid."	jpyygq	NonBinary	13	0.86	2020-11-07 21:40:48
Bad time reconnecting	"So I reconnected with an old ""friend"" a week ago after ghosting him for about three years, I know dick move on my part but I had my reasons, not that they are justified. Anyway, we talked the night before meeting up and it came up that he was gay and used They/he pronouns, which was an odd coincidence since  I also use They/he pronouns but am Pan/ace. We talked for a bit before he had to go to get some sleep and mentioned how he didn't know what I identified  as meant and would love for me to explain it the next day.   


So next day rolled around and we drove to sit in the park and got to talking about a lot of things and in general catching up. We got to the topic of how we figured out we were Lgbtq+ and thats when it really started to get to me that I probably was not going to like hanging out with him anymore (Also due to other unrelated things). When I brought up how I was a demiboy/nonbinary he asked me to explain what that meant for me and so I did, what rubbed me the wrong way was when we started talking about clothing. I myself don't care what most people think typically when it comes to clothing, I like to dress masc and fem at times and explained that to him which got me the response of ""I'm not saying your confused or anything, but you are just figuring yourself out."" .   


I cannot explain how angry this made me, mostly because I had already done that, I knew what I liked and how I liked to present myself. I of course said nothing because I didn't want to be rude and was already trying not to have an anxiety attack from just talking with him. This went on to him commenting on my hair and saying ways I could wear it to make it look shorter, I love my long hair and it is something I take pride in, mostly due to the fact I am a redhead and used to absolutely hate my hair, and in general I have had short hair and feel more comfortable with it long. I get he was probably just trying to be nice and give me advice on how to look more androgynous but this paired with other things like suggesting my parent runs my life (She does not), and things relating to mental health all rubbed me the wrong way. I am still trying to get out of this stupid rut of ""I need to look androgynous , not fem, not masc. Maybe I should cut my hair and stop wearing fem clothing."" and I hate it, I know its wrong and whats important is feeling comfortable with myself on my own terms but damn if my mental health really took it and ran with it for the entire week after.    


Cherry on top is he hasn't responded to a message I sent him the day after(Just asking how his sleep was since he left me on read the night before when he fell asleep)  but had time to be on Facebook and post meme's while tagging people. It doesn't hurt me since I barely know him at this point but damn if it doesn't make me mad for believing someone would actually want to hang out or talk to me or be understanding of who I am other than my best friend.  I get I am probably giving up on him too soon but this along with other shit he said just rubbed me the wrong way, the other stuff having to do with mental health mostly.   
TL;DR An old friend of mine thinks I must be confused for using He/they pronouns but wearing masc and fem clothing and wanting long hair basically."	"You already know you know yourself much better than they ever will.

It’s hard to deal with the negative internal voices when someone fuels them, but you WILL be able to get back to the mental state you achieved before. It’s completely in your power to do so. Take his misunderstanding and projection and use it to recognize how far you’ve come away from seeing life like that.
I think a lot of people hold unchallenged assumptions that identity and expression need follow and it sounds like your friend is naive in this regard and has unfortunately said some things that aren't helpful to you and aren't true.

I think it's true to say that people often choose to present a certain way to express their identity, but how you present is ultimately up to you and you don't owe anyone androgyny regardless of your gender identity or what pronouns feel right for you.

I think it's easy to get wrapped up in trends and visual representations of nonbinary identities, but that's sort of missing the point that this is all about how you feel internally and that's all that counts.

I have male pattern baldness and I look like a bald dude and sometimes I struggle with feeling like I can't look androgynous and that's somehow in conflict with my identity but that's obviously ridiculous. You can present how you want and you know how you identify!
I wish it were easier to do so, I haven't been in a good mental state for a few months now, though its slowly getting better, he kind of just threw it back slightly. I know the most I can do right now is not talk to him for a while, which shouldn't be hard since he hasn't contacted me.

It just really rubs me the wrong way when people make so many assumptions after not seeing/talking to you for a while as if they still know you. Or when they make assumptions like that based off little info.

Thanks for the reply though, and I hope you have a good day/night!
Thats kind of what I figured, it was just confusing to me in the beginning because he mentioned he uses They/Them pronouns as well. I guess I just wished he thought before he spoke really but oh well. I think it does have to do with the assumption that if you're Non-binary or anything under that umbrella then you must look somewhere between masc and fem which just isn't true of course and can be a harmful stereotype.


Thank you for replying btw, and regardless of male pattern baldness you do you, I am sure you rock the way you look, have a good night/day!
I'm glad you can see through it and thank you for your kind words :) I can rock this look, just as you can rock your long, red hair! ;)"	qbwri6	NonBinary	13	1.0	2021-10-20 09:15:51

Mogai and our community	I don’t know if this is going to be controversial but I can’t get my mind off it. I keep seeing people on twitter with muttgender, clowngender and this and that, all with the most specific things to classify, like in pupp, mutt, and things like that you have to be a furry, which is a fandom that people chose to be in, making it literally impossible to be a gender. They all seem personality based and or kin based, which is annoying. If you try to say that isn’t a gender and stuff they get mad and call you a bigot and stuff. These people are why enbies aren’t accepted or liked, they’re the reason attack helicopter shit happened. I can’t even get the respect to have people use they/them pronouns to me when I’ve come out to them and these people expect to be called emojis and stuff. We aren’t a personality, we aren’t kins, we aren’t a joke, we suffer dysphoria like other transpeople, we don’t always feel comfortable in our bodies. I am sick of this, if not for this we probably would’ve been more accepted for like ever. I don’t want to be mocked and ridiculed for saying that pup/pupself or whatever aren’t pronouns. I feel like a fucking joke. There’s enough problems we already have to deal with, these clowns shouldn’t be on our plates too.	"Where do you draw the line at a valid gender identity? Considering that you are making the same arguments that transphobes and truscums make, I'd like to see where you draw the line for what is and isn't valid
""These people are why enbies aren't accepted or liked""

Really? We gonna recycle anti-bi and anti-trans arguments against others? In the *nonbinary sub*, during pride month? Hate to break it to you, but they're really not the reason why transphobia exists. Transphobes are the reason why transphobia exists. And attempting to endear ourselves to transphobes (why would you want that???) by picking on some other random demographic will *not make them hate us less*.

There's two broad possibilities with these idiosyncratic genders: people being genuine and people taking the piss. Let's assume they're being jackasses and are calling themselves clowngender just to rile up the genuine folks. Is honk their pronoun? Use it. Mercilessly. With as much respect as they/them. If clowngender isn't their gender, it's gonna piss em off or they'll get tired of the game eventually.

Let's assume they're being genuine. Either you, they, or both of y'all are uneducated about gender. Are you asking them about it? Are you opening a discussion? Or are you just dismissing them with the *same literal arguments* that transphobes use against enbies? Only 2 genders, all others are personalities amirite? Binary trans people can't even get she/her and he/him pronouns but NBs want ""sInGuLaR tHeY""?

Some prime opportunity for self reflection here.
what do you mean when you say it's something we (im assuming by this you mean nonbinary people) have to deal with? do you think its that much of a problem for the community as a whole?
I remember reading a list someone made on wattpad of every ""gender"" identity they could find online, ya know, for curiosity. A few were legit, but most of them were either personality-based, mental illnesses (I'm not kidding), disorders, and so much more. It's for shit like that many don't take us seriously
Well you have to have dysphoria, you can’t feel 100% comfortable in your AGAB body or else you’re just faking it. It might make them happy but it’s no different than kins, dog isn’t a gender and you literally can’t say it is. A gender has to be explainable and something that could exist even if there were no jobs no fandoms no nothing, something unaffected by personality or interests.
[deleted]
I think it is because anyone that knows of mogai stuff but isn’t educated and stuff often thinks we’re all like that, making it a problem for us all.
I know, I haven’t personally seen much mogais or supporters until like the past few weeks. A lot of people I follow are supporting it and making fun of people who don’t. I like the people but this is just stupid. There’s so much more I and everyone else has to worry about and people with this fake shit shouldn’t be one of them.
>Well you have to have dysphoria, you can’t feel 100% comfortable in your AGAB body or else you’re just faking it

Incorrect, dysphoria is a specific medical term that does not refer to any and all discomfort relating to one's agab. There are many trans people who do not suffer from dysphoria.

>It might make them happy

So why stop them by policing their identity. If it gives them gender euphoria (the way to be trans without dysphoria) then they should be allowed to have that identity.  

>A gender has to be explainable and something that could exist even if there were no jobs no fandoms no nothing, something unaffected by personality or interests.

That's transphobe logic. When a transphobe says that there are only two genders they make the exact same point that you just made. To many, being nb is just a personality trait. The last thing we need is to get the slightest bit of acceptance and then use that to do the same thing to others. 

I see what you're saying, but your arguments are based in the same logical errors that transphobic and truscums use. If identifying as something that you find silly because you don't understand it makes someone happy, why the fuck should we stop them. That just normalizes discrimination against me and you.
why do you think those are the criteria for being trans/nonbinary? wondering how you feel about trans people who dont feel dysphoria, for example
Right, I'll refer you right back to ""either you, they, or both parties are uneducated about gender"". I'm not here to moderate what genders are real/LGBTQ+ or point fingers at who's uneducated. I'm not even saying OP or you are wrong about people misunderstanding gender, some people definitely are! I'm here to remind everyone that 1) repurposing transphobic arguments to attack other people is shitty and 2) the only way to understand why other people are using a term as a gender is to have a discussion with *those people*. Approach them as equals with the goal to learn. Should probably check the circular logic and insults at the door, too.
Sorry idk why it wouldn't let me reply it just now gave me the notif. Listen, I wouldn't really give too much of a shit if the first thing that comes to a lot of peoples' mind when you say Non Binary is attack helicopter or tumblr. I and many others don't even get the respect to have they/them pronouns used for us when asked, asking for something extreme like pup/puppy would make people less likely to respect pronouns in general if they think it's ridiculous or something. I don't see how it's transphobic to say gender must be in some way explainable, or hell, it could be explainable how you can't explain it, but if the environment you're in changes it, it is just a feeling. If being Non Binary is a personality trait to some I don't understand why it's bad to say that's wrong. When people like me are suffering with constant dysphoria and harassment, and others use it to fill in for their lack of personality, that's a problem. I don't quite understand the general problem with truscums, yes gender euphoria can show you're trans too, but if you don't feel a like uncomfy how you were born then you just like presenting different then people would expect of you, which is fine, but it's not trans. It's like how a bunch of old singers are being called enby for not following traditional gender roles back in their time. People call Prince genderfluid, but he was alive during a time where he could've said or known about it, and it would be unlikely that he didn't record it, he just broke the norms. Sorry this turned into a rant or whatever idk but it won't give me the notification normally so I guess it's best to get it all out.
How do trans people not feel dysphoria, it’s the requirement. I once heard an argument that said if they’re exposed to trans people and stuff that they won’t feel dysphoria because they found out young, but they still need to feel discomfort, why would you want to transition if you won’t feel different. You have to feel dysphoria because otherwise you’re just faking it and doing it for attention, it’s not a game or anything and people have been killed just for expressing who they are.
Well, people that don’t experience dysphoria usually have gender euphoria.
You know what I mean, i mean before you transition don’t act like you didn’t know that
Super confused what you’re talking about here. Some people don’t experience dysphoria being one gender, but experience euphoria being one. Obviously they’d present in a way that makes them feel euphoric.
Okay, but that’s not being trans, they feel good as a different gender but if they don’t feel dysphoria in their agab they are not trans
Sorry, but that’s not your decision to make. You don’t get to decide what makes someone trans or not 🤷‍♀️
Yes but it’s not just me, so many people agree and this is what it always was, that’s like saying if you’re homosexual you still are if you’re sexually attracted to the opposite sex.
Back in the day all while people thought they were superior to any POC. didn’t make that opinion correct.
? That has nothing to do with this. Are you saying you don’t have to be gay to be gay?
That was a response to the “everyone thinks this so it must be correct”
Okay? But sometimes a common agreement makes sense. Slavery and the mistreatment of poc wasnt a thing with just one common opinion. Trans people have enough to worry about with the transphobes and shit they don’t need mogai adding more weight.
Someone identifying however they want to identify doesn’t affect you, but it could significantly improve their life.
It does though. The total view of the Nonbinary and Trans community gets covered in shit, even by trans people. I can’t fucking take being a joke to some people. We can’t even get the courtesy of being called they/them by a lot of people, you must be insane if you think people are going to start using pup as a pronoun, which wouldn’t even be grammatically correct.
Sorry, but I’m okay with people identifying however they like. You might think it’s weird, that’s fine."	gwr6uw	NonBinary	14	0.89	2020-06-04 21:55:15
Transphobic Dad	"Yeah so I'm 17 and am going through the college process rn and I feel really hopeful that I'll soon get to actually be out and feel better about myself. 

That being said my life is pretty shitty right now. I applied for a scholarship for diversifying STEM fields saying how I'm nonbinary and I'm one of the finalists wooo! But that means I need to do interview things tomorrow. I am only 17 so I need my dad to come with me but he is super transphobic and doesn't know I'm nonbinary so I'm really afraid that he'll find out because of this. But also I really do want a full scholarship so I'm going to have to try to keep him out of it as much as possible.

 I had green hair and he told me I needed to dye it before the interview and I got it dyed a white color and got it cut super short (I'm AFAB) so he's been harassing me about it saying how ""you're fucking stupid, you look like a little boy, you look like an ugly butch"" and I'm starting to get scared. He already was angry at me because I wanted to wear a pant suit which he thought was horrible but he eventually let me get one (it had to be a womans one of course). 

But yeah this whole thing is just really stressful because he is getting really mad at me for doing stuff that makes me feel better. Like my dysphoria had been pretty bad lately and he just makes me feel horrible. I know it's just because he's a fucking bigot so it's really not my fault at all but idk it's still difficult.

I am really looking forward to college and moving out so that I don't have to deal with him and I can finally not feel like shit all the time. :/"	I’m sorry you’re going though that right now with your dad, but keep doing you. You’re a strong, amazing human. And congrats on being a finalist for the scholarship, good luck tomorrow! You got this.	f068g4	NonBinary	11	0.93	2020-02-07 05:55:26
I'm worried my mom knows I'm not cis!??!!?!	"So, due to ""the current situation"" I \[22AFAB\] have come home from college until the campus opens back up, so I've been living with my mom. I had recently started experimenting with my gender expression, and I didn't really stop when I moved in. My mom's like, slightly homophobic (by which I mean I'm bi and she was mad about it at first and now we just don't talk about it, but she just hopes I marry a man and forget about my attraction to women, but she's not outright mean about anything) so I don't really want to bring up gender to her, but I also didn't really worry about outing myself to her since I kinda thought she would never suspect that I might be trans/nonbinary

But, lately I've started to worry that she's catching on. Here's a list of things I've said/done around her that might hint to my gender questioning

\- I pin my hair up in a hat to make it look like I have short hair

\- I wear clothes my brother-in-law kindly let me have when I started wanting to present more masculine (and my mom knows they're his clothes)

\- I bind sometimes, which I thought she wouldn't notice because it doesn't make *that* big of a difference, but the other day I felt like she was staring at my chest area for a while

\- one day at dinner, a distant family friend came up who has recently started making a podcast, featuring their gender dysphoria. My mom asked ""what is gender dysphoria anyway?"" and I jumped into a long winded explanation of my understanding of it, including examples from trans youtubers I watched, and explaining other trans terms like ""stealth."" After this, I promptly finished eating and left the room.

\- I had a virtual meeting with my counselor, and my mom was out of the house for some of it, but I know she got home before I finished and I don't know how soundproof the walls of my house are and she maybe overheard me talking to my counselor about not being a woman....

\- we went to get haircuts today, and I told the hair dresser to cut mine ""as masculine as possible, please"" and I *know* my mom heard me say that, and afterward she told me it looked really good, when historically she's always been upset whenever I or my sisters cut our hair short (just a few weeks ago she was asking if I was ever going to grow my hair out)

\- After the haircuts, she was uncharacteristically nice to me.  (But then she sent me a scripture about obeying God's prophets so... idk)

Anyway, I have no idea if she's catching on and I'm not really ready to come out as anything since I'm still just trying to figure out what the heck gender is, but I don't know. Do you think she might know? What should I do? Should I bring it up?"	"If you don’t want her to know, maybe mention something about (cis) queer women liking to experiment with that stuff? Maybe she’ll assume that’s what’s happening?
What is the worst that could happen if you just say nothing? Awkwardness? Being disowned? Violence?

If it isn’t that bad, I’d say let it be. Let her think what she wants.
I struggle in a lot of similar ways! You don’t owe your mom any form of explanation if she does happen to ask. You are in control of your journey, and it’s important you experiment and (should you choose) come out on your own terms.  This is different for everyone, and there’s no right way or time to do these things. 

It’s definitely hard when you have to look over your shoulder watching for anything your mom might perceive as abnormal, but I admire your bravery in continuing to experiment. I can’t even imagine moving home right now (I’m also in college)

No matter what happens, know that you share this struggle with so many, and support (beyond trying to convince you your identity is wrong) absolutely exists! Hope this helps and best of luck going forward!
I feel you. This was similar to where I was at with my mom a few months ago except I’m a minor. Do whatever is most comfortable for you. If this is bothering you and you want to come out to her. So it. But also sometimes arguments just aren’t worth it when you’re stuck in the same space with people. I hope whatever you do, it goes well
No disowning or violence, definitely. But I think the worst thing is that, if she knew, she'd probably try to convince me that I'm cis, or that I should try *choosing* to be cis, or something like that. That maybe I feel different but I should just wear makeup and hide my differences so that people don't have to know. She used to want me to go to conversion therapy so I could ""fix"" my bisexuality until I explained to her how horrible and damaging conversion therapy is. Then she backed off really quick. 

On the other hand, maybe she'd finally be ready to listen to me... I don't know."	gnr1du	NonBinary	14	1.0	2020-05-21 05:34:57
Having kind of a difficult time with pronouns...	"How do you get over the guilt of correcting people? I feel so weird saying ""actually not a girl but I'm not mad sorry"" but as hard as I try to look less feminine it just doesn't seem to stick and people tend to automatically assume I'm a girl. Which is fine, Hanlon's Razor and all that. But now it feels weird to hear myself referred to as such and with feminine pronouns (why does it have to hurt now when it never did before?!) and there are people who do genuinely try and correct themselves as they make mistakes but I am in an industry that is very client-facing and I have NO idea how to go about introducing myself or correcting people without feeling like kind of a pain in the ass tbh.

Does this ever go away? What is the social etiquette on introducing and correcting yourself in the most  efficient and uninflammatory way? (I live in kind of a redneck area there are a lot of people that will straight up just not understand). I know I'm a they, or a boy girl, or a both. As long as people think of me with that in mind it's all fine and gravy but I'm really struggling to even get to that point right now. If I need to be more aggressive with it... how?!"	"This Might be silly but pronoun badges , bracelet or something.that would shout it out loud to someone who is talking to you.i have a few
I try to think about it like correcting things like my name. If someone calls me a name similar to mine but not, it makes a lot of sense to correct them and move on.

Also, whenever I introduce myself I say “hi I’m X and I use they/them pronouns. So happy to finally meet you!” Or something like that 🤷
Hey, if you are still having an issue with this perhaps a pin like of the NB flag or somesort of ""flair"" it may catch on as people tend to love to observe. Anyways just a suggestion, also you're awesome in case you needed to hear it!
Hi OP and others. I am.sorry that you are struggling. I am hoping to get your perspective on my issues, which might also help you to reframe your own predicament. 
(Quick disclaimer: Sorry if this is hijacking your post, I can delete this post if you prefer.)

So - My sister's eldest child declared they were nonbinary about 18 months ago, at the age of 14. Everyone in my family is cool with it (my parents don't really understand it well, but they are not against the idea in principle). 

My wife and are childfree, but are quite close with my sister's kids (my nephew is 13), and we are def on the Left/liberal side of the political spectrum. Therefore we have really tried very hard to respect my sister's eldest's decision to be a they/them. In June we took them to their first Pride event, along with their friend (actually their ex-gf - they also came out as bisexual around the same time).

However, I have noticed that none of the other adults in our family (iey mum and dad, my sister and her husand) make any particular effort to refer to my nibling (I think that is the non-gendered version) but their preferred pronouns. I was texting my sister yesterday, and I made sure to only use nongendered pronouns, but my sister just used 'she/her' all the way through.

Should I be picking up my sister etc for their 'mistakes'? It seems to me that they simply can't be bothered if my nibling is not directly psrtnof the conversation. I don't think my sister etc opposes my nibling's decision, but is simply opting to ignore it.

OP, would you be happy if someone else was supporting you by correcting others? Or do you view it as something that is your choice and therefore your responsibility to 'enforce '?
See thing is i have an ID badge for my school that has a little sticker with a ""They/Them"" tag because my teachers noticed people were accidentally forgetting (or I just do such an ass job at correcting people) but it hasn't really helped at all and I'm starting to feel even worse that it's become kind of a mix up
Hilariously i had a meeting with my school and the lady in charge got SO pissed at me for asking them to all use my pronouns and I felt like such a small baby like goddamnit the one fucking time I just wanted to stop being called she :')
Hey bud, I can't answer for every enby in the world because I'm sure some people would be annoyed but I find it very reassuring and supportive when someone corrects someone else on my behalf--especially because I'm still very awkward with knowing when to bring up something like pronouns :')

I would ask your nibling (such a cute word lol) if they're cool with you correcting on their behalf just in case but on my end when my siblings correct my parents or themselves or friends it is like... peak family love feel. It's a gesture of caring imo. And truthfully my siblings were the driving force in my parents being better about it and now they've got the hang of it full stride for the most part


I will say though with parents even when they are supportive I find they slip up a lot, especially if you are like me and came out kind of later in life after presenting one way for a long time and especially if you spend a lot of time together... that's why the siblings stepping up was so helpful for me cause it wasn't malicious on my parents end they just kind of forget: this short time of being ""out"" kind of shrinks in comparison to the time i wasn't but that I think (and hope) will get easier with time. Already seems like it has tbh. 

TL;DR ask nibling if it's cool or if they'd prefer to do it themselves and then go ham I reckon. It's a gesture of love and caring about their comfort.
That sucks.thats the only thing I could think of. If I think of anything else I will just reply to this post here.
Don't sweat it G, she's not worth your thoughts as I'm sure you know. You're grown, more than any adult. Cause it takes someone grown to be as strong as you are. Keep on keeping on, as they say. Much love 69.
Thank you so much for your considered reply! Great advice, and I will definitely follow it. I don't see them as often as I like (they're nearly 16, so hanging out with their uncle is seriously not high on agenda!), but their birthday is next month so I'll probably see them then.

I'm really glad your family has been so supportive, sounds like you have a really awesome bunch of people around you. Treasure it! X
Thanks bud! I think i might need to be a little more on top of it to prevent confusion but the guilt is *so strong* lolll
Thanks bud. I'm not too worried because she will be inevitably left behind and will eventually meet someone who will report her for that shit
Oh trust me I cherish my family, it is a shame I can't share them with everyone all the time :')"	qovtta	NonBinary	11	0.93	2021-11-07 19:28:34
My Brother told everyone at school my deadname	"first of all my english isn't that good so pls don't judge 

So i've been at my school for 2  years and had the luck that nobody knows my deadname because i have cool teachers but recently my brother is also on the same school as me and i noticed that since then a few people managed the figure out my deadname so i asked my brother if he knew why and he just said that he just tells it everyone who asked and when i gor mad he deffendet himself by saying that ""it's your past and you should accept it"" and im so angry right now because i've been living my life with nobody at school calling me my deadname for 2 years and now it's ruined."	"Poor thing... Had Something similar happening to me when I moved... I literally live 1000km away from where I was born and some people know my deadname somehow....

But your own brother doing this to you is just cruel.
Your English is wonderful 🖤 no judgement here 🖤 and thats horrible and sickening. I'm sorry someone, especially your brother, did that to you. Yes, it was your past- but you have the power to decide that that past is dead. You are who you are now. Never let anyone take that away from you 🖤🖤🖤 we must kill who we used to be- so that we can become all we can be
Hmm....

Maybe, explain it to him like being in witness protection. You have a new life, new name, potentially even a new identity. When people find out about the old identity, it can be dangerous, whether it be for your mental health, or your physical well-being (not sure how accepting it is where you live). Let him know by sharing old information that's not true to who you are anymore is harmful, and potentially dangerous."	m420sg	NonBinary	13	1.0	2021-03-13 08:05:54
Having a hard time getting my queer friends to understand what Nonbinary means.	"So I moved away from my home state of Kentucky to Colorado for the purpose of trying to understand myself and to grow into the person I knew I wanted to be. It's a lot easier to come to accept myself in a place that generally nobody cares what you do as long as you don't bother them about it.

 I have come to a problem though of my few friends out here that are queer don't seem to get the whole nonbinary thing. Like there's some kind of disconnect from the idea all together and it's becoming harder and harder to explain. For the most part I don't bother with trying to get most people to use my pronouns correctly but my friends I'd like to because I'm around them the most. A recent example was a friend started misgendering me regularly again and I was too stressed at the time to really call it out and I just left it be. Eventually I confronted her about it and she told me ""well you've been acting so much like a guy lately, not doing chores, being all mad, and what not. I figured it didn't matter anymore. It's a lot easier to use someone's pronouns when they are living their truth."" Which there's a lot of stereotyping problems there as well as a slew of other problems, but this is the same person that prides themselves that their best friend is trans and that they are so accepting and a safe space.

Idk this may just all be a rant, but I just wish people got it. I wish people understood the senselessness of constantly putting people into these boxes. I'm sick of being assumed to be something I'm not and judged and stereotyped within that. I just want to be me."	"I find the problem with a lot of people (even in the community) is that what they see on the outside dictates what is.  For example I'm an AFAB ENBY when I wear my suit I get a lot of ""sirs"" ""bro"" or ""dude"" from the general public.  Likewise when I have the smallest splash of makeup on its miss, ma'am, sweetie etc.  For some reason people think Enbies are supposed to be completely androgynous and that's not the. Ase for most of us.

Honestly I would not call these people ""friends"" if they can't remember simple pronouns.

It would be like if that girl who misgendered you out was bi and you were like ""you almost never date guys just call yourself a lesbian already"" it's invalidating to her identity but why is it fair if she does that to you.

Get better people in your life, heartache over the ignorant ones is never worth it and they rarely if ever change.
I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Your friend is not being supportive and that sucks. I hope things improve for you 🙏

Are you in Denver, or Co Springs? I find Denver to be very good for nonbinary people *relatively*. If you're in the Denver area, I can point you in the direction of a few groups here, including B-Connected, an enby friendly bisexual affinity group in the Denver area (they are on meetup.com). If you want more suggestions, DM me. I wish you luck with your friends

Edit you're to your
Your friend, which I also would struggle to call anyone who is fine with misgendering me a friend, sounds like she is being passive aggressive about issues she has with you and then used misgendering as a way to bring them up? Which is doubly problematic! And not a good start to what should be a healthy, safe and communicative living situation. Since that’s what everyone deserves. 

I think if you’re going to continue living with and being friends with this person, imo you’re going to have to have a sit down, serious discussion where you set some firm boundaries. No matter how she feels about your behavior, misgendering is never okay, and her deciding what your gender and pronouns are based on cis rules and perceptions is transphobia, period. You are living your truth by existing and she does not get to define that for you. If she can’t do that, I don’t feel like it’s sustainable to continue a close relationship with her since every single time she’s saying “I don’t care about you enough to listen to you and validate who you are.” Yikes. You could say something like, “I am nonbinary, my pronouns are they/them, and every time you misgender me I need you to understand that you are actively harming me and invalidating who I am. Please only use they/them pronouns moving forward.” 

Also in this conversation, you could say something like “It also feels like you have expectations on chores that haven’t been communicated. Let’s talk about who does what, so expectations are clear and we can avoid miscommunication issues like this in the future.” 

Sorry you’re dealing with that, relationships of all kinds are complicated— but pronouns are simple and at the end of the day, it’s a matter of care and respect.
I even used that example with her because she is Bi and pointed out she only goes out with guys and she got real pissy about it.

I'm having a hard time making any genuine friends where I am. People are entitled and self-centered. Getting anyone to go out and do a thing with out the plans changing 5 times is impossible if the plans don't get cancelled first. It feels so weird.

I'm trying to find a good nonbinary discord group to join. I struggle with finding good servers though.
I'm not I'm actually up on the north west corner. Currently it's not the easiest to get in and out of the valley. We have a pride group in the valley but several of the people in it I've had problems with also misgendering. But if you have any suggestions for the eastern end or know of online groups I do enjoy a good online group.
We had a pretty solid sit down over it. Things are better since. I think the core of it is she still kinda has the mentality of cis normative culture. She's older than me and grew up in a different time. She occasionally will go on full tangents about how awful men are solely using stereotypes as her basis, then tells me stuff like ""I plan on marrying and divorcing a bunch of dudes so they'll come around and do stuff for me."" So it's apparent there's some underlying sexism.

She used to not be so passive aggressive and self focused. We both have gone through a lot of stressers lately and she seems to have come out really jaded. I know she can do better than this because I've seen it. I'm just struggling to get her understanding.
I use meetup.com to find new social circles.  I promise nothing but check it out.
I lived in Denver for two years and I know the pandemic impacted this, but I had an difficult time making consistent and deeper connections. I’m super social and making friends was always easy for me, but it was an incredibly tough and lonely time. I ended up moving back home for family reasons, but I do think you’ll have to be very intentional and put a lot of effort in to find and make those friendships. My job was stressful and time consuming and I know that got in the way, so I don’t think it’s impossible by any means, I was just surprised by how hard it was!
OK! I can ask if we can bring you into a gender support discord for Denver- Boulder/front range if you'd like. Do you use discord?
With do, thank you lots!
I'm out on the northwest end of Colorado stuck in a valley that is kinda hard to get in and out of in a safe fashion. We don't have a lot of people that aren't transient. the pandemic definitely seem to make it worse for sure. I have a few friends on the front range and I honestly think I'd do better there than here but Ive already gotten settled and enjoy snowboarding too much lol
That'd be awesome, I'll DM you my discord!"	10e847x	NonBinary	11	0.93	2023-01-17 09:32:48
My cousin thinks Nonbinary validating names are stupid. (Apologies if this is triggering, remember that you are valid!)	"(Possible TW: Belittleing names, general tomfoolery, etc. If this is not of your taste, I recommend that you skip my post.)  
Also, sorry about the way this is formatted/typed out, I usually don't post too much.

&#x200B;

I, myself, am \*not\* Nonbinary, (I'm trans FtM, and I use he/him pronouns), but my cousin is Nonbinary, and I feel bad for arguing with them because I feel as if they are more cultured on this topic, but it made me fairly angry when they started telling me about how they hated it when people used names such as Rock, Sock, Berry, Fig, etc.

I defended it saying that people who use those names are super valid and that they shouldn't say that they are stupid. Nonetheless, they proceeded to belittle and make fun of those names, even after I had asked them to stop. I took the time to explain that it is validating to be called certain names, even if it comes down to something that \*they\* might not like themself. But they would ignore me and made the obligatory:  ""Hello 3ds XL whats up"" joke, and it really made me angry they were making fun of it, unironically at that.

I just want to know, was I in the right to stand up to them because of it? They seem really mad at me, and I'm afraid to contact them again, I ask for any and all advice, and I am SO sorry that some of you may have to deal with this kind of stuff daily.

Remember, take care, please. Have some water, get yourself a snack. Lots of people care for you lots!  


Edit: Caught a spelling error."	"I agree with you, but I'm guessing the problem is that your cousin feels that such names undermine the perceived legitimacy of being non-binary. If they themself weren't subject to a discriminatory world, probably they wouldn't care about those names any more than the average woman cares about a name like Dolly, or a man cares about something like Biff. So if it were me, I'd probably back off of the ""Are not valid!"" ""Are too!"" aspect of this and work on helping the cousin see how the forms of oppression are all connected.
Of course it was right. Stand up for any injustice. Telling people that their selection is invalid is a slap to the face. Ppl don’t just pick the first name they see. They take time to carefully pick a name that they believe represents them. It seems as if your cousin is a new non-binary and still has a bit of internalized transphobia that directs them to say “well I’m not a crazy one, I’m more normal” this is how they defend themselves in their gender identity. Given time they’ll come into themselves and be more sympathetic and understanding
I'm non binary. If a binary trans person, man or woman, starting talking bigoted shit about other trans men or trans women, I would call that shit out. Calling out your cousin for being an ass to other non binary people is fine.
Thank you very much, this helps lots and I'll make sure to talk with them about it.  
Thank you again!
You make a very strong point here. Often, the toxicity that trans people--both binary and non binary--put on eachother is based oppressive  beliefs and norms that they have internalized.
Early in being out my take was bad very much because of this. I have a really hard time with acceptability because I’m 28, started coming out at 25/26 and really want people to take me seriously. But eventually I got over myself because it’s not my name or pronouns or whatever I was angry about and why be shitty about something that makes someone else feel good. Men and women do that shit all the time and it’s toxic when they do it for someone in their or other genders and it’s toxic when we do it to.
They way you explained them pretty much fits it correctly, they like to think that they're the only normal Nonbinary person ever and that everything else is weird, which is wrong, all Nonbinary people are super valid and normal in my opinion. Thank you for your reply!
Thank you! Personally I feared I had made the wrong choice of arguing with them but seeing the replies honestly is helping me stand my ground a bit. It's good that I didn't make the wrong decision because they often enjoy telling anyone who disagrees with them that they're stupid.
I'll be the first to admit, they're very pushy with what they believe, (such as all men being shit, which kinda hurts as a trans man, and that my loveable other is ""disgusting"" because they use they/he pronouns (in order of prefrence) which \*totally\* means they're a guy, great sarcasm I have here, I know.) and what they say \*really\* hurts.  
Thank you for your view on this!
I see, they've been like this for a while but this is one of the situations where they express that they don't like it. I'm doing my best to help them out of that mindset though, thank you for the reply!
>It's good that I didn't make the wrong decision because they often enjoy telling anyone who disagrees with them that they're stupid.

I got the same habit. It's not laudible, but it is common.
I'm glad you can admit it, honestly they have trouble admitting that they're wrong and that they have that habit."	n2r75i	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-05-01 20:52:26
Just told my grandmother about my name change and it went amazingly. I just want to share this positive experience.	"I haven't actually told people about being nonbinary yet, though I have dropped a lot of hints and I know some people strongly suspect it. Instead, I started out by changing my name, since I've been saying I didn't like my name since way before I even started suspecting stuff myself. 

So, I've just been telling people about the name change without mentioning any gender stuff. Today, I told my grandmother about my new name, and she was she super supportive. I didn't expect her to be against it, but maybe just kind of indifferent or have a hard time with the idea, but no, she starts telling me how it's totally okay, and so many people do that nowadays since it's legal and accepet and everything, and of course she's going to start using my new name, and asking how my parents took it. And then she tells me she's been waiting for this, and I'm like, oh? And apparently she's been suspecting that I wasn't a girl for quite some time, since I completely stopped wearing feminine clothing and at my 18th birthday I was wearing a dress shirt and vest and stuff.  She tells me about how she's been watching TV programs about trans people (she couldn't remember the word, but still) and just starts ranting about how people could possibly get mad about stuff like that and how disgusting it is when parents reject or attack their trans kids and gay kids. You can just imagine how happy all this made me to hear. 

(Apparently she also knew from very early on that my uncle would either turn out gay, forever single, or marry someone with kids, but he would not have kids of his own. And she was right. He did in fact die single at fifty-something, with no kids, and I at least don't remember him ever dating anyone or talking about it, so there might have been some asexuality or aromanticism?)

I wasn't quite ready to actually tell her about being nonbinary, and I don't know how much she knows and how she feels about stuff outside the gender binary, so I didn't tell her about that. I did tell her that I don't quite feel like a man, but also not like a woman. If she knows about nonbinary, she probably strongly suspects. If not, she just thinks I'm still figuring it out, which, other than just being not binary, I am. And that's totally cool with her too. 

She also asked if I wanted her to tell her sister-in-law, my father's aunt, unlike my mother, who just started telling family member when she talked to them, and only told me afterwards that they knew (I know she has good intentions. She still could have told me first though).

So, all in all, turns out my grandmother is more knowledgeable and progressive than I thought, and she's both very accepting, understanding, and pro-LGBTQ+."	"That is so great to hear, and i'm glad that you shared it with us! I honor this big brave step that you took, and I know that whenever you're ready to take the next one, that it'll be beautiful and meaningful as well! I trust grandma will be a safe place then too. <3
That's so wonderful! I'm so happy to hear that! 

I'm sure it was pretty scary at times, but it's great! I hope everyone else will react the same! We love supportive grandparents and stories! 

Have a great day! :)"	mhaxaa	NonBinary	13	0.9	2021-03-31 17:18:16

Pronouns Questions	"Hi! I don’t mean to get anyone mad with this, just figured this thread might be the place to ask. I live in a very small town in Italy, where I’ve never come across any NB whatsoever, so please forgive me for not knowing everything, I’m still trying to learn and don’t want to be left behind. 
Do people who use they/them pronouns want to be referred as a they in every context? I know this might sound weird, but I never got the chance to ask anyone. Am I supposed to say like “do YOU want to grab coffee?” like in a plural way? Or is it wrong ‘cause it sounds like singular? I’m not a native english speaker so if you add the language problem, this gets me really confused. Pelase help, I wanna be more conscious about this and help y’all.
Also can someone explain actually what it feels like to be they/them? I feel like this stuff should be taught in school, but in small town like mine we hardly even talk about it!
Thanks and sorry for my uncultured ass."	"Only in third person do you refer to people as 'they'.
Ask the individual if they're comfortable being referred to by 'they' pronouns in every context, as they might not be out - and ask what pronouns they'd prefer in those contexts.
It's okay to not know things - I love to see people learning ❤
hi! the usage really depends for each person. some people’s have different preferences and it’s best to just ask individually!

personally, the only thing i like to be called is they/them. for me i just don’t feel like a boy or a girl. i tend to look more femme just because i was afab but i try to look as androgynous as i can 😊
When you're asking about using ""you"" in a plural way, are you meaning in Italian? I'm not familiar with Italian or if it works like this, but I had some limited French and I recall there were separate words for ""you"" singular/informal and ""you"" plural/formal. If that's true for Italian, I'm pretty sure it would not be the plural you for a single nonbinary person.  The use of they/them in English is not because it is plural, it's because it is not gendered. There are a lot of jokes online about being plural, but most people don't actually think they are plural. (This may vary, so if you meet someone you can definitely ask them what they prefer. Pronoun preferences can vary and this might be a cultural difference for Italian nonbinary people.)

There isn't one definition for feeling like you're a they since there are many sub-labels for nonbinary (for example, agender, third gender, and genderfluid may have different reasoning).  For me, it is similar to how a cis man might feel being called ""she"" and ""Ms"" and ""ma'am"" by a stranger. It's uncomfortable, it doesn't fit. Something is inherently wrong about it and it feels bad or weird to hear it used. 

Unlike a cis man, however, as a nonbinary person I feel this way about both feminine terms and masculine terms (she/her and he/him pronouns and other descriptiors). Even as a kid, long before terms like nonbinary were used, I often had a gut reaction of ""no, I'm not one of them!"" When told to go join a group of kids with my assigned birth gender.  

Some nonbinary people like to keep one or both of the binary pronouns due to their gender partially aligning with that gender (like demigirl or demiboy) or for any number of other reasons (including their native language lacking a gender neutral option, it being unsafe in some spaces to be that openly nonbinary, being used to a certain group of people they know using their AGAB pronouns and not wanting to put forth the effort to change that, etc.).
Usiamo ""they"" invece di lui o lei. Quindi non è che lo usi se parlassi con una persona direttamente perché ""you"" è quello che dici di più. 

In rispetto di come si sente...molto complicato. Allora devo dire che ognuno ha una esperienza diverso a rispetto del genere. Siccome non sono donna ne uomo, ""they/them"" è un modo per riconoscere questo fatto della mia vita. In inglese diciamo ""I feel seen"" e non so come tradurre in italiano ma sarebbe forse che una persona mi conosce come sono e non per come voglia vedermi secondo le tradizioni storti della società.
I think the most concise way I can explain what it sounds like you’re confused about is to say that generally you would just replace the he/him or she/her you’d normally use with they/them, so it only applies if you’d otherwise be saying he/him or she/her. For example, if someone uses she/her pronouns, you would still use the word “you” when speaking directly to them. The same is true for they/them.
You use they/them in replacement for when you would use she/her or he/him. Like “they walked to the market” instead of “he walked to the market”.
Thank you very much, I guess asking the individual is indeed the most respectful thing to do.
Thanks! I really appreciate all this help🥰 Guess I’ll simply ask what makes the individual comfortable, seems the most polite and respectful way.
Like also in English, take for instance a “Thank you”, would it be okay? Also yeah, Italian works pretty much the same as french, there is “tu” wich is sigular you and “voi” wich is the plural you. But i feel like we don’t really have a neutral one, at least we do but it’s technically reffered to objects, which seems kinda rude to use for an individual.
Also, thanks a lot for the explanation, it is way clearer now, I think in the future I’ll simply ask the individual what makes them comfortable!
Ok quindi tipo dovrei dire “vuoi prendere un caffè” che alla fine è neutrale in un certo senso, non è nè femminile nè maschile giusto?
Yep, ""thank you"" and anything directly talking to someone would be the same as someone who isn't nonbinary.  ""Oh, you forgot your wallet!"" or ""You're welcome"" or anything like that where you're talking to the person are used regardless of gender.  ""You"" and ""I"" are both non-gendered and work the same for everyone.  The ones that change are 3rd person pronouns - so if you were talking about a woman and said ""Oh, **she** has 2 really cute dogs!"" - that's when you'd use ""they"" if the person was nonbinary instead of a woman.  This may change in Italian, I'm not that good at other languages - some individuals may prefer the object-they option, others may have a gendered pronoun preference (even if it isn't accurate, one may feel better than the other).

It's definitely best to just ask the person in languages where a neutral option doesn't really exist or may be rude like you mention for objects.  If it's a language they speak, they will probably have put some thought into what they'd rather use; whatever they want to use is correct for that person, even if it is one of the gendered pronouns (it may or may not match their assigned gender at birth and that's fine either way!).

As long as you are considerate and willing to use what someone asks you to - you should be just fine!  Being willing to learn and change how you speak to someone for their comfort when asked are all wonderful things - it's always great to see people want to learn and be inclusive, so thank you!
Si, esatto. Vuoi/you non ha un genere in inglese."	px4rlm	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-09-28 11:56:10
For the next time someone tells you that the singular they is grammatically incorrect:	"* The [MLA](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/#:~:text=Specific%20Use,paper%20on%20Jane%20Austen's%20Persuasion) (Modern Language Association) and the [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they) (American Psychological Association) both changed their rules to accept using they as a generic pronoun and a nonbinary pronoun.
* Grammarly and Dictionary.com are pro-singular they/them. \[[citation](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/use-the-singular-they/), [citation](https://www.dictionary.com/e/they-is-a-singular-pronoun/)\]
* In September 2019, Merriam-Webster added an entry to the word ""they"" to include using it in the singular sense, specifically for nonbinary folks. \[[citation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/they)\]
* The Oxford Dictionary has traced back the usage of the singular they to 1375. Although, that's just usage in writing, so it's very likely that the singular they was used verbally long before then too. \[[citation](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/)\]
* The American Dialect Society chose the singular they (in the context of a nonbinary person's pronouns) as their 2015 Word of the Year \[[citation](https://www.americandialect.org/2015-word-of-the-year-is-singular-they)\], and as their Word of the Decade in 2020 \[[citation](https://www.americandialect.org/woty)\].
* We use the word ""you"" as both a singular second person and a plural second person pronoun, so why is the singular they so wrong? \[citation: the English language\]
   * Back in the day (and I mean like, the 1600s), older folks would get mad at younger folks for using the word ""you"" in the singular sense. \[[citation](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/)\]
* Also, grammarians have been bickering about this for roughly the last 200 years \[citation\], so if anyone tells you ""ThEsE tRaNsGeNdeR sNoWfLaKeS aRe JuSt iNvEnTiNG woRdS""
* Many revered English authors throughout history, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austen, have all used the singular they in their writing. \[[citation](https://www.dictionary.com/e/they-is-a-singular-pronoun/)\]
* Wikipedia also has a [whole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they) article about this very topic that I don't feel like summarizing if you wanna check it out.

So, in conclusion, language evolves over time, and you're completely valid.

Side note: I speak English (obviously), so this post is about the English language. But for those of you live somewhere where the main language isn't English, y'all are completely valid too. I don't have any websites to back me up on this, but I can say with 100% certainty that your pronouns are not grammatically incorrect either."	"That's really interesting, thanks. Language change is a truly democratic process....if enough people use something,  then it's considered to be in use. Most professional linguists are descriptivists, ie they look at language in use. Prescriptivists want to limit and dictate how language is used....very few of them are linguists. They know better!. Spare a thought for the anti they brigade though. Imagine seeing beautiful language change all around you, and only being able to feel outrage, anger and bigotry 🤣.
Technically, language features which are in a process of change, such as the adaptation of pronouns, are said to be transitional. Seems appropriate somehow!
Something important to remember about historical usage though is that singular they was used almost exclusively to refer to someone of unknown or unspecified gender until relatively recently. It's still grammatically correct, and always has been, but it's widespread usage as a person's preferred pronoun hasn't been around for very long.
You pretty much nailed that argument - with receipts. Also, any system that's grammatically consistent has a grammar. That's like saying ebonics isn't valid."	jh494x	NonBinary	12	0.99	2020-10-24 06:33:01
Dear nonbinary people	"A why are yall so goddamn cool

B  if i validate a trans girl by calling her beautiful and I validate a trans guy by calling him handsome then what do i call a nb person without assuming how they wanna be

C will you folk be mad if i call you guys mattress instead of mister or misses because I always do it and my friends never answer but it makes me chuckle"	"A: because we aren’t worried about gender 
B: amazing, wonderful, androgynous(in some circumstances), or any synonyms
C: I love mattress as a form of addressing but i prefer to just keep it informal always, even in teaching or work environments
A=thanks
B= depends on the nb person so aks
c=amaing lol

Thanks for.asking
A: We just are. 

B: Depends on what the person in question likes to be called. 

C: I love that 😂.
A. all the energy that wouldve gone to gender goes to coolness instead

B. attractive is a pretty gender neutral term, or just say stuff like ""you look so good"" or ask them what they mind and dont mind, itll make them feel good to know that you care enough to go out of your way and ask

c. again, ask. other people in the replies seem to like mattress, i personally dont so it depends on the person
A: being cool starts with not giving a fuck and we're collectively out of fucks

B: magical, gorgeous, magnificent all work for me, idk about others

C: I've e heard ""mastress"" but mattress is a new one haha"	hxhz79	NonBinary	11	0.88	2020-07-25 06:14:39
Non-binary signals that I missed... Gawd I was so oblivious!	"In hindsight, this was a crystal clear non-binary signal: every form I filled out with a M or F check-box made me hesitate a bit. Gawd, I was so oblivious for so long! ... “check M or F” made me hesitate and cringe because I was literally lying! ...Gawd... so oblivious!   
  ... I mean, unless it was a medical form asking if I’m a person with a prostate, etc! In that case, and ONLY in that case, I check M without cringing!! And when it’s an online form, I politely insist that they add some thing (anything) to the M or F. 

Here’s another non-binary signal I missed: I always congratulated myself for flexible thinking when presented with a choice: choose one of A or a B. My mind ALWAYS rephrased the question as choose A, B, both, or neither. There I was congratulating myself for being open minded and scientific, and the entire time I was literally rejecting the Binary! Gawd... so oblivious!   

(Bemused, shakes head. At least I’m not mad about it!) 

Hooray for hindsight, I guess. What are some other stories from our awesome community with signals that we obliviously missed?"	"In high school for art class we had to make wax figured. They had to have a gender. Everyone made either a boy figure or a girl figure. I didn't, and when the teacher asked about the gender of my figure, I responded with a bunch of mumbles that basically summarised to ""no"".
I gave a speech in front of my entire public speaking class in high school—including my crush at the time—about that fact that they/them has historically been used singularly and “some people today” still preferred that (I had never heard the term nonbinary before). Everyone was surprisingly chill about it—I even got some nice comments about how classmates had never thought about that—and it never occurred to me to be self-conscious about potentially outing myself because I was totally just sharing a cool grammar fact guys!

Before that, when I was around 17, I started writing a character who was female but not a woman who was referred to as they/them in my creative writing class. Again, I have no conscious memory of ever having heard of an NB person before that, I just kind of independently created the concept of being NB because it spoke to me."	kfeyeq	NonBinary	12	0.93	2020-12-18 05:23:53
"My mom doesn't use ""nicknames"""	"So I came out to my mom a long time ago, but I told her I changed my name only a few months ago. She's very progressive for a white southern Trump-et living in Texas. So I trusted her more than all of the other adults in my family. She understands that I'm gay, she doesn't understand that I'm pansexual, and she thinks that non-binary is a very fancy way of saying bisexual. I never expected her to use my pronouns, but I thought she wouldn't have that hard of a time with the name change. However, when I told her I changed my name she responded, ""That's, cool. I'm not mad at you. I'm still going to call you baby girl, and address you by your birth name"". I know I probably had high expectations, but I wasn't expecting her to be mad, so her saying she wasn't was really weird. I then asked, you would still call me by my birth name even though I told you no one has called me that in 3 years? She said yea it's the name my father gave me. Well that's fine, I didn't expect to much, after all parents have a different connection to their kids names than literally everyone else. But, recently, my sibling changed their name, and I'm not deadnaming them obviously. My sibling is not biologically related to me and lives with different parents then my mom, so my mom has no attachment to their birthname whatsoever. I talk about them in conversation commonly so when it came up with my mom I said, ""(name) did this. Oh by the way (birth name) changed their name to (name)."" And my mom responded, ""I don't do nicknames"" That's when I remembered, she genuinely doesn't give a crap what ppl want to be called. My mom has multiple friends, some are black and some are Mexican and if she can't pronounce their name by the 2nd try she gives them a nickname, and if they give her a nickname to use bc everyone else calls them that, she refuses and either calls them by their actual name or whatever nickname she comes up with. She's a bit racist in this regard as well, because she believes that their nicknames are ""stupid and unprofessional"" What I want her to understand is that a trans person name, including nonbinaries are important to them and not just nicknames."	"“It’s not a nickname. I have changed my name. This is legally no longer my name. I will not answer to it.”
Mom is a nickname... How upset would she be if you called her by her name instead...
Yikes :(
I thought about doing this. She hates when I call her mother bc it gives her bates motel vibes, I could only imagine how she would react if I just went up to her and addressed her by her name. Or even more annoying her whole name. However, I can see this backfiring bc I don't want to be called by my whole name, I have pretty much dropped all of it."	12bnylx	NonBinary	12	0.94	2023-04-04 16:15:46
i came out to my bf's parents, they are now mad at him (cw: unaccepting parents)	"I came out to my boyfriend's parents as nonbinary. And now his dad is angry at we told his siblings before we told him.

I'm beyond any describable feeling at this point. I'm sad. I'm angry. I'm scared, for myself but mostly for him. He isn't out to his family yet and i offered to come out to them first since I've been out for a while to other people and my own family for a long time. His parents seemed pretty neutral on it, his mother just sort of shrugged and said ""you're you. That's all that matters."" His dad on the other hand seemed like he didn't like the news very much but was trying to (poorly) hide his disdain. When we told him that his siblings already knew, he got LIVID. I've never seen him angry at all before and my boyfriend had never seen him that angry, let alone with him. His dad claims that he isn't angry that i came out and that the fact that we told his siblings first is a separate issue but I can only imagine that he was upset because he couldn't control that information and ""make it go away"" somehow (and i shudder to think of what that could mean, although i seriously doubt he'd do anything rash or violent). He is a rather large guy and is very aware of his strength and size, so it's easy to say that I'm terrified of him. I know he would never hurt anyone who hadn't thrown the first punch because he is not that kind of man, but that doesn't make him any less intimidating or scary. 

I'm terrified for my boyfriend and what all of this could mean for him because we both currently live with our parents. He is a bisexual man who isn't out yet to his folks, so i can imagine he is terrified that they will disown him if they found out about that on top of all of this. I've never really felt ashamed of my identity before because i was and am very fortunate to have understanding and accepting parents, so i don't know if that's what I'm feeling now. All i know is that i feel awful, hopeless, and disheartened knowing that he is in trouble and potential danger solely because of who I am. My heart aches for him and it aches for his siblings (one is most likely nonbinary and not out yet/is questioning). I wish i could just run away with him and never turn back but we both have obligations to friends, work, and family where we are now and we wouldn't have enough funds to get by for long. I feel lost and trapped. All i can do is offer him a safe space to go but i want to do so much more than that for him. I know it's not my fault here, but i can't help but feel guilty when all of this is happening *because* of my mere existence. I wish i could just undo all of it and go back to being in the closet again. If it meant he would no longer be scared of his father, I'd take being misgendered for as long as I need to."	"I'm sorry, that sounds so difficult. I also grew up with a really open parent and struggled when I met my in-laws who judged me for my class and background, and I felt they blamed me for the way my partner and I lived as adults. Experiencing oppression from within your family is a very different and more vulnerable position than just from general society.

It was very kind of you to offer to come out to your bf's parents before him, so please don't feel guilty for it. Try to look at it like your bf's dad is the one responsible for his own anger and making sure he doesn't bring harm to his family. It isn't your existence or coming out that is the problem.

I also think it's so normal to tell the siblings first before the parents, those siblings are probably your peers and have way less power over the two of you than the father has.
My thoughts exactly! But i have a feeling that he saw that as a knock against his authority over the house, which is very childish and immature imo. I'm trying to look at things that way. From what little i know about him, he can be prone to overreaction and then calm down much later. Luckily it sounds like things have somewhat calmed down in his house, but there's definitely a major rift. I'm still not totally convinced that his freak out over who got told first isn't a red herring to cover for his dislike of trans folks (he's also one of those ""no trans women in women's sports"" kind of assholes). The most either one of us can do is play the rest by ear though so it is what it is, i suppose."	y5mq59	NonBinary	13	0.93	2022-10-16 17:36:24
What is wrong with me??	My gender is fecked. I feel like I’m nothing and everything at the same time. Like I’m *a* gender, but not male or female. I definitely have one concrete gender, but I feel like it’s some weird knockoff version. Sometimes I’m leaning a little masc or femme, but I’m not a boy or girl. I feel confused and sad and mad at myself for being so worthless.	"Just because you don't exactly know what you are or how you feel doesn't mean something is ""wrong with you"" or that you're ""worthless."" The concept and idea of having to know who you are and what you are at a certain point is ridiculous. Self-discovery journeys can take months, years, a whole life. But the point of them is to take it the pace *you* want to go. And to explore or experiment in however way *you* want to. If you can't figure out what your gender is, that's why you need to experiment with pronouns and presentation, to see what clicks with you or not.

Masculinity and femininity isn't exclusively to male and female. A male could be effeminate. A female could be masculine. Someone that's agender (gender-less) could present and behave more masculine, but it doesn't mean they're a male/boy. Same thing for someone that is neutrois (gender neutral or ""dull gender""), or someone that's androgyne. Some could lean more towards femininity, some masculinity. Others, completely neutral or a combination of both, but not always equally. Masculinity and femininity are concepts, they are not determining factors of what makes someone a certain gender.

Have you considered Perigender (identifying *with* a gender but not *as* a gender) or Paragender (feeling very close to/near a gender and partially something else which keeps you from feeling fully that gender)? There's also Offgender (a gender that closely represents/is most closely represented by another gender, but is not that gender).

Also Maverique (characterized by autonomy and inner conviction regarding a sense of self that is entirely independent of male, female, masculinity, femininity or anything which derives from the two while still being neither without gender nor of a neutral gender).

And Ilyagender (a gender in which one has a tangible presence of gender. However, that gender is not man, woman, neutral, or agender in any way. It is not in between any of these genders, and it is not a combination or derivation of any of those genders).

Lastly, there's also Egogender/Charagender (a gender which can only be defined by oneself).

You just have to be willing to do research and be patient with time, because in order to figure out your gender, you need to experiment with many different things, like social roles, how you present yourself, trying different pronouns, etc. I also highly recommend talking to a gender therapist to talk about this with. They can help you organize your thoughts better, which in turn will allow you to figure things out more efficiently and effectively.
All gender identities are 100% valid, you are not worthless. Your description reminds me of these labels. I hope some of them stick out to u and hope u know ur not alone and if they don’t that’s totally valid too because there’s plenty of undiscovered genders, there’s genders I might not have heard of and have known to put on the list, and there’s a gender called egogender that pretty much just means ur gender is completely individual to u and it’s just as valid.

You could be an androgyne. That’s what I mostly identify as.

And more importantly, you’re not worthless. You just exist in a world obsessed with a gender model that doesn’t actually represent the reality of a lot of people.
Awesome, you have similar gender as me XD confusing to explain but know how you feel anyways. The 2 labels that match me is agenderfluid as I feel like my base is agender but I often feel partial connection to either boy or girl. Also demigender also pretty closely matches how I feel

Yea, don't worry about it or the label XD you know how you feel, so just be you :) I found it frustrating myself trying to put a label on it, I have settled on the label, but what really helped me was stop worrying about the labelling it. Just express how you feel that day
Thank you for this. I learned new words today!

Young Non-Binary needing help.	"I originally posted this in r/TooAfraidToAsk

Sorry if it's a bit of a mess. 

I believe myself to be somewhat rational, for the most part.

I was born a female. I know what's down there.
I was always a bit of a tomboy. This doesn't affect your gender, yes, but I still believe it to be an important piece of evidence.

At age 11-12, I can't pin down an exact point, I started to question myself. Mainly, my femininity. I didn't like being a girl. I never was into the ""normal"" female things. Being a male felt more natural, but still a bit off. After a bit of research, I learned of being non-binary, specifically, to be neither gender. Finally, I found something that felt right.

Now, I know that just because I wasn't a girly-girl isn't grounds for transitioning, my feelings went beyond that. When I was called she, it made my chest feel tight. Wearing feminine clothes was about the most uncomfortable thing I could do. 
Months later, I finally convinced my mother to let me get a shorter haircut, and it was as if a piece of me had been restored. I started wearing more neutral/male leaning clothes, and I felt better.

Though outwardly I did all this, I was still in the closet. I had told my mother, but we more or less swept it under the rug. She still used my birth name and pronouns. I didn't mind, as I felt coming out at such a young age was a bad idea. I at least had the insight to know that it could have been just a phase. 

Fast forward to age 15. I had been living with these thoughts of transitioning for nearly 3-4 years. It nearly drove me mad. I was stuck. I dressed neutral, had a short haircut, and strangers even called me by male pronouns or neutral they/them. It was nice, but I wanted more. I wanted people to call me they/them, and I wanted to be called by a different name. 
I can say for sure I wasn't an SJW. Even online, if people referred to me as a female, I didn't go nuts. I felt mature enough to handle being transgender, but I had no clue how to come out to my peers, the rest of my family, and to have my mother be on board. 

I asked to get counseling. I assumed it would help me by either letting me live with these feelings, make them go away, or to help me come out.
Needless to say, it didn't. 
While my counselor was a lovely woman, she basically told me to just find peace where I was. I had been where I was for 4 years. There was no hope of peace.

Fast forward again, into highschool. Everyone knew something was up. Substitutes called me 'sir', people saw the way I dressed. It was hard to keep quiet. I was so close to having my secret out, it just needed to be confirmed. Still, my mother and I never discussed it, and when we did, she always told me to keep it in.

Now, at age 17, living with this for 6 years, I'm ready to come out.
I want to be known as they/them (though if people referred to me as a female, it wouldn't bug me. I just want to come out of the closet.)

Here, though, if my question.
Should I come out?
Is being non-binary something bad? I hear the term 'special snowflake' a lot.
How should I go about this? How do I live with this?

Tl;dr I have known I'm trans for 6 years, and I don't know what to do."	"You don't owe coming out to anyone, that's for you. Come out to anyone you feel comfortable with or want to know, you're not required to come out to everyone you meet in order to transition. That therapist was just flat out unqualified to treat you. Gender dysphoria has nothing to do with self esteem, you can't love yourself out of being transgender. Everyone has self esteem issues and they certainly are going to interact with other issues like dysphoria, but they're not the same thing. When people say things like ""Can't you just be gender noncomforming and love yourself for what you are?"" I just want to scream. Can't you just love your impacted wisdom teeth or your inflamed appendix? Once gender or sexuality become part of the equation, people act like it's some abstract component, separate from the body (which the brain/mind/hormones are a part of, duh) that has no connection to health and medicine, like it's a political stance.

&#x200B;

Being nonbinary isn't good or bad, anymore than being male or female is good or bad. Intentions are good or bad, actions are good or bad...genders are just a fact about a person. Some people are bigots and put it down, to make themselves feel superior, but those kinds of people would always find SOMETHING to be a dick about. Be yourself, get professional help from someone who specializes in gender issues, come out to whoever, however, whenever you feel ok and safe about it.
Ok, couple of things, and these might be harder or easier depending on your status in life right now.

For starters, I’d recommend finding a different counselor/therapist, because the one you had sounds awful. I’d suggest looking for a sex-positive therapist. There are resources online that can point you in the right direction for your area and budget. Whether you decide to come out or not, whether you transition or not, you are going through some stuff right now that not a lot of people know how to deal with. A therapist can help you find your place in the world, and if you DO come out, they can help guide those conversations to be positive and productive,

As far as talking about this with your family, well that depends on your family. Coming out can be freeing, and affirming and great. It can also be painful and lengthy and result in losing family and friends. Use your best judgment. How open is your family? How educated in this area are they? Are they super conservative? Have they given you a lot of grief about not being “feminine enough” in the past?

In some cases, until you are on your own, stable, healthy, and safe, you are best off living with the secret. It may be painful to be closeted, but it’s better than being kicked out or abused. You have to put your health first. Is there anyone in your family that you are particularly close to? That you trust above the others? Try talking to them first. Be casual, see where the conversation goes. Leave yourself an out. “I heard about this gender stuff online, what do you think?” Or “what would you say to a person like this?”

Just be careful, and make sure you aren’t going to burn any bridges you can’t afford to lose.
You write very maturely for your age, amd it reminds me of myself when I was in high school.

You're way ahead of the game when it comes to figuring yourself out. That's super awesome that you have the language to describe how you feel. I know it can be isolating.

Do you have any LGBTQ community, either online or in person? That would be the #1 thing I recommend. Join a Facebook/Instagram/whatever group online for nonbinary or LGBTQ people.

Also, you could check to see if you have a PFLAG chapter in your area. It's a ""parents of lesbian and gay"" group but oftentimes they have youth meetings, especially at interfaith churches or schools. You might be able to find a parent-figure who supports you with your identity and can help you talk to your mom.

Does your school have a gay-straight alliance or anything? Are you out to any friends?
God, I love how you worded the first part. I'd love to quote that, as my family does believe my gender identity is connected to self esteem. Thank you for that. 

You're very wise, I appreciate the time you took to give me advice. 
Your advice is lovely to hear, and I'll be sure to keep it in mind when I look for a professional.

I've talked it over with my mother, who I am very close with, but it's still swept under the rug. I think you're right that I should wait until I'm out of the house. Thank you!

Well, thank you! It means a lot to hear that. 

I do often turn to a group of online friends I have, most of whom are either in the binary or not trans, but they have been a big help, much like talking to the lovely people here has been! 

PFLAG? I've never heard of it, but I'll be sure to look! We live in the South, so I'm not sure, but thank you! 

And no, I'm not out to anyone, I think that's what makes it so hard. I struggle to connect with my friends because they don't know that key part of me, and they seem to question why I dress/act the way I do.

Thank you for taking the time to provide your advice! It really helps
I'm glad it's useful to you. I've definitely heard that bit about accepting yourself and all that in the past. I don't know how wise I am, but I'll take it. I feel like I'm a baby transgender person in general, I'm barely out and not yet medically transitioning at all. I am middle aged and been working through family bullshit and self esteem issues for 20+ years though.
Oh dear! Well, I still believe your words have helped me a lot, so I hope you can take that :). I feel the same way, though it's nice to know that we're not alone. I wish you luck in your transition! 
Thanks, you too :)"	9gbzc5	NonBinary	12	0.94	2018-09-16 16:40:41
Purposfully Dead-named at College	"Hi folks! This is my (23NB (They/Them)) first time posting, and I'm on mobile.... so, sorry for any formatting issues. TL/DR at the end.

To start, I am pretty fem to androgynous most days, and I'm not mad if strangers unknowingly use the wrong pronouns for me. Long story short, I transferred credits from my B.S. in Psych to my local community college and recently signed up for classes to finish my last semester for an A.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Being a new student, I needed to get an ID. I asked the front desk attendant how to do that and if I could use my ""preferred name"" instead of my legal name. He said no they can't because of legal purposes. Which I thought was reasonable and went along with it. Then he asked what my major was, chuckled and said something along the lines of ""isn't that's a bit ambitious?""


 Later on, I was talking to the registrar and they said I could have my ""preferred name"" for my email and to interact with my professors and such. It dawned on me today that when I take an exam my ID legal name wouldn't match my name on the roster. Which could be a problem since a 4/5 classes are online and my profs never see my face.
I called my college's general questions line and they transferred me to the student affairs line. Turns out the ID guy lied about it being mandatory that my ID name match my legal name. So, guess who had to redo my ID after I called? He made sure to call me my legal name multiple times during this interaction. 

I am just so mad.

TL/DR: College staff member who makes IDs is mysogynistic and enbyphobic. This staff member lied about policies and dead named me while having to correct my ID."	"Wow! I'm not surprised you're mad. I'd be utterly furious.

Glad the college confirmed they lied to you and they had to redo your ID.

File a formal complaint about them?
That’s incredibly infuriating… I mean seriously, using a preferred name isn’t for the sake of ID dude or anyone really, it’s because that’s the name you’re most comfortable with, one that best identifies you… gotta love it when other peeps make an inconvenience out of someone else’s life smh.

I’m glad that you were able to get that resolved, though!
Absolutely this. Gender and Sex discrimination is a big deal for entities who accept federal money!
Thank you. I emailed my advisor and he told me to speak with a campus counselor. This might just be a way to push it down the line, but welp at least they'll hear the complaint.
At least they seem to be taking it seriously enough to not just tell you to drop it. 

Good luck!"	sidy60	NonBinary	12	0.93	2022-02-02 03:15:53
I went from questioning to pretty sure I’m non-binary. Now what?	"Hi! So I’m 19 AFAB, and recently, after talking to some trans friends, I started seriously questioning my gender identity. I grew up my whole life with parents that are supportive of most of the LGBT community, but get really mad when I bring up anyone on the “in between” spectrum (I.e. bisexuality, being non-binary. Anything not either gay or straight male or female). 

My whole life I’ve always hated being referenced to as a girl. I’ve hated being called “ma’am” “miss” and I’ve never been fully comfortable with she/her pronouns. I also have a double name, and one name is traditionally masculine, and one is traditionally feminine, but growing up I felt horribly uncomfortable with being called my female half of my name, and never really liked just the male half either. I hate that my breast have recently gotten bigger, I hated dresses as a kid, and I still to this day prefer to dress masculine, but some dresses are great too.  Because of all this I’m labeled as a “huge tomboy that has their feminine moments”

It recently come to a head when talking to a friend who is trans FTM and he is wanting to start his transition, and I asked him how he knew, and we got into a deep discussion about gender identity and dysphoria, and he said I should really look into the non-binary community. I did and I nearly cried because that... these people... they were JUST LIKE ME! I’d never had that before, and I didn’t know I could feel so comfortably seen. Then one night while questioning and practically knowing I’m not a girl, I played Sims 4, and created me as a non-binary character. Then I couldn’t stop looking at them because I had never in my life felt like I looked like a sims character until that moment. That moment when the me on the screen had a flat chest, short hair, and masculine clothes but still wore makeup, had an amazing party dress, and lovely high voice, I actually saw myself and teared up. 

I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m trying to convince you guys, but this is all so new to me, I feel like I’m still trying to convince myself I’m not somehow faking it. 

So now I truly believe I’m non-binary, I want to go by they/them pronouns, and I want to buy a binder... but that’s such a huge change. I’m terrified. I know it’s not safe to come out to my family, and I’m worried my friends will think it’s weird and treat me differently. I’m always at college, so I’m not too worried about coming out to my parents, but to actually put this change into affect into my life is a daunting task. I don’t want to change my name (because it’s already half feminine half masculine, it still feels like the right name for me) so that won’t be a problem, but I’m worried about my new pronouns, and the fact that I’m cutting my hair into a pixie cut in 2 days. 

How were you guys strong enough to do it? How’d you manage to get people to respect it? How did people react?

TL;DR I believe I’m non-binary, and want to come out to my friends (family aren’t safe) how’d you do it? How were you strong enough? How’d it go?"	"Same here! First of all, I'm so happy for you!  There's nothing that makes you feel more free than finding yourself! At the beginning, I want you to understand that you don't have to explain anything to anyone.  It's your right to live the way you want to live.  And no one has the right to interfere.  

Step one by one, start with the people you trust the most.  Then slowly spread around you.  But first of all, it's important that you feel ready.

At first, I told my boyfriend, who knew everything about me and loved me.  He was very happy and understanding.  Then I told my sister and she supported me.  But I'm not going to explain to anyone else.  I'm just living without pretending, and whoever wants to think.  I don't give a shit either.  I do not have many problems because the words are not separated according to gender in my country.

DONT FCKN FORGET, You are valid, you are loved and you are fucking important 🌈🥰😍 Aaaand never alone 😁
Congratulations!! And welcome!

One thing that helped me was knowing that it's so common for us to feel like we're faking our genderfeels. Knowing I'm not alone feeling like that is a big comfort.

Second, you don't have to make any changes to your presentation if you don't want to, and many people find AFAB folks dressing androgynously to be kinda unremarkable. Like, because the general public is still pretty unfamiliar with nonbinary identities, most folks will read you as ""just another tomboy"" instead of ""oh, they're an enby"". (Annoying at times, but useful for those that need to pass.) If you don't even comment, then most folks will just assume you changed your style for non gender reasons. You can take your time coming out, and start with the people you feel safe around. There really is no rush.

As far as binding goes, you can ease into it, getting just one to start, wearing it for short bursts here and there, and then see how you feel about it. 

You get to decide your own transition goals, and it'll take time to learn how you feel. After awhile you get used to things taking time to figure out.

I found so much support from a local community organization in my city; I started with a transmasculine support group, and they had a flyer for this community health org's open house, and when I went it was just a room chock full of trans folks looking for info, and since then it's been an amazingly smooth ride for me. (So far, knock on wood). I really hope there are resources near you as well, because it helps a TON."	efd0r6	NonBinary	12	1.0	2019-12-25 06:18:31
Non-binary, or a case of internalized misogyny?	"I was/am AFAB, but was always a tomboy. Growing up in the 90's I had never heard of different gender identities or even a lot about sexualities. I knew about trans people, gay men and lesbians, but not that it was possible to be bi/pan/ace or anything else.

 I never felt like I was only a little bit like my female friends, but not quite like my male ones either. It wasn't until I started meeting trans, genderqueer and otherwise androgynous people that I felt like I matched them. I don't experience gender based attraction even, it just doesn't factor in for me. 

I also grew up with a lot of misogyny. It took me a long time to come to terms with it and my learned attitude toward women and even any femme person at all. I was taught that femininity was the enemy. You could even say I was raised as a boy, as much as my parents could. Until puberty of course, when I was absolutely expected to suddenly drop all the tomboy stuff and perform femininity.

How can I tell if my complete lack of identity to one gender or another, or if I'm just radiating mad ""Not like the other girls"" energy?

Thanks in advance."	"From what you wrote, it seems like you might find nonbinary as the best identity for you, but that doesn't mean you can't embrace femininity as a nonbinary/trans person! In working through my own internalized misogyny (as an AFAB enby), I find it way more comfortable to view my femininity separately from my gender. I don't know if other people do this too, but it helps me :)
Viewing femininity separate from gender definitely describes what I tend to do in practice to be honest. Thank you for putting that into words. I always felt like dressing femme felt more like cross dressing, and recently I embraced it rather than feeling like an imposter, and honestly it helped so much."	s1m4k5	NonBinary	11	0.93	2022-01-11 20:04:31
Work place ettiquite and being validated and respected.	"So a mad. They/them, genderqueer/nonbinary mostly just try for androgenous. I present masculine out of safety but have a lot of more femine habits. I cary a neutral tote bag or purse some times. My fashion sense is more androgynous. My voice is higher. Even my posture and how I move which I've worked on is more femine then masculine most days. 

I started a new job at a Bar as a chef/kitchen manager and it is very different from my previous job which address me by neutral pronouns and most people my chosen name over my ""dead"" name. 

The new place they do call my by my dead name and don't know how to address that without it seeming like a joke. A lot of my friends so understand the name thing but with work it's tricky cause I haven't legally changed my name so it's still on my ID and all my cards. I don't know how to bring it up without it being odd as it was just casually accepted at my old job.

The second is pronouns. My co-workers refer to me by default in the masculine and it bugs me a lot. I trained with someone from South Africa who claimed to not understand me when I explained I don't like gendered pronouns when referring to me. He went so far as to excuse himself when it came to calling me man and sir because they are respectful when they say them. I feel like they use them for me only because I present masculine at work.

I don't know how to address  these without seeming like I am being a whiny malenial or entitled when it's a big deal to me and a very small accomodation.

What should I do?"	"I suggest to say that your current name is a nickname and you strongly prefer it rather than your other name. Maybe say how all your friends and family call you by your name and the other name is very foreign to you. And with pronouns it takes sadly a lot of emotional labor to tell your coworkers and your boss about your pronouns. Some of them don’t necessarily know what that means and might ask you to educate them. If you have the emotional capacity to do that by all means do it. Also constantly correcting them will be a thing, so it takes patience as well and some days you might be impatient. 
With regards to names, I would start by cheerfully correcting people, especially if it's a habitual mistake. ""Oh, and I go by [name]!"" Hopefully some people just don't know, or are forgetting. If there are publicly viewable things that have your legal name on them (like a schedule that's posted on the wall), you could ask your manager if it'd be possible to list your preferred name.

With pronouns, I think it really depends on how comfortable you are correcting people and how supportive your manager is. I'm getting the impression that your coworkers are aware that you're non-binary but are defaulting to masculine pronouns--have you told them that you prefer something else? If you're already out at work but haven't been explicit about what pronouns you use, you could try gently correcting people, or asking your manager for guidance. If you feel like people are misgendering you on purpose or out of laziness, you'll have to consider if you feel comfortable talking to your boss about it. It'd also be a good idea to look at whether your workplace has an anti-discrimination policy that includes gender identity/expression (or if this type of discrimination is illegal where you live).
I’m new to embracing my enbieness  and not IRL out, but would a more gender neutral nickname derived from your dead name or some characteristic of yourself be a possible first step? In new school classes and new people at work asked for any nicknames I prefer even though I am publicly cis male. 
Robert > Bobby
James > Jaime 
Christopher > Chris
Soooo...who gives a shit? Tell them the name you want to be called. As far as referring to you as he or she you just need to get over it. In general I call people guys as in a large group of people. Normal people don't get offended, it's just a part of life. Would you prefer if people referred to you as person? guy/gal is a description...

if you were involved in a crime they would refer to you as the ""man"" who committed the crime...because you fit the description of a man more than a woman...

why be so worried about such a basic concept. If you don't identify as a man or woman that's fine but don't be upset when people don't automatically understand your personal views since you've never told them...

so yeah...you sound like a whiny millennial...it's really not that big of a deal...grow up...

the world doesn't care how you feel...

I’m not sure if you are trans or not but pronouns are really important to a lot of trans people. Maybe you might go through life like that but other ppl don’t. I know that when I go through misgendering it sucks because it doesn’t matter whether you wear a binder or have short hair. People don’t validate you. Along with lack of knowledge and understanding. Constantly educating people is annoying.
So I'm sorry I caught you on a bad evening when you apparently didn't beat you PR or whatever interest you from a glance. You just seem like someone who's a little too dense to get the nuances of human identity I never said I cried or whined. I'm aware of how I could be coming off as a whiny malenial or something. It's a big deal to me how I am address especially as someone in a leadership position. Sorry you are having a bad day butter Cup. My day is fucking great because I at least have wonderful people in this community to be supportive especially when insecure trolls like you feel hungry for attention.


Have a goodnight darlin' 
im not trying to come off as a troll i guess i just dont see what the big deal is. especially if you've never told people how you prefer to be addressed.
This whole thread is asking for advice how to address it. Not complaining that their coworkers aren't mind readers
2 options...

option 1: speak up

option 2: stop worrying about it
Yeah ""speak up"" isn't very specific. "	7pdu9g	NonBinary	11	0.93	2018-01-10 06:43:03
I don't have to be hyperfeminine to be considered attractive just because I was AFAB.	"I think part of my dysphoria was denying myself from presenting as anything more than ""tomboy"" because I subconsciously believed my attraction value was based on how female I appeared.

I've been getting mad at my androgens for making me feel confused or look ""ugly"", and thinking unless I adhere to all modern femme beauty practices, I wasn't going to be considered attractive (or clean, or ""normal"", or acceptable or...) to anyone. But I love my androgens!

 I'm not naturally busty or dewy skinned, so I felt I had to try even harder and therefore, denying further that I'm NB and making my dysphoria worse. Not that I've ever been really girly, but I felt like I had to research and keep up with girl/woman stuff, like grooming/makeup and it all felt performative and unnatural to me. Basically googling ""what do people who look like me do?"", ""what are the girl rules now i just want to blend in please"". Just figuring all this out now at 30. 

This is also made more ridiculous to me now because I am attracted to all kinds of people, but for some reason, in my head, I'm not attractive unless I'm trying to look like all the other girls (and then I'd just be an imposter anyway.)

Edit: just wanted to add this is in addition to altering speech/voice/behavior to appear more feminine and ""attractive"", which has messed with my self perception and overall personality, not just about my physical appearance if that makes sense."	"Hello! 
You are not alone in these feelings! I have had them in the past as well...
It makes some sense to be attracted to all sorts of people, but not to consider ourselves attractive. I think people are their own worst judge and societal expectations don’t help, riddling our minds with what is “normal” so we can comply. 
Anyhow, don’t try to fit in just because you think looking like everyone else is more attractive... Just be true to you!! Whether that’s femme or masc, andro, or waivers, someone will love you exactly for you!!
Thank you so much! I'm new here and still making these realizations. It's crazy when it really starts to sink in!
It is great as it sinks in! When you’re able to be unapologetically yourself, that’s when the euphoria follows :) Good luck friend!!"	iu46hi	NonBinary	9	0.82	2020-09-16 20:39:34
Is it bad to (sort of) choose to be non-binary?	"So I know that you don't choose to be transgender and I really get that.

But I feel like I've got a choice, because I could live my life as a cis-woman. I wouldn't be un-happy if I did that, I wouldn't hate every step of the way and it wouldn't be a problem bodily or socially as I don't have dysphoria. But I would probably have a sort of gaping hole inside my identity, because I know that my identity isn't solely female (leaning more towards bigender).

Right now I'm kinda inclined to choose to be bigender and explore that further, but I'm scared that the trans community will be mad. Why would I choose to be trans instead of living my life easily as a cis person? I get that could be insulting, especially if you've suffered. So now I'm asking it to you, as members of the trans community: is it bad if I choose to be non-binary?"	"Choice and no choice are a false dichotomy. Do what makes you feel happy and authentic. Doesn't matter why.
These feelings of not being ‘trans enough’ or not being valid can hold you back from being the happiest and truest version of yourself. There’s no right way to be non-binary, so if it feels right, choose it and be proud!
>Right now I'm kinda inclined to choose to be bigender and explore that further, but I'm scared that the trans community will be mad. Why would I choose to be trans instead of living my life easily as a cis person?

It really sounds to me like the choice isn't whether or not to be nonbinary. You already have those feelings, the choice is just whether to act on them or not. It's incredibly common for people questioning to feel like they could exist without acting on those feelings, but the point of life isn't just to exist. If exploring gender would make you happier in life, I can't imagine why anyone in the trans community would take issue with that.
someone please correct me if I’m wrong but you can be nonbinary and not be trans, since people who are gender nonconforming also claim the nonbinary label. idk if thats your situation but its an option if its a more comfortable description of you.
Others have made some good points here, I just want to add, you *didn't* choose to feel how you feel about your identity, but you do get to decide how to act upon it. Imo the right to choose how to act (or whether to act at all) on your feelings is vital for every trans and queer person.

Drawing an analogy with sexuality for a moment, as a bisexual afab person, I could ask myself, ""why would I choose to be in a visibly not-straight relationship instead of just having relationships with cis straight men and living my life easily as a straight person?"" But I hope you wouldn't say that bisexual people choosing to be in gay relationships is insulting to the gay people who have no choice, and they should just stick to straight relationships instead. Or that if they're in a straight relationship that negates their bisexuality. Please don't be more unkind to yourself than you would be to others.
nah
I totally get you. I consider myself an enby but I don't consider myself trans. I intend to basically come out some time this year (new year's resolution!) but being out feels more like a luxury than a necessity. 

But life is short, why not do the things that make you happy?
It's not a choice to be nonbinary. That's just who you are/ how you feel. Whether or not you explore it or change anything about how you live your life is entirely up to you and not shitty gatekeepers
My dude. Explore your gender, find you happiness. Don’t worry about what others may think about you because that will cause all sorts of problems. 
To be honest, there is a matter of choosing when one is trans. One has to choose to live that truth, they have to choose to live with the backlash. Sure, sometimes it might be easier to fly under the radar and not take any risks, but thats not fair to yourself. Try new things and flip off the world that stands in your way.
I’m kinda in a similar situation (I’m genderfluid). No one chooses to be trans or nonbinary, they choose whether to come out about it/to what extent to let others know. What matters is what keeps you safe and happy. If that’s coming out to your close friends but not to your workplace/social circle in general, then that’s that. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.
>It really sounds to me like the choice isn't whether or not to be nonbinary. You already have those feelings, the choice is just whether to act on them or not.

Thank you for saying that like this. You just helped me with some internal doubt and second guessing.
To me trans involves dysphoria and a desire to transition. To be non-binary a person doesn't have to also be trans, but might be. A trans person might also see themselves as binary, but a different gender than where they started.

There are genders outside the colonial binary that a person may have felt they've always been. No transition necessary, no dysphoria necessary. Just not binary.

GNC could be non-binary but might not. It depends on how the person identifies. Either way is ok.

I'd highly recommend the gender reveal podcast. Molly Woodstock does an awesome job finding guests of varying background and the interviews are super, well, revealing. https://www.genderpodcast.com/
I do have a tendency for some internalized trans- and biphobia. Basically boils down to everyone is valid except for me. I’m trying not too be so harsh on myself tho. Thank you for replying :)

I can't stop thinking about committing	"Usually they are just disembodied thoughts but lately they have worsened and I'm starting to think about some methods when they are in my proximity.

The fact is that I can't deal with my life anymore. A life balanced between lying to everyone I know and trying to not go mad by staying true to myself.

A life where I keep thinking I am destined to lie or to remain invisible if I come out because for many people I, a nonbinary person, am not even possible. I am ashamed of myself constantly. I am ashamed of my birth name, I am ashamed that if I change that name I'll have to tell everyone and seem ridiculous and egocentric.

I still live with my parents in a rural town so lying about my identity is a constant. I wish I could live alone, but I don't know when that would be possible as I'm currently unemployed. 

All these struggles, that I am also ashamed of because I am so privileged and I could just shut up, are bringing me crazy. I don't know what to do or say anymore. I just wish more than ever to just stop existing because I think my problems outweigh the acts of good I could bring to the world.

I am constantly scared. I know I should break the closet and come out in hope of maybe someone that could think that I'm not completely crazy, to save myself, but I am so scared and so every day is painful."

Please consider talking to a mental health professional
You can absolutely do good in the world, there's a lot more life left and nothing stays the same forever. The urge to do this is temporary but the results are permanent. 

When I have been in this place I tried to think of how those I love would be affected and sometimes that kept me strong. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and please don't hurt yourself. Speak to a professional - a doctor, a mental health professional, a teacher, counsellor - or a relative you know cares for you.  They will soon show you that they care enough for you to stay alive and maybe this will be the first small step to feeling better in yourself.
Remember you’re a person too and worthy of all the love and goodness you want from the world. It’s so hard to love yourself but I’m telling u that u deserve ALL OF IT. The world is full of beautiful crazy things and people and ideas and life. Don’t give up ❤️ keep fighting. Youre so valid in ur identity and the way you experience the world and ur existence is such a gift. Try to keep in mind ur value. Your voice may be silenced by those around you but never lose it in yourself. Ur life and experiences are so real this pain is so hard and scary and I believe in you and all ur hopes and dreams coming true. Queer life is to be celebrated if people around u aren’t on board with that just remember that they’re choosing to live like that with all that negativity while you’ve chosen a path of self acceptance. You have nothing to be ashamed of Im proud of u for fighting 🤍
I attempted as a teenager. If you can gain independence, and transition things can get so much better. Try to hold on, and seek help.
Maybe contact [the Trevor project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/), and get in touch with a mental health professional.
Things will get better, just hold on
As you might tell a lot, if not most of the people on this subreddit, have gone through periods of crises like this. For myself looking back I now realize that my brain was literally lying to me and manipulating my thoughts. I couldn’t see past the current struggle or fathom how things could change. And anyone that tried to help me I could easily dismiss them. 

It does get better. Just as you started this period of feeling like crap so too can it change again. “How” and “when” nobody knows. 

If you’re like me I bet if you were employed and had more of a sense that you were self sustaining and had some purpose in life (even as a capitalist slave) it might help you get out of the spiral. I had to go back to school and totally reinvent myself as I couldn’t get any employment with my previous degree and was really stuck on figuring out what to do with my life. I just felt totally adrift and so worthless and awful. Like another commenter has said you can do good in this world. Just try to figure out what you might be able to do or break into. Even volunteering helps feel like you have a purpose even if it’s just temporary until your feeling better and know your next move. 

When you’re in hell don’t stop driving!  Keep going!  Keep driving until you get out of there and can think clearly without depression, self hate, and anxiety lying and tricking you.

Tips on fem presenting while in the closet	Hello friends! I am a demiboy, but my parents still think that I am a cisgender boy. My parents think the whole concept of non binary genders is just some confused people who are trying to be unique. I probably won't be coming out to them for another few years because there also homophobic. I really want to start doing things like wearing makeup or painting my nails, but my parents would get really mad, and I don't even have access to that stuff cause I'm only 12. Do you guys (dint mean too assume anything, just couldn't think of another word) have any tips for me? Any help is greatly appreciated.	"To start presenting more feminine in public I recommend maybe wearing more feminine clothing and then putting a sweatshirt u can take off later, over it, or putting on makeup when u get to a place. To get the items, if you have any friends that’s have more accepting parents or maybe a friend that’s a few years older you could ask those friends to help you buy everything.

it hurts *more* when trans supporting people misgender me	"coz at least if a transphobe misgenders me i know they do that for everyone and it's coz they ""don't believe"" that people can be non binary or use pronouns other than he or she. plus i don't have enough respect for them to really care what they think. but when people who *acknowledge the existence of non binary people* still assume the pronouns associated with my agab for me, it really kills my mood. how, with the knowledge that people do exist who are non binary or use pronouns besides he and she, are you so confident about assuming my pronouns and my gender? how do you still see me as my agab when i try my hardest not to be perceived that way? i hate when people look at me and immediately think ""gender"" if you know what i'm saying. i mean when they immediately associate my appearance with a specific gender (especially my agab!) without a moment's hesitation i'm just like... :/ it actually makes me mad"	"i agree with you, it sucks, a have a lot of ally friends but it hurts a lot when they make mistakes and the school and my parents say to ""dont expect everyone to get it right all the time"" and thats understandable but it still hurts
i’m sorry :( if i see someone is gender non conforming i say they, and if they’re gender conforming i usually assume pronouns. but it sucks when you’re trying to be perceived as NOT your agab and people ignore that :(
it makes me worry that my appearance is more, agab-conforming than i think it is :( i pretty much always get misgendered as my agab and not the other way around
ah i’m sorry ❤️
thanks for being supportive! ❤️"	ssgttd	NonBinary	10	0.92	2022-02-14 17:57:56
Do I have dysphoria?	"Hi, I ID as enby and I aint really dysphoric. I know ppl say you dont need dysphoria to be trans but im still worried im not dysphoric enough to be non binary. 

I certainly dont *like* being my agab, but its no strong dislike either. It doesnt causes distress/depression/emotional pain etc. In social situations, it causes irritation/discomfort and cringiness at most. But sometimes, I feel nothing. It doesnt feel ""right"" but not totally ""wrong"" either. I just feel nothing towards it, no connection to those words. Compare it to the feeling of your name being mispronounced, something just feels off. Its like, people to call me something that I don't necessarily feel like part of myself. She/her, woman, girl, lady, miss? Huh? Why? I just try to move on thinking ""theyre just words, they dont know better"". Mostly it's just ""this is wrong, but I can still function.""

I mean, I cant transition. So I cant be mad at ppl for calling me by feminine terms/see me as female. Its out of my control for now, so why let it bother me? Only one peron IRL at least knows im questioning gender and tbh, it kinda sucks when she refers to us as ""women"". Theyre pangender so she still ID as a woman but it felt  uncomfortable when she called me a woman KNOWING im prolly not a woman. It got me a ""oh :/"" reponse. 

When I have to refer to myself as my agab, I get this gut feeling thats telling me its wrong. I totally cringe inside. Its like my brain goes ""no no no no"". It causes discomfort.

I feel quite dissociated from my body. I get gender envy from androgyne/masc bodies. I wish I didnt had a chest/waist/hips. When I daydream, I often imagine myself to have an androgyne body. But when I look in the mirror and see my female features, it simply doesnt feel like my body. This is just not how I imagined it. Its almost dissapointing. I often try to hide these features. 

I get gender euphoria when I imagine myself as an enby and get euphoria when ppl perceive me as such. It feels like the true me. But the lack of dysphoria makes me feel like im maybe just faking it. When looking into the future, I just cant imagine myself as a woman. Ive tried to leave the thought behind of me being non-cis but everytime I just keep going back to thinking ""something feels off"". 

Ive seen different opinions on what dysphoria is. Some ppl say its dysphoria when it causes severa distress. Others say any non-postive feeling towards ur agab is dysphoria. So yea, what is the real definition of dysphoria and do I have it?"	"From all you're saying here, it sure doesn't sound like you have no dysphoria to me.

You seem to definitely have some. The way you don't like when people use feminine words to refer to you, the way you don't like what you see, this is dysphoria. It doesn't have to be extremely uncomfortable or stressful to qualify as dysphoria. Dysphoria is a scale. Some feel it strongly to the point they get sick seeing their body, some barely feel it at all aside from the occasional cringe.
I personally feel dysphoria but do not class myself as trans, I class myself as enby only. But it sounds to me as if you do get dysphoria! Dysphoria is discomfort and there are many types - *gender* dysphoria is discomfort in regards to presenting or being classed as certain genders, sometimes including your AGAB (cis people don't feel it towards their AGAB but might feel it towards all other genders). So it sounds to me as if you very much have gender dysphoria.
When you talk about your friend calling you a woman and you not liking that, it sounds like maybe you would prefer that your friend use another term to talk about your gender. (Btw, since a lot of people in queer/trans communities don’t like to label others, your friend may have been trying to use the only language she believed you use, and just didn’t have any other language available since you didn’t say to use any other term). The term “dysphoria” is from the medical view of trans people. You don’t need to worry about whether you have it or not, unless it means something to you. Try asking your friend to use different pronouns for you and see how it feels. I bet you’ll feel better about some terms than others, and those will be your clues (in addition to the clues you already have)
I can relate, as I'm pretty same from the other side. I'm, in way, okay with being my agab, though I do dream of just being something else. I could probably just present masc for the rest of my life and that would be end of that. I don't feel dysphoric, but I know what would be better.

For me, gender euphoria is being femme, but seeing myself in the mirror I always just see the same agab face and features. I feel like I'm just faking it, and I just should stay in my lane.
Hej there, 

You are touching on a lot of points from various domains there, and every time I try to zoom in on one, another is taking priority in my mind, and I don't know which one, exactly, is the most important point for you. So for starters, I'll arbitrarilly pick one:

> worried im not dysphoric enough to be non binary.

Consider this: The 'enough'-part stems from the medical understanding of human perils. To cite the DSM:

> the condition must also be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

This disclaimer seems to be ammended to *everything* related to mental health (I say 'seems' because I have not read the whole damn book. I am a general theorizer, not a general practitioner).

I find this idea linked to one French philosopher (pretty sure it wasn't Blaise Pascall, so it probably was him), who allegedly stated that until and unless the sum of his malfunctions disabled him from going about his daily life, he deemed himself rather healthy. Which attitude is stereotypically associated with masculinity, but this goes deeper:

One, it is a selective measure to determine where -- on whom -- to spend limited resources for medical care.

Two: 'clinically significant' is a qualifier that depends on the judgement of the diagnoser. Which depends on their biases, liabilities, and their capability for genuine insight. In that light, it is entirely possible to go undiagnosed (and subsequently untreated for your whole life) by merit of flinching away from telling sob-stories, or by being reluctant to bother anyone, all while internally dying, bit by bit, every single day. Which leads us to

Three: If you somehow manage to cope 'well enough' (in the diagnoser's judgement) on your own, you will fly under the radar/ fall through the cracks, and will not be treated/cared for the way your situation actually would demand. That is called being 'high functioning' (while facing depression, or trauma, or substance-use, or interpersonal abuse, or any neuro-divergence...the list goes on). But that does *not* mean that your issues not be real -- the fact that you *have to cope with something* implies that there are issues you have to deal with. And coping uses up resources -- mental and material ones, as well as time and effort -- that you could spend elsewhere. Meaning to say: The exact degree  (if it ever could be exactly measured anyway), is not what qualifies you to, or disqualifies you from, being non-binary. What qualifies you (to the best of my own understanding) is your honest self-asessment that you are not quite, or not solely at home with the idea to be exclusively male or female. What *should* qualify you in the eyes of the world, is your honest say-so.

Dunno if that helped, but I agree with the other commentors who pointed out that your decription does ring the tunes of dysphoria, and wanted to provide you with some fodder for thought on the 'enough'-part. Because, you know ""you do not have to have dysphoria to be trans"" -- or non-binary.
Im glad someone relates and thank you for sharing your experience! I dont think living as my agab would be a living hell but I a hard time looking into the future imagining myself as a woman. It certainly doesnt give me happiness. But remember, u prolly aint faking it as faking is intentional. Gender euphoria is valid :]
Thank you alot for your detailed reponse :]"	10bl7nz	NonBinary	10	1.0	2023-01-14 10:18:20
Still questioning but I got a hit of that Enby euphoria today.	"Went to a patient care because I was feeling sick and got COVID tested. Before that, I checked in as female (AMAB trans fem is what I am currently). The office had a Non-binary option. I didn’t go for it despite having a slight inkling of wanting to. 

The nurse checking my vitals asked if I have had a menstrual cycle recently. I told them that I don’t have them. She immediately looked befuddled and apologized for asking. 

“It’s ok. I’m not upset.” 
“Well they have an option on there.”
“I didn’t see an option for last menstrual cycle. Is there supposed to be one?”
“Oh, do you identify as female? I thought you were non-binary.” 
“Oh! I mean, yes. I, uh, do ID as female.”
“Ok, I’m sorry then. I don’t mean to offend. I do my best to be helpful to any gender and not cause dysphoria.”
“Oh no! You’re ok! I promise I’m not upset. It’s kind of a compliment to me.”

*awkward silence for a few seconds*

“Can I ask you an honest question? Did you think I was non-binary.”
“Uh”
“It’s ok. Im not mad if you did. I um, like that you did.”
“Well, then yes. I thought you were non-binary.”
“Really?! :)”
“Yea. :)”

This is like my 4th time this year questioning my gender of if I’m non-binary. Then I got that hit of exciting euphoria that I was mistaken for a non-binary person."		rl1njh	NonBinary	9	0.86	2021-12-21 00:37:55
[Vent] I wish my identity was simpler...	"I am trying to come to terms with being nonbinary but it’s so hard. I was AFAB but I don’t think I’d be comfortable transitioning to look more masculine, unlike mosr nonbinary people of my AGAB. I don’t know what I want to do with my appearance, there is just a slight discomfort of being perceived as a binary woman, but I don’t even have body dysphoria. The thing is that I’ll probably ALWAYS be perceived as 100% a woman by others because of how I look like. And honestly, “close enough” I guess but it’s still a bother to me. If I was more masculine like most nonbinary people. Yes, I am aware not every nb person is androgynous or masculine or afab but the very big majority of them are and like, i’m happy for them but it makes me feel even more isolated, especially since I don’t know what the heck I want for myself yet and it’s difficult to think about because just the thought of being queer fills my eyes with tears because i dont know what my future will be like.

If I had body dysphoria and wanted to look more masculine I could hope to medically transition and hope to be seen as a man more often and get the benefits that has. I know very few people transition because they dont like the disadvantages of being seen as a woman and that the ones that do it just for that regret it, but since i am not 100% cisgender at least i could be a trans man or something closer to that right??? But nOpe everything gonna be extra hard for me I guess. Not implying that transitioning its easy because I know its not but at least being ftm has extra benefits i’ll never ever have and im so mad at myself for not being like that. Sorry for long post"	"I totally get where you are coming from with this. I find it really difficult to relate my appearance to how I feel about my gender. I am still trying to figure things out and believe I fall somewhere between Demigirl and Agender? For now I am just sticking to the umbrella term of NB. I have had days where I have wanted to cut of my hair to better ""fit"" in the label, but I am not sure if I want that either. I feel like we are in a similar headspace, if you would like to chat more just drop me a message, it would be nice to try and figure some things out with someone...
♥️ I'm of the more andro variety in my goals but my young child is a very femme them and I see this in their life and fret about it. I hope hope hope that as time goes on we as a society/species will move away from the belief that one can tell gender based on appearance, or especially body type. It's monumentally unfair to expect people to undergo medical transitions and/or surgeries, or even wear clothes they're not totally into, to be correctly gendered more frequently. Non-binary people don't owe performative androgyny to anyone.
Yes of course!
Yeah exactly :( i hope we get there someday"	khb6nz	NonBinary	10	1.0	2020-12-21 05:45:04
Stubborn guy who keeps using incorrect pronouns- rant	"So I’m on discord, basically my friend is friends with this other guy (who I’ll just refer to as Bob I guess). When I met Bob I didn’t particularly like him, but you won’t like everyone. Bob then talked to my friend and called me a ""he"" (at the time I had my pronouns in my username). I corrected him, then left the conversation. My friend informed me later that Bob had used the wrong pronouns for me again. I got pretty pissed, reasonably. Then Bob joined a server that both my friend and I are in. He continued the wrong-pronouns thing. About a month later my friend DMed me showing Bob calling me a ""he"" twice. After all the corrections. So I DMed Bob, and corrected him. ...He didn’t stop. Just today, a couple months later, my friend DMed me with oh so surprising news. Bob has done it again. So I composed a very clear video including my gender and pronouns. He’s been offline for the day so I am currently waiting on a response. All I can say is, if that guy misgenders me one more time I’m just going to...I can’t even put it into words, that guy makes me so mad."	"Cut him off. If you are in a group chat, remove yourself from the situation and leave the group.

Misgendering once could be an innocent mistake, although still sucky for you, but more than that and it’s on purpose. And what do we call purposefully misgendering people? Transphobia!

It’ll be easier for you if you don’t interact with Bob, and you could ask your friend to refrain from mentioning him too.
Is there a need to be around this Bob fellow? I wouldn't keep doing this back and forth. Just tell the discord admin that Bob misgenders you and that if he enters the chat you'll leave. Let your friend know that you don't care about Bob and would prefer to not know how he refers to you or if he does.
This Bob woman... She sounds horrible. I wonder if there is any way we could get back at her using the same tactics? I think she needs to learn what it is like to be misgendered on purpose.
Agreed. Bob's clearly going to Bob, and knowing about it only makes your life worse.
My friend is actually the owner of said server. They like Bob a lot so I can’t really avoid him either. And I have told them, they keep telling me about what Bob does. Thanks for the advice though!
Maybe if you told her you weren't upset about it, it would take the power away. I like to keep control of myself within myself. You can say to her, ""That's fine, girl! I know who I am and so what you say doesn't matter a bit. I know you feel the same way."" And then misgender her forever.
I was gonna say, misgender Bob. Transphobe cis men get so upset when I say ""what's poppin sis"" or something like that but I really mean 'cis' but they don't know that hahahahahahah
Thanks for the advice!
Is your friend correcting Bob? Did you have a serious talk with your friend about how this affect you? Your friend should really Support you.
That sounds really fucking awesome. I’m gonna do that.
Yeah, they are correcting Bob. I’ve told my friend that I really care. They’ve stopped for now but I think that’s just because there’s no new Bob news."	ku4xpv	NonBinary	10	0.83	2021-01-10 02:02:43
My partner came out and I'd like help	"I'm a cisgender woman. My partner and I have been dating for a year and a half, and live together. I thought of myself as bisexual.

A year ago, my partner first told me they weren't sure of their gender. Now a year later, after briefly mentioning it maybe once every two months, they came out to me and our closest friends as non binary. For now they're still figuring their self out, they don't know what pronouns they feel more comfortable with so we're using all of them, they don't plan on physically transitioning or change name yet...
I'm still madly in love with them. Although I have to work on myself and we have a lot to figure out (how to adapt nicknames, what to say to our families etc), I'd like to know your stories about coming out to a cisgender partner, things I should know about? I have non binary friends but have never dated someone who is non binary. I'm very conscious everything will have to be talked about with my partner, but I'd like to hear about you and what are your advice, things to avoid at all cost etc... And also advice for them. They are not androgynous at all so they don't feel legitimate and feel worried that they won't be perceived as who they are. If you have some nice words for them that would be great.

Thanks for your answers"	"For you: My most generic advice doesn't seem like it applies--that would just be, make sure you take this seriously, it is real, it matters, and it absolutely will impact you and your relationship. You obviously get that already, so let's see...this might not be super relevant right now, but it's important to be really honest with yourself and comfortable with vulnerability, especially as things go through periods of shift or change. It's totally ok to be uncomfortable with change (hello universal human experience) but it's also easy to ignore especially if your priority is to be helpful and supportive (which is great! just, downsides) until it gets really big and a lot harder to see clearly, communicate about productively and respectfully, and work with.  Relationships can grow SO much from careful communication about vulnerable topics if both partners can meet in the vulnerable place, so I'd just really encourage both of you to stay in touch with your feelings and check in deeply together often. The other thing I'd add is, whenever somone I know comes out I spend some time paying a LOT of attention to and correcting how I think about them and the language I use for them in my head *when they aren't there.* For some reason, mentally correcting myself when I use the wrong pronouns or gendered language for someone when I'm thinking about them abstractly (""Don't forget to add her to the invite list. Oops, him, don't forget to add *him* to the list,"" that sort of thing) really helps my brain get on board with the change a lot faster (it's probably just more opportunities to practice, idk) and it gets at the absolutely most important thing to me--when someone changes their gender, I am committed to seeing them as that gender and thinking about them as that gender, and that involves a lot more than saying the right pronoun in public, if that makes sense?

For your partner: Welcome sibling, I am so glad you're here. To me, exploring and embracing identity and sharing that with others is first and foremost about *freedom.* I just want to celebrate yours for a second. You are *free* to identify however you want, regardless of your presentation. You are *free* to present however you want, regardless of your identity. I think this is true for absolutely everyone but the nb community is usually where this is seen and celebrated the most and I truly believe this is one of our gifts to the world. Your existence exactly as you are is a gift to the world. You are *free* to change your mind about both as may times as you want or not, and you are *free* to take as much time exploring as you want."	12m9cff	NonBinary	9	0.92	2023-04-14 19:09:14
how do i get my bf to use my pronouns??	"i honestly don't know how to bring this up to him, because i know he's trying his best to understand and i think he might be just confused, so please id love some help on how to tell him this nicely. 

so last week we were talking about pronouns and i told him that i really don't care what pronouns people use for me, i do prefer they/them but it honestly doesn't matter that much. we also talked about how my gender fluctuates between feeling femme and feeling closer to agender depending on the day.

and this is all well and good, he seemed to understand and get it. however ive noticed that he only uses she/her or refers to me with feminine terms and it's really starting to bug me(im not mad, it just makes me kinda uncomfy). i really would like him to use more of a variety when referring to me, but i don't want him to feeling like im upset with him. we've had similar issues in the past with the pronoun situation but it's been kinda tough for him to grasp, but he is definitely making an effort so i don't wanna seem like i am not appreciative of that :(("	"You can sit down with him and tell him that you know you said you didn't mind about pronouns but that hearing him only refer to you in feminine ways made you realize you would prefer if he also used they/them and included more gender neutral words when talking about you. You're not being crazy or ungrateful and there's nothing about this that should upset him. You're just telling him how you feel and asking for something that shouldn't be much of a challenge

Good luck!
You told him you don't mind what pronouns he uses, but you actually do mind. Time to have another talk with him and tell him how you really feel.
Partners and friends really help with gender validation when the general population doesn’t get it. As the above comments said, saying “I prefer this but it doesn’t really matter” dismisses yourself and your feelings, and I used to tell folks literally the same thing for my personal pronouns. Finally I took away the she option and it helped immensely. The folks who are close to you are your advocates and ally’s. As far as your bf’s ideology of “words are words”, he needs to understand that is not the case for you and words hold power. He of course can still have his opinion, but he needs to  try to see your side and have your back when you need his support. Sending good vibes!
I geus you have to talk to him again and say that things have changed and now you would like him to actively use different ptonouns and not just feminine terms. If he strugges with that you could suggest that he changes your name in his contacts to ""man1c\_pixiee (they/them)""
So personally it seems like either he either doesn’t care about what you want, 
or that he genuinely doesn’t understand the importance of using your pronouns(and really pay attention and see if he cares that you care). Let him know that this is something that is very important to you. Make sure to communicate exactly what you’re saying in this post right now to him aswell, let him know it makes you uncomfortable(even if it’s just kinda). You’re just correcting him, there’s nothing wrong with that and nothing about it makes you seem unappreciative. Best of luck :)
thanks for this🥺 tbh it's particularly difficult with him when i mention it's important to me because it's not important to him what people call him. his ideology is that words are just words and it doesn't matter what people call him, he legit said ""i don't identify as cis or nonbinary, im just me"". so when i face him with the fact that it's important to me, he doesn't seem to get it..
yea i guess that's true.. it's not so much that i mind ""she"", but by using only she and feminine terms towards me just feels like he doesn't fully respect how i identify i guess..
Well I think if he doesn't understand that you two are different people who feel differently about their identities then the problem isn't yours. He should at least listen to you and respect how you want to be called even if he doesn't understand.

There are a lot of things in this world that we won't understand, we're just humans with limited brains and it's okay, he doesn't have to understand how you feel just respect what you ask of him
I don't think he knows that you feel this way because of how you worded it.

There's a big difference between ""I don't care"" and ""I use all pronouns.""
that's true, we talked it over and he said he'll start using other pronouns and gender neutral terms! 🥰 but i do see that i need to work on my phrasing in the future :/
Well done for having that conversation! ☺️"	rbo3id	NonBinary	8	0.84	2021-12-08 10:07:17
I'm seething	I'm so fucking mad right now.  I'm applying for a university in Ontario (I live in Québec and when I applied for a Québec uni, they asked for my gender and only gave 2 options, which I didn't understand until now) and had the choice between Male, Female and Other, which made me really happy for some reason.  That victory was short lived because when they asked for my permanent code, it said the information I was giving was INCORRECT BECAUSE I HAD CHOSEN THE WRONG GENDER WHAT THE FUCK???  So I had to change the gender back to my AGAB, which is so fucking stupid for so many reasons???  I deadass am so confused ...	"I live in Quebec too and I think you need to put your ""legal"" gender. Since they check with the gov database and there you're probably still AGAB. You can get it change tho
I guess that makes sense, but it's still dumb imo ... I've heard we can get our ""legal"" gender changed, and I will eventually; there are just quite a few downsides apparently, especially when traveling (from what I've heard)
I don't really know since I don't feel the need to get it changed, but yeah, I guess it could be hard to go some place more conservative, since they tend to not be super open mind."	kk4nsx	NonBinary	8	0.85	2020-12-25 19:37:18
Parents support TERF cult disguised as Christianity (Mormonism); making SI bad	"TW: Discussions of suicidal ideation; fundamentalist Christianity; mean parents

Hello my loveliest of lovelies, 

Enby here, raised in the queerphobic Cult that is Mormonism. I'm a direct descendant of one of the founders, Parley Parker Pratt so my family consider themselves proud of their heritage. The first 17 years of my life I held onto my faith with every fiber of my body because it was the only coping mechanism offered to me for dealing with the crushing gender dysphoria, but as a young child I regularly asserted my actual gender and tried to get my family to recognize me for who I was. Obviously that didn't happen because in the Mormon church, socially or medically transitioning to any extent is apostasy, meaning they excommunicate you from the church. (Mormons now consider the word ""mormon"" a slur, so you should be aware they are officially called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but I'm going to call them Mormons because its a ""win for Satan"" apparently.) 

Anyway. Recently I came out to my Bapuji (that's what we call my grandfather, it's Punjabi for ""respected elder"") He was born and lived his young life in India and then came to the US in the 1950s to study mathematics. He married my grandmother, who is a Pratt (basically mormon royalty) and joined the Mormon church. Coming out to him was such a big deal because he was the first ethnically Indian mission president to preside over the Indian Subcontinent and because he did a fuck ton of genealogical work for the mormon church gathering records from India, translating them, and then giving the names of my ancestors to the mormon church for proxy covenants, which is what Mormons do in their secret temples. Mormons believe that everyone has to receive certain covenants in order to be saved, so members of the church go to the temple to perform covenants for someone who is dead. 

Now, here's the thing. Prior to British colonization, Trans and Non-binary people enjoyed a lot more freedoms. They were recognized and didn't face widespread discrimination. Because of colonization, those same groups who were once revered are now endangered. So in my mind, my Bapuji who I have always loved and respected immensely, bought into the Mormon church's teachings about the divine binary nature of gender, and then performed proxy religious covenants for my ancestors, some of whom were definitely not ""men"" or ""women."" So basically he mis-gendered people in a really sacred and religious way that basically invalidates their whole existence which is crazy ancient and beautiful and is INCREDIBLY offense and harmful to me as well as MAD FUCKING RACIST AGAINST HIS OWN ANCESTRAL PEOPLE

and the vast majority of my extended family, as well as my Mom, dad, older sister and older brother still pay more than 10% of their gross annual income to the mormon church. They all served missions, teaching people on different continents that gender variance is a sin. The Mormon church is incredibly wealthy and tax exempt even though they regularly interfere with local and national politics and have a whole lobbying organization which mobilizes really intensely against any form of queer rights. 

And all of this just makes me want to not be alive. My mom says she doesn't believe what the church teaches about gender variance and that ""more revelation is coming"" but I asked my mom to stop paying tithing years ago, and I thought she did. I said to her ""if you pay tithes to the LDS church and have a queer child you're not gonna have a queer child for very long."" My mom is justifying her paying tithes by saying ""well i'm going to pay for top surgery too"" like...i don't want you to pay for top surgery if you're still paying tithing. I don't want you in my life if you're still paying tithing. I don't want to be alive if you're still paying tithing. You're putting your brainwashing transphobic cult rituals over your own child's health. How can you say you love someone and simultaneously pay for their oppression?"	"You may find some advice in r/exmormon too. Dang... you have the added pressure of being “pioneer stock” too!

So I’ll give my two cents as an exmormon with lots of active family members, hope it helps. I think this is a very complicated topic, and you have every right to be upset about it. Allow yourself to feel what you feel and know that it’s okay to feel that way.

But—and this is a big, painful, unattractive but—you probably will not be able to get past your anger/sadness until you accept that you simply cannot force someone else to quit their religion and stop paying tithing to it, even though it hurts you tremendously.

I have no idea why my family members still believe what they believe when they know full well it makes no sense when you consider my situation as a queer person. But they do. And I can’t change that.

Where you CAN find solace is in focusing on what you yourself can do about the situation, such as a) separating yourself from the church, b) having honest conversations with family about it, and/or b) distancing yourself from family members who you feel you can’t be on good terms with while they are still involved in Mormonism. And most importantly, practice SELF COMPASSION. It is very important that you learn to love yourself regardless of what your mormon family may think of you. It will make it easier to deal with the pain/betrayal you feel. When you have done this for a while, and processed your own trauma from being involved in the church, you may be better able to practice compassion for your family members as well, and be better able to accept what you can’t control.

If you want to talk more in depth about it please feel free to DM me. (P.S. sorry about all the caps; I still don’t know how to italicize on mobile)
I'm still reading, but I had to stop and laugh at ""Mormon"" as a slur.

Imagine being such a shitty social entity that their own *name* became ridiculed and weaponized against them.

It's as hilarious as middle aged white Karens trying to equate being called ""a Karen"" to being black and being called the n* slur.

Absolutely hilarious when shitty people whinge.
I'll post to r/exmormon too

ok a little background: 

Born in the covenant, raised in Provo. My faith crisis was 6 years ago, I'm 6 years resigned from the church next april. I have had honest conversations with my parents about it. I never asked my parents to quit their religion and I would never do that. I just want them to stop paying for their religion to oppress my people. If they still want to follow the law of tithing I sent them lots of queer mormon organizations they could give to instead. (like the encircle home, which would be fitting considering they kicked me out when I left the church.) I am pretty distant from my family already, I live in NYC and they live in Utah. But I think i got more emotionally close to them because of the pandemic, and that's why this stings so much. I miss them so much. I love them so much. I have been to a LOT of therapy and have processed a lot of my experiences in the church, and I thought I'd come to some sort of plateu in the rollercoaster of our relationship, and then this shit. Imma DM you, just thought i'd reply in case anyone stumbles upon this."	itcqbf	NonBinary	9	0.91	2020-09-15 16:54:11
I've always wanted to have female clothes but was scared of being judged.	Growing up, I always played within the boundaries of society. I never attempted to break any rules and do anything that could be seen as different from the norm. Due to recent life events, though, I've found this unusual comfort in cross dressing in female clothing. It's not any kind of innate sexual desire to do so, but more I simply feel happy doing it. I have cone up with two different names for myself, which during psychological distress I retreat into. The one is called Riley, and the other is called May, but they are just the same person. Riley is my fierce side she likes to play sports and be way more tomboyish, while May is more of a colorful girl. I've always found myself identifying more with the name Riley, though, and it makes me happy. Even though I'm now going through a tough time in my life I have faith that I will still find happiness even in today's madness.	"The sad and amazing truth is that no strangers probably care about you enough to say or do anything. They will all forget you exist within 24 hours; unless you're really really somebody's type, that might stick with them for a few days/weeks. 

As for family and friends I would confirm who is a safe person or not before you be obvious about it but they'll probably be a lot more ambivalent then you expect, unless they are psycho conservitives. 

My advise would be to walk into specifically a womans clothing store and buy a neutral outfit, like short shorts & crop top, anything you'd be comfy wearing in public, but grab some dresses or whatever to try on while your at it. If your going to be uncomfortable you might as well do it infront of somebody who is being payed to be nice to you ❤

Most normal people don't really care which gender the clothes are designed for, slightly more care if you have a gender nonconforming presentation but again; people usually require significant motivation to give a shit about anything."	11iihd2	NonBinary	9	0.91	2023-03-05 00:38:31
Second week on T	"I'm on week 2 of low dose T. Changes so far: 

I don't get as upset as I did before. More of a I get mad or frustrated before I'd cry.

My sleep has been screwed. I can't fall asleep at night and when I do it's hard to wake up.

Skin is more oily especially on my T section.

I'm super sweaty and hot. I'm overall more hungry too.

The start	"I'm not sure why, but I want to talk about how I learned who I am.

It's a long story, as I'm very old, and I'm not sure if it, or I, belong here. As there isn't a sub called ""a little bit trans* which is how I thought of myself for a long time, you're stuck with me for now.

I've flaired as ""support* but actually I'm mostly good and happy these days.

I don't expect any replies or answers, I just want to tell me story.

I'll start in the mid seventies. I was maybe 6 when my parents split up, and my stepfather had some odd ideas about parenting. He wasn't hugely pleased that I was around. His adult children had left home, and that suited him.

It started, ridiculously, with shampoo.

My hair was washed in fairy liquid. He had an anti dandruff shampoo which nearly blinded me, so I got what was available from the kitchen sink.

I hated having my hair washed. It was greasy and horrid and stung my eyes, and I asked my mum why I couldn't use her shampoo, but she said it was special.

If I was alone in the bathroom I'd open all the bottles she had and smell them. Shampoo that smelt like flowers, conditioner that was rich and smooth, and all sorts of other gorgeous things. Toner, lotions, foundation- I couldn't understand why I couldn't have nice things like that.

If I was sick, my stepfather and mum would go to work, and leave me in bed with squash and comics. I learned to live those days.

Is count to 100 after the door closed, and slip out of bed and go to the bathroom.

I'd smell the gorgeous things on there, pouring a little at a time on my hands to feel and smell it.

I'd look in the mirror, and wonder what id look like with long hair, or would I be brave enough to try some lipstick?

Eventually one day I put a little in the back of my hand, to work out how to remove it safely. I kept it on until it was almost time for mum to come home, lying in bed, reading, and thinking about the taste and feeling of it.

I was jealous. So jealous, all these pretty things that I was told were expensive and for big girls, not little boys.

Maybe mum suspected, but one day all these things vanished. I found them in her room, in a box in the wardrobe, and waited until I had a cold again.

That day I snuck in, and tried to really carefully pull the box out. The rest of the wardrobe was a wonder. There was a long dress, in a sort of gold satin. It still had the tags on, so I suppose it had just been consigned to the back of the pile, maybe the wrong size.

I put it on, over my Paddington pyjamas. It felt so pretty, but it trailed on the ground.

I went downstairs, turned on the TV, and drank my squash watching some sort of educational program while I waited for lunchtime TV to start.

Maybe I fell asleep, maybe I wanted to be caught.

I woke up, and mum was going mad. Crying, calling me a thief, telling me that she was ashamed of me.

I learned, after that, that it wasn't allowed, it was wrong, boys were meant to wear drab grey clothes, and I cried myself to sleep for a week frightened that she would tell someone."

I feel really bad when I talk about Nonbinary people w/ my mom.	"My mom has said that ‘they/them’ pronouns are ‘too confusing’, and so I’ve had to misgender them and I hate it. She asked what my Nonb classmate was biologically born as, as if it’s any fucking business to her. I really wish I didn’t have to speak to her or hear her opinions on ANY lgbt shit, cause she’s always super regressive even though she thinks of herself as a progressive. 

I probably just shouldn’t mention my friends at all, but then she gets mad that I don’t tell her ‘everything’. And she also thinks I’m ‘confused’ about me being nonb when I’ve been living out to my friends for a year now. 

Sorry, I just had to rant."	That sounds like it sucks dude I'm so sorry. Hopefully she either pulls her head out of her ass or just gets easier to deal with	w3ccue	NonBinary	9	1.0	2022-07-20 03:50:24
Need some help with coming out to my mom...	"Like the title says, I need some help or tips or something. I came out as gender fluid about 3 or 4 years ago and she seemed almost mad when I told her. ""So you're my *son* now??""   I told her, ""I'm not sure what I am"" and then the conversation slowly fizzled away and here we are today

It's been a few years, and she's now more understanding that my gender is very fluid at random times. But over the past few months, I've been hating she/her pronouns and hate being someone's ""daughter""... I'm out online and semi out to friends, but it's just so difficult to talk to her. I'm AFAB, and an only child to a single mom and I just can't figure out how to tell her my pronouns are he/they and I don't like my birth name and I want to be called this other name and all these other things and I'm so confused 😢

Anything helps. Please and thank you ✨"	"First you should try sitting her down and tell her it’s very serious and you just want her to listen to you before she responds. Be confident in yourself and what you’re saying; let her know how it makes you uncomfortable to be seen as something you are not. Let her know gender and sex are two different things and that you can’t help who you are, but you’re also proud of who you are. Let her know you’re still her child and you’ll always love her, but you can’t be called “she” , “her”, or “daughter” anymore because it makes you feel trapped. Being called referred to as “she, her, and daughter” are still things I struggle with my own mother, but your mother can’t give the effort into supporting you if you don’t let her know how strongly you feel about your identity and how important these pronouns are. 
Thank you so much ❤️ Your comment really did help me, gave me the kick in the ass I needed to tell her and... she was so incredibly understanding and agreed to try to use he/they pronouns. 😇
That’s wonderful news! So happy for you💕"	b0huo5	NonBinary	9	1.0	2019-03-13 04:41:57
Does identifying as non-binary make you queer?	"Having a conversation with two friends (bi and gay, respectively) and one of them asked if I identify as queer. 

I assumed queer was purely in relation to sexuality. (For context I’m AMAB and date non-binaries and women, but labelling any sexuality when you’re NB is already a madness because almost all  labels are based purely around a binary model of gender, but that’s not the point here.) 

But after I told them I don’t think so, both my friends said they would class me as queer, as I’m a part of the LGBT+ umbrella, but I’m still unsure what to think, as I worry I’m taking away from different LGBT+ groups by claiming queer. 

Where do you all stand in this? Am I just over-worrying or do you agree with my friends?"	"If you want, sure. Most people would say that a relationship with a nonbinary person isn’t straight, so it would be a queer relationship. But it’s entirely up to you. 

Me, I’m queer af. You do you, babe.
some trans & nonbinary people consider their gender to be a queer experience of gender, some don’t. it’s a personal thing. personally I feel both my gender and sexuality are hella queer.
queer is the biggest umbrella there is. It just means doing gender and/or sexuality differently than the norm. If you want to be identify as queer, then as a nonbinary person you are definitely queer.
> as I worry I’m taking away from different LGBT+ groups by claiming queer

Nah boo you're just as valid as others.  Queer is a general term that most understand to mean some kind of gender, sexuality, or romantic minority.
I'd say yes, since the most common model of labeling sexuality is gender comparison. What gender are you vs what gender you're attracted to. It's difficult to cleanly label sexual orientation when your gender doesn't always neatly fit in that model. That being said, I stand by the idea that labels should always be self applied and tools to understand ourselves and be understood by others, not rules that are enforced on people.
I think it really depends. Some nbs still identify somewhat with their agab, and if they've always identified as straight before and they don't experience love in a queer way then I think straight is the label that serves them best. It's important to say too that only having straight attraction doesn't make someone any less valid as a nonbinary person.

I do think having a gender fully outside the binary like agender, gender neutral, various other nb identities makes you queer inherently, and I've seen some arguments that contradict this which are really transphobic. Like the other day we had a thread where someone said they're """"""female bodied"""""""" and only like """"""""male bodied"""""" people like, bodies can't have gender and you just misgendered like every single trans person in existence.
Gender queer.
Cheers boo, that makes a lot of sense!

I don't know how to tell me family that I'm not a trans guy	"So for the last year I've been thinking that I was trans, and I've gone by Kian and using he/him. But I now know that I'm more non-binary. My family has been pretty supportive, you know after I was persistent enough. But they have also been going around telling everyone about my identity, without asking if that was ok. So telling them about how I feel just generally is kind of hard.
When I first came out I said that I identified as non-binary, but my mom insisted that it didn't exist. Then I gave up and went as my dead name for a couple months until I broke down over it. They then thought it meant that I was trans. And I somehow also managed to convince myself of the same. But after having been out for this school year(i went to an art school, so it was pretty accepted) I have realized that I'm not trans, and that I don't want to go on hormones or have surgery.
I'm just scared to tell my parents because I don't know how they will react. As in the past, they(especially my mom) have shown no regard for my feelings or identity.
I'm scared that they will be mad that I ""lied"" or whatever they will call it. But I need to tell them. I just don't know how."	"Nonbinary Falls under the trans umbrella because the concept of trans is NOT Binary. 

Remember you do not need to be on hormone to be trans. You do not need to undergo surgery to be trans. You do not need to ""pass to be trans. 

You are trans because you are NOT Binary. Non binary people are valid and you do not have to explain yourself beyond that you do not align with the sex you were born as. You are fully aware of your biology however your mind does not feel that way.
i don’t have any advice, but i want to reassure you that not wanting to medically transition doesn’t make you less trans if that is how you feel. 

you didn’t lie to them, it sounds like you tried to come out as enby and your mother told you that you don’t exist so you adjusted for your own safety.
Same way you told them about your identity in the first place. “Hey after thinking about it I’ve come to the conclusion I don’t identify as X. I want to go by Y from now on. I was figuring myself out and feel like this suits me better, hope you can respect that.”
Transness ≠ medical transition. You can still be trans and not make any changes to your body or even name if you don’t feel like you need to. Everyone’s lived experience is different, but that doesn’t invalidate yours. Typically, non-binary individuals DO fall under the trans umbrella, but honestly it’s a personal choice for some non-binary individuals to refer to themselves as trans or not. I hope things work out for you and your family shifts to a better frame of understanding!
Honestly, you may just have to bite the bullet.  If you have decided that physical transitioning isn't for you, and you're worried their reaction to finding that out will be, in effect, some version of ""told you so, we were right all along, you were just confused, now when are you gonna a marry nice boy & give us some grandkids"", well... that may indeed be their reaction.  Which will indeed suck ass.

Obviously you're under no obligation to tell them anything, but *if* you feel you need to tell them, well there isn't really a painless way to do that. 

All you can do is be as direct & honest as possible & get if over with as quickly as possible - you're responsible for your own words, you're not responsible for their reaction.  Just give them whatever information you feel they need to have, delivered as calmly as possible; maybe just as simple as ""I've decided that testosterone & mastectomy are not for me, but I use they/them pronouns & the name XXXX & I'd feel more comfortable if you referred to me that way"". At least that way you could feel secure in the knowledge that you've given them the opportunity to refer to you correctly, even if they don't take that opportunity.
This!

Non-Binary **is** trans. Trans just means “not cis”, i.e. you don’t identify with your AGAB. That’s that, nothing more, nothing less. What you feel, do or don’t do beyond that is very specific to each person. Thus, you can be trans without ever transitioning in any way.

Go ahead, live your real life!

Hugs and my warmest wishes."	w3jqf0	NonBinary	8	0.91	2022-07-20 11:14:25
Hello friends! Question on being an ally.	"First of all, my apologies if this is the wrong place to post-mods feel free to move/delete! I did read the rule about searching, and I searched, but I didn't find an answer to this question. r/trans helpfully suggested I move my question here.  


I am part of a ""diversity in tech"" slack in my city and we have this program where you can sign up to get paired up with another random member and then basically go on a blind friend date with them. I am looking at my partner's pronouns, and they are ""she/they."" This is the first time I have seen this particular pairing (I have seen they/them, she/her, he/him, zi/hir/zir, and probably others but it has always been a ""set,"" even if it's a nonbinary set).  


I am excited to meet this person because we share a lot of interests and I'm worried about fucking it up and offending this person especially when the industry we work in can be hostile already. Does this mean that this person is comfortable with she/her and they/them? r/trans suggested demigirl or genderfluid. I would love to be as welcoming as possible to my partner and know as much as I can before I ask, but I also am looking for guidance on the best place to start my research. I know you can't speak for my partner, but I'm hoping to at least get a foot in the door in terms of understanding so that I'll be able to talk to the person without totally making my partner sad/mad/confused/etc.  


I appreciate any input :)"	"generally, this would mean that they use either and don't really have a preference, which is what i do. it would be ok to use either of those at any time. if you're still unsure, you can just ask. most people don't mind being asked about their programs, so your partner shouldn't be offended. and there's not really a way to know her gender because pronouns don't always equal  gender.
In your situation, I would feel comfortable using she/her and they/them. Avoid masculine pronouns. That pairing is not enough to assume they identify as genderfluid or NB or trans.
I used to use two sets of pronouns too. it meant that I was equally comfortable with either one. Most people picked one and always used it, although i preferred people to switch it up sometimes.

people have many different reasons for doing that, but ultimately none of them are immediately important for your purposes. focus on the pronouns. ask the person if one is slightly better than the other. ask about other gendered terms like girl, man, dude, sir/ma'am, stuff like that. then address them as prescribed.

It's okay to ask about gender identity, but I often prefer to have more trust established with people before I get into it. they might too.
I think that probably means that she is ok with either she/her or they/them. I would ask her if she has a set she prefers, but I would wait to ask her about her gender identity until you know her better."	bx3ipj	NonBinary	9	0.92	2019-06-05 14:58:35
Scared to tell my parents about my haircut	"So I’m not out to my parents as nb but I am out to them as a lesbian. They’re both ok with it but they’re also both weird about it and we don’t bring it up. I asked my mom to get my hair cut short about 6 years ago when I was still in high school. She didn’t say no but she acted weird about it and I got scared and changed my mind. 
About a week ago I found a tiktok with a cut that I really liked. It’s not short but it’s an undercut and that’s the most drastic haircut I’ll have gotten in my life. I made an appointment at a queer hair place and now the appointment is tomorrow. I really want the haircut but I have a feeling I’m gonna chicken out because I’m so scared to send pictures to my parents. They won’t be mad but I just hate how much they make a big deal of things that I want kept more lowkey. Idk what I’m looking for. Just kind of needed to release that fear and tell other people about it."	"it's your hair, not theirs, and if you don't like it, it'll grow. it's not like, top surgery or something that's pretty permanent and you need to be 1000% certain about. try it, and if you don't like it, don't try it again
It's a haircut, just let them know you liked the haircut and that's why you got it. 

Them being weird about what you do shouldn't dictate what you want to do for yourself, and if they are weird about it then that's their problem.
Best of luck! It’ll be scary telling them the first time, but after that it’ll just feel more and more normal! I was scared to get my hair cut again when I grew it out, but I was really happy I did."	k7zsj4	NonBinary	8	0.85	2020-12-06 19:05:49
How do I come out as nonbinary to my mother?	My mother is strict, overprotective, overbearing and homophobic. I want to be nonbinary. She said that she would disown me if I am not straight. I was born female but I really want to change to nonbinary. I got everything ready. My name is Mavis and it's a femal name. I want to be called Alex because it can be a girl name. She disowned her sister (my aunt) because she is trans. She is so old fashioned. She is very religious. Once I tell her that I am changing my name to Alex, she will know and get mad. How can I come out without getting disowned?	"please please please do not come out to her. from what im reading it seems that it might be very unsafe for you to come out. please remember you dont HAVE to come out to everyone. only come out to people that you can trust. i know this hurts to hear but if she has disowned her own sister and threatened to disown you, she probably will. please stay safe
Stay safe first and above all. Sounds to me like it's not worth coming out to her at this point.
Sometimes parents can be angry and unreasonable at first but come around later which would be nice or sometimes you have to live your life and accept whatever losses and find a new family 

Some parents will decide that maintaining a relationship in the end is most important and others won’t. All’s you can do is be respectful,  sometimes validating their concerns but gently educating them can help but stand your ground and hope for the best
Thank you for the advice. I am so happy I don't have to come out to her.

I'm so tired of everyone erasing us	"I'm really sorry because this is going to be so unproductive but I really need to get it out of my system. TW for erasure and misgendering.  


I saw some discourse about Kurt Cobain possibly being genderqueer on Twitter today. I'm not a giant Nirvana fan, but I enjoy their music well enough and I always found him an enticing person that obviously died  way too early, so I went ""huh, that's neat"" and saw if I could find out more about it.   


So, the fuzz seemed to be originating from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/MagsVisaggs/status/1485329749387972608) and I don't know why, but something about this tickled a weird place in my brain and I can't let it go, I am so mad about this.  


So what's happening here is that this person (who I assume from context is a binary trans woman, but I can't say for sure and I do not know their pronouns) took the following ""evidence"":  
\- Cobain writing lyrics about not being a man and wanting to grow breasts  
\- him being jealous of male seahorses for being able to give birth

\- him often wearing dresses and nail polish   


and claims that therefore he must have been a trans woman who would have actually preferred she/her pronouns. Excuse me?  


Guess who is not a man, enjoys having breasts (most of the time at least) and wearing nail polish and dresses. That's right, it's me and fucking none of it makes me a woman. It already sucks that I get misgendered by cis people every god damn day of the week, I do not need that kind of shit from other trans folks.  


 It's so infuriating to me that someone would look at some hints that imply that a person probably wasn't a cis male and then immediately jump to the conclusion that therefore they must have been a trans woman. Also the fact that they just *decided for literally no reason whatsoever* to use she/her pronouns is infuriating to me. Cobain not being a cis dude doesn't equal Cobain being uncomfortable with he/him pronouns. And even if he was, that does not mean you get to pick a random set out of a literally endless pool of options just because they happen to match your own. I can't imagine how a trans person who claims to have non binary friends could possibly think that's okay.   


It hurts so much that a binary trans person would happily accept that they're erasing so many aspects of non binary identity for a funny tweet about an artist they like being ""one of their own"" or whatever. I know that it is commentary on cis- and heteronormativity regarding historical figures. But you totally could have done that without just *guessing* what he might have been.  


Also the way the tweet is worded in this fandomy-headcanony way is so fucking obnoxious. You're not talking about a character from your favourite movie. You're talking about a real life person who hasn't even been dead for that long, who still has living friends and family that might find it pretty disrespectful that you would say their loved one who died at a tragically young age is ""yours now"" and that ""you will not be returning him"".  


Again, sorry for this super negative rant, but I'm just sick of people deliberately ignoring that we exist if it serves their purposes, and it hurts me so much more coming from other trans folks."		sdaq4v	NonBinary	8	0.91	2022-01-26 17:03:15
Came out to the surprise of no one.	"So I want to start this off with a backstory.
I was never a girly person and even though I was a girl I never really felt comfortable being a girl, jeans and shirts are my fave and I never wanted to look girly or even really look like a girl growing up.
I would cry and become incredibly uncomfortable around feminine things like makeup and dresses.
People in my family did try and get me into dresses but it never happened as I hated wearing them.
(Please don’t hate my family for this as it’s not something I’m mad at them for)

I don’t think I ever really hid this as I never really knew that I was any different as I just figured I was me, and being me was awesome.
When my best friend came out as a trans man I did think I was a trans man for a short while as I didn’t really wanna be a girl.

That was until the beginning of last year when I REALLY wanted to try a binder and I didn’t want my boobs anymore, I started wearing baggy clothing and just left it at that.

Around 4 months ago I was at a friends and I put on a dress, it was a biker type dress with pleats (hopefully you know what I mean) and within 1 sec of having it on I burst into tears and tried to tear it off.
We took it off and I don’t think I’ve ever felt so uncomfortable and disgusting in a while.

A couple of months ago I gave it some actual thought, and spoke to some people online and realised I’m probably not a male or a female and that’s pretty cool.

I’m moving house when quarantine is over and will be getting a binder so I can finally be me.

The thing is that I came out to my friends and none of them seemed to care or where shocked as they always knew me as the girl who wasn’t a girl, my roommate even said he never really saw me as a girl and didn’t care lol.


TMI....
It also makes sence to me as to why I went through a hyposexual phase for a year and then refused to even touch my downstairs, I actually have to force myself to clean down there cause I hate touching it.

Need help with boyfriends parents	So, my boyfriends super religious, transphobic, evangelical parents found my twitter, where I am very open as a non-binary person (among other things they hate). They brought this up to him privately, expressed concern, saying I’m confused and you either born a girl or a boy, yada yada. My boyfriend assured me it’ll be fine, but I’m freaking out. He said we should at least try to explain it to them, or else they’ll complain that we can’t be mad because we didn’t even try. I really need any articles that are good at explained non-binary and transgender people to older, religious parents. This was also brought up by them only because he was having an innocent and happy conversation with them about his future, and how he sees me in it, so I do need them to at least not hate me. Any help is appreciated, I’m just really panicking (my panic attacks have been mild though.. so that’s a plus I guess)		jdaf6j	NonBinary	8	1.0	2020-10-18 05:07:11

3 months on low dose T.	"I figured I'd give an update about where I am on low dose T after 3 months.

First of all my dose is 20mg /0.2ml once a week subq. Don't adjust your own doses without consulting a medical professional but this is for general reference.

My testosterone level went from 1 nmol/l to 5 nmol/l a typical male at my age is 13+ nmol/l for reference. I had pcos with low estrogen rather than high testosterone. This is a happy place for me as it's nice and in between and I'm seeing the changes I like.

Changes from top to bottom:

Hair: my hair is relitivly the same, it is still thick and has a little more texture to it, but otherwise exactly the same. Scalp is more dry/flakey.

Face: my face shape is relitivly the same, a little more chub but otherwise uneventful.

Facial hair: Comes in quicker and I'm starting to get a few more spots but it's nothing to brag about.

Skin: oily but no break out issues so far.

Voice: not much of a drop but I can make it go lower than before and going up is harder. It's easier to go to the male to neutral range and stay there.

Muscles: clear increase in muscle mass. I am however having more issues with dystonia causing major muscle tightening.

Body hair: no real change, few more existing hairs are dark but not really anything much. I don't like most of my body hair so I keep shaved.

Body oder: I sweat more and smell different, but it's not bad or noticeable to most.

Fat distribution: I've gained weight (10 lbs) and it sits on my gut. I plan to work on this though.

Bottom growth: about half an inch or so. Hasn't changed after the first month.

Urine smell: It smells bad and different. Very much need to stay on top of hygiene down there.

Internal Atrophy: Noticeable for me without going into much more detail.

Periods: Stopped after my first shot.

Mood: A lot better, I'm calmer and more relaxed in situations I would have gotten mad or anxious in before. I'm more likely to stand up for myself.

Low levels: mostly tired the day or two before my shot. I'll fall asleep very easily. I hover sleep far better overall.

And that's all I can think of. Questions feel free to ask."	Wow, thank you so much for your post. This is insanely interesting and actually makes me a little less anxious about maybe starting T myself some day	qh5184	NonBinary	7	0.9	2021-10-27 19:53:16
Advice on convincing doctors/finding a doctor for surgery.	"For several reasons, I want a complete hysterectomy. I know I can get insurance to cover it since I have several medical reasons (ie pregnancy will equate to death). 

I tried talking to one OB and she got defensive and mad at me. Basically saying that castration like that is inhuman to do to someone and who would want to go through menopause early. Umm yeah... that is kinda why I want them out. Along with the fact that one is being choked out by blood vessels. 

Thankfully that wasn’t my normal OB. Still, I don’t want to run into this issue again. I know that the surgeon who delivered my youngest will at the very least do a basic hysterectomy. How have people approached doctors about these things?

I also would like to get a breast reduction. They are huge, and binding doesn’t reduce it enough. I want to keep some tissue for my more feminine days. But being a B or C sounds a lot better than where I am currently. I am hoping to become more androgynous with it. How did you all find a good surgeon? What are some good questions to ask them?"	"I knew for several years before getting one that I wanted a hysterectomy. Always had terrible problems with menstruation, and eventually realized it was causing dysphoria in addition to physical pain. 

The thing was, I couldn’t get any general practitioners OR gynecologists to take the idea seriously. They told me I was too young (I’m still under 35). They asked if I was suuuuure I never wanted to have children (never, ever did). They insisted that an IUD or continuous birth control would be a better solution (I used the pills as a compromise for a while). They didn’t want me to make any decisions that couldn’t be undone. Blah blah blah.  

So I decided to find out if I had access to gender transition services; turns out I did, and visits to a marriage & family therapist who specialized in gender identity were fully covered. I had three meetings with the therapist, explained that menstruation and having breasts were negatively affecting my ability to work and my body image, respectively, and was promptly referred to the “gender pathways” department. The guy was super nice and very nonbinary friendly. 

I got appointments with a gynecological surgeon and a plastic surgeon who focuses on chest reconstruction. My hysterectomy (removal of uterus, tubes, and cervix) was performed a few weeks ago. My top surgery is a year from now (I’m only about 80% sure I really want that one). 

After the discouraging experiences with all of the gynecologists I saw—not to mention the struggles of my trans and nonbinary friends—I was shocked at how easy all of this was. I retained my ovaries because having estrogen doesn’t bother me, only bleeding did. But if you have physical issues with your ovaries, by all means keep asking for what you need. 
I'm sorry that you had an experience like that with a medical professional, it's not appropriate of them to get defensive at all!

Are you talking about a hysterectomy and oopherectomy (uterus and ovaries) or just uterus. removing your uterus will not send you into menopause, but it's still sometimes difficult to find a surgeon who will perform the surgery if you're under 30 or so? Menopause will SUCK but if that's what you want you should be able to get it done somehow!

I got lucky and had a doctor recommended to me who turned out to be extremely trans-friendly and had connections with surgeons who specialize in trans care, I'm currently doing the legwork to get my hysterectomy probably sometime next year. Is there a planned Parenthood or gender clinic near you to contact for a referral? Do you have any trans friends who have decent doctors you could try to speak to? I could tell you who I'm talking to via PM, but I'm in upstate NY and don't know if it would help at all. 

Anyways, these are just my thoughts on the topic, I hope you find what you need and I'm happy to do what I can to help. Good luck!
I told the last one that while I am done having kids and am ace do not having sex, I wanted a 0% chance of getting pregnant. As in the chance of getting pregnant from a random rape was too high of a chance. 

How did you find out information on gender transformation services?
I was meaning both. I have to have abdominal surgery for it regardless due to some organs not being where they are supposed to be. Due to my last pregnancy (both my child and I almost died), I am hoping that I can find someone else now that I have moved. 

I think I will seek out a male doctor for it since females seem to get defensive over it all. I don’t get why they care when it is my body and not theirs. 🙄

I’m across the country in WA. Most of my trans friends are AMAB. I need to connect more with the local trans community. If not for me for my middle child. 
You could check with your insurance. Mine has a doctor finder tool on the website and let's you sort by different things, one of which is lgbt related topics.
When I wanted to find out if I was eligible to get gender affirmation services, I tried the online portal first, but couldn’t turn up much useful information. I resorted to e-mailing my main doctor, who luckily knew that someone was right nearby.

EDIT: fixed typo
I still recommend asking your AMAB pals if they have a good doctor- not just surgeons. Their PCP may have resources for AFAB folks too. 

You're in charge of your health and body, keep demanding what you need until you get it. I'm sorry it's so hard, and I wish you all the luck in the world!

Both my doctor and my surgeon are cis women, but if you're more comfortable with a man by all means seek one out."	927l1n	NonBinary	8	0.9	2018-07-26 23:59:18
So here's the Tea	"This all started fairly young. When I was around 10-12 I kept saying I wanted to be a boy. I wanted to wear boys clothes, be seen and treated like a boy. It pissed my very conservative parents off. I don't even really remember how this discussion came about but I was in the nurses office and she asked me in the most British way possible what I would do if I had...male genitalia. I really didn't know. That seemed kinda gross and weird. That got rid of it for a LONG time. I was content with being a tomboy girl. 

But in thinking. The past few years I have been feeling a lot of ""top dysphoria"" if you will. It comes and goes and usually isn't a major issue. Although as of late it's been kinda shitty. 

The other day I posted a pic of myself and I had my hair tucked in my cap (the first time I felt any other kind of dysphoria). One of my online friends instantly thought I was a dude. And I was really happy cuz that was the goal! 

Tomorrow I'm gonna try that again as well as hiding my chest. (Which I did the other day by wearing an over sized jacket) 

The one reason I'm not sold on believing I'm nonbinary is because I can be very comfortable being AFAB sometimes. I am OK with the parts I sometimes wanna hide being seen. I'm OK with female pronouns and I'm OK with my birth name. From my understanding nonbinary is kind of an androgynous thing where you don't want to be seen as male or female. Although that's kinda how I want to be seen as when I'm presenting more masculine. If I'm wearing traditionally female clothes I'm not gonna get mad if someone says I'm a girl. 

I also want to rule out other things like depression, since I have 3 depressive disorders or perhaps I'm just not allowed to express myself freely enough in my parents house so I'm having issues with my gender expression. Idk. 

Any experience and feedback would be nice."	"Androgyne is not the only non binary identity, but labels are mostly for you to try and see what, if any, feels best to describe yourself
From what you mention you might be a Demi woman, a fluid identity with a constant feminine component that changes in intensity usually also mixed or flowing with with another gender identity"	ez4tud	NonBinary	8	0.9	2020-02-05 06:00:06
A brain dump of my feelings on my gender. Am I a poser? (I’m trying to figure out how to talk about all this at my first therapy appointment this week)	"I just need to dump my feelings about my gender before my first appointment with a therapist this week, and see what anyone out there in the interwebs has to say about it. Idk what type of response I’m looking for.. basically I just want some feedback on my story so I can figure out how to introduce myself to my therapist. I’ve done therapy my whole life because I have some mental health issues, but I’ve never ever talked about my sexuality or gender, and I feel like it’s time. 

I’m AFAB. From age 3-7 I insisted I was a boy. My parents never talked me out of it, they just had a sort of “it’s probably a phase” attitude about it. I mean if they did have any problems with it, I’ve completely repressed it because I don’t remember them ever being mean about it in any way. I remember a convo with my dad where he said I didn’t have to stop thinking of myself as a boy if I didn’t want to. I did get bullied in school by some girls, but I didn’t care too much about that because I wasn’t friends with them anyway. Everyone my age in my neighbor were boys, so all of my good friends were boys and they all thought of me as a boy. The only negative thing I remember regarding my friends was that my best friend really thought I was a boy, so him and me and both our parents and our teacher had to have a talk at one point about how I was a girl. He got really mad and didn’t accept it at first, but once he did he refused to be friends with me. It hurt my feelings and our parents tried to force us to still hang out, but I just kinda got over it at some point and made a new best friend.

Around age 7/8 it just stopped. I felt perfectly comfortable being female from then on.

Then at some point in high school I did a “breaking social norms” project for AP Psych where I just randomly showed up presenting as a guy. I didn’t tell anyone about it before hand. And despite being a conservative and a Catholic (with conservative and Catholic friends), everyone was like “yeah we’re not surprised, it’s cool”. Which was, frankly, shocking. And made me rethink everything I knew about gender. I was expecting to have to argue with people but everyone was like “yeah this makes sense” and the best answer I got from anyone basically was because I’ve always been a tomboy.

Anyway life went on and I was happy as a gymnast/cheerleader/sorority girl for the rest of high school and college, never really questioning my gender again. 

Except whenever the topic of me “wanting to be a boy” when I was little came up, it would bother me for a couple days. I grew up in the 90s, so basically every girl my age had a short bob or pixie cut at some point. So whenever I’d say that I thought I was a boy, basically any girl would be like OMG ME TOO. But every time this happened, we’d realize that they just meant they liked Sporty Spice and had a bob. For me.. I mean I tried to pee on the side of building with my (boy) friends and told all my teachers and doctors and everyone that I WAS a boy. It just seemed very different than what anyone else experienced. And I was in high school / college from 2005-2013, so things were not nearly as accepting at this point that they are now. I know that doesn’t seem like it was that long ago but it really was a lot different then, than it is now.

Anyway. After I got married in 2016 to a very open-minded man, and learned a lot about the world, I totally changed. We moved a few states away from my family and old friends and met some great open-minded people. Since that time I’ve come out as pan and possibly poly. And I’ve also accepted myself for the “butch” woman I really am. I shave my head and don’t wear makeup and present very androgynously. And it’s going well for the most part but it’s a lot to process so I’m going to be talking to a therapist this week.

I’m happy with who I am, except I kinda get a weird feeling when people in public assume I’m female. I mean I do have boobs but I dress in a way that downplays them. And for whatever reason, it really bugs me. Like I don’t really feel like I wish they’d have assumed I was male. But I also don’t feel good about people assuming I’m female.

I totally accept that gender is not a binary (like I thought it was growing up). But I suppose I still have some of that in the back of my mind because in a way it’s like I don’t feel male or female but I’m not like okay saying that. Like I’m comfortable saying I prefer to have an androgynous look.. but I’m not comfortable with any of the gender labels. Non-binary is I suppose the least worst option. But I still feel like a poser saying I’m non-binary. Idk. Also to keep the timeline making sense I’m 29 now if that’s helpful to know. 

But anyway, yeah idk what I’m looking for here but if this post makes you want to say or ask anything, go right ahead!"	"Heya, we're contemporaries I think (woo 90's kids).

You don't sound like a poser at all, you just sound trans af, weather that's transmasc, gnc, nonbinary or binary.

I'm sorry you have had such a bumpy road to get to a place where you have support and can be and live in a way that feels more authentic for you. Many shared feels! 

I'm agender, the central tenant of which is 'fuck gender'. I hate being labelled and gendered. Maybe that resonates?
You're definitely not posing, it's possible you could be genderfluid but over a long time before switching, or agender. Maybe the thing you are doesn't have a label. Here's my advice to you though: Focus on the practical stuff (style. pronouns, name, medical stuff (hrt, surgeries if you want them) first. Then if you have time you can put a name to your gender. After my 18 years on this planet the only thing I can think of that describes gender is ""the simplest way of classifying people"". I see it more as a social group like theatre kids or computer geeks or such. And some people don't feel like they fit in any of those groups.
You're valid. To me it sounds like your gender is ""meh"" or maybe /shrug or possibly third/other/nameless gender or maybe genderfluid or maybe agender.

In my opinion indifference about gender identity falls under non-binary and feeling like nothing fits is the same deal. But picking labels is a personal decision. It's up to you and you're valid with whatever you pick.
Honestly, I think it’s kind of a gender non conforming rite of passage, the stuff you’re describing. A lot of us go through it. I’m non binary and felt the same at one point. It’s like... well, you don’t feel like the binary opposite of your birth gender/sex.... but you sure as heck don’t fit as your culturally assigned one either. So you wander around in the wasteland doubting yourself for awhile. You know you’re different as a kid but lacked the language to describe it. 

The fact that you even experience this AT ALL is a sure sign you’re LGBTQA in some form. 

Do you question whether you’re a fan of your favorite ice cream? No, silly right? You just like it. Actual cis folks are like that with their gender: it’s just what they are. Constantly worrying about it means one thing: the cis shoe doesn’t fit, so don’t wear it.

I came out to my mum!	"Okay, maybe not quite. But I told her about how I feel and that, if I could, I would have loved to have a ""sexless"" body and that I want to seek out a professional to medically transition and give me the required documents to also legally ""transition""! I didn't say the word Non-binary directly, but she got what I was trying to tell her and she was very okay with it! :)
It makes me so happy and I want to ask her soon to no longer call me by my deadname and instead use my ""new"" name! ^ . ^
Even tho she didn't fully get it, which I'm not mad about because I can understand that, she was, as said, very accepting and okay with that :) She said, she wanted to see what the therapist(s) will say, but all in all, it went pretty smoothly ^ - ^

My mum also told me, that she always knew I wasn't a ""girl"" and I think something also finally made sense for her on why I am this way :) I hope to have another conversation with her in the future and really tell her, that I am non-binary and that this just is who I am :)

I am relieved rn and just very happy about everything ^ - ^ Please wish me luck, that I can get a therapy place at the clinic and start my true life as the person I (almost) was always meant to be :))"	"I had a friend, X, who used very similar words. X didn’t feel like either gender ‘felt right’ (also didn’t like third person they, but didn’t feel like anything else fit either). X said it wouldn’t feel any better with any hormone changes or surgeries so just stayed as born, and just “dealt with” the body dysphoria because no other possible change would feel more true. (X liked to think of X as a gender less robot more than anything else xD)

No idea if this resonates, but I thought it sounded familiar. 

Grats! And yay for your mum!
I used to dislike they/them too, but now that I tried them, I actually like them alot!
And U can understand that X may find that HRT and surgery may have felt wrong or as if they wouldn't have done anything to relieve X from the dysphoria, but I actually want to have surgery and make my body more androgynous. I don't view myself as a ronot, but sometimes as an alien, that should have been born differently ^ ^
I explained to my mum that, in videogames you can sometimes create your own character and if I had that option before being born, I would have made myself sexless. I still want to be human, but nothing else. Not male, not female. Just human is what I wanna be ^ ^

It kinda resonates, but doesn't at the same time xD I think the Non-binary identity is too broad to have to people experience the same. Many might experience similar things than others, but just like with binary genders, everyone is ever so slightly different and no one is the same :)

Thank you!!
Yeah, and I didn’t want to push any way in particular, just that you sounded very similar to X in your wants/needs = )"	ngexeb	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-05-19 19:37:50
The words transfem/transmasc etc feel invalidating (when used for nonbinary people)	"I feel like I see people giving away their AGAB more often than they need to. I feel like this is unnecessary information a lot of the time. The same with AFAB/AMAB too.

I often find I relate to the experience of someone, but when I see that they've used the 'opposite' word it makes me feel dysphoric. It feels like we're reinforcing the binary with extra steps.

I understand that it describes a direction of travel and may be more helpful for those who are further from where they started but I kinda wish we put less emphasis on it. I also know that people can have different experiences, but personally I'm far more interested in the things we have in common. I find those words very frustrating and although one technically fits me, I feel alienated by both.

Please do what makes you happy, but perhaps it's worth a thought

p.s. I'm not calling anyone out and I'm not mad if you do this, it's just my personal experience

/srs /nm"	"Objectively this makes sense to me, but in my case I use trans Masc because I'm more aligned with masculinity than my femininity. And I'm starting testosterone, taking a medical step on transitioning in order to more fully embrace my masculinity. So for me, I am NB, because I'm not FTM, but I feel transmasc more fully describes me. Nonbinary is a spectrum, which is what makes it so beautiful. If you're more firmly in the middle then just using NB makes more sense, but when you're more strongly leaning in one direction or another, then trasmasc or transfem can make more sense. I personally don't mind people knowing my agab, but if that makes you uncomfortable for people to know yours then that's valid as well.
I made a post on a general trans sub the other day pretty much saying the same thing. Makes me hesitant to explore maybe being nb male because of how fixated people are on nb people’s agab. I tend to relate to nb people more who are the other agab from me and this binary within nonbinary really confused me.
I have similar thoughts. For the longest time I've thought I wasn't a valid enby because I'm not transmasc. I want to be more feminine but not in a transfem way either.
I disagree.

Transfeminine is a word I use to describe myself, not one others usually ascribe to me. I am actively taking medication to feminize my meat suit, and that's why I use the label.

I'm not super worried about people knowing my AGAB because it's painfully obvious right away, and there's not much I can do about that. At the end of the day, it doesn't change anything on a practical level. The people who gender me correctly and respect me will do so regardless of what labels I use, and the same goes for the transphobes; they don't care what your AGAB is they just hate you for being trans.
This is helping point out how much the binary still dominates our thinking, or at least certainly mine. I try to be very aware that my experiences, having been socialized the way I have, give me privileges that other marginalized people don't get. So I think when I see someone's AGAB is different from my own, I mentally take a step back and don't want to insert myself into the conversation, or assume my feelings are comparable to theirs. But these aren't absolutes, and I am encouraged when I do see someone's feelings toward gender are similar to mine, that I can understand where they're coming from. I guess in a way, this makes me think of the kind of ""post-racial"" talk that dominated the conversations many white people had in the 2000s, that because the goal was to be beyond racism, we should act as though we were all on a level playing field. Of course, racism *isn't* over, and you can't live entirely in a hopeful future--you have to deal with the present in order to get there. This is in no means an argument *for* the gender binary. We have to admit it shapes our lives, because it's imposed on us, and society at large isn't as far along the road of rejecting those limitations. But of course, feelings are not debatable, and I can absolutely see why reminders about AGAB coming up in a non-binary space would be distressing.
I agree. I'm scared I'm being a gatekeeper when I say this, but I've encountered many such people I'd classify as ""transtrenders."" I think some people appropriate trans terminology to sound  more interesting, and it comes from a lack education (or maybe comprehension?) of the words.

I think it's important to remember, though, that we're all constantly changing as people and in how we see ourselves, so the people who may be misappropriating our terminology are ultimately just trying to understand themselves better.
Same
I think this is completely valid. I completely see how it can be useful for people in the context of transitioning too.

What would you say to someone who is a masc AMAB nonbinary person, who maybe feels closer to where you do, or vice-versa? I can't help but wonder if sometimes we miss shared experiences, because we refer to ourselves in terms of where we've come from and not where we are now (or where we want to be)

You might not mind people knowing, but someone with a different AGAB might relate more to you and might end up feeling like they're ""doing it wrong"".

I love that nonbinary identities are a spectrum and I certainly don't want to police the way people describe themselves, after all it's a personal experience. I just wanted to raise the thought, because this is my experience
Exactly this! I relate to a lot of ftm things but don’t consider myself ftm and nonbinary is such a huge spectrum that finding people with similar experiences can be difficult sometimes without some narrowing it down. I will say I do only use transmasc in the company of other trans people as it’s a bit more of a safe environment.
I feel you, and I hope you get the chance to explore your identity as much as you need to
Thank you for sharing! I hope you feel far more valid nowadays
I think this is totally valid, and I completely see how it can be useful for people in the context of transitioning

[I wrote a very similar  response](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/skmhk5/the_words_transfemtransmasc_etc_feel_invalidating/hvoa8z4) to u/call_me_kade and I would love to know how you feel about it
Thank you, you've given me some important things to think about.

I certainly agree that it does have an impact, but it feels like there are contexts where that may be more or less relevent
Keep in mind that, for a lot of enbies, forcing ourselves to be consciously aware of our AGAB makes us more dysphoric, not less.

And, although you insinuate that AMABs are more privileged (which is true), it isn't necessarily the case for AMAB enbies in particular, and painting those as a privileged/oppressive group distorts a lot of things and erases most of the dynamics of the nonbinary community. Think about how dangerous it can be for an AMAB to present fem in public (yes, it's actually more dangerous than you think, despite what queerfeminism might tell you), or how little AMABs are represented in nonbinary spaces (and, nearly systematically, in a negative way).

Also, ""socialization"" as you describe it was initially a TERF talking point to, guess what, delegitimize AMAB trans people and paint them as opressors and a danger in non-masculine groups.

TL;DR: Please don't paint all AMAB enbies as a privileged/oppressor group, this is very far from being the truth. I know that it has been the trend recently, but it's a gross minsunderstanding of intersectionality and of, well, everything (on top of being mildly transphobic).
I understand the feeling of protectiveness over these terms. I'm not particularly worried about 'trenders' personally. I would rather people felt comfortable to explore their identity, and don't feel stigmatised for going down a different path in the future

There are times where it they may indeed be useful, I just think it sometimes needs a bit more thought about how and when
Honestly in terms of relating to people, I find I most relate to masculine people regardless if they are nb, trans masc, ftm, cis male, or even cis women who have a masculine vibe. To me, my label was a way if me finding my place in everything but it's not everything. My being nonbinary allows me to see common qualities with everyone, because I feel a little bit of everything. I think labels are a great way to initially find your group and your people but it's certainly not everything. There's no one way or right way to be anyone.
I know I'm butting in where I'm not the one being asked, but as someone who self-identifies as a transfem enby? To be perfectly honest, if the terms I identify with, that feel right to me, make someone else uncomfortable, then... well, it's truly unfortunate that they feel that way, but I'm not going to mold *my identity* for the comfort of others. 

I understand why others would rather forget their AGAB entirely, but I consider my origins part of the person I am, even though they're not the ones I would have picked. I'm not ashamed of them; I'm not going to hide them.
Not really, I'm still going through constant thoughts of ""What if I'm faking it/doing it for attention?"" Because whenever I do or like anything that's associated with my AGAB I make myself feel bad for supporting gender roles or patriarchy.
Congrats, you just agreed with a classic radfem/TERF without realizing it (see my comment just under for more information)
I agree. I didn't mean to make it seem like I was stigmatizing them. Other people using the words does not take them away from anyone else.
I would fiercely protect your every right to identify as a transfem enby. At the end of the day it's not for me, or anyone else, to tell you how to identify. I tried to make this clear in my OP, because it's very important

I was trying to share my experience, which has no more value or weight than anyone elses, and I was interested to know if others had the same experience. I have a feeling that looking for shared experiences is why a lot of us on this subreddit. I am also genuinely interested to hear if people disagree with this, or see things a different way, after all it might give me a new perspective

Also FTR, I wouldn't suggest that anyone should feel ever ashamed of the gender they were assigned at birth. I really hope it doesn't come across that way

The only thing I'm asking in my original post is to think about it, I am not, I repeat I am not, telling anyone how to identify
I'm sorry to hear that

If you're not adhering to gender roles, surely naturally you'll end up doing things associated with your AGAB from time to time. Idk it's difficult and confusing, I don't have the answers

(I'm making the bold assumption that you're not oppressing women etc and if you were I might encourage you to not do that)
My agreement is very limited in degree. I did see your comment before, but I didn't get to respond yet*. In fact, I actually upvoted your response and not the comment above

To be totally clear, I was agreeing only in that somones AGAB can have impact on a persons experience, but I wouldn't agree that it creates an inherent advantage across the board. If one person feels like it has put them at an advantage, that is their experience, but I wouldn't accept that as universal.

*I actually didn't respond because I couldn't figure out how to without giving away my AGAB. I would happily do that in the context of this specific conversation, but this is Reddit

Anyway thank you for your response, I didn't mean to alarm. I was just trying to find some shared ground on a sensitive subject

Edit: also, for clarity, I appreciated the response and that it had things to think about, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with what was said there
Okay! Thanks a lot for your elaborate response, and sorry if I assumed stuff or was too agressive in my comment :/
Not at all, I appreciated the challenge :)

Confusion	How do I know if Im faking it or really non-binary, or trans, gender-fluid or whatever? Its really bothering me, cause I don’t want to just go and say that “oh, Im non-binary” or “oh Im a guy” or “oh Im a girl” cause non of them really feel… right. I was born female, and for the most part Im comfortable with that I guess. But I feel this… disconnect from my body. Like, sometimes I’ll wear dresses and look in the mirror and be like “Damn, I look good” when it more just feels like.. playing dress up I guess? Like it feels like my body isn’t really ME, its just a stupid shell. And people calling me “mam” or “girl” or all these things feels so wrong, and sometimes I’ll just look down at my chest and want to rip it off. Or I’ll look at my face and think about how round it is and how my eyelashes are way too long and my ideal version of my self has always been a skinny tall guy. Meanwhile, here I am a fat, tallish girl.  On top of all that, theres my name. My given name has never felt right to me… like I know thats how it is for most people, but idk. Its always felt way too girly. Nora. Idk, its just not right. Latley I’ve been thinking of something else Id want to be called and the name Lake came to mind. I really like it, but I’m scared to actually ask people to call me that. I mean, everyone already knows me as Nora, and what if I change my mind? What if they get mad or say Im weird or hate me or forget and I have to remind them and feel weird for reminding them? I even thought of going to Starbucks and putting my name down as Lake to see how it feels, but I freaked myself out so bad sitting in the parking lot that I gave up and just went home. Idk. Feel like this maybe would work as a place to see what people who are actually non-binary or on that spectrum think. Or maybe I just need a place to vent.	"> How do I know if Im faking it

This isn't a thing. Your experience is your experience. There's no debate there, there's nothing *to* fake. You simply experience it. Like, you can't fake being hungry. You can say you're not hungry when you really are, but the experience of hunger is what it is, regardless of how you choose to describe it. So, your experience of gender is your experience of gender, regardless of what label you choose to use when describing it. There is nothing to fake. It's merely a question of finding a way to describe that experience that you feel will adequately express it.
A lot of nonbinary folks experience imposter syndrome. You aren't faking it. Why would you fake something that's been a negative experience? That doesn't make any sense!

Going to a place that doesn't know you and using the name Lake sounds like a very good idea. The Starbucks folks won't know, and even if they did, I really don't think they'd care. Just because you use the name Lake with strangers, or online, or with your friends, that doesn't mean you have to use that name with everyone.

And if you change your mind later, so what? It's your name. It belongs to you. You can change it if you want to.

Having to remind people *can* be weird and stressful though. Like my birth family doesn't use the right name or pronouns, and it isn't worth my energy to keep correcting them. You'll have to decide how much that matters to you. You can decide if its going to feel too weird to correct them and whether it's worth it.

As far as whether people think you're weird or hate you, that's really a *them* problem. You don't owe anyone your time or energy, much less owe any attention to people who are rude to you.

Good luck out there, Lake or Nora or whoever you are 🙂
Lake, nice really rolls of the tongue. If your friends don’t accept you for who you truly are than were they really your friends to begin with? Gender shit is scary and confusing and it’s totally fine and normal to feel scared and lost and like your world is melting. Being gender queer is beautiful but we don’t accept the binary we are engaging in a very political and triggering act which can be dangerous for us. I’m not sure where I’m going with this but i guess I wanted to say I’m with ya <3. I’ve recently started playing with hair styles and clothes to present more fem and it’s liberating :) do you have a safe place to bend gender norms?
Hey, im sorry i cant offer much advice or help but  
how are you, Lake?
Faking is conscious. If you were faking, you wouldn’t have to ask this because you’d know—it would be intentional."	pw5j6u	NonBinary	8	0.9	2021-09-27 00:07:13
Names & Masc Help	"recently I've been experimenting w names like using Danny instead of Danni. Danny feels better than Danni, but it isn't quite there yet. Based on how I look, what would be some good names (preferably neutral) that'd suit me? I can't cut my hair or get more masculine classes, cause my family has gotten mad at me for trying both, and my father is very anti transgenderism and the idea of non-binary, etc; so what are some things, even clothes and mannerisms, that I could pick up on/use that could make me seem more masc?

Layer v-neck or crew neck t-shirts over sports bras and under blazers, flannel, button ups. Also go for bootcut or straight cut jeans and pants, longer shorts with cuffs at the bottom for more structure. Wear boy short underwear or even boxer briefs if you can get away with it. Small compression shorts might be a better option to not raise suspicion. Perhaps find a messenger bag, small backpack or wallet you like instead of carrying a purse. 

When you walk, lead with your shoulders instead of your hips, keep your chin up and try not to bob much or sway your hips when you walk. Take up space. Sit with your legs and arms uncrossed, feet pointed outward or straight forward. We should all feel free to do those things, obviously, but as an AFAB person it took me a long time to untrain my brain that I should protect myself with my arms and body language and take up less space. 

Hope that helps!
The first name that came to mind with your photo was Aiden. Are you specifically asking about masculine ways to present, as opposed to something only you are aware of, like packing? I'm not clear on your desired end result given that you're also trying to avoid conflict with your anti family members.

Are you able to purchase whatever items you want?
For names, maybe Jacob, or Darren?
that was absolutely awesome advice, thank you so much. I never really sat inwards as a kid because I was always very tomboyish and my parents always had to remind me to sit like a lady, to which I replied ""I am not a lady."" the walking tips is something I never thought of, and the fair ideas! I have a male cis friend that does low ponytails and i never even thought of it! right now I have a small checkered backpack I carry around cause I h a t e purses. so here's hoping I can make some of these changes! thank you so much! much love <3
Thanks for your reply! I'm trying to find some more masculine ways to dress/act, that wouldn't cause conflict? Not really to be honest. The only reason I'm getting a binder is that my internet friend is getting me one when I'm a month clean. My family is a bit stretched financially right now but soon we're getting more money with my dad's disability check from the army, and most people won't hire me yet, as I'm 14, nor do I have time for work. So really I've been keeping cash and saving it when they give me money, but they haven't recently so I'm out of money right now.

why are binders so expensive!?	"i’m a non binary lesbian from india and i’ve been in need of a safe binder for a year now. i don’t feel like going out, meeting people, playing sports,etc. because of how my chest looks. i hate it. i tried applying for a free binder but it’s gonna take 3-4 years for that to arrive. furthermore, i was considering buying one but they’re extremely expensive and considering that one usd is about 80 indian rupees makes it so crazy that i could never and on top of that i’d have to pay customs and shipping charges which really sucks. I AM SO MAD 

tldr- i need a safe binder but it’s too expensive"	"Honestly, having breasts is expensive. Bras are expensive, the larger the breast, the more expensive the bra (and the more frequently you have to but them). Getting rid of breasts is expensive and the risk of breast cancer is,, expensive.
funny you posted this, I just donated my binder a couple weeks ago since I no longer need it (got a breast reduction.)

Not sure what your size is but sometimes before I got surgery I'd use tight sports bras & double up on them. 

Good luck.
I was going to throw my old binder to the trash bin but I can donate if you want is an M of gcb2 the long one in black. It's worn out and it is practically an L thanks to the use. I live in Europe so I don't know how much it can cost to send it and how long to arrive but if you want it you can have it.
The main job of breasts is produce milks and feeding babies right? Why don't it just enlarge only when we get pregnant, otherwise it's just a useless bump that we'll even get shamed and sexualized at worst?"	t4kvkk	NonBinary	9	1.0	2022-03-01 22:56:45
Am I overreacting?	I feel so sad, me and my mom were talking and then she mentioned Courtney Stodden (who was relevent to the conversation, this was not a random mention) and she said “that girl” because she forgot their name so that’s why she said that girl and I corrected her saying “Courtney is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns” and she tried to say I was mad at her for not knowing that when all I did was correct her on their correct pronouns and that they’re not a girl. I did not show anger I was calm and then she said it was hard to remember that stuff when you “have a lot going on” yeah when it doesn’t affect you and you don’t have to give two shits about people who aren’t like YOU, I thought I could be open with her and all she did was accuse me of being angry. Yes it CAN be hard to remember someone’s identity BUT that doesn’t mean don’t TRY. Is it going to be this freaking hard when it’s your own child’s identity? These things make me not want to come out to her, am I overreacting for feeling upset by this interaction or is she the problem here?	"[deleted]
No she never acts this way over corrections in general, I corrected her before about still saying “she” when speaking about a trans girl (or any trans person for that matter) in the past tense and not to use “he” and she said ok correcting herself. I have no idea why she is acting like this now, I keep getting whiplash from her sometimes I get the vibe that she is not queerphobic but then other times I question that."	szx9fz	NonBinary	8	1.0	2022-02-24 00:54:51
My NB friend wants me to use they/them pronouns for their dog	"I’m using my throwaway and on mobile so I apologize is the format is weird. (This is NOT a shitpost). I was going to post this on AITA but I want a non-biased opinion so here I am.

I’m a cis female and my friend is NB. It was confusing to me at first but I’ve grown to accept and love them for who they are. I’m really close with this person but something happened the other day that made me think of them differently. I was at their house the other day and I was playing with their dog and said “good boy”. My friend told me that they use non binary pronouns for their dog. I thought they were kidding and gave them a look and laughed. They were serious. I told them that’s ridiculous and they were pretty mad/offended for a bit which made the rest of the day pretty awkward. Am I a jerk for thinking that’s ridiculous?

UPDATE: I’ve read your responses. On both NB and AITA. I have responded to some comments on both subs and I may have contradicted myself. I just want to clarify how I feel now that I have read all the responses and have a chance to think. I still think the whole dog thing is silly. I just can’t change my mind about that. But I will admit that I’m not being sensitive towards my friend. It didn’t occur to me that using gender neutral pronouns toward their pet could be a coping mechanism. Or a way to feel less lonely (they’re the only NB person in our area that I know of.) Like I’ve mentioned in a few responses, I’m very new to this whole world of non binary genders. I’ll admit, I do misgender my friend sometimes. But not to be cruel, simply because I’m still getting used to it and it’s a natural way of speaking for me. I’ve actually had to backspace numerous times because I kept misgendering them while typing responses. I’m still learning and I’m willing to continue learning. I sincerely apologize if I have offended anyone with my lack of understanding. My intention is NEVER to offend anyone. My friend means more to me than this incident. While we still disagree on certain things, they as a person mean more to me than my opinion. I’m going to apologize to them as soon as I can figure out exactly how I should word it. Thank you all for the insight and I hope I’m still welcome on this sub because I’m truly interested in learning to be more open minded. I hope you all have a wonderful day."	"The dog isn't gonna give a shit either way, so why not appease the person that does give a shit about said dog
This sounds like it's a coping mechanism for the person--they may feel trapped and suffocated by society's insistence that all things have a strict binary gender, and are trying to create a space where they can escape that feeling. Or maybe they just don't think we should apply genders to animals who have no concept of gender. But at any rate, the dog doesn't care, and your friend does. What do you lose by going along with something that makes your friend happy?
Yeah. It's a dog dude. A. Dog. If the owner wants you to call the dog like that, so be it. Don't get angry over a.... Dog.
Soooo, for a while during the times I was figuring out what the heck my gender was, I spent a lot of mental and emotional energy in queer and trans circles. My body was gendered by the world, my parents, my friends growing up. Everyone made (and makes) assumptions about what part of my brain is like based on what I looked like as I grew up. Note, this is partly the social aspect of dysphoria, not really touching on the other pieces.

For a while, dealing with how uncomfortable, and downright angry, this made me feel was very difficult. I had no control, I had very little power. The best I could do was confuse people and as liberating as that was, others who thought they knew what I was would step in and exert their own power over the situation to place me back in an incorrect box. 

I had a cat, my childhood cat, probably at the time the closest and more reassuring being in my life. Being able to abstract that I myself was being gendered incorrectly and that we use our binary gender system to refer to beings that have no nuanced communication about self-identity, I decided I would stop gendering my cat. I had influence & control over this (for my own references to my cat) in a way that let me feel less like the world was spinning away from me without a chance for me to even breathe.

Eventually, I stopped. Nobody else hopped on the wagon, partly because they were never invited to, I never felt comfortable enough with anyone in my life to talk to them about it, unlike your friend who either trusts you enough or sees it as a low enough risk. It was just another failure at being able to take some of the rigid binary system out of my life. Cis gender norms are literally inescapable even in my own home if someone is going to come in and throw gender identities on things and animals that have no mental gender id or communication path.

What does it hurt to respect your friend’s wishes? Why is your friend asking you to do this? What does it mean to your friend if you acquiesce? If you refuse? It’s a dog, your friend’s dog. There is literally no way to get in the dog’s head and ask them what their preferred pronouns are, and if you could they would go ?????? Much like you’re doing. This isn’t about the dog, this is about your relationship with your friend, and what acknowledgement they need from you right now at this time.
I'm not gunna lie.. I've always thought people who were really insistent on their pets' ""correct"" genders are kind of odd.

If it were me I'd just go with it, but if it weirds you out that much, maybe y'all aren't compatible as friends?
YTA. I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the dog has a penis which is why ""good boy"" was used. It's that connection of gender with sex that's nasty. I feel like you wouldn't have this issue if your friend had said ""actually, she's a girl,"" it's only really when nonbinary gender is involved that people get to thinking it's ridiculous.

I also get annoyed when people gender my animals or make decisions about my animals around me, so I get where they're coming from.
I prefer to use gender neutral terms for all animals as much as I can, and it makes me extremely uncomfortable to hear people using gendered terms for animals. This is because sex doesn't determine gender. I don't really think animals have gender, of they do there's not really any way to tell without their minds being developed enough for communication. HOWEVER, with that said there's nothing technically wrong with refering to animals with gendered terms, since everyone's so used to it and gendered terms also don't equate to gender. As long as you don't actually believe sex is gender you can do whatever. 
HOWEVER again, whether you agree with your friend and I or not is actually irrelevant to the question of 'was I a jerk?', because whether you were correct or incorrect, you were a jerk. There's never any reason to call someone else's beliefs ridiculous unless it's genuinely hurting someone else, especially if it's about a topic that you don't understand as well as they do. You should have taken the time to understand their veiwpoint before putting them down for it.
I mean it's kinda strange, but it probabally not take mich effort, and it sounds like your friend may be using this as a coping mechanism.
Something to consider: do you have a problem with people using it pronouns with animals? That is gender neutral as well.

I get that and I’m not judging them, I just don’t want to be policed for not using they/them pronouns for their pet.
I don’t know who you’re referring to, but I’m not the one who’s angry. My friend is.
Amen to this, a million times amen. I'm sorry that you have such pond scum surrounding you, I hope you find some supportive and respectful people soon.
No I don’t have a problem with saying “it”. That’s typically used when you don’t know the sex of the animal. My friend however, is strictly they/them for their dog.
I'm gonna be frank here--you can say that you're not judging them, but at the end of the day, asking you to use they/them for their dog is a 100% reasonable request. If you'd called their dog ""good boy"" and they were like ""actually, she's a girl"" you would have switched pronouns right away, and you certainly wouldn't have gotten angry about it. It would have just been one more piece of information about the dog. This is why your friend got upset, and I honestly don't blame them. Whether you meant it this way or not, your reaction to being asked to use they/them pronouns for the dog showed your friend that you think they/them pronouns are not equal to she/her or he/him pronouns, that you think being asked to use ""they'd/them"" pronouns in general  a burden or, in your own words, ""ridiculous"". You also showed your friend that you place a lot of value on unnecessary binary gendering of things like dogs that don't have a concept of gender and don't care how you gender them. I can guarantee you that your friend has been hurt by this practice of projecting strict gender identities into everything all the time. If you want assurance that you're not being a jerk, you need to take a step back and think about how your friend feels, as a trans person living in a painfully cis binary society. You need to think about how your reaction to their reasonable request hurt them, and when you apologize you need to let them know that you understand how your words were hurtful, regardless of your intentions. Be aware that this could be a big deal to your friend, that your insistence on projecting a binary gender onto their dog very well may have opened old wounds about people projecting binary genders into them. I'd also like to point out that you are the one policing a dog's gender by calling them ""he"" after you've been asked not to. It's not difficult to replace ""good boy"" with ""good pup"". As a closing note, I use they/them pronouns, and I've answered your questions as I would if you were my friend.
You can't be 'policed' over any pronouns that aren't your own, because any pronouns that aren't your own aren't up to you to decide.
I don’t really think it’s your call to make. If the owner wants you to use they/them for their pet, use they/them for their pet. It might be hard to make the switch, but it’ll be better for your friendship in the long run
You are a rockstar
You were angry enough to call them ridiculous over somethig that's pretty important to them.
Well I thank you for being respectful and making valid points without attacking me. I do disagree, but I respect my friend enough to just put my opinion aside to make them happy. In the end, they mean more to me than this incident. I probably do owe them an apology simply because I’m still learning about this whole world of non binary genders and I may have been pretty close minded. I still think the dog thing is a bit silly, but like I said, I respect my friend enough to get over it.
Last time I checked, the fucking DOG didn’t choose they/them pronouns. They’re not my friend’s pronouns to police either, according to your logic.
It wasn’t out of anger at all, it was out of disbelief
I think the fact that you decided to post on /r/NonBinary even though you received a lot of responses on /r/AITA shows a willingness to understand and learn :)
Seriously? I never said we'd be misgendering the dog or hurting the dog's feelings, I said we'd be hurting your friend's feelings and disregarding their current struggle. The dog isn't in the equation, the question is how respect you have for your friend. Considering how hostile you're being, I would personally rethink being your friend.
Those are still pretty nasty and hurtful things to say-this is not me trying to make you feel bad, I just feel like no one is sensitive to other people and how their words can be hurtful, and it's always important to be aware of stuff like that.
I posted on both subs to get all different opinions from all different people. I’d say the responses were pretty 50/50. Like I said earlier, I still stand by my opinion on the whole dog thing. But it didn’t occur to me that my friend is probably doing this for themselves (or themself? Still learning.) It took me a long time to understand this whole non binary thing. To be honest, I still struggle with it, but I’m really trying. I’ve accidentally misgendered them countless times. But it doesn’t mean that I don’t care. I’m still getting used to it. I actually had to backspace a bunch of times while replying to this because I kept misgendering them. Even though I might sound contradictory to some of my responses on both subs, I’m starting to realize this isn’t about me, it’s about my friend, who I care about so much. All that really matters to me is that they’re happy despite my opinion."	bot5i9	NonBinary	7	0.77	2019-05-15 04:12:09
Upset at work	"Today a coworker told me that she wouldn’t use “they/them” pronouns for people.
Now she thinks I’m mad at her, and she’s talking crap about me.
I’m not mad. I cut her out as a friend as soon as she said that.
Now I’m just upset that I don’t feel safe at work.
Upset that my LGBTQ+ customers might not feel safe.

I use “he/him” pronouns. What if she stops using my pronouns because she’s mad? I’m sick of feeling like the problem.
