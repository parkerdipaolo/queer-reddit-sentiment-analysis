"Being pigeon holed in the middle of ""the pipeline"" makes me sad so I made a low-effot edit to cheer myself up :)"		"Lowkey even though this is meant to be a meme, I can't think of anything that more accurately describes my vision for myself 😂.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

Non-binary people don't owe anyone androgyny; nobody is owed a gender presentation.

""It's not the colour I don't like, it's the obligation. And I don't have an obligation to anyone but myself"" - she/her/hers lyric
I love this. Showcases different enbies out there. Thank you for the edit.
Funny thing is that it can go from right to left, left to right, or any order you can think of. Enbies'll enby haha

I've been very comfortable from the middle to the right. Figuring out the middle to the left for myself at the moment without dying on the inside from body dysphoria. It's so fun when you want to wear a normal shirt and pants but you get horribly dysphoric feeling like an off-brand michelin man instead :(( Somehow my body related dysphoria is the worst out of all
God I wish I could pull off all those looks like they do!
Where's the representation of people that are so far outside the gender binary it's almost terrifying?
Wait, I was supposed to do shorts & thigh highs *BEFORE* a mini skirt?
I’m the one with the pronouns they/them😂
This is the only time I'll describe myself as far right
I love that, thank you!
You can be nonbinary and hot AF. No gender has a monopoly on attractiveness or sexy clothings lol
You know, I never complained about this before but why does only the one on the far left have glasses, just because most of my style of being is more aligned with the second person. Doesn't mean my eyesight is suddenly cured.
Hi yes I’m currently somewhere between they/them and they/them on the pipeline. 10/10 very accurate.
I’m between middle/left wanting to be middle/right at most
All are valid!! Gender fluid here and I'm no less nonbinary being distinctly more masc or femme one day to the next, and on that same note if you're more distinctly masc or femme and nonbinary, you are still valid no matter how you rock it. No one can change that except you. 

I look forward to encountering more people in my day to day who I learn are nonbinary and present distinctly more masc/femme. It'll really open up the field on making sure to not assume pronouns. (I'm so used to ""she"" I respond to it and flow with it, but as time goes by it holds less value for me, so I deeply look forward to everyone just using ""they"" until they know, if I may ever see that in my life.)

Repeat after me: We owe NO ONE androgyny to be nonbinary. We just ARE nonbinary. <3
Me as a apora-fluid-xeno gender enby (i am all of them)
LOVE THIS I’ve personally been grappling with my identity and my presentation lately as if I owe people a specific presentation. This is amazing validation 🥹
I’m genderfluid so my life is all the pipelines I guess
This is a meme but this is happening to me right now.
I want to be the middle one so bad, that’s my goal is to feel as perfect as I can in my own body.
I just wanna be dumb thicc
I want to become the one on the right except I allow both she/her and they/them. I'm not in an environment where I can come out yet.
I love this so much 😭
In before the he/him he/him he/him edit and the she/her she/her she/her edit
There and back again. I aspire to be able to hit every point of this spectrum whenever I want.
I am all of these
Me speedrunning right to left in 6 months lol
whats the pipeline?
I can say from experience that it also works in reverse.
I’m all of the above, thanks
This is nice. I present as more femme, just because I don't... put effort into myself much. I also just naturally look more femme. I get misgendered a lot, and because I don't look androgynous, I feel like shit. I feel like I get judged by other non-binary people for not appearing more gender neutral.

Idk
I’d probably be second from left. Or at least that’s where I’d want to be
I loooooove this :'))))
Middle of the pipeline is Nightwing.  I'll take it.
Tag yourself I’m they/them 🤩🤩
Yes! Thank you! Gender identity does not determine aethstetic! So many people end up sinking a lot of time and money into trying to look a certain way just because of what people say non-binary ""looks like"". If you're comfortable with your appearance, cool! If not, change. Thats all the requirements.

Good meme.
I love this so much! I’m getting so much of the androgyny bs right now and it’s been exhausting trying to remind people that I can present however I want to fit how I feel at the moment.
last one is me asf, haha
Second to the left or second to the right is ideal
Um, I'll have the number two body, please 🥺
Pigeon
not our fault all the coolest clothes are labeled ""female""
i want to flow between the middle three please
When I started dressing more masculine it made me girlier
OP may think it was low-effort, but this meme is S-Tier knowledge
How’d they get all that ass though
Yup. Honestly I'm going for the second from the left, but am the second from the right.
I fluctuate between the last three (And I guess technically the first one, but that’s only because not everyone in my life would be accepting 😔).
why are all of them so hot :')
Thank you
What does pigeon hole mean? 
I saw it in a lyric before, and I couldn't find the meaning
Tbh I'm the 3rd or 4th one, just depends on the day.
i’m on the third if i can make it to the 4th i’ll be so happy
WHY CANT I BE ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME!! FUCK NOW IM CRYING AGGGGHGHGHGHG
Honestly this is me with he/him
This pipeline is the large hadron collider for me - it's a loop and particles travel the whole way across the spectrum. I dont know anything about particle accelerators, but if I'm right it's a lot like this.
 I needed this, thank you 🥰🥰
I know this is supposed to be wholesome, but am I the only one who would smash everyone of those drawings/humans/characters/however that works :) It’s just…they’re all so hot and all so transition goals, I swear.
Somehow I’m all of them
oh look it's me
i fell in the pipeline

and im not getting out
[deleted]
Me
What's the pipeline?
Wow. That's all I can say. Wow.
Hold up mom let me go get them’s hat
I need this fr
Good for them
Just need this the other way
me.jpg
Tbh this is just my lookbook.
I LOVE THAT SO MUCH
Other way for me
yea pretty much
Guys I don’t mean to bring drama into this but I would seriously recommend not using this image for a meme anymore. Pretty sure that the creator draws nsfw of characters who are minors and shit like that.
that one moment when you want to be the 3rd and 5th person at the same time
What hairstyle is the second one? Because I need it immediately
I posted a transmasc version I saw of this in a different subreddit. But as someone who uses any pronouns and is nonbinary I like this one too lol 🥰
This is definitely my pipeline hahaha
just like me fr fr
Im constantly fluctuating between left and right as a genderfluid person lol
I love this SO much but I've been searching desperately for the original. Do you have it by chance? Pretty sure the one all the way on the right had a speech bubble that said ""teehee I'm such a pretty girl."" I was trying to describe the original yo a friend a while back and he just wasn't getting it
I'd stop at the 3rd one looks so hawt 😫
I'd stop at the 3rd one looks so hawt 😫
God. I think I belong in this sub
Me a Pansexual: Yes to all  this BEISKSGDSOSHEHEHDHEISKK 😋😙🥰😍😘🤩😛😜🤪😝🥵😭😩😖😣😫😈👿
This pipeline is the only time I’m ever far-right but yes
Ok but this is actually more accurate lol
Also where did they suddenly get that ass
Why is the middle one just a thiccer version of the middle-left one?
What top is the they/them on the far right wearing? Asking for a friend
Nice. I'd also love to see this exact graphic but with he/him and she/her under each as well (or just a one for all ""she/he/they"" under each). Nonbinary people don't owe cis society any specific pronoun or changed pronouns. I'm Nonbinary and use he/him. Use what feels good to you, just like appear/wear what feels good to you.
Life goals
Slayy (also me too)
Same honestly! The ability to be all at any time you want
For real! And I'm not even exaggerating when I say I pretty much have every outfit in this picture. The one in the middle is 200% me, though: I'm always checking to see how my ass looks in my pants 😅
This is what I want for myself more than anything ☺️
I feel this too!!!
Aaa I love she/her/hers, jewel of a lyric there.
&#x200B;

 She/her/hers is amazing!
What song is that from specifically? I’ve looked on google and Spotify but can’t seem to find it
aaaa same 🥲
Me too 😭
I tried to upload it but the files corrupted every time.
Instructions unclear, send more cute clothes.
Omg same
💀
Or you can be like me, an unattractive af enby 😎
Lol didn't even notice. Maybe they wear contacts for the others.
Maybe they’re reading glasses 💀
Me too!
People post this meme a lot in trans subs where it's he/him he/they they/them she/they she/her from left to right and it always annoys me because a) they/them isn't just the middle step between male and female, and b) any of those figures could be they/them.

Work smarter not harder.
It means when someone has a very narrow idea about something and refuses to change their mind.
Cute or cute, got it.
Did you bring snacks?
Don't sexualise us you dirty fuck
Not all enbies have dicks, ya dick. Any, or all, of those can be nonbinary and have vaginas. The whole point is presentation != genitalia.
Check out ""they/them"" by Atlas. Holy fuck, they're *chef's kiss*
Nvr Pass
fuck, the computer is revealing our true forms
Wow really😲
I'm sure that's just the societal self-hatred indoctrinated deep in your brain talking.
Me three!
oh weird! strangely i havent seen that meme, but then again I don't really look at the memes in the subreddits. thats super odd though.... seems like something people who are just entering the community would post and agree with, mostly because all the bad stereotypes of that ""pipeline"" that goes around. thanks for informing me :)
To live in, yes. I am afab with a big bust and would loooove to have a flat chest. I just bought my first binder and now I am waiting for it to get here :D
Tysm
Aww ty you're so sweet 🥰
no

i forgor
For my SO 

Not sexualizing you. Not even sexualizing the pic. 

Me and my SO call their parts a dick. And I hope you Don't gatekeep others from doing the same
 I'm not.
My bad I have a non-binary SO call their stuff a dick. Reminded me of them. Was screenshotting it to them.
Thanks!
I don't care what folk call their parts , you came on to the nonbinary sub and thought it be a good idea to comment that on a picture about how nonbinary folk can look any way they want.  So yea it came off as fetishing nonbinary folk and wasn't what you claimed in your first reply which I didn't respond to."	wmh779	NonBinary	4079	1.0	2022-08-12 09:46:11
It makes me sad that the cis gay male community can still be unsupportive to their queer siblings, although obviously this can be a toxic app		"You're a bigot Harry.
I knew a gay man that would run around saying non-binary people don’t exist. You would think that him being gay he would be an ally to all LGBT people, but I guess it doesn’t work that way.
I mean tbf I have a lot of bad experiences with cis gay men in queer spaces as well. They're usually the one announcing ""ladies and gentlemen"" and calling me ""girl"" even with my tittieless chest/top surgery scars out. So yknow, in my personal experience, sadly, it's not just a grindr issue.
This kind of garbage on the dating/social apps is always kind of confronting in the moment, but the optimist in me usually is glad to know who to block or avoid. Obviously, it’s quite toxic and damaging but I don’t know how else to process it. 

I’m sorry you had to endure this nasty interaction and hope it didn’t derail your day too much.
That app is not good for the mind, body, or spirit. They literally went out of their way to inflict mental harm to you. Even reporting the behavior, they won’t do anything.
Because ""they"" is such a special brand new pronoun thats never been used before apparently
Yikes.
""I'm helping people who want me dead push back my rights! I'm the voice of sensibility! 🤡""
harry came from the 16th century it seems

&#x200B;

edit: hold up, seems im mistaken, this dudes using singular you, hes just an asshole
Sorry you had to deal with that. How the fuck is ""they"" a ""special"" pronoun? It's just a pronoun!
I deleted Grindr 10 years ago when some dude couldn’t get over a MAN having PURPLE HAIR. Wonder how that self-hating gay would react to my gel nails and high heeled boots. Grindr brings out the absolute worst in the gay community.
I have had super good luck on grindr, but I am absolutely fast and loose with that block button. I think it might depend on your age too. I feel like older ish (30's and 40's, basically not young adults) guys are more likely not to engage if something doesn't tickle their fancy (like pronouns, gender, weight, ethnicity).
These kids will pop on, only to be rude (or yanno, sexist, racist or the like).
I just got in an argument with a cis lesbian coworker about not respecting pronouns the other day. Just being queer doesn't erase bigotry unfortunately.
Some of the gay community has been very toxic to trans people for some time now.

It's a shame. I'm 46, I remember the 70s, the aids crisis, how the gay community was treated.

So many young gays have become just as bad as the homophobes their predecessors dealt with. Including at stonewall.
Men can be toxic, gay men can be toxic, gay men on grinder are extra toxic. Block back, move on
Cis gays are NOTORIOUS for being transphobic.  It's so incredibly baffling.
You're an asshole Harry
sucks that if you feel like you put your pronouns on your profile you'll turn some people off,  


but like, if that turns you off, maybe I don't want you messaging me anyway  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
The idea is some sort of traitorous thing I guess. I mean he does have the right to not go out with an enby person. But ""special pronoun"" that's just insulting.
Good thing this guy made himself known first so you didn't have to waste any time, sorry you had to deal with this shit
Grindr is a cesspool, wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
[deleted]
Dude I feel you. My lesbian mom is a TERF, believes bisexuals don't exist, refuses to accept queer as a positive  label, and believes that asexuals are just fooling themselves and that they better be okay with their husbands (insists they're not LGBT) screwing around on them. Needless to say, she's an abusive dick outside of that, and I don't associate with her. But it definitely sucks to feel betrayed by a part of the community that is supposed to accept you.
Grindr is a toxic place. It did nothing but make me feel like my body is all I'm good for and that people fetishizing me was okay. Never going back on there!
Is it just me, or is it worse in queer spaces sometimes? Like if they don't understand why someone identifies the way they do, then that person is ""ruining the cause""

It feels like your older sibling being like: ""shut up, mom will never take us seriously if you say that!""
And I'm here like: ""mom/authority figures/society has a lot they don't take seriously but they should...""
Hope you blocked him first! Tbh with you though I haven't ever received abuse on grindr... In fact I get far more attention as a girl / non binary than I did as a boy! But it does rule some people out from fancying me now as they're really only into men, which is fine! 

Sorry you encountered an idiot on there, hope they're not representative of everyone!
It would have cost him nothing to say nothing. There’s something deeply wrong with people like him.
I used to have lgbt friends that would say genderfluid or nonbinary aren’t valid. One of them was a trans male who has said non-binary and genderfluid people want to be like the trans people so bad and that there’s no such thing. Obviously I cut ties with that group.
Oh fuck. That's awful. The only good thing is they've self-selected themselves as not your love. You matter. 

I am non-binary trans and I started grindr about a week ago. Holy cow that app is a lot
well it’s a good thing they blocked you then, the trash just took itself out. you don’t deserve that kind of negativity in your life.
Grindr is a cesspit. Frankly, cis gay men are the most transphobic and enbyphobic demographic I've ever had to deal with bar none. I just steer clear of them at this point.

Like this dude could've just blocked you and moved on. There was literally no reason to be petty and antagonistic. Alas, that's how many cis gay men are for whatever reason.
Hypocrisy abound in social media… whoop de frickin doo. Sadly this isn’t a surprise, and it’s sadder that it exists in the first place. Also which app is this from?
I hope you blocked this person first
I cannot even date cis gay men because I look too naturally androgynous to them. There are many toxic people in that community sadly. For me it’s incredibly lonely existence as a non-binary person. I’m primarily attracted to masculine presenting people. The bulk being cis men. That is not an easy dating world to navigate. Especially with this heteronormative society oppressing men’s ability to explore their sexuality and feminine side.
I think a lot of us tend to have a feeling of solidarity with others in the queer community. We are all treated badly, so we should all have some empathy, right? No. We are all individuals, and as individuals, we can be kind, or we can be complete and total assholes. I still get upset sometimes when people who I feel should be allies aren't. However, I try to remind myself that in the same way that X group is not all evil, Y group isn't all good. It still sucks, though.
I think someone needs to do their research on Stonewall
Bruh it's wild. My roommate is a cis gay male and lowkey when I came out to him, he was kind of like rude about his questioning and then like now I feel like I'm having a competition with him on my changes since I started T. Like sorry i got good hair genetics jfc
cis gay men, especially white cis gay men, are one of the most toxic groups around.
It's such BS that even the queer community isn't accepting of other parts of the queer community... sigh.
Some of the worst and most virulent bigotry I've seen in recent years has come at the hands of cis gay men. I don't know what's going on with them but they seem to have some cultural Issues they need to fucking work on.
& he thought he ate…just sad
Grindr is shit so I’m not surprised sadly
How fucking rude..
Some people need to learn a thing or two about solidarity...
Harry is like a bullet that dodges itself for you. very helpful of him
This is such projecting lmao. Even many gay men are more fluid than they like to admit to themselves, but because society finally accepts (white) cis gay men as essentially on the same social step as white women, it’s hard for some older cis gay men to risk breaking out of their safe little misogynist bubble. 

One of my best friends for over a decade has always been a self-proclaimed, out and proud, gay man. And he used to do the whole bullshit about “ewwww vaginas are so gross!” Then he fell in love with a trans-masc enby. And he quickly realized that yes, he is a gay man, but his gayness is NOT based in cis/white/patriarchal ideals. He discovered that being gay did not exclude non-binary folks from his attraction. And he became 1000x more understanding and tolerant.
OH MY GOD how can that b@$#@rd put a smiley face after that?
sorry you went through this :(   


toxic masculinity and bigotry can really be found everywhere :( 

&#x200B;

much love <3
Sometimes the most toxic people are part of the LGBT community, it's sad
The internalized homophobia , ableism, and self hatred are strong with this one.
'Not if I block you first ❤️' *block* 

He doesn't deserve your (or anyone else's time.) This is why I don't like cis gay spaces tbh.
Apps like grindr, scruff, and growlr; despite queerbaiting us to be on their platforms (*to lessen public critism, maintaining the mirage of NB/Trans acceptance, by allowing us a chance to include our gender identities on our profiles; if we so choose*) are cesspools of toxic masculinity and really shitty people in general.

I know it hurts at first, but remember, if your taking the hookup app route to meet people, expect a *hookup app* experience from it.

Even Tinder can be transphobic, at times.. perhaps check out Taimi; obviously still shitty people there too, but at least it's a space designed for everyone in the lgbt+ community.

You'll find cis and trans enbyphobes there as anywhere else, but people are at least nicer about rejecting you for not being in the cishet side of things.
My favorite is this one time when someone messaged me saying, “Do you smell like a woman?” Honestly was impressed with just how problematic 6 words could be.
I am stunned at how discriminatory people can be. 😤 Enbys are special and perfect and should be protected 😭
Since coming out I’ve notice a lot of general transphobia and specific non-binary phobia idk what to call it. It’s really disgusting and disheartening. I expect to hear this shit from the cishets but people from our own community pushing us out and calling us derogatory names
Some cis gays got that ""I got what I wanted out of the lgbt+ movement, so yall can suck a dick"" energy
What an overconfident prick, clearly compensating lmfao
It's the :) at the end that really gets me. It feels so petty.
What a goddamn asshole shithead. >:(
the little :\]
What a dick.
Assholes exist in every group just like good people do to
yes, as a gay transmasc enby i do find some cis gay men attractive. yes, as a gay transmasc enby do i find cis gay men confusing and kind of arrogant sometimes. we exist
Despite being AMAB socialized/growing up/accessing queerness among and through the lens of gay male culture I find that cis gay men are just… the WORST. (I understand “not all gay men” before anyone bites my head off) The blatant uninterrogated transphobia among cis gay men is staggering. I wish I could say interactions like this are the outlier but in my experience they’re closer to being the rule
Wtf
when i used grindr no one ever said anything like that to me, but they did ask whether i was a guy or a girl and what it means to be trans. and i was like ""im not gonna explain this to you"". i guess i lucked out maybe?
This has happened to me so many times on grindr. It’s a shithole
Well, sometimes the trash takes itself out. You now know they’re bigots before getting emotionally attached.
“I’m literally just saying it’s cool to call me either of these pronouns.”

“Omg you fucking snowflakes just have to be so complicated and difficult all of the time with your 17 pronouns and 42 alternate labels lmao It’s simply impossible not to accidentally trigger you guys these days”
Gotta say, I hope you blocked him first.
How did cis straight guys end up being some of the most supportive people in my province? Literally the most supportive person of me aside from my trans friends have all been cis straight guys and I love them like family because the things they say mean so much cos I know they show so much love and support for who I am dispite not having any way to fully understand it
I see this a lot with older gay folks. I'm friends with a few from my synagogue, and they don't believe in nonbinary/trans anything. I was told once that ""women are women and men are men, you can't change that"", by an elderly gay woman.

Seeing it in our generations is worse. You'd think they'd be more accepting than these old farts.
This is something I will seriously never understand. This is just like the hate on individuals that identify as Bi. They are judged within their community
That harry sadly is not harry styles :(
There's a more than zero chance that this person is actually straight and looking to harass queer people on Grindr.
Real question, why are pronouns important for y'all?
I mean i literally don't care and I'm having a hard time understanding.
[removed]
Dox them
That person’s question implies you can unintentionally ascribe pronouns to yourself and that just makes no sense. Yeah I accidentally go by she/they??
This is why I am so big on supporting the trans and nonbinary community. It's soo overran by cis gay white men!
""That's fine, you were not worth my time anyways. I'm glad the trash took itself out ;)""

Fuck transphobes and enbyphobes. You deserve better, my liege.
Toxic people thrive on apps like that, they are cowards who hide behind a keyboard.
wait did he mean if you were faking he would block u tho? i’m confused
Avoid online dating. People intentions are so selfish there.
Very cruel of that person, sorry you head to deal with that
Gay cis men are just a teeny little bit less problematic than straight cis men. Change my mind.
I mean people literally put ""no blacks, no asians, no fems, no etc..."" On there 🤦🏼‍♂️🙄😒 what do you expect? And it's been normalized as in there is absolutely nothing fundamentally wrong and fucked up with it! 😱😰😒🤦🏼‍♂️🙄.
My uncle is the same way he hates anyone that doesn't identify as male or female. He told me that there's only two genders male and female nothing else. Hurt me to hear that coming from a gay cis male. Like I thought this community was supportive. He said LGBT was what it should be and that LGBTQ+ was stupid.
i absolutely hate to see this. you'd think lgbtq+ people wouldn't be lgbtq+phobic but noooo...

gays and lesbians hate bis;
bis hate pans;
pans hate omnis;
omnis hate polys;
everyone hates aces and aros;
everyone hates trans people;
binary trans people hate non-binary people;
and *EVERYBODY* hates xenogenders and neopronoun users...
Definitely losing nothing with their absence.
""don't bother."" --> block him first.
That's sad. Sorry, fam
I always say at the end of the day, cis gay men are still cis men ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯
Conservative gay men are more common than you might think
What I don't get is why people like this waste their own and the other person's time by engaging in this worthless little dialogues. There are millions of people out there who don't agree with you on a number of subjects. If you can already tell from their profile that they are not your kind of people why not simply leave them alone, for the sake of everyone involved?
The F*** Kinda Person Does This? Like, Legit, What Is Wrong With Them?
Trolls have a miserable life, that's why they do it. Never forget that. You win even by saying nothing.
😂😂
I'm a whot?!
""Your a unit of power harry""

""I'm a watt?""
Unrelated but this would make a good anti JKR hashtag on Twitter
Say you were abused for being different in one conversation
BAHAHAHA
There are even binary trans ppl who say we don't exist and are just confused. It makes me so sad that even among trans siblings we can't be fully sure we are safe.
There always be asshole in our community :

Just on the Bi side of thing:

Most of the gay people I have interact with, No problem....

A vocal minority of them : ""Bisexuality don't exist"", ""your gay ,just not assuming....""

So I don't think this kind of Jerk is ready to understand Non binarity....
[deleted]
I knew a gay TRANS man who used to go around saying NB people were trenders and hurting the community. Hes much better now....but yeah
I actually did make a sweatshirt in response to people saying non-binary people don’t exist - [Yes…they’re real](https://imgur.com/a/E8BqVCH)
A lot of gay men sympathize with LGB Alliance
I've heard binary trans people saying genderfluid and non-binary people don't exist because your gender can't switch between more identities and you also cant identify as neither; they said you're either male or female and those \[genderfluid, non-binary, agender, etc\] are nothing but a joke to the community and if you identify like this you're actually transphobic.  
You'd expect a trans person would be supportive to all trans\* identities but nope.
People in marginalized groups can very much also be arseholes and bigots. Marginalized people are people, after all. And social hierarchies run on people on the middle rungs of power and acceptance actively participating in upholding the hierarchies.
I called this out once and a cis gay male told me I was being both misogynistic and homophobic……. :|
(Not op) this is spot on and a very sweet way of thinking about the situation. People can be exhausting.
Yeah they're right nobody uses they. 

I love when these bigots use pronouns to make fun of us for using pronouns.
The smiley at the end increases the yikes by a lot (at least for me)
Seriously? I grew up in the 70s and 80s has he never met a punk or a goth before?
I had the same thought. Like it sucks to be transphobic/biphobic but at least the old cis gays and hets are generally just ignorant and will quietly move on. This dude went out of his way to be nasty like he enjoyed it
I’m only 20 and I’ve had random older guys (30-60) message me and say transphobic shit
Probably thinks he's an expert on special cause he went to a special school.
This is pretty misleading I think, lesbian TERFs are a really prominent strain and terfs make a big deal of trans women “invading lesbian spaces”.
Man I have lesbian moms and I forgot how lucky I am
Jesus Christ, that sucks.
I dont accept slurs as positive labels, myself.

I get really mad when someone expects me to be happy about calling myself a faggot. Its never gonna happen.
A lack of attention.

That applies to both your sentences, actually.
Some are great, and some asked me to clarify bisexual because they dont get it, despite being 40+ years old and out for more than half of their life.
Exactly why I think the community itself isn't... a great idea. No one can agree who belongs in it. Might as well separate and ignore haters 🤷‍♀️
For real! This horrible guy at the bar said ""we dont like lesbians, lesbians are gross"" i told him to speak for himself.
Taimi is honestly the worst experience I've had with apps. Like within minutes of joining I was swarmed by cis male chasers being creepy. Was really gross.
Gay guys where I live are also huge homophobes too so they’re just absolutely fucked
Queer siblings: Block this fucker and move on
No, the other way around sadly.
Yes, it would
Already is, I bet
I’ve had this happen to me. Was told I just didn’t have the confidence to be ‘real trans’
As a trans person, it just boggles my mind. Out of all people, you would think that we would be the most supportive and understanding and accepting of non-binary people. I wish all trans people truly cared for our fellow non-binary siblings ❤️
Ugh, tell me about it! Just a few weeks ago the mod at r/ftm_irl made a post saying that they were banning non-binary people from posting on the sub and claiming that the term ""transmasculine"" is offensive. Personally, I really don't understand why such a huge distinction needs to be made between ""binary trans men"" and ""non-binary trans guys"". There are some transmasculine non-binary people who want to go through HRT and SRS, and there are some binary trans men who don't want to or can't. It all comes down to personal identity at the end of the day.





Also it honestly sucks that even other trans people can't grasp the idea that non-binary doesn't always have to mean agender, since a common retort that I've seen is ""so you claim to not have a gender and yet you identify as male?"", which is an incorrect oversimplification of the non-binary experience.





Anyways sorry for the rant lmao, to anyone reading this I hope you have a nice day!
Honestly, this is why I try to be outspoken about respecting and appreciating you guys. I can't believe other binary trans folk would be so disrespectful when we've been through the exact things you guys are going through. People are pretty cool, but communities keep finding new ways to disappoint :/
You'd think that the LGBT+ community would, as a whole, know not to try and invalidate other people based on who they are or how they feel or who they love. But unfortunately, that's not the case. Just recently I got downvoted and shouted at for being a Christian in r/LGBT despite, you know, the fact that I'm a trans enby who's about as close to being a lesbian as possible as an enby. Honestly the things people can say sometimes, it makes me sick. It's like they don't even realize that, if they said the same things about *literally any other group* they'd get called out as bigots, but because it's against a group they disagree with, they think it's okay.

While not exactly the same as being invalidated as an enby by people who should be allies, it still hurts to have a part of who I am so viciously attacked.
An actual quote from a lesbian who I used to work with: “I don’t believe in bisexuals, they’re just lesbians who are also attracted to men”. Like, I mean, technically yeah…
i once met a guy who explained to me that when a man dates a man, he's gay, and then when he's dating a woman he becomes straight, therefore bisexuality doesn't exist

he also said the articles about bis were ""bisexual propaganda""
You are valid and I hope you have a great day! :)
Ace panromantic enbys unite! Yeah I've seen the same thing. I just stay quiet a lot now.
Ace, grey aromantic/panromantic nonbinary person here. I feel like I always have to be prepared to be told “that doesn’t exist”. Even in LGBT+ spaces. There’s mean people everywhere, unfortunately.
I feel like this is a good place to post a reminder that the LGB Alliance briefly opposed same-sex marriage, until they were called out by *actual* gay rights organisations.
Ew

Imagine calling people transphobic while being transphobic
What in the cis nonsense?
They're idiots
For now on all cis peoples pronouns are just redacted since they cant deal w having them. Instead of 'did you see him yesterday? He went to walmart' itll be ""did you see [RËDÆCTÊDPROÑÔÛN] yesterday? [RËDÆCTÊDPROÑÔÛN] went to walmart'
Aw dang, that sucks. I suppose people are just trash across the board, and I am just lucky.
Was this a Harry Potter joke that just got misread? Cuz I don't get it otherwise and I certainly don't get the downvotes lol
Thanks. I agree. 😊
They have better mods on their than the other apps. 

When it comes to chasers, block and report them for harassment. 

And make it be known you're not ok with them on your profile.

Creeps are everywhere, at least Taimi attracts lgbt friendly people; fetishists or not.

They do allow fetishists as they unfortunately are apart of the trans dating pool; just evade them and you'll be fine.

It beats the harassment and flakiness of the other apps, in consideration of trans acceptance.

Down low creeps with all their secretive baggage aren't as much an issue on Taimi, compared to other cis oriented dating apps.

Also, gotta love the verification process.

I don't fuck with unverified profiles, period.
so did this person end up getting blocked?
It's ridiculous. I literally live as a ""binary"" trans man without going into the full scope of my gender because it's *easier* that way. I wish I had the confidence (or option, really) to live as my true self because being seen as a guy is good enough but not 100% correct.
There is no group, no matter how oppressed, that is immune to becoming oppressors in turn. Once you start seeing pansexual nonbinary people in Hallmark movies, it'll go from ""gay vs trans"" and ""binary trans vs nonbinary"" to ""tier 1 nonbinary vs xenogender"".
[deleted]
Yeah, some people get really pissy and act like every trans person that isn't ""binary just like them"" is a personal slight.
I'm a transmasc nonbinary person! I take T and had top surgery (I'm older than many here, I'm sure, 37)! We exist!!! 😭
What the fuck?? Damn. Thats fucked up and dissapointing.

Edit: damn they even have it in their bio. Thats so fucked.
I'm really sorry you had to experience that, virtual hugs to you!
I... I don't.... How do they not...
One of my best friends in highschool was a lesbian, I am pansexual (called myself bi back then) and she literally said to me ""There are no bisexuals, those are just straight women who are slutty enough to also hit on lesbians"" like what ??? Also, she was hitting on me all the time back then while I wasn't interested lol
that’s what bisexual basically is buddy you’re almost there lol
They're putting chemicals in the YMCA pool water that turn the kids bi!
Lol imagine thinking I don't find everyone attractive just because I'm dating a woman or a man.

I'm currently dating another non binary person, really curious what he'd say about that lol
What the fuck is wrong with those ppl? Do they believe that they actially don't deserve equal rights? So weird...
LGB Alliance is a pretty recent (formed around 2019) “drop the T” organization.
Yeah.... >< I don't get it. Czech Republic (the country I live in) is already really transphobic (not even all sexologists accept non-binary identities; I was denied transition from this reason a few years back... and even binary trans people have to lie to fit into stereotypes of trans).  
So like... specially in a country like this you'd expect some support.
Nope, just me getting brigaded.
Comments of other people's experiences as queer people make me glad that my parents just completely ignore that I'm queer and trans and don't want to talk about it at all.
Yup, transitioning to man, but experience a weird conglomerate amount of genders on the inside.
I will always love my xenogender siblings. But I don't care how bigoted people think I am, I will never accept the xenomorphs and I will die on that hill, game over man
I think this is it.  My father is a binary trans woman, and I personally took a while to accept non-binary people (and even longer to accept myself) because I thought it would somehow hurt or make her look bad.
The worst part is that three new mods were added, and all of them are active on r\truscum... :(
That’s… the hardest self-own I read in a while lmao, I hope she realised the irony of the situation since
Wait sluttiness leads eventually to hitting on other genders? 

How in the hell did they come up with that?
The key is that they're not a gay rights organisation, they're an anti trans organisation hiding behind the gay community. Over their entire history as an organisation (and longer individually for a bunch of their core people) they haven't promoted gay rights or even fought *against* them.
They frequently ally with outspoken anti-LGBT figures and organisations.

I don't doubt for a second that if they somehow managed to get rid of all trans people, they'd turn on the gay community next.
Because the truth is they’re actually a bunch of cishets pulling in the self-hating gays.
And we all know that it's bull :
Bev Jackson say easy debunbkable shit

Science walk with us => Psychologist, Psychiatrist sociologist proove NB existence.

History walk with us => there was trans and black folk at stonewall, whatever she say => It's a fucking historical fact.

So let the stupid be stupid, and try to be an advocate only for people that don't just want to be selective with the Fucking evidence, fact and science.

Queer erasure is real, like bisexual or gay erasure.
Like Bipoc erasure.

We are nothing but new.
That's shitty, too. I mean, on the one hand, it's nice that they didn't think you changed, but to completely ignore a large part of you? **Especially** about you being trans. That's super messed up. You deserve supportive and loving parents. I hope they get better for you.
This is definitely something I’ve fervently wished for sometimes because my mom is absolutely incapable of dropping anything, but it’s no way to live either. Sorry your parents aren’t trying harder to see you.
me too
Jfc
idk, but I wish it were true, then we'd have more pansexuals :D
I requested help from a well-known gay man who runs a well-known charity (Keep Olim) in Israel. I was heavily and aggressively feminized by him (I am ftm), he asked if I had a big pussy and said he will not send money if I don’t answer the question. He threatened to tell all my friends on Facebook that I’m transgender (we both members of new immigrants support group). This was during the time I was recovering from a brain stroke. I had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide after this conversation with him.
God, that’s awful! I’m so sorry!
I know it's not easy, but they are like people that believe in flat earth,

They only see the evidence they want to see.

To far gone to be reach, just try to advocate on sensible people.

Sorry for what you've gone through....
I think that he and men like him are really jealous of ftms, who in their eyes can get way bigger dating pool than them just because of having been born female.
I never thought of it like that. I always thought they believed we were invading their spaces and were somehow homophobic
IMHO, it's just that all family got their fascist uncle, 

The only difference is that ours are link to be sent in a death camp with us.

I'm (almost ) 40 and I'm old enough to have seen a bunch of alt-right gay...

They are far from the majority, but they are vocal, stupid and often uneducated.

And they are angry with anybody, even when they want to date you.(I'm a Bi AMAB, but most of my life I was identifying as cis, so I got shit from then...sometimes mixed with weird hint of interest), so don't take it only against FTM: they are angry at everyone in my experience....

(And in the end I hope that with generation shift thing may change.... the young are more open that boomer or us(millennial) imho...)"	rfdniu	NonBinary	2763	1.0	2021-12-13 11:27:39
Second Comic I think you should see. Sadly this is reality for many of us		"I love these comics! I read them on webtoons, and like 99% of her comics are amazing and so true to the standard
Related to another phenomenon where feminine signals carry more social weight in how someone is interpreted and categorized. So you get this issue where AFAB people who later identify as non-binary or a man will masculinize their appearance up the dickens and people will still identify them as women. Whereas AMAB folx who are drawn to feminity might start experimenting with small feminine things and are immediately questioned, rebuked, or corrected by others. Even hyper-feminity in cis AFAB people is mocked. It's like feminine qualities are always the worse choice.
I’m on the other side of this but it’s the same thing on both sides. I can shave my head and be dressed in men’s clothes doing the most macho shit I can think of and I still constantly get “there’s no wrong way to be a woman”. I can’t tell you how many frigging times I’ve heard that. 

When people (even well meaning) say this, it tells me that no matter how I express my gender or define myself womanhood is inescapable. It sucks.
This comic actually taught me something and I appreciate that
Where can I find more of these comics?
holy shit, that's such a shitty thing to see. love that other people are making trans women's oppression about \*them\*. wonderful.
Ikr, please let me be an enby in peace and don't judge me for having feminine hips. That doesn't make me a girl
Love the comic!

But the topic is kinda complicated imo. Because I absolutely do NOT want to invalidate boys who want to play with dolls while still identifying as male and the other way around. Different story when people know that the person is enby or trans, then of course it would be very inconsiderate to say such things. But idk I feel like it is generally a step in the right direction to say boys can play with dolls too, and when people misgender or get anything wrong one can still educate them.

Anyway I suppose the person in this comic has educated the people around them and they're still saying these things so 10/10 comic, pretty relatable lol
I'm a Pangender person and I LOVE my tits but no matter what, I'll always be gendered as femme for them because they are huge and unhidable. I don't want to hide or remove them, but I'll never truly be seen as a boy unless I do. And even then maybe not. Sigh. We must remember our gender is for us and not other's consumption, even if that's an inevitable outcome, it doesn't define us.
I've managed to avoid all this by being non-binary! (sure does come with its share of other problems tho :^[
Aint this the truth!?
Yeah, that's the reality for basically every life choice/component of your identity. 

Like, ""Oh, you're not dorky enough/too girly to like math"" 

 -> *does the thing to conform to everyone's expectations and have your interests treated as valid*

-> *gets mocked and invalidated for conforming to a sterotype*

It's worse with the queer aspects of your identity for sure, but so much of who you are is shaped by this toxic BS. It's awful.
This hurts... that was my mom. Like thanks mom...
i dont see ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" , but i do know that my style is socially more ""feminine"". i want to wear what i like, dresses and makeup and stuff, but people dont get that that doesnt make you a woman. NO MATTER HOW I PRESENT IM STILL NON-BINARY. 5 years of this and i still struggle with it not affecting my mental health.
Adding this to the required reading material for my family to understand where my head is at.
can someone explain this to me; i really don’t get it.
I know right! They’re truly amazing.
What is the comic's title? I'd love to follow them as well! (I tried 'Assigned Male' and couldn't find anything, though I did find 'Assigned at Birth' but they don't appear to be the same comic creator?)
It just really, really sucks because she gets a lot of hell just for being so visible. She's an awesome human being. Hope she's ok. Her comics are so amazing.
As an afab agender dumpsterfire, I have never felt more at home in ""femininity"" than I do now that I've removed myself from the inherent expectation of it -if that makes sense. It feels like my makeup or skirts or whatever are very purposeful instead of simply expected. 

But, with the body I was thrust into at birth, it makes many people (cis people specifically) question the validity of my identity. How can I be agender when I now present more feminine on occassion than ever before? If I was born female how am I not female by looking how they expect a female to look? But when my nonbinary trans masc friend, who presents mostly masc, puts on lipstick they are acceptably nonbinary to these same people. Its such a strange measure, and I still dont know where people want me to land. If I bind my chest and wear a dress how is my presented self more binary than theirs? Its as if you choose to present feminine you are simply female.

Maybe it stems from the overarching belief that male is default? That femininity in itself is somehow a core personality trait. Like in a cast of ""diverse"" characters there's tons of back stories and motivations...and then there's the token woman. Her back story is...woman. So linking yourself to a feminine appearance is what people immediately categorize you with as a whole. So to subvert this you have to be at least androgynous, but at best purely masculine to be acceptably nonbinary as a afab person. 

I dunno, I feel like I am made up entirely of tangents right now. Meh, fuck it. My gender is now tangent.
it’s the misogyny
I admittedly have this problem and it probably stems from me disliking being a girl myself as well as insecurities I have around other girls. It just seems like there's so much social weight carried with feminine features/signals. How would you suggest making it less stigmatized?
Agreed. Femininity on any gender is mocked and looked down upon, but especially trans women and transfemmes. Julia Serano writes about this in her book Whipping Girl.
Yeah, same here.Pretty much one-to-one the same as this comic. ""She's not even a tomboy, look at her sewing doll clothes."" ""Girls can like carpentry and computers too."" ""She just likes wearing comfortable clothes."" ""Why are transmascs perpetuating narrow, toxic ideas of masculinity?""  


Edit: And before I get the inevitable tone-deaf TERF messages in my inbox - boys can sew doll clothes and girls can wear comfortable clothes and do carpentry, etc. I'm not saying you should gender people on the basis of these things, I'm saying you should respect what they say about their own identity regardless. I know, it's shocking.
Do look up the rest from the artist :)
“Serious Trans Vibes” on WEBTOONs! She changes her style a lot throughout but it’s still really good!
The other point is that the people who want to have an issue with you will find a way for it no matter what you do. There is no appeasing of intolerant. Some of us walk the path down in the comic in hopes of getting validation and end up just getting yelled at even more.
I’m going to get a button that says “don’t judge my feminine hips” over a trans flag. Highly relatable.
I am fairly certain that if we see this strip as a part of her other work, it is about how trans kid have hard time being seen. But you are right, buys should be able to play with dolls if they so choose too.
Remember the words of Eddie Izzard. If you buy a dress, it is *your* dress. If you are not a women then clearly it is not a *womens* dress since it is owned by a person that is not a *women*. I am sorry to hear that you struggle :(
Do check artist other work. She seems to be able to capture these vulnerable moments well in comic
A common issue trans women face is that if they enjoy masculine things, people will say they’re not feminine enough to really be a woman. But if they enjoy feminine things they’re often told that just because they like feminine things, it doesn’t mean they’re a woman because boys can like feminine things too. (Which is true but that doesn’t invalidate the trans person’s gender). And if trans women are *really* feminine, they’re often told that they’re making a “mockery” of womanhood because you don’t need to be super feminine to be a woman. 

Hopefully that helps?
Short version: You cannot buy validation from people that have issue with you by comforting to stereotypes, they will always find some reason to have issue with and not accept you.

The message I receive from it: Be you and be you the way makes you comfortable, not the way people expect you to be.
I left it on another comment but I’ll leave it here too. It’s called “Serious Trans Vibes” on the app WEBTOONS! 100s of the comics on there and she is just amazing.
https://www.facebook.com/assignedmale/ Here's her Facebook, if that helps.
I am kicking myself for not going in meet-n-greet when she visited my country
Thank you :)
>Maybe it stems from

yep, pretty much this bit you just said. I genuinely think this is a major part of it. Also the sometimes subconsciously held belief that femininity is ""lesser"" and therefore you'd only choose to engage with it by some kind of necessity or force, rather than by choice.
also [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=assignedmale&set=a.305470909635180](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=assignedmale&set=a.305470909635180)
Thanks!
Absolutely
oh okay! I can’t believe i didn’t get that. Thank you for the explanation; i totally get it now.
Thank you! I was scouring webtoons but just didn’t have the correct title!
Maybe you'll get another chance sometime in the future. *Keeps fingers crossed*
I think this comment section hits it on the nail for me. If I engage in femininity I want it to be on my own terms, not because people assign it to me, especially when it's being used as an excuse to think less of me.
Hope so :) I am feeling super guilty atm for benefiting some major karma out of her older work. This cartoon just resonated a ton with me and seems it hits home for many of you too."	kyjyvv	NonBinary	2410	0.99	2021-01-16 14:36:00
After a bit of sad brain time, I'm back to feeling myself. I feel quite dapper today!		"If I'm honest I like the look more without the sweater, it's not that the sweater is bad I don't know if it suits the shirt and the combination I think would look better split, the shirt itself is really nice and suits you. As for the sad brain time whenever I feel low I try to sit back and simply focus on my breathing, I focus on the breaths in and out while imaging an object or the word 'breathe' or that I am in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a glass box that nothing can get in and I watch the thoughts race by the window.  


Doing that allowed me to get through the sadness, it hasn't happened in a while but I find meditation once you actually put effort into it is so helpful especially for people in the LGBTQ community who face violence on a daily basis, especially from ourselves in our head.
I love your sense of style, and I wish mine was that great. 

To add onto the top comment, I think the issue is just that the neck on the sweater is too deep. It needs to be higher, or a cardigan.
You look fantastic! I love it!!
Oh my gosh you are adorable
That sweater looks so cozy, love the shirt too! Looking fantastic 😊
So handsome!! I love your style. That sweater...! *chef’s kiss*
The outfit is super sic and you look epic as hell in it
You look quite dapper indeed!
You look brilliant! :)
I fucking love your style so much!! You look so cool!
Dude, you look great! Love those pants! You have a super chill vibe like me and I’m loving it ☮️🤙🏻
wow you’re handsome
Ooo I love those pants! And really digging the look, you look great!
look dapper AF
Handsome— carharts are such a hot look.
Nice threads! Would look great with a tweed blazer or a denim jacket too 😎
Oh dang, I want carharts like this now. I have a pair of the overalls for work but plain pants would be great. Thanks for the inspo!!
Yes yes and yes 
Can you be a model please?
Nailed it 🙂
Please teach me your ways 🥺

(Afab wanting to dress like this but no idea how)
Awesome fit! A crew neck sweater of a similar color would go great with that button down! Happy Friday!
What is dapper? It's so confusing to me because in my native language dapper means brave.
Quite dapper indeed.
You look amazing! 🙂

In the left pic, you look kinda like the queer singer LP! Look her up.
I’m sorry you felt really sad :/ 
You have a really kind face and these photos are awesome!
I'm sorry you were sad, but you look incredible in both of these photos, and your hair is amazing.

Dressed for a date to ghost me after the meetup, I’m quite sad about it >.<		"Their loss.
I’m so sorry. The same thing happened to me twice last month and it sucks! You look amazing though 😻
i hate to hear that :( for what it’s worth, you look lovely! good things are in store for you 🤍
Happened to me too. But don’t worry, if they’re the kind of person to ghost after a date, you don’t lose anything. 

You’re cute. 💕
You look hot. It just goes to show you dodged a complete idiot. I know that doesn't take the sadness away, but the person you're meant to be with won't stand you up. Their path is making it's way to cross yours soon. Don't give up and try to do something tonight that makes you smile... a funny movie, your favorite music, a pint of ice cream, call a friend... Hugs, love!
I feel ya Hun Ive been there plenty of times you waste all that getting ready then nothing 

Just remember you are beautiful regardless and that person was a fool
I'd take you out in a heartbeat 😊
Just proof you’re too good for them. You look stunning btw.
They don’t deserve you! Also you look astonishing I genuinely hope you have better luck on the dating zone
Looking good 👍
I'd let you ghost me just so I can say I had a date with you. You're gorgeous
They apparently have poor taste so don't worry about it
I will never understand why people go out of their way to miss out on perfectly wonderful people, do they just assume what the future holds?
I love your eyeliner and your haircut!  It looks amazing on you🔥
Ugh what is it with non-binary people straight up getting ghosted and stood up all the time? People don’t understand how hurtful it can be, especially for queer people. It’s fucked. You’re gorgeous and deserve better than that
You’re incredibly beautiful. I’m so sorry someone stood you up! Sometimes it’s better for us when people show they’re not going to be caring and supportive immediately, I’m definitely sorry that in some relationships I had to wait months to find out. I hope you can feel better soon, you deserve to feel great about yourself. Sending you a big hug from far away :)
So sorry that happened to you :( u don't deserve that at all.. sending u lots of love 🤲🏼💕✨
b*tch ur too cute to be sad, get up and slay!
they don’t deserve you <3
I'm sorry someone was an ass and not clear about what they wanted. You're probably better off without them. You're so pretty by the way!! 😍 Love the liner.
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS. (I seriously need eye makeup tips from you...)

It's a shame they stood you up! >:/
Remember that it’s usually about them, not you. Whatever their reaction was to you or to the situation, it’s a reflection and a projection. Don’t take it on as a commentary on you!!!!!
Aww, that’s the worst; just remember you’re worthy regardless. 🖤 Sending good energy your way!
im so sorry, you look amazing hun! their loss is their loss
Dammit. We’re here for you!!
Absolutely their loss, you look fab~
Don't let it get into your mind, didn't deserve you 😊😊
Do you tell them you are non binary before the date? If you don't tell them then they could feel like you weren't being honest with them.
They missed out, you look adorable!
So story for you 🤗
I’m sorry that happened. You look great! And the evening wasn’t a total loss, it hurts and it’s not any fun getting ghosted especially when we put our whole selves into something and they just walk away. But. You did it, you went and you out everything out there with confidence and they chose to walk and that’s their loss. At least they did it now, and didn’t waste more of your time. Your time is worth a lot, and it’s a shame to waste it on people who will take a long time to expose their ugly. At least they did it right away. Sending you all the good luck and positive energy on your next endeavor! I know I already said it but you look amazing! Take yourself out on a date and just know they lost out on someone great.
Where to they live 🔪
Sadly this happened to me. 2hr date, during which she ended up admitting her roommate tried to convince her not to go out with someone who’s NB (she defied their advice, went out anyway, then subsequently ghosted me in the end)
It sucks
YOU'RE SO CUTE! 🔥 🔥
THEIR LOSS!
I’m so sorry that happen you don’t deserve that
ugh their loss indeed
https://t.me/+0p-YLEG2aCo3N2My
Thank you, unfortunately logic says that but emotions give no fucks :(
We suffer together lol. It just hurts because I put everything on the table
Thank you, I hope the same good things will happen to you <3
Thank you for the encouragement >.<!!
Thank you for the suggestion !!   ^_^
Yeah, I really like her but I guess she didn’t feel the same
Idk, the date seem like everything went well. We kissed, then still text a lot afterward. Idk why
I don’t really identify as anything, I just let people identify me whatever they want tbh. Though I dont think me dressing up like this was the issue because she knew and she said she accepted it. Idk exactly what, I don’t think I did anything wrong
Thank you <3 I appreciate your kind words
No violence :3
I don’t get it but each to their own I guess
Thank you I try to think positive about them though, I’m sure we have done asshole things over the years. You have beautiful hair <3
Emotions can be emotional.  But it's still their loss.
It takes a lot more courage to do that than people give credit for, I admire you for being able to take that plunge. Been trying to ease myself back into meeting people for years
That definitely makes it harder! I think it’s the easy way out to be like “that person is an ass hole! They don’t deserve you!!!” But really it’s a huge struggle to be alive/be a person right now, and there are aaaaaaaall kinds of reasons why people might “ghost.” Not trying to make excuses or say that it’s not a hurtful way to treat someone, but at the very least don’t let it into your heart as a any kind of negative commentary on you.
It just hurts a lot when I make sure to be honest and open communication about everything. I hope that people would do the same but sometimes they don’t. In this case, everything seemed to go well and she didn’t even communicate with me how she feels so it hurts a lot, just want people to be honest you know"	tqpatc	NonBinary	1341	1.0	2022-03-29 02:10:48
i fucking hate people	so i work at spencer’s right, and this older couple comes up to me asking if we have any small rainbow flags. i tell them no, sadly we only have small non-binary flags left. the man asks what non-binary is, so i explain, and in response he laughs in my fucking face??? keep in mind, i’m wearing a non-binary flag beanie, i have a non-binary pin, AND my pronouns on my lanyard. im already having a horrible day, it’s shipment day and it’s been fucking packed all day and this is the biggest shipment we’ve ever had. that remark genuinely set me over the edge and now i’m in the bathroom crying lol	"When I was young being gay or lesbian was offensive to the straight people.  Now there is a month of pride.  You exposed them to something new.  Sometimes a person's reaction is to laugh at things they don't understand.  You were brave.  What they do with this new knowledge is on them.  Thank you for teaching the Cis people.  Be you!
Im so sorry to hear that. I was at hot topic ( as a masc presenting NB) shopping for new clothes for fem stuff for  school. These people,  very clearly in there 50s, starts to destroy a fellow NB. Understandingy, I rushed over to help them. I hope they are doing well.
Ugh, that sucks. I used to work at an ice cream place, where I mostly sold sugar to cranky Floridians on vacation. Can't tell you the number of times crusty old Republicans would intentionally misgender me because I was...AFAB and had short hair. A person just existing was enough to set them off. Somedays I could give as good as I got, and others were like ""oh, this part of why LGBTQIA suicides are high"". 

When I have rough gender days, which thankfully is pretty infrequent lately, I watch an episode of something like Owl House or Schitt's Creek. Stuff where homophobia and transphobia just don't exist. Or I'll look up YouTube videos of Alok Vaid-Menon or Jonathan Van Ness. People who make me hopeful about the future while validating some of m6 current struggles.
fuck im so sorry that happened, people are dumbasses
I think its so cool you have your pronouns on your lanyard! After seeing half a dozen or so people doing this I finally very recently started putting my pronouns on my name tag. I'm pretty socially anxious so I knever told any of those inspirational people what seeing their pronouns meant to me. I bet you make nonbinary people who come into your store and see you feel awesome.
UGH I’m sorry people really suck sometimes. That’s just awful and you didn’t deserve that in any way :(((
I’m so sorry about that happening to you :/ slightly off topic tho, do you like working at Spencer’s?
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened people are so shitty.
Why can’t people just be respectful and not laugh at someone’s identity in their face??
It takes some skill to be that guy. I'm impressed. I take it he came up to you on all fours? After all, there's no way something with that small a brain could do the calculations to balance on two feet.
Man go follow there car and go throw a eggs at there house and dip
I had a similar experience at my job. I wear my pronouns at work and a young girl talked to her grandad about how cool and brave it was. He then came over and asked me about it and I politely explained and he made an attack helicopter joke.

My manager came over in case he needed to defend me and calm me down. Girl was telling her grandad off while I stood there calmly with eyes like ice. He went ""see she doesn't mind"". To which my response was ""they do, but I've heard all the jokes and have no energy to entertain it today"". I sent him into his film, thanked his granddaughter for being an ally and got on with my day.

The people that don't want to understand will either lose family or die off soon anyway. All we have to do is wait.
I’m sorry love, you’re very valid❤️
WHO let the bigots into that hot topic 😡😡😡 exit our sanctuary IMMEDIATELY
Sorry
I also hate these people but it's really cool that you work at spencer's
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Customers can be real shitheels.
That sucks im sorry
i am so sorry to hear this. people are delusional and rude!
same thing happened to me when i posted something with my avatar on r/gocommitdie, needless to say the people in the comments constantly shit on me because of my pride flag
That would press my defiant little buttons. Mm, makes me wanna chew that guy out.
It shouldn't be your responsibility to teach the straights when Wikipedia and Google are free, but you did. Their reaction says infinitely more about them than you
Oh my god. I'm so sorry. People are so insensitive and fucking rude. I don't understand why people can't just respect others. Even if they don't understand. Even if it doesn't make sense to them at the moment, there's no fucking reason to laugh when you're learning about an identity you don't relate to. You are valid, I'm sorry you went through this.
Bruh wtf. Who in the world would life at you like that?!
This may not be the case, however it could be that when he laughed he was laughing in pleasant surprise, like a celebration. Sometimes when I encounter something unexpected I laugh, not to be mean but to express gratitude and appreciation for life. In some situations it may not seem ""appropriate,"" however that tends to be an perspective held by people who don't often find reasons to laugh. 

To be clear, I am not dismissing your feelings or perspective. I don't have a way of confirming the spirit in which he laughed, and not everyone laughs in surprise. It could very well be that he thought the idea of gender non-conformity amusing rather than something worthy of respect. I'm simply offering another potential perspective.
Hope your feeling better OP <3 <3 <3
Sounds like a rough day. I hope everything turns around for you
Working retail is the fucking worst.
Yeah that shit pisses me off when peo do that especially my parent, like my dad will go on full rants about it and my mother will make snippy comm about it making it less easy to come out.
Assholes gonna be assholes!
I mean doesn't that qualify as becoming baligrant or rude can't you at this point I don't know redirect the customer out of the store and tell them they are no longer welcome.
You hate some people. Me too
Not to defend their behavior too much, but maybe the way you explained nonbinary was wrong in the context. Idk, I definitely see that different explanations are necessary for different people. If you went with some ""people who don't identify with being a man or a woman"" or ""outside the gender binary"" can simply be too vague for someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. It's like the explaining evolution 200 years ago and people going ""I didn't come from monkeys"".
What a douche, why’s he laughing when he’s the dipshit who not only doesn’t know what that is, but knows so little that he’s surprised to see a non cis person working in a place like Spencer’s (dunno what it’s like at your store but it was known as a place trans, gnc, and non cishet folks in general were when I was growing up). I think ppl like that are currently over-compensating with even more blatant mocking and assholery towards us because underneath the bravado they’re realizing they’re wrong.
pronouns on a lanyard 🗿
thank you 🥹🥹 that honestly makes me feel a whole lot better about it. in retrospect i was overreacting a bit but stressful days will do that to you
When I was young we were still getting pistol whipped to death for being gay.

All-in-all, we’ve come pretty far… Just gotta get the rest of the way. Now is not the time to lose hope or focus.
omg that’s horrible!! i hope they’re doing well too :(
Wtf what happened?
destroy them? Like yell at them or physically hurt them?! wtf?!
Literally Owl House is how I coped through dysphoria today it’s amazing
OMFG soOO many ppl here in florida always emphasizes to call me ""ma'am"" way more as of recent after NB became more well known, a lot of it had to do with me cross dressing, it's honestly annoying
that’s a great idea :) i’ll try that right now 

no but fr i worked in food service before and i wish so badly it was legal to spit in stupid peoples food
The intentional misgendering is so fucking dumb. When I was a cashier a guy saw my pronoun pin and kept looking me straight in the eyes and saying ""ma'am"" in this dramatic tone after every sentence. 🙄🙄🙄

JVN is one of my comfort people as well. 🥰 She's so beautiful and has such a healing energy. I'm so thankful they're a public figure because he helped me come out to myself 😭
I also find that lgbtq inclusive and positive media help balance out the unpleasantness. 

I'd add The Penumbra Podcast and Dimension 20 to the list.
i will cry rn omg that is the best thing to hear. it’s so scary being as out as i am but the fact that i can inspire people like you make it worth it, i hope nobody gives you shit! you’re awesome
yes i do!! most people are very nice and have great vibes. 

all my coworkers are in some way alternative and LGBT+ and so am i, so even though i haven’t worked there as long as everyone else they accepted me with open arms. i’m pretty close with most of my coworkers already. 

plus everyday you leave you have a new crazy story to tell LOL. like we have a guy who comes in every single sunday to buy a pocket 🐱. we found out after he denied toy cleaner everytime that he USES A NEW ONE 5 TIMES A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK AND HE BUYS A NEW ONE EACH WEEK BC THEY END UP DESTROYED.
it’s a party for sure.
LMAOOO
bruh wtf that’s dumb asffff
it sadly seemed like the latter, but i appreciate your point of view. :)
i am! everyone’s love on here lifted me up a whole lot. i’m so glad to have a community like this <3
Nah, this is too much defense. Asking for an explanation and laughing at the answer you get is rude, period.
I'm gonna go a kinda big sibling on you if that's alright, if not, just disregard my comment: You weren't overreacting. It sounds like you were overwhelmed and that's okay to feel that, especially on stressful days. <3 your identity is valid and your feelings are valid and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise
You were not overreacting!! They laughed in your face over something that's an integral part of you that took bravery to come out with. That's hurtful!
People are scared and ridicule what they don’t know, plus, some “allies” are pretty gross acting. Be yourself, accept that, and don’t ask for permission to be yourself. Sorry this happened, but until people catch on that “this isn’t a phase, mom”, it may happen more. You’re valid, trust that.
They started disintegrating them with their mind beams, but thankfully u/local_ENBY06 came in at the last second
They were yelling at them, and starting to threaten to physically hit them.
Owl House and Amphibia are what I'm watching while I wait for this bout of food poisoning to clear. Definitely great comfort shows. I love that kid's shoes have such great representation these days. God knows more adults could benefit from them.
I wonder if they think you're a trans woman and are trying (ineffectually) to be respectful?

Also, the ma'am/sir problem for enbies is real. There just isn't an equivalent non-gendered term. ""Friend"" doesn't have the respect connotation, and ""comrade"" makes one think of Russia.
Food service is definitely a special hell. I'm pretty happy to be in healthcare now. The fact that my job now involves counseling trans folks who are on hrt is really validating. When work does suck, there's Our Flag Means Death.
Some people have been kind of rude, others havent acknowledged it at all, others have been really cool about it, but a few weeks ago since I was out to my boss they felt comfortable coming out to me as they had just realized they were nonbinary, i spent years at this job feeling too scared to tell anyone at all and they felt like there was someone there to support them day 1, it honestly felt pretty great so I try to focus on that when other people at work get me down.
That sounds amazing!! I actually asked cause I have an interview at the store where I love tomorrow :) it’s good to know that it’s an enjoyable place!!
OMG you wouldn’t believe what some customers at my store do, I had this one guy DEMAND that I accept a return for this stroker that was obviously USED, not to mention the whole bag he had brought it into the store was sopping WET with god knows what 😭😭😭

He wouldn’t accept making an exchange instead until I got my boss involved too (I’m already in a management position, however this guy wouldn’t listen to me after I explained our policy on these things… he may have thought he had leverage over me since I’m pretty obviously queer, this guy struck me as homophobic asshole 🙄🙄)

The list of crazy stories goes on lmao
im replacing my account so the last thing i do will be giving you a silver award
thank you so much <33 🥹
what an incredible rescue effort, I couldn’t imagine recovering from near disintegration but hopefully they’re healing up okay after being blasted with so many mind beams
jesus christ, it’s so spooky out here for our community, I’ve had people following me and pulling weapons on me while they said “people like you need to die” and shit
I meant to say shows, but shoes works too.
mayybe but i look cis since i still present somewhat femininly (at least as of recent more comfortable with that) , i have booba and i'm 17 and look young so like they couldn't really think i have had any surgery either (especially with the political state here ik it's harder for trans people now), but yea i mean maybe that's the possibility? still hurts 😭
trust me, you’ll love it. good luck at your interview!! :)
EWWWW OMFG THATS AWFUL
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH :D
Absolutely it would. I'm sorry it happened. You are valid just as you are.
Thank you!!
hello!!! based on these replies, you can probably guess who i am
np, see you on my replacement account"	wlbrfa	NonBinary	1284	1.0	2022-08-10 23:10:44
Even though I’m afab and present feminine 70% of the time, I’m still a proud non-binary!! Also, feeling happy because I bought a cool shirt with sharks from the men’s section and it looks hella good on me (but no pic yet sadly)		"Wow I totally needed to see this right now. I've been struggling with figuring out my gender identity and I think I'm nonbinary, but I present feminine most of the time too. It's nice to see someone else looking cute and girly while also being nonbinary
I’ve been questioning my gender identity a lot recently, and I don’t know why but reading the title and seeing the pic really helped me. I’m afab as well but due to some body-related stuff I haven’t been able to figure out if I can present myself in an androgynous way. However, this one post has helped me realize that I can present myself in a feminine way and still be comfortably non-binary. So I guess this is a really long-winded way of saying thank you!
That's such a cute outfit you look great :O !!
We owe no one androgyny. You're fantastic!
You’re so valid!!!! Nonbinary folx with SEEMINGLY binary presentations and that like binary language are just as nonbinary as the rest :)
This picture look so good I thought it was an ad for coffee or something and almost scrolled right past it! 

Glad I didn't though, you look lovely!
I'm non-binary too, and love to dress femme and play with makeup! I loooove that yellow on you, it looks so nice. :)
Like a few other people here, seeing you be confident in your identity as nonbinary while being afab and presenting femme is just what I needed to see. Sometimes I feel like I have to present a certain way to be nonbinary, so it's always reassuring to see other nonbinary people like me :)
Be as feminine as you want to be - your identity is still valid! Lovely photo!
You are like a 60s pin up pal ❤️💛
Can't wait to see the shark shirt, sounds great! Until then, we have this fantastic photo of you!
You are completely and utterly valid!!!! And anyone else who leans more to one side of the presentation spectrum  than the other is completely and utterly valid!!! 🖤💜🤍💛
I adore that color!  Such a cheerful outfit.
Omg you look so amazing! Rock that outfit, friend!
I always love to see posts like this. While logically I know your can dress however the fuck you want, I do feel semi-conscious pressure to dress more masc, or bind or similar things. But he'll yeah femme/masc enbies!
(Also you're very cute! :D)
ever since i worked out i'm nonbinary last year i've been trying to convince myself i don't have to present a certain way to ""count"". seeing feminine-presenting afab enbies like myself helps. thank you and keep rocking the way you look with no apologies :)
I HAVE A SHIRT WITH SHARKS TOO!! It’s my favorite
Ah, your whole outfit is fantastic and you are lovely. 

Fembies rock <3
Yellow dress is amazing, the cut is fantastic it really accentuates your shoulders in such a lovely way
Omg they look so pretty everything gives off such positive vibes and I love it
Where did you get your glasses? :O They're stunning!
Same here, but AMAB and present and look mostly masculine, and I know most people look at me as pretty ""manly"" even though I don't put effort into that. Just want to be myself without people forcing an identity on me that I never felt comfortable with though. I've settled on it's fine to be yourself, and if other people don't see you for who you are, fuck it
I’m glad I helped you! I used to have similar struggles and sometimes I wonder “am I really enby?”, but really, it’s a spectrum. 

As someone said somewhere (i don’t remember who or where, but I loved it) if being a girl is pink and a guy is blue, there’s a whole spectrum of other colors like yellow and purple. And even if you feel just light-pink, that’s still different from the girls’ pink, so that’s already outside of the binary!
Just a heads up, you don't need to be androgynous in order to be non binary! Not all non binary folks are androgynous!
I’ve been struggling with similar things! I happen to have pretty wide hips and thicc thighs, so it’s hard for me to appear androgynous or masculine when I feel like it (but I’ve learned to manipulate fashion to still appear masc).
I’m glad I was able to help you feel better though!! Sending you lots of love and support!
Thank you!! Yellow just makes me really happy \^^
Yeah!! Thank you!
Louder for the people of the back!!! 😄
Hahaha credit to my mom’s photo skills!

Thank you!
Eyy, I’m sure you look great in it, too!

Thank you!
Yeah!! I’m glad I can help people like this <3
Thank you!
Hahaha thank you! that’s the style of the dress I guess! It looks super good on me!
I’ll post it as soon as I can! Thank you!
Yeah!!
Right!! It just makes you feel so happy and warm inside!
Thank you!!!
You just need to overcome that boundary I’m your mind! It’s not easy, but once you do, you just understand yourself soooo much more!

And thank you^^
You’re doing great so far! ^^ I’m glad I’m able to help fellow binary-presenting enbies feel good!

And thank you <33
AAAA YES!!! Sharks are good!
Thank you!

Yea! Fembies rock!
Hahaha thank you! I think so too!
Thank you!!
Oh man I wish I remembered... I think they’re by Ray-Ban? But they originally had blue lenses, and I replaced them with prescription lenses!
I really needed these comments right now <3
That's a great way of looking at it! Thank you very much for sharing that with me
My sibling is just coming into her nonbinary-ness and being able to show her examples of other folx ok with binary presentation and/or language has been helpful with her finding herself so thanks for sharing with us all :)
Well yes! I do love a good goldenrod~ 🌻
genuinely looking forward to a picture of you in that shirt with sharks on it sometime c:

Just sad	My wife ask me if she turns me on still, and I said it would really turn me on if she used my pronouns consistently (they/them). She turned it around and told me that I shouldn’t correct her because it’s incorrect grammar and it triggers her to use my pronouns. I’m just sad. I don’t necessarily need feedback, just sharing. It fucking breaks my heart.	"What trauma could have possibly happened that someone is triggered by grammar that’s at least several hundred years old? How can pronouns hurt her, mentally or emotionally? How?? 

Anybody who cares about grammar **so much** would surely know that languages are not static, and grammar changes over time. Anyone who particularly cares about refusing to use singular ‘they’ and ‘them’ ought to know that it’s an older part of English than singular ‘you’. 

If someone don’t know these basic facts that would undermine their knee jerk bias, that’s also proof they literally haven’t looked into it, because these are extremely obvious and accessible facts 

OP, you deserve so much better than to be snarked at when you’re being vulnerable about your feelings and needs. A part of me is downright spitting, “wtf is this crap, gtfoutta here with that, PTSD is a real thing wtf is this ‘ironically triggered’ bs” because it’s so thoughtless and casually cruel on her part to talk to you like this
If it triggers her, then she should get therapy. OP, you deserve better than low-effort and catty excuses for being a transphobic bigot.
My husband is autistic, he is *actually* triggered by incorrect grammar - he goes off on one when people get it wrong. It drives him insane. But even he uses they/them pronouns for our Nb child. I am so sorry your wife is such a transphobic bigot. There is no excuse for her behaviour.
That's not what a trigger is, and it minimizes folks with actual mental health triggers. Ugh. What a terrible thing to say in any context, but to your spouse? I can't even imagine. I'm so sorry.
Your wife sucks. She’s making bogus excuses to misgender you.
I’m so sorry to hear that. Let her know if it makes her feel better, they/them is used singularly all the time. She likely does it multiple times a day. Here is an example:  Singular they, along with its inflected or derivative forms, them, their, theirs and themselves (also themself, and theirself), is a gender-neutral third-person pronoun. It typically occurs with an unspecified antecedent, in sentences such as: ""Somebody left their umbrella in the office.
Triggers her my ass
Im sorry, They them can be used singularly. I also find it weird how she says it triggers her yet shes the one disrespecting you.
Do you have issues with those self esteem ? she seems kinda manipulative. Making this about her

 A long time ago I thought non binary people weren't real and that they were just looking for attention but when my siblings came out I could see it was important to them so I did some research. Even in the several months where I thought they were confused I still was respectful because I love them and I can see that it was important to them.

 I'm a not a good person. I hurt people I care about if I'm a better person than your wife that's a big problem
I’m sorry, if incorrect grammar “triggers” your wife, she must be a mess just listening to herself, because the believe that your pronouns are in any way grammatical is complete and utter nonsense. There is quite literally hundreds of years of precedent for the use of singular “they” pronouns. 

It was used in the King James Bible, written 1604 — Philippians 2:3:

*In lowliness of mind let* **each** *esteem others better than* **themselves**

It was used in Shakespeare’s Comedy Of Errors, written 1594 — Act IV, Scene 3, Line 1:

*There's not* **a man** *I meet but doth salute me*
/*As if I were* **their** *well-acquainted friend*

It was used in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, written in the 14th century, *literally before the advent of modern English*:

*And* **whoso** *fyndeth hym out of swich blame,*
/**They** *wol come up*

No grammatical argument can be made in good faith against the use of singular “they.” Anyone who claims otherwise is either lying as a means to be transphobic, or deeply ignorant of English grammatical convention and literary history.
Is your wife from before 1370? Cause using they as a singular pronoun was first put into text as early as 1375. So grammatically speaking your wife is over 600 years on the wrong side of history.
I think I speak for a good enough portion of us when I say that is your *Ex-wife*...
Wow, what a drastic pivot from ""i care about whether I turn you on"" to ""I want you to feel miserable around me.""  So sorry you're having to deal with this.
oh improper grammar my fucking ass. even if it is incorrect by grammar rules, grammar changes. iirc, ""you"" used to be plural only
it's been proper grammar as long as she's been alive. Singular ""they"" has been recognized for hundreds of years. It's listed in every major dictionary. It was prohibited in formal writing in the past, but that has changed in recent years. All major style guides have been updated to allow the singular ""they,"" both in cases where it's someone's preferred pronouns, and in cases where the person's gender is unknown. The ""he or she"" standard that we were taught in school in the past is now considered outdated and non-inclusive.

People saying it's improper grammar has become something of a transphobic dog whistle. At best, they're poorly informed, but usually they're making an excuse for their deliberate choice to not recognize non-binary people.
Why are you married to someone so ignorant and belittling? To someone who doesn’t value you or respect you? To someone who treats you so poorly?
 Asked off of this post AND another of your posts stating she “acted weird” when you mentioned top surgery and you’re genuinely concerned she wouldn’t help you with recovery….

It really seems like this is not something she’s accepting of.

I don’t know how long you’ve been out, but at a certain point you have to accept that some people just won’t accept who you are. Even if that person is your spouse.
I’m so sorry - having your partner use your correct pronouns is so little to ask; like, the barest fucking minimum. I can’t imagine how heart breaking that conversation must have been. I hear you friend. ❤️
I would have just straight up said ""Then no, you don't turn me on anymore""
I remember my mom's stories of being beat with a switch, at school for using her left hand. Or writing notes. I never heard her complain when my eldest asked to be called him. 

I actively out myself through triggering situations in order to help people. Just because I know the suck they feel does infact truly suck and their suck has no choice of escape unless I help. 

I also have corrected child services, to their face. And school teachers, and police officers. I am Native American and my name is Spanish. I can definitely say those moments are intimidating, and triggering. I get over it, because I love the other person. I believe that is what most of us do, or at least try to. 

I believe their words are baseless, vague, inappropriate, disrespectful, and purely bigoted. 

But as a compromise. I can correct her if you like. Then you get the correction, and it isn't you ""triggering"" them. Eh? Lol. Joking not joking.

P.s. My wife switched to they them pronouns for me after 14 years of knowing me as another. And opens they door for me too, and helps me into the car too, and we share the normal gender specific attributes we wish to share, and cut those we think are dumb, and we both came out of extremely controlling and restrictive families. I feel lile any excuse is relatively garbage when it comes down to it. We all make exceptions for those we love. At least this one comes as a request and not a surprise. Idk. Food for thought. 

Edit to add the p.s.
I'm so sorry, friend. Ask her if Shakespeare triggers her, too, because he used they/them all the time. Also, the OWL has this to say about gender pronouns: [https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general\_writing/grammar/pronouns/gendered\_pronouns\_and\_singular\_they.html](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/pronouns/gendered_pronouns_and_singular_they.html). And here is the Oxford English Dictionary: [https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they). They are like the leaders of grammar and the English language.
I’m sorry to hear this!  It is sad!  My partner also had a similar reaction even though she is agender only because gender bothers her so much. By me changing my pronouns she felt she has to think about gender more and that triggers  her. 

I agree being validated and loved for who you are is SEXY.  Being invalidated makes you feel like you’re moving away from someone not closer. 

I hope you and your wife can work it out if that’s good for you. My partner is getting better with time after I’ve explained how important it is to me. But I’ve felt really lonely at times.
You both should probably find someone else.
Divorce time, you don’t deserve that treatment
That sucks 💕 sorry love
my ex used to say random little things triggered her all the time, i eventually realized that she was just a narcissist. i’m sorry you’re dealing w this friend, best of luck to you<3
i’ve been in love with literature and the english language since i learned how to read. i’ve taken every advanced english class available to me as soon as they were offered from 7th grade on. i’m the first to notice grammatical errors and misspelling and i’m often asked by friends and family to review their work before submission. i’m also nonbinary and use the singular they/them. it’s grammatically correct and has been for ages. people use it all the time without noticing. she’s just being hurtful. 

even for “sticklers” like me seeing something grammatically incorrect isn’t the end of the world. if it’s a very bad error it’ll get an eye twitch from me but constantly correcting people is annoying and uncalled for. it is in no way triggering and it’s very telling that she claims it is. either she’s immature or she really doesn’t want to use your correct pronouns. i’m sorry you’re in this position, you deserve to be surrounded by supportive people.
My housemate has a masters degree in linguistics and uses they/them pronouns. Singular ""they"" has existed in English for longer than singular ""you"". I hope your wife gets over this, for both of your sake.
Singular ""they"" has an older history than singular ""you""


I'm sorry your wife is a bigot who uses incorrect knowledge of grammar to misgender you
That is really sad. When I came out to my bf he was immediately supportive and has done everything to make sure i feel valued and respected (using my pronouns and other supportive things included). I love him, and he loves me. 
Love is an action, and how can anyone say they love you but are okay with disrespecting you? Love you but won’t use your pronouns? If your wife loved you wouldn’t she make the effort? Shouldn’t she? If my bf can do it so can she. No excuses
I understand you to some degree, the people around me know I'm nonbinary, but they don't understand it, they don't try to understand it, and they never use the right pronouns when referring to me

It just hurts....I don't even correct them anymore
Maybe your wife should reconsider her priorities and work on her issues.
She isn't triggered; she’s intolerant.
Ýoi should take a long and serious look at your relationship, and your wife. It genuinely reads like she's full of shit; she needs to work on herself, maybe some individual and marriage counseling would do some good? Either way hang in there, and know we're here for ya
I'm incredibly sorry, OP. This is a hard situation. I hope you have (besides us ofc) a queer-supportive space/community/person in your life ❤️🏳️‍🌈
It’s not incorrect grammar, and we use singular they naturally already when we don’t know the gender of someone. “Oh no, they left their umbrella! Maybe I can catch them.” Very unsupportive and not cool of your wife.
How can she expect you to be turned on by her when she hurts you intentionally
Ya know, I think that saying “divorce your wife is too extreme”. But entertaining people who do not respect you is also not going to be very helpful to your circumstance. If she is “triggered” by using they/them, then she should be too “triggered” to speak to you with familiarity.
You should inform her that singular they is older than most pronouns we use today as well as a lot of other words. She’s not actually worried about grammar as bigots seldom are, she’s just being unsupportive and using grammar as an excuse. I’m sorry this is happening.
You deserve better my homie, she’s looking for an excuse to be enbyphobic…
You deserve someone who can show you the basic respect of using your pronouns correctly. It's really not that hard to at least *try* using them consistently.
Honestly I’d she refuses to respect your pronouns you probably shouldn’t be around her because she doesn’t respect YOU.
I’m so sorry, but if she doesn’t even love and respect you enough to use the pronouns you requested, the relationship is already over.
What the fuck. You deserve better than this bullshit.
Wow, words used in the time of Shakespeare and Chaucer are only just now triggering her, what a pathetic excuse. You deserve better than that.
Singular they predates singular you. And language evolves. Either way, she can get therapy for whatever her grammar trauma is, and get over it. If she isn't willing to try, she doesn't respect you.
In academic writing, they is frequently used as a singular pronoun. You can find lots of academic articles employing that, it isn't incorrect grammar.
Bro put a dead rat in your wife's lunch, anyway why'd you turn the question around bestie
Probably already know this, but she clearly has **a lot** of bigoted feelings to work through. She just probably didn’t think she could possibly be bigoted and trying to process that with any excuse she can say. 

Like, what happens when pointing o it singular they has been in use for centuries? What happens when pointing out that what she is doing is far more triggering, especially when the other thing isn’t remotely triggering? I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. Sucks, but bail for your mental health.
If this was happening to your friend or sibling, what would you say?

Call for divorce. It won't get better. From someone who has been there and was engaged to a person who always forced both of us to bend to what she wanted even if it actively denied me my existence and well-being, it will never ever get better.

Live your life for *you*. Get out of there and be free, my love. You will feel so, so much better.
Your wife is making excuses and cop outs. She sounds like a terf. That is genuinely a heartbreaking thing. I feel for you.
Oh geez. She’s not even right about it being “incorrect grammar” - not that it should matter.
Does your wife mistreat you in other ways?

https://www.thehotline.org/?utm\_source=google&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=domestic\_violence
divorce. Right now. They clearly don't care about you at all
I’m sorry this is happening to you, you deserve to be gendered correctly. This honestly sounds like an excuse for something else like “not ready to change” kind of thing to me, but I don’t know her ofc. I hope the truth comes out soon but the bottom line is your identity is non-negotiable.
Big red flag. I’m so sorry babes this is happening especially on TDOV. We love you
It’s just transphobic, bottom line.
""told me that I shouldn’t correct her because it’s incorrect grammar and it triggers her to use my pronouns."" MY BRAIN COMPLETELY IGNORED THAT THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS BECAUSE OF HOW FUCKING INSANE THAT IS. This is not a healthy marriage, friend. This is psychological abuse that she's subjecting you to. Twisting things to present herself as the victim?! Not much can leave me dumbfounded but WOW that was hard to process. My brain essentially became the dialup modem sound for a minute. My heart breaks and my blood boils for you.
Studying linguistics. She's wrong. She's thinking of prescriptive grammar. ""Whom, not who, they is plural,"" etc. But this isn't how we use grammar unless you constantly are in a college classroom. We use descriptive grammar to say that ""they are good"" is correct grammar and ""are good they"" is not a grammatically correct sentence. Do you know what order to put sentences in? Congrats, you know more grammar then her. Is group therapy/couples therapy a possibility? Wishing you the best of luck.
I think it's less about the pronouns deep down, and whether or not she accepts this. This is her coming to grips with that you are coming out to be a person who is changing in front of her. I hope she can look inward and figure out what she wants from your relationship together.
I'm sorry you're so sad. I would hug you if I could. Just remember you're still valid. 💛
If this was about grammar and “trauma”, then your wife would have issues with the pronouns and nothing else. (Even that would be dubious.) 

The fact that misgendering and other transphobic issues are at play, on top of pronouns, means that this is a transphobia issue.
If respecting someone's loved one triggers them, maybe they should be the ones going to some fucking therapy for their issues
Even if she does have trauma and is still triggered by her ass of a teacher from middle school, it's not a free pass for her to use the wrong pronouns and make you feel like shit. Past trauma does not give one an excuse to make other people's lives difficult.

She should not try to make *your* pronouns about her.
Anyone who cares more about grammar than you as person does not deserve you. Period.

The grammar argument is bs anyway, as many others have pointed out. You deserve SO much better.
Wow, that’s so disappointing of your spouse. My mom tried to use the grammar excuse on me over Christmas. I told her it’s like this- if someone left their umbrella at your house, you would wonder who left it so you could give them back their umbrella. There is nothing grammatically incorrect about that. She dropped it after that, was pretty effective. I can’t imagine if my wife was like this though- you deserve better. 💛🖤💜
Dang. I feel so lucky my wife is accepting.
The “trauma” of getting points knocked off a school paper (trivial) can’t be compared to the trauma of gender dysphoria (potentially lethal).

So sorry that you’re being snapped at for asking to be acknowledged. It’s not what you deserve💖
It sounds like she is refusing to process her internal bigotry, and maybe turning that question on you because her attraction towards you may be so strictly gendered if she comes from a relatively religious or conservative background. (Speaking from experience anyways I don't know the situation.)
Allow me to chime in as a person who has been working as an editor for 15 years, which means my job is to be an expert in English grammar and to be familiar with a wide array of dictionaries and style guides: every major dictionary and style guide now recommends the use of they/them as singular, gender-neutral pronouns.

Your wife’s understanding of grammar is wrong. 

Furthermore, experienced professionals in my field are generally not real sticklers for grammar because we understand that the rules are not prescriptive, they are descriptive. We certainly don’t get emotional hangups about it.

The rules are there for convenience. They’re there mostly for business purposes. They’re a shallow attempt to tame a lively beast.

Getting hung up on a grammar rule—getting upset about grammar—is a sign of a person who has very little expertise in language and no authority to police it.

I don’t really think this is totally about the grammar, but that’s what I’d tell your wife if I could talk to her. And I’d tell her to get a life.

I’m sorry she is letting you down.
Hang on.  I’m sorry but focusing only on one side of this conversation seems unfair.  I understand and appreciate how hurtful that response is.  But she asked a question that you didn’t really answer.

Do you still find her attractive?  Where did that question come from?
I'm sorry you're having to deal with this and I hope your wife is open to being educated, because she's being extremely transphobic and exorsexist. I do hope she's being melodramatic when she says it triggers her since singular they isn't incorrect grammar at all, but if there truly is a trigger there for whatever reason she seriously needs to go to therapy for that as that's not a good thing and actively Interfering with her life and her relationship with you which isn't healthy. If it is a trigger, she should be willing to do the work to figure out *why* it's a trigger and work on healing that part of herself. I hope she's open to it for both of y'alls sake.
Your wife is wrong , Miriam Webster changed it for this to be correct grammar over four years ago .  Now she doesn’t have to be triggered!!   But also she sucks and I am sorry
Oh honey, I'm so sorry this is happening for you. You deserve someone who is totally turned on by you just the way you are.
Hope this isn’t too forward, but she doesn’t sound like a very good wife...you deserve someone who respects you and doesn’t act like your existence is an affront to them. 

I believe the most important thing in long term relationships is respect. Your wife is being incredibly disrespectful. Also, being confronted on your own bigotry =/= triggered. It’s obviously not the grammar if she still misgenders in grammatically correct ways. She should respect you enough to at least acknowledge it as a her problem, instead of making it a you problem.
That sucks a whole lot. I'm sorry you have to deal with that, and that she's making it about her instead of supporting you.
You deserve better than someone who won't respect who you are. She doesn't give a shit about 'proper grammar', and she doesn't know the actual definition of the word 'trigger', she just knows she's going to get mocked if she uses your proper pronouns, and she cares more about how other people see her.
OP you deserve better. i’m sorry you’re experiencing this. glad you know you shouldn’t be treated this way. hope you’re able to escape her transphobic-self asap
She needs therapy, and you need a love who will do anything for you, even if it's hard. What is the point of love otherwise
People using the word ""triggered"" as an excuse for everything.... *screams* *in* *BPD*
She wants you to validate her by saying she is attractive but absolutely refuses to validate you by respecting the fundamentals of your identity 😒
I’m sorry that your wife makes you feel this way. It’s extremely hard when family does it but it has to be even harder when your spouse the person who is supposed to love every part of you rejects your identity. I hope you have a support system to be there for you when you need it even if it’s online. Remember that you are valid and your wife’s opinion doesn’t matter 💛🤍💜🖤


EDIT: And if your wife keeps saying that using your they/them pronouns “triggers” her flip it back on her and tell her that her using your incorrect pronouns triggers YOU, which is the truth for so many trans and nonbinary people.
Why are you with someone who doesn't respect your pronouns?
Adding on to all the helpful replies you've gotten just to send love and support. I'm so sorry that you're going through this. Partners can be so helpful or so detrimental, and you deserve to be with someone who can respect and support you. Recognizing that this behavior is manipulative and abusive is a really important first step! It sucks regardless, but it's good that you can see her bullsh\*t for what it is so that you can decide what you're going to do about it.
If I were you I'd be fucking offended by her accusation that you're calling her out _to humiliate her_. Does she truly believe that's your motivation?
Hello. I have an English degree. I went to school for 4+ years to get it and had to pay for it with scholarships. We discussed singular They regularly and always had a few people that would balk. Fam, someone else said this, but singular they had been around since before Shakespeare. 

They are using these things as excuses and making you miserable instead of just doing the work. If someone cares about you, they'd do their best to get your pronouns right. It sounds like to me they are wholly in disagreement with nonbinary identity and using all this as an excuse.

If my partner did what your partner is doing, they wouldn't be my partner anymore. 

I hope you find peace, or your partner opens their eyes.
I've had many friends like this through out my transition, I know how painful and sad it feels. Even some of my best friends at the time did things like this. I would say going to therapy and trying to work with your wife would be the best. And make sure you have a support system to help you throughout it all. But if nothing is helping/changing, I would think it best to look and examine the relationship. I am sending you all the love and good vibes, I hope it al goes well and your life is happy! :)
Personally, I'd like to think that that would be the straw that broke the camel's back and I'd be done, but I am unfortunately unhealthily passive. She doesn't deserve you as a spouse or to be your wife (I differentiate the two only because from that comment alone, she makes the fact that she does not respect your gender evident and likely would use a gendered label) and I just hope you realize how valuable you are. You deserve better. Honestly, being 22 and single, one of my biggest worries is getting attached to someone and finding out that they're toxic.

&#x200B;

***Also,*** I can't believe I got this far into a comment without pointing out that Merriam-Webster had the singular they be the word of the year one year. I tried to find the tweet, but am not great at finding things when I want to.
I couldn't imagine loving someone who wouldn't respect my identity. Leave her ass. You'll find someone better. Trust me.
It is grammatically correct. She’s just transphobic
This is very toxic behavior. You deserve better than that, OP. This is a basic respect thing. Your wife is turning it around to appear the victim. She is also full of shit.

I bet you bust your ass for this relationship and do most of the compromising to maintain harmony. And your partner is probably never quite happy about it, no matter what you do.
Your wife is an idiot and you need a divorce if she's refusing to respect you.
using your correct pronouns means that it’s the correct grammar. we get taught that at a very young age.

your wife is transphobic :(

edit to add: i’ve read through a few of your replies to others now and it’s very clear that your wife does not respect you at all. it’s hard asf and shitty asf, but you need to leave her. she doesn’t care about you the way she says she does.

i’ve been there a couple times. i’m so sorry OP, but you’ll be happier without them for sure. 

remember, your right person will respect you for you, not offend and disregard you. you’ll find the right person one day <3
As a person who’s taking a linguistics course it’s not bad grammar there’s a whole school house rock song dedicated to that
Yeah she said her English teacher would slap their hands with a ruler if they used “incorrect grammar” in middle school. She also told me that I shouldn’t correct her in public because I do it to humiliate her, which is definitely not true. I just want to be seen and acknowledged and she still calls me a girl, female, and uses other gendered language which I have asked her not to use.
I mean, as someone with a best friend with a minefield of triggers in their ptsd, I can see how it is entirely possible. But I'm pretty sure in this case, she's just overdramatic, full of shit and doesn't care about respecting her partner. I really hope OP is doing okay and that they have people in their life who respect them.
My linguistic brain loves it when people are corrected when saying that singular they is incorrect grammar lol
exactly it's not about grammar, it's about control.
Because she adds a value judgements to the pronoums. That value judgements makes her suffer, creating emotions. 

It's not about the pronoums but about what they rapresents for her.

Off course, that value judgement could be wrong too.
Absolutely this
On the flip side, I've had some autistic friends/my partner tell me that their autism makes it difficult to really relate to strict gender binaries. My partner is a cis woman with a ton of trans and NB friends, so it would make sense at least for her lmao
seriously, abusing the word trigger *and* being overtly transphobic to her trans partner. i’m sorry, OP, that your wife is being so vile towards you.
Big time issues with self esteem. She is manipulative and when I started individual therapy last year, I started to realize this and work on my self but I’ve struggled with self worth for so long, that I know it’s a long bumpy road and I’m really trying. Which I why I try to enforce my own pronouns and it just ends up backfiring on me and this is an example. We’re in couples therapy and have been since October 2022 and I don’t feel like it’s working. She just constantly makes excuses for shitty and downright abusive behavior and I’m about to just call for divorce. I can’t handle this anymore.
I’m pretty much there
I’m on the verge of a divorce. I came out to her last fall and it’s been a nightmare ever since. We’re in couples therapy but it doesn’t seem to be working.
I’ve been “out” to her since last fall, by which I mean I started using different pronouns. She knew I was genderqueer as soon as we got together. I think you are right, in that she doesn’t want to accept that I want to change both my physical appearance thru top surgery and use they/them pronouns. She keeps asking me if I’m trans, and I’m like, well yes because I don’t identify with my AGAB, but also I’m non binary so I don’t plan on using a different set of binary pronouns, nor do I currently feel like I want to use HRT, but that could change, IDK how I will feel in 6 months….or a year…or whatever. I think our marriage is over tbh
Based not asked**
Your partner may need some therapy. Disliking something is normal, but someone else's gender identity shouldn't trigger her.. like if the very concept of gender triggers severe mental distress, she has a problem that is likely impacting her quality of life.. if it's not triggering severe mental distress, then she shouldn't say that because it trivializes serious mental health concerns. Someone with PTSD for example, can be triggered by the sound of gun shots and subsequently experience flashbacks/losing touch with reality, dissociation, or severe anxiety/distress... that isn't the same as being a little uncomfortable or not wanting to think of gender because it doesn't fit her world view.  

Like it or not gender is a concept that exists in the world. She doesn't need to like it, but she needs to work on herself because being triggered at the thought of gender is not a functional or healthy way to exist in the world,  gendered concepts are literally everywhere... but I assume that's not the case, and she's just saying she's triggered,  not that she actually is.
100% agree and that’s why I made this post. I just want to be seen and heard and respected and needed this external validation to make sure I’m not overthinking this.
Yeah counseling has been going on for a good while now and things haven’t changed much. I’m about ready to call for divorce.
YUP. It’s time for me to make a decision about my future.
Yup pretty much.
Funny that’s what I said and she told me I just want to start a fight
I think this take is accurate. When I mention getting top surgery, she freaks out and I don’t even want to do it if we are together because she won’t help me in the recovery process
She just randomly asked me and I gave her the answer, it would turn me on if you used my pronouns consistently. But honestly, my attraction to her has lessened over time because she continues to find excuses for treating me like shit and despite therapy (both individual and couples) shit doesn’t change. I have a very hard time feeling emotionally attracted even more than physically because of her behavior.
your wife should take solace in the fact that usage of singular they has been a thing since before Shakespeare's time and is not technically grammatically incorrect. We also use singular they without even realizing it, for example: ""Whoever parked their white Toyota outside, they left their lights on."" It shouldn't make a difference if someone wants to be called they/them.

 I feel like if she truly cared, she would listen to you and make more of an effort to not make you feel this way. I also think it sucks that she's more concerned with how it makes her look when you correct her in public vs. her actually using your correct pronouns in public.
""Saying person instead of girl is grammatically correct, so why do you still misgender me in that way?""

If it was truly about grammar and her trauma around a teacher who physically punished her when she used improper grammar, then she would be able or at least attempting to change how she talks about you when pronouns are not involved. This isn't about trauma, she's simply being transphobic
So she cares more about her English teacher from middle school than her partner’s feelings?
Just to come at this from your wife's perspective - there are things that my wife needs, that I find hard because of my own issues. Sometimes, she would bring up an issue to me and it made me feel really awful even though she didn't mean it to, but because I was convinced that I had 'failed' and that she was going to leave me. 

You know what I did?

I worked on MY issues, because I fucking love my wife and she needed to be able to say ""Hey, can you [do this thing a bit differently/take this into consideration]?"" Without me dissolving into a puddle of self loathing tears and making her feel like she was hurting me when she asked for what she needed. 

It's absolutely okay for you to say ""Hey, I'm really sorry if this upsets you. But I am allowed to ask for what I need in the relationship, and if you have personal issues that make that difficult I would like to work with you to overcome them, but I won't accept less respect than I deserve just because you have a trigger around that. Would you like me to help you find a therapist? Would you like me to word it differently when I correct you on it so that we are both happier? Would you like help practicing using my pronouns so that I don't have to correct you if that's what you have an issue with? I don't want to upset you, but also I need a partner that respects me, so let's work on this together so we can both be happy.""
Being called a girl and being referenced by she/her in public by your partner is much more humiliating than being corrected in public. It sounds like she's trying to manipulate you into not expressing your gender publicly by referring to you as a girl and then claiming you're humiliating her by setting the record straight as to what your gender and pronouns are.

It seems to me that this goes further than just not respecting your gender identity and pronouns.

You may not ever be able to truly and freely express yourself while in this relationship. Is this really someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?
If she thinks you're doing it to humiliate her, she has either entirely missed what it means that you're enby, or she's just trying to make you feel guilty. I hope the two of you have a serious talk about whether to try to change things in your relationship or if it isn't worth it. You deserve to be with someone who understands and respects who you are.

If she's having real issues with this, like if it's truly triggering some issues for her or if it affects her sense of identity regarding sexual and romantic orientation, you have to agree on how you're going to work on this in a way that's sustainable for both of you. But if she's not willing to try to get better for you, please don't make yourself stay with someone who keeps invalidating and disrespecting you like this.
Okay so as someone with multiple traumas and complex post traumatic stress disorder, the last thing I want to so is call bullshit on someone’s trauma so I won’t, even if I kind of want to in this instance. But one thing I do know, is that when I am triggered in a relationship, if I love someone, I work on that trigger and try to change. If she is genuinely having flashbacks and experiencing the feeling of being hurt by her English teacher all over again every time she uses they/them pronouns (which is what feeling triggered is ACTUALLY LIKE), she should want to move past that. Because trust me, no one with PTSD likes to be triggered. I know that not everyone has the resources to get help, but if she really cared, she would at least recognize her triggers are a problem in the relationship and would hopefully try to get better. It’s not easy, but an effort should ideally be made if your actions are hurting someone else. At the very least, she could learn that they they/them pronouns are actually proper grammar. Maybe that would help her feel less anxious and triggered if that is actually her legitimate problem. I can send you some educational materials to show her that can help educate her and hopefully reduce her anxiety. However, her insistence that you are trying to embarrass her in public by correcting her on your pronouns is absolute horse shit and I think it’s likely she is feeling embarrassed by something bigger than your pronouns. I’m sorry you’re having to go through this because this should never happen in a healthy relationship. She should be able to talk to you rationally and be willing to educate herself. If it was me, I would run the other way, but I have a very low bullshit tolerance and I also know it’s not that easy to do that if you’re married. I am sure there is a lot of time and feelings tied up there and I truly am sorry. You don’t deserve this.
Me too. As someone with a linguistics brain as well, I couldn’t come out as non-binary until after doing a bunch of research. 

And how totally and absolutely unsurprising, the actual facts do not support what reactionary, lazy bigots claim! What, AGAIN??!? 😂
Making a value judgement is nowhere near the same as being triggered by something. That word is to do with trauma not displeasure or discomfort or activated emotions. It seems astronomically unlikely she would be triggered by using they/them pronouns for her spouse.
Wow yeah I feel that. I'm neurodivergent and nonbinary and I definitely feel triggered by misgendering but at the same time feel more angry that people are steeped in the binary and their minds are so blockaded from seeing who i really am. I think that its hard to describe how i've never felt like a he him to people who have historically thought of me that way...
I’m so sorry for all this and support you in this decision.
I am glad that you can see she is manipulative and abusive and I know I’m just a stranger on the internet but I 100% support you in filing for divorce because you don’t deserve any of this crap. You deserve to be who you are without feeling like crap and having to deal with someone else’s childish emotions. You’ve got this.
The outcomes of couple therapy really tends to be reconciliation or separation. It’s a good measure to see if things can work out. If it’s not getting better in therapy it’s time to part ways in my opinion. Same situation in my first marriage except we stopped therapy and I continued to be physically and emotionally abused for a couple more years until we finally separated.  The divorce was difficult but ultimately one of the best things that ever happened in my life looking back.
I didn't want to suggest it in my comment, but this is more than enough to justify divorce, particularly because of how expensive it can be but you're flushing your money down the toilet with couples therapy. I honestly can't think of many (if any) rational justifications for you to continue to subject yourself to her abusive and vile rhetoric. I just worry that if you don't get yourself away from that, things may escalate. That you have been putting so much effort into this marriage with no effort from her is honestly concerning. I mean, you may not be in this situation, but if one spouse is the main breadwinner and has more money, they can drain their spouse of cash and force them to rely on them financially.
Yeah, reading some of your other comments here... Seems like this relationship is pretty toxic.   Set yourself free.
Don’t be on the verge, do it.
Good points!  Yes, she does need therapy. When I gently suggest it and tell her how helpful therapy is her eyes will fill with tears and she will say she doesn’t need therapy while starting to cry lol. 

She does have issues with examining some of her own internal experiences and feelings. She likes to keep them under lock and key.  But to her credit she is doing better and even tries to use my pronouns when I’m not around.   

We’ve been together for a long time and for most of the time I didn’t know she was agender and both of us didn’t know I was non-binary. But obviously that must have been a component of our attractions and draw to each other. 

She of course has many other good qualities and I have my own issues with anxiety/depression and PTSD from an abusive marriage.  So not to make excuses for either one of us but we are both works in progress. However, your 100% she does need therapy. I’ve been in therapy on and off for over a decade so I agree how essential it is.
>Like it or not gender is a concept that exists in the world.

Well I don't like it. Gender is stupid. Everything would be easier if we didn't have it at all.
If you're stating that here, then you already sound like you're gone. Best of luck 💗
You deserve better ❤️
Divorce is great! The earlier you start the earlier you're done, and it's such a relief to be out of a painful situation
Yeah, she's definitely projecting. The fact that you telling her to not make it about her is somehow ""starting a fight"".
Okay.  Totally understandable.  The answer seems like “no” then.  Or do you think she’s conflating your transition with attraction?

I am sorry that you’re not in an affirming relationship, and hope you have other people that are supporting you.  She is also in this relationship and has feelings and (clearly) questions.  It can be hard when a partner or family member makes a change.  I don’t know what responsibility anyone has in a relationship at all, but I do wonder how she’s feeling for her to act this way.  And if you are indeed still in the relationship too.

I have a family member that outright stated why they stonewalled my coming out (ironic lol) - it was because they felt I hadn’t been there for them (gender neutral for privacy’s sake).  Still heartbreaking and has caused a big rift, but at least it’s transparent.
Will use this example! Thank you!
Also Helen Zaltsman (sp?) has a podcast called The Allusionist and there’s an episode about the historically correct usage of they/them. And sorry/not sorry for being crass but that person can kiss my cis ass and my enby child’s ass as well😡
Extremely well said! Thanks for opening this up further. 

I had thought to include a sentence like, “I don’t want to completely dismiss the possibility that she’s being literal and serious when claiming that pronouns ‘trigger’ her,” but then I reconsidered. Theoretically possible, yes. Believable in OP’s situation? Gotta be honest, I really think not. 

I see her statements about “triggering” as an excuse—an emotionally manipulative one—even if she’s tapping into truly being upset about pronouns. My PTSD is not excuse to mistreat people. Her bad experience with abusive nuns is not an excuse to insult people. EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE.

Thanks for expanding on that point
This is a really good point. This is an issue of Need vs. Want. 

OP needs basic dignity and respect for who they are. OP’s partner WANTS to avoid the effort of giving that, WANTS to maintain the moral high ground while refusing to do a basic and loving thing for OP, and WANTS to be the only one whose hurt feelings and bad memories matter at all
It’s such a laugh seeing bigots faces drop when you show them that ‘they’ singular pronoun is older than the word ‘she’
(If I remember correctly she didn’t come til later in English history, whereas he - or a variant of it - and they were commonly used in old English)
Basically, according to cognitive psicology we make value judgement about stuff.

Then, those judgements makes us SEE the stuff with a certain perspective.

That perspective triggers emotions.

That's how a person gets triggered, i was just trying to answer that question...

Off course, those judgements can be bad judgements that create negative emotions and this theory DIO NOT underestimate personal responsability.

I don't get why the downvotes, but i hope i made myself clear.
Fellow ND here, but Agender. I've had problems all my life with people reacting to gendered words/things where I was like ""??? Why are you reacting like this? What makes it gendered?!?""

The only times I've felt bad about it, instead of confused, is the two times I accidentally did it to a FTM friend and my social anxiety + self hate made me freeze so long I didn't even manage to apologize to him, so now my brain likes to throw those memories at me from time to time and go ""he probably thinks you're transphobic! That's why you aren't closer than you are..."" so I try to be mindful, especially around people I know aren't cis, but man... My brain just has such a hard time remembering those things that I sometimes slip up, no matter people's identities...
Thank you for sharing your experience around this. I’m on a precipice and have been for a while now and I want our relationship to improve but I’m really feeling like it might not be reconcilable.
There's no pressure to be perfect, but there is pressure to do your best and treat your partner in the way that they need to be treated.. which it sounds like you're both doing. It would be nice if she was open to therapy, but sometimes it takes time to be ready and accept help.. Hopefully it's soon because she will be better for it. 

Also, figuring out identity takes some time, and gender isn't always a firm thing, which is okay too. 👌 

Best wishes to you both 😊
I am kinda with you there, I personally find the concept stupid and useless.. but I recognize that the world doesn't revolve around my personal opinions, and that gender is an important part of some people's identity that I need to respect to afford respect to the folks in my life. 

You don't need to understand or agree to respect others, you should just respect their identity regardless of your personal crap (isn't this the very minimum we ask of cis folks who don't understand enby folks?.. I think we should follow our own advice on this one)
This is how my partners feels. It sounds harsh but when she explains it for herself it makes sense.

I think it’s valid to feel like this and still respect other peoples gender. Gender is a social construct. It’s like the stock market it make no logical sense but it’s a reality and if you want to save for retirement that’s ultimately where most of your money goes. Gotta play the game even though we know it’s basically performance art.
The problem can also be deep like an identity concern. If wife identifies as a lesbian, she probably sees OP only as woman because it affects her self identity as a lesbian. She could do with broader education on the trans community as well as therapy. It’s the only way to change this attitude.
You're getting downvotes because of the fact that you are supporting the person that is in the wrong. This person's wife is misgendering them and claiming that it triggers her to say they/them instead of binary pronouns, because of the fact that in her mind it's grammatically incorrect. https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/provost/writing-center/resources/Tips-Singular-Pronoun-They.pdf
That website explains that it is grammatically correct to use they/them and that, ""according to the Oxford English dictionary, singular they showed up in ancient writing in 1375, over 600 years ago.... And it's worth noting that you and your has a somewhat similar history but in reverse. You used to refer only to plural antecedents, not singular ones. In 1660, the founder of Quakerism even wrote a book on how using you as a singular pronoun was wrong (a brief history). Yet since you is now, without any debate, used as a singular pronoun, we can trust that they is headed in a similar direction."" The website also shows a list of some organizations that were formally against the use of singular they but have now changed their views here are the organizations

: The American Dialect Society, which honored the gender-neutral pronoun they as the word of the year in 2015

: The International Writing Center's Association

: The National Council of Teachers of English

: New Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage

: New Oxford American Dictionary

: New Oxford Dictionary of English( which also uses they in its definitions)

: The Washington Post
Thank you for your kind and encouraging words!!🥲💜🌈
>I think it’s valid to feel like this and still respect other peoples gender.

I never said I didn't respect others' gender! 

Just that I think it's a silly social construct and I don't like being asked ""are you a girl or a boy"" and similar questions, or worse, someone assuming my gender.
That’s just it. It doesn’t have to. Gender nonconformity is a part of lesbianism, like that’s literally the meaning of one of the colors on the flag, and I know plenty of lesbians who don’t find issue with dating non-binary individuals. 
We decide our own labels and because of that there is variety in what each label means to different people. 
Some see lesbian as “only dates women” some see it as “dates anything but men” 
If OPs wife wants to keep the label lesbian she can, without invalidating her significant other in the process.
I'm not supporting that person in any way. I just tried to explain how she's getting triggered.

And i don't need to read this, since i'm also using pronoums, being non-binary transfem myself 😅

Since it's not clear i'll state it: i don't think her behaviour is right. She's wrong and she has responsability for her actions. 

That's how mind works thou and she can work on those judgements to become a better person. My partner literally did that with my therapist.

Don't know why assume i'm supporting something i'm up against only by describing how something work...
I agree with you. I’m sorry if I seemed to say you didn’t respect others genders. I didn’t mean that. Gender is a silly construct. Silly yet crucially important like the stock market.  I just meant to expand on what you said and to validate your post. 

Gender is ultimately silly when I think about it academically. You are just YOU not a girl or a boy. Just the authentic you! 💙🌈💜🌈
I think it's a bit more complex than that. If to her, lesbian means being into women, and that is part of her identity, changing the meaning of the word is still changing her identity. Also, I think a lot of people ignore how it's entirely possible that a lesbian with an enby partner would actually not have dated them if they knew they were enby. Some lesbians are simply not into enbies. And this could be super hard to deal with, because it can make you question the very concept of sexual and romantic orientation.
It comes off as you excusing her behaviour, and frankly as you talking down to the comments a bit. Most adults are aware that people have pre-concieved notions and make judgements.
People have human emotions and they're flawed, it's just not really relevant to the fact that her actions are wrong and shows a complete lack of respect for op regardless..

Edit: you're also saying this as if you know it to be the reason why, which comes off as arrogant. we can all try to interpret the situation with our own experiences. However it reads a bit like ""this is how she's thinking and feeling, it is something all people do, here is what she needs to do to stop hurting her partner."" 
You talk about it as if it is not her intention to be disrespectful, and as if you're an expert on human emotion who knows more than everyone else here about it.

I'm not saying that is what you wanted to say or how you meant it to sound, but I think that's why you keep getting downvoted.
That’s fair.
I’m not ignoring that some lesbians don’t want to date/be with enbys. Like I said the label has different meaning to different people. And to some the label means only women. 
But if OPs wife doesn’t want to be with an enby then that’s a serious conversation they need to have rather than her just pushing her “grammar” on her significant other who has expressed that that is not how they identify. 
I meant the part about being able to keep the label lesbian because the person I was responding to said OP being NB might affect how their wife self identifies to the label lesbian so I was just trying to add that she could keep the term and be with her partner if she so chose. 

Me personally if they identify as a woman or enby it doesn’t bother me and I identify as a lesbian, but A friend of mine is a lesbian and doesn’t date enbys. So like I said the label is a bit subjective in how the person who self labels themself that feels about the term.
I agree with this and i wasn't trying excusing her behaviour. 

But since i'm in a similar situation and i've been ""solving"" it with my therapist and my partner in this way, i talked about that.

I'm talking down the comments because i don't like assumpions made from things i didn't say, or even opposite to what i literally said.

But what can i say? I apologize if i made people think that way, maybe i could have wrote the comments in a better way.
There are other psychological perspectives you can take with this too. For example, it could be that OP's wife is experiencing cognitive dissonance because she's seeing herself as someone who is into women, she also thinks of herself as a good person, and she thinks that someone who misgenders people is not a good person. Thing with cognitive dissonance is that it's really hard to cope with, so if you can't, you end up defending yourself in ways that can make you do really shitty things. Like OP's wife is doing.

If this is true she is lashing out at OP because she doesn't want to change. It's more important to her that she can keep feeling comfortable in her own little picture of herself and the world, than that OP is feeling okay, validated, loved and respected in their relationship and as a person.

My point is that there are many angles to take with psychology. You can never truly know exactly why someone is reacting the way they do, and sometimes they don't even know themselves. And when there's a conflict, yes, it's useful to consider how the other person is feeling and thinking, but there's a point where you have to actually make a judgement about the situation. There's a limit to how much it's reasonable to try to bend backwards to accommodate the other person just because you may be able to work it out. At some point, the different perspective that they have can very well hurt us, and hurt us badly, if we decide to keep going. So yes, try to understand and solve the conflict. But if the other person is not ready to change to accommodate your very valid needs, you simply shouldn't stay.

I really hope things work out for you and your partner. But please keep this in mind. If your partner is in any way showing that they're in fact not willing to change, please re-evaluate if this is a reasonable thing for you to keep working on. You, like OP, deserve someone who respects and validates you. No amount of psychology to understand the other person can change that. But again, I hope things work out and that your partner is ready to take your perspective and change as much as you are doing for them.
Thanks for the kind words to begin with, since people here seemed to get angry even if i didn't want to.

You're right actually, there could be many possibilities around this situation. But sadly most of them, if not all, needs the partner to work on something and accept.

Sadly, my partner needs a similar work too, but she's not willing to do it completely. She made progress, but she finds a skirt ""too much"" for example. If she's not going to work on that, i don't know what i could do thou."	1287xzq	NonBinary	1182	0.99	2023-04-01 02:07:15
Living as a non binary person in Poland is very hard for me, people don't understand my perspective of life and it makes me sad. How is it in your country? 🙂		"Pretty shitty, legally we don't exist and our language is incredibly gendered. I wanna move to Sweden
Hungary is hell for anyone who is not heterosexual, cisgender , or the people who doesn't want children because our lovely government said that everyone should have at least 2 children in order to let the population grow.
in Maryland, USA, an incredibly small state, you are either raging homophobic or raging gay. barely an in-between, unless you consider the internalized homophobia. 

Nobody walks around as authentically themselves, they are all natural-color-haired and dress identically.
even if our language is very gendered, the people that care about us and ourselves are changing that. also it is legal here to put that you are non binary in your id!

sadly it is still very transphobic in some other aspects, laws change societies but ours still has to learn.

\- a transmasc person from argentina.
thats an amazing picture
Just had a pride event as your neighbors in Lithuania. One day we will be free to live the lives we want, stay strong <3
In My country it's like we don't exist
Language Is Really gendered
Inclusive language Is made fun of
Trans people are constantly killed, it's Even worse for non binary people
Iwannagetoutofhere
i live in poland too and i don’t really come out to people because they probably wouldn’t even understand the concept
1 state (out of my knowledge) allows you to put an x on your birth certificate! But if you ever decide to get a passport so you can travel, you will get arrested for falsifying documents...
I’m sorry I don’t have any input on what things are like in my country (Japan) as I am still not out, but I do know there is a pretty active community regardless.  Japan has an interesting combination of gendered and gender-neutral language. I am not part of the NB/pride comm yet as I am waiting to be out to my spouse before I join. 

 I just want to say that you are absolutely stunning, though.  I am so sorry you’re having an difficult time of it. :( keep living authentically and beautifully, because you’re doing both very well already. 💕
I live in the US have Polish family and spend summers in Poland. I understand how hard it is there. I do have some relatives that are understanding but the older ones are not.  It is definitely better in the US (Washington specifically) but not always.
It depends on where you live in the US.  
I live in a big city on the west coast and people are fairly accepting of nonbinary people. It seems like people in their 30's and younger are very accepting of it and moving away from binary gender roles and sexualities in general, or at least that is the view from my little bubble.   
I purposefully live in the city because of it. Because it is safer than the rural community I lived in growing up, where I would fear for my safety if I was to present how I feel comfortable. Travelling a couple hours across a state can feel like like travelling through time here sometimes...
Living in the US south, have been mostly open about being enby and feel *extremely* luck to not run into any openly raging bigots while doing so, even met a few other openly LGBTQIA+ folk around. And now I'm struggling internally to decide whether I might actually be a trans woman, lol.
I live in Missouri (USA) in a smallish town by Kansas City. There are some lgbt people here but it's mostly white, Christian, and conservative. It seems like there a churches on every corner here and quite a few people are homophobic. I've heard some nasty things but I've never really had things to my face except for once.
I live in New York about 30 minutes away from Manhattan. People are pretty homophobic here because it’s a religious area. However, there are also many younger lgbtq people.
Can't say what it's like to live as nb here in NZ, because I'm not ready to be fully out yet qwq However, I think NZ is very progressive. We're legally recognised as gender diverse and our gender can be put on any form of identification such as passports and driver's licenses.

Finding someone who understands is another matter entirely. A huge part of why I'm afraid of coming out tbh. It hurts to not be understood and it's exhausting to explain over and over to someone who will never understand
I'm so sorry people don't understand you :( I hope you can find people around you who love and support you. Don't forget you've got a huge community of people online who care about you so so so much!

Where I live there are a lot of people who hate lgbtqia+ people but there are a good amount who are kind and caring too. It's really a gamble so I try to lay low, but I'm getting more confident about sharing my identity with others!

i'm from Poland too and yeah, it ain't fun. i'm lucky enough to have a few nb and queer friends, so at least i feel seen within my friend group, but the outside world sees us as nothing more than either extreme leftists or a cheap punchline
Language is gendered, most don't understand the concept and are rather hostile to anything that doesn't fit the ""norm"". I am lucky to be accepted by my mom, but afraid to tell anyone else. 
Such is life in Russia.
Manchester, UK - I'm almost universally assumed at first glance to be a butch lesbian. Being in my late 30s with kids fuels that. The city is pretty queer friendly in general, with some exceptions.
Well, most people who support the community are quiet about it and most who don't will find any excuse to say that they don't and call us ""sinners"". I find that funny because God is all about loving one another, yet they use Him to put people down.
I’m lucky to grow up in the UK. We still have our problems like everywhere else but I won’t pretend that I’ve had it as hard as you. You are absolutely amazing and I’m so sorry that you are made to feel the way you have.

in the US it really depends. I live in the gayborhood of a medium-sized city and I really haven’t run into any issues here. The sidewalks in my neighborhood are actually painted rainbow lol. But I grew up in a small, rural town not far from the city I live in, where I wouldn’t have felt safe being out.
My mom's side is from Poland, but we live in Canada. I am in an area in Canada where things aren't very accepted, I am bisexual and gender queer, but I'm not out to any of my family because a lot of my family is religious and homophobic. I am on the Pride committee in my city which has helped me so much to be accepted into a community, and I get to feel good by helping others. I recommend finding something like that for yourself if the people around you don't accept you for who you are.
half the population wants to kill me and voted for a fascist last year, so-
I love this photo. It reminds me of [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRb3xWoez7FKBNArEHRMbdLBpIvlQYijwpSJA&usqp=CAU) from Melancholia
Today was the first day of school and I had just cut my hair very short and I was going to wear a tie so I thought I was going to get bullied, however everyone was chill and the teacher that I had met for the first time said that my style was very cool. That made me really happy
New Zealand, I'm semi closeted because I don't feel confident to come out to work/family but my Doctor and Psychologist both know, and some friends. It's becoming much easier, though I still hear some comments I'd rather not.

Also I can change my gender on everything except my birth certificate no questions asked, no extra form work, which is nice. Birth Certificates may be being brought in line with all other IDs though.
I'm just 'gay'
In Spain is very very hard... I'm going through psychotherapy because people and Government don't want to listen us, they only care about binary people, etc.
Ok but you look like a Demi-god
US here. I live in a bit more southern area, so... Not great. Not awful. But not great either.
This photo is album cover worthy!
kinda crap, we're vilified here for basically no reason other than the ruling class is disgusted by us.

trans people in general, in fact, are constantly getting hit pieces in the papers.

i live in the UK by the way, i would say things aren't quite as bad as the reputation would suggest.
In Finland it's... okay maybe? At least compared to other countries. Gay rights are kinda happening and legally you can get married and stuff and most people I see aren't actively speaking out against gay people. As for trans rights it's not as good. NB ppl don't exist in tye eyes of law and a lot of people who I would view as fairly progressive don't at all recognise any nonbinary identities. For binary trans ppl it's quite hard to actually transition and a lot of people are semi openly transphobic, it's not frowned upon as much as open homophobia. That said though, there are plenty safe spaces and in majority of cities and towns you can find at least some kinda organisation catering for LGBT people young and old, who ask for pronouns and all that nice stuff. Even if it's not the best situation it's still miles better than a lot of countries so I feel quite lucky to live here. It also helps that I'm quite cis-straight passing.
Depends on where you live. In California, New York, and some other places (mostly big cities) it’s fine. But in the Midwest? Nah.

We’ve got a city  election coming up. Houses that never had political flags and stuff are showing signs for the conservative candidate. I thought my town was pretty half-and-half but I guess not.

Luckily my school is becoming more accepting. My teachers had us make name tags of our chosen names to keep on our desks.

But it’s still the Midwest, one of the most conservative states here. I want to move to NYC or somewhere in Southern California when I graduate. Big cities and places with good education are usually safer. California is one of the best states to live if you’re LGBTQIA+. I’d be farther away from family but I’d be safer.
Well getting hrt was really easy, but if I worked somewhere else it would probably be prohibitively expensive.
I'm from Poland too, and yes, it sucks-
Honestly it depends on where you live in the United States
Same... good luck in doing that❤️🙂
what country are you currently living in?
As someone who lives in Sweden, I can say that there are alot of lgbtq+ people, friendly spaces and allies (especially in and around the city from my experience). I have met a few not so nice people, but it's nothing too bad. Tho it can take a bit of time to get medical support, if that's something you wish for. Unfortunately there's not as much support for nonbinary people, but people are working on it and trying to push forward! So it's not perfect, but we're getting there!

If you ever come over here, I hope you feel welcome, accepted and enjoy your stay :>
And of course there’s the cheap loan you can take out from the government if you have 3 kids… But at least our language is not as gendered as others!
you from montgomery county too? lol
I live in a small hick town in Maryland , I was surprised to see you trans flag. Well, I was more shocked to see a bi flag in West Virginia about few miles away.
may I ask where you're from?
But 20 States allows you to put a x on your ID, with no legal consequences. So just pretend your birth certificate is genderless till they fix their system😄
Yeah, some parts of Washington are supportive, and safe, but once you get to the towns it's a toss up on who's going to view you as a person. Even medical staff sometimes.
I'm currently in a small town in the US, and I'm stuck between wanting to be who I am, and deciding where it's safe to be out. There are people in my town that are genuinely accepting, and allies, but there are just as many who would consider it fine if I was murdered. I hate it so much, and currently don't have a path out. Heck.
Thank you. I'm half joking but yeah, maybe one day
Germany😬 I mean of course it's worse in a lot of countries but it still sucks that it's virtually impossible to get dysphoria treatment here if you're not binary trans (and even then it can be incredibly difficult) and that I virtually have to misgender myself constantly because gender neutral words just don't... Exist
Thank you so much, that's really nice to hear
Yeah , bless my alien language for not overcomplecating everything ( just the grammar and the alphabet xd)
nope but very close!! ‘round Columbia! 💜I love to know there’s someone from around here on this sub.
I'm from Perú
I'm sorry you're experiencing that. It sucks. :(  
It's scary and so exhausting (emotionally and physically) when you feel like you have to hide who you are to be physically safe.   
I hope you are able to find a place that it feels safe for you to be yourself - even if it's just on the internet for now. 

Know that you are valid and worthy of love and respect always.
I feel you. German here as well and my SO is enby. I hope we'll find beautiful neutral words that non-binary people feel comfortable with :) our language is definitely making it hard
Yea another German here, many in my friend group are nonbinary and we hate our language :/

Sadly this happens to often		"My daily experience at work...
Lord, this. They will pretend to be the most respectful, kindest and accepting, and the second you've got a disagreement with them or any small fight for any reason, brace yourself for a olympic pool worth of disgusting bullshit about your orientation or identity because the mask falls very fast.
When people are insecure about something they tend to be more critical about any comments regarding it. Just an FYI
reminds me of my mom

""you can tell me everything, I will always support you""

""what do you mean you're NONBINARY TheRe ArE OnLY tWO geNDeRs""

never again.
Yup it still happens to many lesbians, gays, bis and pans smh
\^\^ my sister.
Omg I hate people who are like this. I'm recently coming out as non binary and I want to tell my parents at some point but I'm just unsure about how they'd handle it. I might wait until I move out so I don't have to deal with any potential repercussions. X(
Oooo it so annoying like I came out to my friend like this as bi and that happened so now I'm not coming out to them as demi-r, ace,gender apathetic,. I could go on but I think u get it
Insecurities aren't an excuse to be rude or homophobic to people
You wouldn't see a joke as rude or homophobic if you weren't insecure. Have a god damned sense of humor.
So what you've done here is you've imagined someone telling a joke and you've decided that the joke you imagined them telling is funny and harmless, therefore homophobic comments don't exist
Oh gee,you sound just like my LGBT+phobic parents with your ""LeArN tO gEt A sEnCe Of HumOr""
>therefore homophobic comments don't exist

Now you could make anyone look bad if you put words in their mouth.

I just think it's a bit odd that you would look at a comic where a hypothetical person is portrayed as saying unspecified homophobic things (something which does happen, you know, people can and do say homophobic things) and your first instinct is to defend this hypothetical homophobe because you reckon whatever they said probably wasn't homophobic.
Didn't sound like it
Don't pull that bullshit.
> I'm on your side 

You don't get to decide that when people are calling you out on shitty behaviour.
first instinct, no. I actually stopped to think about what I wanted to say for a min.

and defend? no.

That's the 3rd time you've put words in my mouth. lmao

anyways I'm just saying a good percentage of the time where **we** get offended (I'm including myself) they're really just being funny and it could often get interpreted as a backhanded comment. Don't get me wrong, I validate all of your experiences, **some** of those guys who commented something dumb to you are legit dumb, but I'm just sayin. We shouldn't take any and every opportunity to get offended just cause the opportunity presents itself. We shouldn't let people control our emotions like that.
No clue what mountain was on about but I promise it's how you took it. I wanna share a [guide](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201606/5-keys-handling-judgmental-and-opinionated-people) I read recently. I'm following a path in life that's far from the norm and it's presented tools that I haven't considered but have found to be really helpful. Maybe it's something you're interested in? You seem pretty open minded.

or maybe see the good in people
Being on their side is not shitty behavior. If you can't see it then it's on you.

If you don't trust anyone just cause they're cis you are utterly insane. Make friends, not enemies.
It's just, you know, a bit weird that that's your response to someone making a comic discussing their experience with homophobic people.

I mean it doesn't come across as validating, as you say. It kinda comes across as the opposite, even if you didn't intend that. So uh, maybe you should have thought about it a bit longer
The word you're looking for is resiliency and that can come from having a strong support system. I don't need my support system to also be tearing me down, thanks.
You know nothing about me, I've had my fair share of trauma in life
I know this must come as a surprise, but human beings aren't plants.
Just don't be a dick.
Who the fuck is talking about being cis?

You're telling people to ignore transphobia, there's nothing supportive about that.
hold on there's lots of comments in this chain, I'm getting lost here. Which one of my comments are we talking about?
[deleted]
Seeing good in people is being a dick? okay then 😂
I'm not saying to ignore transphobia, I'm saying it can help you process your emotions better if you identify it more accurately and be more forgiving when there's ambiguity.
The first one, and then also the ones defending that position.

Just your position overall, really.

I don't want to put words in your mouth here, since I'm sure you had good intentions, but your position *comes across* as though you're telling us not to take offence at homophobia and homophobic jokes since they're just jokes and we're only offended because we're insecure.

Like, that's not validating, and it's not helpful. If anything it's kinda rude, and it comes across as dismissive of people's struggles in dealing with homophobia.

So, you know, if that's not what you were tryign to say I would suggest thinking a bit more about what you're saying and how it might be recieved by the people you're saying it to, in future.

And if it what you're trying to say, then maybe stop because it's not a good position
Have you ever considered that maybe you should treat mental health as mental health instead of constantly trying to act like it's comparable to plants and weightlifting?

Trauma doesn't make you stronger. The human mind isn't a muscle or a plant, causing it prolonged strain won't improve it.

Also, if weightlifting is causing you constant pain, you're not doing it right.
If the topic is prejudiced people saying hurtful things (which is what the comic is depicting) telling people to just ""see the good in people"" ~~is being a dick.~~ isn't as nice or helpful as you think.
> to take offence at homophobia and homophobic jokes since they're just jokes and we're only offended because we're insecure.

close but not quite. I think I've been more than clear on my stance. I stand by every word of my first comment and I believe that when there's amiguity in what someone is saying we should er more on the side of thinking the best of them.

I think that's it right? we both said our thing? I gotta ask about your username though, is that a reference to what I think it is? lol
That doesn't make the least bit of sense. Why do you want to be enemies?
Just to elaborate a bit, if what you're trying to say is ""don't listen to the haters queen, homophobes' opinions don't matter"", then that's good, that's a sentiment I can get behind.

But what it instead *feels* like you're doing is defending homophobic positions as ""just jokes"" and therefore not offensive. Which, you know, is bad. But it's a fine line so I can definitely see how you might do that unintentionally. So I don't blame you, if that's what's happened here.

But if you do think the second thing, of how homophobic jokes are fine since they're just jokes, then i do blame you. Consider yourself blamed, lol. Idk.

As for my username i have no idea what you're talking about, sorry
>I believe that when there's amiguity in what someone is saying we should er more on the side of thinking the best of them.

I agree with that in theory, but I also think seeing the best in people can be dangerous sometimes. I think it can be helpful to consider both possibilities, don't assume someone is a bad person, but don't assume they're a safe person either. 

For instance, my grandfather was someone I always had to be kept away from. I could have worked on seeing the best in him when he was alive, and that might have been helpful on an emotional level; but if I had used that as a reason to make a connection with him, I would have ended up getting hurt.
I don't want to be enemies, your comments we just bothering me. I've edited my previous comment.
>As for my username i have no idea what you're talking about, sorry

ah I thought it was referencing Tiananmen Square massacre. My b lmao
You seem like a very reasonable person. You think about your values. I admire that.
Didn't see the edit. Anyways how would you say I should I encourage others to see the good in people?
I just edited it after I read your reply. I think context matters; if the context is people talking about someone being homophobic to them, or otherwise hurtful, I think it may be best not to bring it up. If someone is saying ""this person is being hurtful to me"" and you say ""you should try to see the best in people"" that comes across as a defense of the abusive person.
I see, from my angle I think of all the times I've said a joke that most people take well and I think of all the times someone took that same joke poorly because they didn't want to see the intention of it.

I still don't think I did anything wrong by suggesting we all be more forgiving. I see that the culture of nonbinary is very rewarding to sensitivity and I don't necessarily see that as a good thing when it becomes reminiscent of explosive irritability. I'm sorry. I tried really hard understanding :/
>I see, from my angle I think of all the times I've said a joke that most people take well and I think of all the times someone took that same joke poorly because they didn't want to see the intention of it.

I think everyone's done that at times. The thing is, I think this meme implies that the other person is being intentionally hurtful, so telling the people who relate to the image that they should consider the possibility that the other person was well meaning seems dismissive to me. If someone is saying that another person is being hurtful, I think it's often best to just listen. 

If someone is already feeling hurt, I think suggesting they may be wrong about the situation seems misguided and often hurtful. I replied to another one of your using my grandfather as an example, and I think it might work best to do that again here: If I said ""I never knew my grandfather on my mother's side, but I know she had good reasons to keep me away from him. It makes me angry to think about how he hurt my mom."" and someone said ""Well, if you didn't know your grandfather, how do know he was really abusive? Maybe you should keep an open mind."" that would make me feel terrible.
We agree to disagree, it's fine. We don't need to burn anymore time. lol"	lhgk6k	NonBinary	985	1.0	2021-02-11 08:46:42

Mother keeps reading the Daily Mail and my Dad has previously agreed with the TERFy comments that Greer said...
Hello from Ohio! Big Sad sucks. My (terrible) therapist said that if I stop wanting acceptance from my parents, it won't hurt when I don't get it.  I'm proud of you for being honest about who you are and for pursuing the things you want. I hope to have that courage someday.
Yeah Big Sad™ sucks. If it makes you feel any better you are very much goals.

I’m turning 40 soon. I wore this dress the first time I went out in public in femme over 13 years ago. I was 26, sad, alone, confused, and doing it because it was true. I’m so proud of myself for staying true to who I am through all of these years, and building family based on that.		"Im so anxious about not looking ""young"" androgynous but when i see older enbys looking great i always feel like one day ill be right where i wanna be c:
That is awsome to hear. And I adore that dress!
I’m proud of you too. And thankful to see someone owning their non-binary body and soul when they’re about to be 40!!! You’re a bright light for younger enbys. Thanks for being here ♥️
You look like you could front a really cool punk band! Love the dress
Way to rock it! I hope I can get to that place! Absolutely awesome dress
Absolutely fabulous
Rock on, sister.
You look so good in it! I think I might have to buy one myself while I still have the confience to try one on.  I'm not sure how the sizes work though.
I am proud of you too. Nobody can take the courage you developed away or the peace that comes with being true to yourself. People that mock have their own insecurities they are too afraid to face and live in some degree of delusion.
Beautiful courage! 🖤
Amazing amazing 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👌🏻🌟🌟🌟🌟
My anxiety is so much more settled compared to when is was in my 20’s.  I think the biggest shift for me was the combination of self acceptance of where I am in the present, and giving less and less of a fuck what everybody else things of where I am.
Go to a store and try different sizes until you find your size!
I admire your bravery. Much more than my own which is much much less. Self acceptance, Im getting there, and Im just getting to the IDGAF door , and walk through it. And for me personally its how I feel about myself , and where I am. I dont care what others see honestly, when I look into a mirror I know what I see. Im just not so brave enough to go out in public as such.
Still not quite confident enough for that.
oh man, i know it's scary.... maybe your first step could be to just go to a store and peruse the ""women's"" section. and the next time you could grab ONE garmen and go into the fitting room.

otherwise, you could buy like 3 sizes online (in the size range you think you might be in), and try it at home, then return the ones that didn't fit. i've done this, it works!"	dlb55i	NonBinary	805	1.0	2019-10-22 02:17:24
Was not allowed in a bar cause of a no bags for men policy	"I’m non-binary amab. I went to meet up with some friends at a barcade that was in a “sports bar” type area, not my typical scene but I didn’t think much of it.
My style is somewhat androgynous, long hair, light make up, baggy pants, crop top.
As I walk up to the bouncer he tells me
I can’t bring my bag (it’s my small purse) in. I look around a point to the nearest woman who has a huge purse and tell him that she has a bag. He then says “no bags for guys”…. Ouch
I was to embarrassed to explain my gender cause I knew he wouldn’t care so I told him it’s my purse and once again he says “idc no bags for guys”… 
I walk away in a sad defeated mood and just go home. 
Sigh. Nothing I can do about it just wanted to vent."	"I would really like to hear their reasoning for this policy. It sounds so arbitrary!
as someone who carries medication with them 24/7, that ""rule"" doesn't protect anyone. I would complain because that rule is super ableist, if they're worried about weapons just have a bag check policy.
This is like...one of my biggest fears. I'm so sorry! Being misgendered is bad enough, but being misgendered and also kept out of a public establishment specifically BECAUSE you were misgendered? I'd be absolutely gutted! And at a barcade of all places? In my city, those are usually pretty low-key venues where no one would expect violence to happen, none of them even have bouncers! I can't even wrap my head around why a barcade would have a policy like that out of fear of violence. Did you check on the barcade's website to see if that's actually a policy? It wouldn't surprise me if the bouncer was just making shit up because he's phobic.
Is there a different barcade in your area? I would just suggest you and your friends never go back, that place isnt worth y'all's time nor money
I'd be writing a negative review online. If they're worried about drugs, weapons, etc. they can just check bags. Also... do they assume that only men carry that stuff? Check bags, end of story.
Personally, I'd recommend writing online about it. Not about that bouncer bc you don't want anyone to lose their job, but if you publicise it they might be more likely to get with the times.
No bags for men? They should let them have bags and just check them. Anyway that’s bullshit sorry that happened
I've heard no bags for anyone or no bags of x size, but this is a weird rule
The idea that only folks that the bouncer perceives as men are capable of violence is fucked. There’s a music venue that used to pat me down until my presentation became femme enough. I still get pretty upset about it when I see them do it to the men.

I suppose it goes without saying, but a violent asshole could also make someone put the weapon in their purse. This establishment solved no problems with their discrimination.
My mom saw the same BS decades ago, before I was born. That ""men"" couldn't bring bags places because they might have weapons. She thought it was very sexist and knowing her she made a loud fuss about it whenever it came up. 

I'm so sorry. This nonsense is stupid. Either check bags for safety or don't. Profiling people and being bigoted is wrong. Was then is now
That's shitty. I'm sorry that happened to you.
That is such a dumb rule, and it's definitely discriminatory.
That bouncer was talking out of his ass, go complain and make a stink.

No bags for guys? In a sports bar? Nah, bouncer talking absolute shit, there's no way that's a rule. How many dudes are rocking up with gym bags? Is the bar willing to accept consequences and pay out when cars are broken into and dudes bags are stolen? DOes the bouncer, since its his policy?

What about dudes who might need to carry stuff with them from work, or for medical or personal reasons? What if someone prefers to keep their diabetic wallet in a bag rather than their pocket, like every diabetic I know? What if you had asthma inhalers in there? 

Once again, it MUST therefore be bar/bouncer policy that they accept responsibility if a customer has a medical crisis because they cant bring their fucking bag inside.

&#x200B;

WHat a fucking.....blert, this fucking bouncer, fuck. This has pissed me off. He was so fucking threatened that he just lied to you? What a coward.

&#x200B;

He can fucking check inside your bag for contraband.

Make it a thing. WOMEN are just able to carry weapons, drugs or other contraband, the bar is actually being misogynistic in that policy. 

Bullshit, make a HUGE stink of this, that bouncer let his vile, shallow, narrow minded bias show and now you get to destroy him.
Give them really bad reviews everywhere pls. So more people are aware that this isn't a save space.
I'm really sorry you went through this. I can't imagine how terrible and embarrassing that must have felt. Some people just cannot think outside of their own comfort zone, and even things that are changing are changing far too slowly.
what a shitty bar. also get better friends that take you out to better places and go home with you if you get thrown out over bullshit like this situation.  
if i was you i would make the bar public.
pure homophobia
Don't be afraid to tell us what bar it was and what the bouncer looked like, OP.
This is really frustrating, I hope the bar goes bankrupt >:'(
Honestly I've been to sports bars that have long lists of don'ts posted outside that are discriminatory but apparently it's allowed. There are bars that don't allow head coverings of any kind, caps worn backwards, etc etc. It's NOT a safety thing. It's discrimination. Same with bags for men. If it's about guns and knives they will check all bags and sometimes have metal detectors (I've been to these bars too).

The only reason to deny service to a paying customer for their appearance is discrimination! Hands down. It's only related to safety if you're a bigot and think that appearances make someone immoral or wrong or a criminal.
Wait wtf
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, I'm sorry that happened
You probably dodged a bullet in that place anyway. Any bar that has gender-specific policy is probably little more than a hook up spot.
That's infuriating to hear. I carry a bag with me to the LGBTQ bar I frequent, and if there's a new door person there, they just check the bag. They have a ""no large bags"" policy (obviously waived for the night's drag performers) and check everyone's bags on weekends - men, women, and those of us outside the binary. It's a simple process. I wish everyone did that, and I'm so sorry you had to deal with being shamed.
Hand it to a female friend. Now its her purse. Then reverse.
I'm not arguing it's OK or fair but bouncers have to deal with it when 💩 goes down and there may have been a past incident with, weapons, drugs, theft, or just dumb drunk drama that is driving the rule.  Not exactly a defence but service industry jobs can really suck.  try not to make them worse.
I'm agender AFAB and I would feel poorly about my unisex bag being designated a ""lady purse"" at a place like this. You should leave a bad review on Yelp to warn others.
That’s terrible I’m sorry 🤦 makes me shake my head at the stupidity of this world
I would look into that honestly cuz that’s discrimination
Wow that's fucking so stupid I hope you and your friends never go back there
Like the previous poster said. It’s most likely about weapons. I’ve seen this at other venues as well. However given the fact that I lean more to the femme side in gender and appearance and my purse is quite small it was upsetting
Gonna say they figure men are more likely to be carrying weapons?
Yep, my EpiPen doesn't fit in my pocket and most places serving food don't care about allergens.
There’s a barcade in New Orleans that’s been dealing with some violence. https://geekimpulse.com/sea-cave-arcade-and-bar-attacked-menacing/amp/
People losing their jobs because of transphobia is fine by me. They endangered their own livelihood by enacting violence.
Yeah, the way white women are put on a pedestal as being harmless or incapable of doing anything harmful isn't right. When transitioning (trans woman), I noticed that cops either completely ignore me, or trip over themselves to be polite.
Yea this was my first thought. Like why didn’t the friends offer to go somewhere else?
This doesn't fly at all in this case if the bouncer freely allowed women with huge bags into the bar. Women can raise just as much hell and can definitely fit contraband items in their bagss. 

There is no such thing as a 'no bags for men' policy at any bar in the history of bars, ever.

There are bag search policies. Bouncer showed his bias, cost his bar custom and money, offended a customer, its simple.
If the policy is only applied to certain people that's discrimination
In Germany it's normal that no one is allowed to bring bags (like in TV studios) or for stuff like bars and partys the bouncer just checks through, that you don't bring anything in like weapons, drugs, whatever... 🤷🏻‍♀️

Such ridiculous stuff like ""no bags for gender"" is straight discrimination.
If that's the case they could check everyone's bags that they take in instead of that rule
Thanks for sharing your rant! Obvs I share the outrage expressed in this thread 

I have an anecdote to share: My younger brother is cis but when he started carrying this tote bag around he started calling it a purse. Ofc I’m like finally someone with some sense, a bag is a purse and a purse is a bag no matter who carries it! But then he told me that it was just so he could bring an extra bag while traveling by plane (they’re often, but also arbitrarily, not counted as carry-ons.) 

My point is the arbitrary aspect, people need to carry things while they’re out, my brother simply started calling it something else and people were more inclined to allow it… I’m sorry that did not sway this bouncer. 

The size of the bag is reasonable grounds for denying entrance (I kno you said it was small tho) the fact that people gender the use of bags will always be nonsensical. The same attention is being paid to backpacks but if I carried my small backpack on my one shoulder they considered it a purse. Again nonsensical.
If there is a no bag rule, it should apply to everyone. Basing it on gender is extremely bias and discriminatory. AFABs can carry the same weapons as any AMAB and use them.

In my state this would be clear discrimination against gender orientation, but I don't know if that is the case where you live.

I'm sorry you had to go through this. I'd leave bad reviews for the place wherever I could if it were me but I'm kinda petty over stuff like this lol
It’s not about weapons. It’s homophobia. There are a lot of bars that have “anti-gay” dress codes that only apply to amab. It was very popular in my college town and my partner just ran into this issue last night at a bar in Toronto. If it was about weapons, they would look in your bag as they do for female purses. This fucking sucks that this happened to you.
Aren't bags normally checked by the bouncer?
They would be surprised by me then (well armed and usually passing trans woman).
So what though? That doesn’t mean they will only be carried by men, or that a man won’t put one in his female companion’s bag.
Yeah lol tell that to my mom who takes a pistol pretty much everywhere she goes
They may not be transphobic, they may not even like the rules themselves, but would have to enforce the rules of the business to not get fired.
Yeah, especially considering that I and many people I know have been victims of violence at the hands of white women, it's really fucked up.
Yes it's  unfair, biased and bad ploicy.  

My only argument is that Bouncers have a terrible job a main component of which is dealing with sloppy and violent drunks.   There's a good chance if they're turning people away it's based on a recent incident or incendents.  The criteria might be unfair biased and ill informed but my bet that there is something behind the Bouncers actions.
In Finland we have a coat till function at most bars. Bags and coats need to be left at the entrance to a worker run coat hanger system, it costs like 2€, you get a ticket that you exchange to get your stuff back when you leave. No one is allowed in with bags or outdoors coats.
I used to keep everyone’s dab pens in my purse in a secret pocket that I easily could put a small knife in and never got caught. They never look that hard in my experience
Didn't say it wasn't discrimination either way. Just made an assumption.
This is a set of rules that can easily be pushed against. The head bouncer typically dictates the standard, anyway.
OP is not a man, therefore the rule doesn’t even apply. Bioessentialism is inherently transphobic. You can’t look at someone and know their gender identity.
Sexual abuse in childhood by two different white cis women, one of the two nearly murdered by sister on several occasions. 

I believe cis women are every bit as capable of evil, but because it is usually domestic violence or child abuse, they don't get held accountable.
This is normally optional here, but I think it's a good rule. So you don't have all the bags and coats laying around and occupying for example seat space.
No, the manager dictates the standard. The bouncer lets people in who the manager told them not to, the bouncer gets in trouble. No matter the circumstances. Even if the rule is as stupid as this one.
And people make mistakes without full knowledge. Most people have no idea what non-binary is, and most people have never met a trans person before. People make assumptions. It’s not great, but it’s what happens.
Yep, exactly. That was the case for me and my friends as well :/
Bouncers don’t always listen to what they’re told to enforce. And, as stated before, there’s no way to tell what someone’s gender is. If they have a bag, assume they’re allowed and check it if you must. It’s really not that far fetched.
“Most people have never met a trans person before”—do you realize how many trans people exist in this world? This is absolutely false. They may believe they’ve never met one of us, but that doesn’t make it so.
There are 7.753 billion people in this world. 

Of the populations studied, one source is saying that only 0.1 to 2% of people are trans. Another source says Worldwide estimates for transwomen are 1 in every 30,000 people. Transmen are estimated at 1 in every 100,000 people. 

For the US, a source says: According to the Williams Institute, 1.4 million adults identify as transgender in the United States. About 0.7% of adults 18-24 identify as transgender, and 0.5% of adults 65 and older identify as transgender.

(Now obviously estimates will be lower as many people struggle to be out publicly, but it’s still relevant data)

So yeah, most people have never met a trans person before. We aren’t numerous. Obviously there is a few of us around, especially in places like this where we congregate, making it seem like there’s a whole lot. But in the grand scheme of the world we are minuscule. Our population is tiny. The chances of meeting a trans person is small, and many haven’t. 

I’m non-binary and I’ve never met another trans person in person. Only online. I’m part of my countries’ local trans group, a group that represents trans identities across my country, and it only has 2.5k members. Including ally’s. I’ve not seen another non-binary member in this group.
You’ve never KNOWINGLY met another trans person. There is truly no way to know how many of us there are as there is no set way of appearing trans. Also: the definition is very western and people who don’t identify as cis go by many names, and always have. This is, imo, a silly hill to die on.
Just because you don’t like the stats doesn’t mean they’re not true. We are a tiny population. 

Yes, sure, I may have met another trans person who didn’t mention it or wasn’t out yet. But that is entirely unknowable. I may also have never met another trans person at all. It’s just as likely because it’s also unknowable.

And as far as I’m aware, I’ve never met another in person. That is my lived experience as a trans person who seeks out queer spaces. Imagine a cis person.
I neither like nor dislike them. I just know how complicated statistics are to gather in the first place. The margin for error is wild and, as we’re already saying, because of how difficult it is to know, how on earth do statisticians know how often we “occur”? Which definitions of transness are included in these numbers? Excluded? These are muddy waters. Bouncers aren’t considering these numbers, they’re trying to oversimplify shit and that means we get caught in the crossfire—OP was caught in the crossfire and I don’t give a rat’s ass of the person discriminating against them gets fired; there are other jobs and hopefully they get their act together and learn if by some chance they didn’t already know about trans people.
Accusing people of transphobia when we don’t know if they are malicious or just ignorant doesn’t help. 

What OP went through was awful but again, we have no idea of the bouncers intentions. They could indeed be transphobic. They could just be following orders to not get fired, based on cisgender assumptions. “There’s other jobs” is a very ignorant thing to say tbh. 

I’m tired of you so will no longer reply. I’ve given you statistics. I’ve given you examples. Assuming everyone is maliciously out to get us all the time is exhausting. Sometimes people are just ignorant because they don’t know better.
Transphobia doesn’t imply intent. Microagressions happen constantly and often come from well-meaning people. You’re making very limited western-centric arguments. Be as tired as you like—it’s still a silly hill to die on. Nuance is lacking in all you provided.
You’re assuming I’m western. Should I accuse you of racism? Or perhaps you’re just being ignorant, and going from your own assumptions? And I shouldn’t assume you racist since you don’t know better?
“Western-centric arguments” is not “you are western”. My goodness.
I’m really not sure how this has devolved so wildly, and prefer you being “tired of” me. This is me throwing my towel in lol.
You are assuming my arguments are western centric. They are not. They are worldwide, as the stats I provided were worldwide, though I included some US stats too since there’s a bigger concentration there than other places for fairness. Assuming I’m coming from a place of western centricism is racist, according to your own perceptions. So you’re racist now, just like how that bouncer is now transphobic. Just using your logic. 

Trans people aren’t just a western idea. Trans identities aren’t inherently western. I genuinely have no idea why you seem to think my points are western-centric. Is it just because we’re speaking English, and using the English word for trans? That seems very English-centric of you :/

Accusing me of western-centricism based on nothing was ridiculous so I’m being just as ridiculous back."	wyuo7r	NonBinary	704	1.0	2022-08-27 05:33:30
Denied top surgery	"Went on my last meeting today where they basically told me that being nonbinary isn’t a thing and that they only treat people that are trans with gender dysphoria. Two years ago they said I’m nonbinary bc I’m obese…. then I lost 15cm in my waistline out of spite. Now they said I’m showing too much progress so I have the ”capability to live with my struggles.” Fuck Sweden. LGBT inclusive my ass lmfao

Also doesn’t help that I’m autistic so they just think I’m being confused.

EDIT; oh gosh, I didn’t really expect to get 40+ comments so this is a bit overwhelming but thank you guys for the support !!

I had been advised by most of my FTM trans friends to lie about my identity but sadly it was a bit too late for that as I was halfway through my meetings. 

The reason I didn’t lie is because after the first meeting, the doctor told me that the gov had gotten more inclusive and included nonbinary people. I had thought to myself: 
”Oh, I’m getting lucky!! Guess there is no need to lie.” 

The meeting I went to yesterday she informed me that.. the gov had removed that right once again. She really wanted to help me but she was simply just not allowed to anymore. The only other organisation that included nonbinary people is across the country and now that has also been limited by the gov.
They’re really just trying to limit us from getting help and being happy.

Next step will be time consuming or money consuming and honestly at this point I’d just want to go the money route despite how limited my wallet is. 

Oh well. I’ll get through this eventually :’)"	"Whattttt so sorry to hear this D: 
Is going private an option for you?
Lie to them I guess?
I'm sorry to hear this.
I also live in a country where they don't recognise non-binary as valid. Didn't even try it here. There's only one gender clinic with 10 years wait.

I'm getting my top surgery next week. Going abroad where you don't need any medical proof, just mutual acceptance. Downside is that you need the money for that. But I couldn't be more excited right now.

Have you looked into this possibility?
Sadly its the same thing in Canada (at least when I got top surgery). Although I do have gender dysphoria, I said I was a trans man because I heard that the surgeons will deny people who are nonbinary from getting top surgery.

I'm so sorry about that. It's not fair.
They thought your gender identity was caused by obesity? 🙄
You ""kids"" are trailblazers! Keep fighting for your right.

I'm 53. I'm nonbinary. I have always wished I could have my boobs removed. They get in the way. Bras are awful, uncomfortable and damaging. I don't use them so why have them?

But for me there was no surgery available because I was born a woman and women have boobs. You ""kids"" have changed all of that. 

Duck that. Push. Fight. Change doctors. You deserve to be the best you that you can be.

I'm proud of you. Good luck.
If you are looking for advice: lie to them

If not, man im so sorry. Its bullshit that they don’t recognize your gender or respect your wishes.
idiots will blame everything on obesity
I'm so sorry to hear this.
 I always thought if there's any country in the world, where enby top surgery would be covered it's sweden.

*Sigh.*

In germany there is the option to flat out lie to all doctors and psychiatrist/psychologists that you are a binary trans* guy (you then still may need a ""good"" reason for not wanting to go on T ; or find a doctors who is accepting and understanding and willing to lie to insurances with you )

Or

You pay for it on your own- most places I've looked into also have options for payment plans- 

I don't know if any of those things are an option for you.

I wish you all the best and hope you'll be able to find a way eventually.
Transphobia and ableism wow.
????? Goofy as hell.

Pull a fast one and just say you're a dude. What're they gonna do, put your boobs back in once they do the surgery?
You would think that they would support nonbinary people since they’re the same country that officially implemented they/them pronouns in their language
Ugh I'm so sorry. Unfortunately when I go to the Dr I have to larp the ""Hello it is me, He/Him super binary man and I love monster trucks and fishing!"" in order to get healthcare. It honestly feels impossible to force them to understand the nuances of gender, so my only advice is to just lie. It sucks but the end result made it worth it for me.
Yeah, Sweden sucks. r/transnord recommends lying about it and saying you're FtM.
🤗 (If you like)
Find a new doctor/therapist.
I feel your pain, I was denied in Germany a few years ago because I naively believed they'd accept non-binary people. I'm so sorry this happened to you.
can you go back and say, ""so after some soulsearching it turns out I'm ftm""? or can you approach a new care organization to start fresh?
I'm so sorry this happened to u

The gatekeeping system is so fucking disgusting in the EU 

This is just institutional oppression, nothing else
Pal, you better lie.
So sorry to hear this and I hope you find another way forward.

Sweden is honestly the most conformist non-affirming place I've ever been to and I'm from Africa.
Hi from Stockholm. I wanted radical reduction because my chest was giving me dysmorphia. I went to Kry to a GP ask about that. And they told me “that kind of things u do privately “.
I told her it’s not the case, that I can be diagnosed and get my surgery. So they put me in a waiting list to a clinic that does it. 2 years waiting time for the first appointment, and then it can take 2 years to be diagnosed. The GP was calling me “transsexual” coz her English wasn’t good and my Swedish isn’t enough to talk about medical issues.

I could have a regular reduction as I qualified but then they would make it just a bit smaller, “proportional to by body”, which I am sure it’s not what I need. Long story short I went privately in Dec…
Feel you 💔❤️
Lie, many Non Binary people to do it to get care. 
I was lucky i didn't need to lie, but about half of my Docters asked if i wasn't just a trans man. Because I'm really masc leaning.
So sorry to hear that.
What the fucking fuck. I’m so sorry. That’s not okay
I'm sorry you're going through this right now!! One of my partners is Swedish and they've expressed having a hard time getting trans health care. The trans healthcare system in Sweden truly seems to be garbage.
Honestly, I would send this info to the news. Read just now in DN about how a tv profile who appears to be nb (använder hen som pronomen men är fem-presenting) apparently had few problems getting breast implants to better conform to their gender. They might have done it through private means, was a long text and don't quite remember, but at least the topic is getting a bit of a spotlight at the moment
I’m so sorry your going through that, I hope something works out soon for you!
Lie. Get what you need.
i shall sprint to sweden and commit murder for you
The fact that I knew this was one of the Scandinavian countries just by reading the first few sentences omg..  
That sounds horribly frustrating and we got a pretty similar situation here in Norway from what I've heard. I'm definitely planning on just telling my doctors that I'm a trans man (technically half-true, so it's fine) because anything else is way too big of a risk. Progressive countries like ours shouldn't be this behind when it comes to trans healthcare. Super frustrating tbh
As a nonbinary person who is also seeking top surgery, this is my biggest fear and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 
You are valid in your identity, and I urge you to not give up on getting what you need to be comfortable in your body. 
Much love, friend!
I’m just stopping by to show some solidarity. This sucks, it’s wrong of them to deny you this, and I’m sorry that it’s complicating your journey even further.
Gaddam Sweden sure is handing out the backhands for troons today. In another sub a trans girl said they told her she has to be socially transitioned for a year (wearing skirts and makeup out before passing) before they allow her HRT. 

wtf I thought Sweden was like the beat place in the world to live or some shit
Jävla dårar!
That sucks! Exactly the reason I never wanted to transition medically (I'm also in Sweden).
well.. yes.
Em isbitnstill a demand that you get sterilzed before you can under go g""gender affirming care""?
I'm sorry.
it MIGHT be? There is another organisation but its all across the country. it has recently gotten a rule that I need a doctors note that my doctors arent allowed to give bc I’m nonbinary so it’ll be a bit hard
This is, sadly, the way. The amount of times I've needed to lie to doctors due to gender bias is infuriating.
What country are you traveling to?
How much does it cost? Im from the uk and the guidance says they only do top surgery on people who have been on T for 2 years. Im not interested in going on T but have a lot of top dysphoria. Cost for private surgery here is like 10000. Way outta my budget.
Good luck with your surgery btw and let us know how it went!
That's genuinely baffling to me. I'm in the southeastern US and like nobody had an issue (and I'm AFAB and generally femme presenting). Like... its your body and if you want to lob your tatas into the abyss then you should be able to lob your tatas into the abyss.
Wait, they will? :(  
I'm a Canadian enby who has thought about top surgery but never mind, I guess...
Really? I know several non binary people who got their top surgery covered by the Canadian govt in Ontario.
Anti-fatness is the real disease - it makes people act like monsters and treat those in larger bodies as less than human.  Like so what if someone’s fat?! (A word which I use in a neutral sense) If they want to chop their boobs or get any kind of gender affirming surgery, care, joint replacements, etc., why tf are they being denied - I do not buy this utter bullshit about ‘well the anesthesia is harder to do and dangerous and blah blah blah - like no, because you’re happy enough to rush someone into surgery and take their money when it’s a bariatric surgery.  But God forbid fat folks have access to life-improving care of other types.  SMH🫠  Bigotry is so gross.
Can confirm. Everything from my intelligence to my health to my gender to my sexual orientation to my political convictions is somehow caused by and/or invalidated by my weight. It's maddening.
Do you have tips for dealing with the psychiatrist examinations in Germany? I've talked to another guy about this and he said that I won't get their approval bc I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and now I'm (ironically) too scared to continue looking for one
Exactly. This makes my future look darker, too be honest
Unfortunately my understanding is that Swedish authorities work hard to shut down all providers that do not conform to their rigid rules. That sucks terribly badly but medical tourism is an option.
Ya
Barcelona, Catalonia. I have surgery with Dr. Brasó
Yeah, it's exactly the same here in Ireland.
In Barcelona you're looking at 5-6k in a good clinic, maybe less if a less known clinic. They're also more used to doing them surgeries over there, so I do trust them more than if I was to get it here.
[deleted]
It really depends where you are in Canada, don't lose hope! The place I went was fine with NB people getting surgery
Not everywhere! I've actually never heard of that, its disappointing to know parts of Canada are less progressive. But, my friend is non-binary, they're not on HRT (they dont plan to transition that way), and they recently got top surgery in Vancouver :) I believe the wait was much less than a year and it cost them like $15 lol (had to pay for anesthetic)
Not everywhere and not every surgeon! Mine was covered by OHIP and this was back in 2017-2018. Things may be different now, but back then I had to lie about being nonbinary.
Oh mine was covered too! I only paid $2000 out of pocket after the OHIP coverage.  


I'm saying moreso that I had to lie that I was a binary trans man (and also that I didn't have any mental health issues) in order to get top surgery. This was back in 2017/2018. Most nonbinary people I talked to had told me to say I was a trans man because many of them were denied for being nonbinary. Others were for being autistic.
My biggest recommendation is going to/calling/email-ing a dedicated counseling for trans*.
They know the local doctors, psychiatrists , etc and frequently deal with health insurance relate trans* issues.

Having other diagnoses does not automatically mean you can't get a diagnosis for dysphoria, being trans*, etc and medial letters and access to at least parts of trans healthcare.

There are people (even frequent psychiatry in-patients with multiple diagnoses) that get at least indication letters and HRT...

Approval for surgeries is in most cases a long and complicated process, often with rejections, for all sorts of reasons (according to my friend who was in contact with a trans counseler in a big city in NRW, she started her process in 2022)
Quite frequently only not accepting the decision of your Krankenkasse and going to court gets the final approval... 

I'm sorry I don't have more details or more positive things to share, I hope it was helpful anyways.
I hope there is some kind of support existing in your area - knowledge about who and what to look for (and what to avoid) can make daunting tasks much less scary.
Thanks a bunch! Gives me some hope for the future.
Oh I’m well aware that I’m one of the lucky people and not everyone can access care. I don’t personally have anyone telling me I can’t do what I’m doing (well nobody with the power to stop me).
This was in Ontario and back in like 2016-2018 for me. It was covered by OHIP for me besides $2000 (to make it 'look nice'). But yeah, things might be different now!  
I just know that prior to my top surgery, I had nonbinary friends who advised me to say I was a binary trans man."	10wcdoi	NonBinary	634	1.0	2023-02-07 20:36:20
I want to be feminine, but it makes some people uncomfortable.	"I found alot of comments in transgender subreddits,
alot of the post comments or posts in those reddits say they avoid nb people who are feminine or masculine because:
-They get dysphoria
-Don't wanna be seen as gay or straight
-Believe nb people should look androgynous or they're fake cause they're not putting in effort to be labeled correctly. 
It makes me feel a bit sad cause I'm a feminine nb and I don't wanna make someone uncomfortable cause I'm causing dysphoria or making them look fake.. Its making me second guess my identity, I don't wanna make trans people uncomfortable or embarrased."	"Nah that person's just transphobic
Non-binary people can present in any way they're comfortable with, just like any other gender identity, because presentation doesn't define gender, and gender doesn't define presentation.

If a person experiences distressing thoughts and feelings based on seeing you, that's *their* problem, not yours. We are each responsible for our own thoughts and feelings and reactions. If I can *cause* someone to experience dysphoria, that takes away their agency. That means they will be forever at the whims of whoever walks past them for whether they feel happy and valid or not. That's not healthy.

Let's look at a similar case. A woman dresses a particular way to a party. She is sexually assaulted. The perpetrator of that heinous crime doesn't get to say ""she shouldn't have dressed that way if she didn't want to be assaulted."" That's an obviously fallacious argument people make in an effort to try to shift responsibilty for their actions or feelings onto someone else. It doesn't fly with blaming clothing for sexual assault, and it doesn't fly blaming non-binary people for a binary trans person experiencing dysphoria. We call the former victim blaming, and we call the latter trans/enbyphobia. They're the same wrong premise, and both of them should be rejected.

You are valid just the way you are, and interacting with you brings me euphoria. I love seeing the wide variety of ways that non-binary people can express themselves. If you want to dictate someone else's feelings to them, please dictate euphoria in my direction as much as you can by continuing to be awesome.

Edit: please don't give this awards or whatever. I'm flattered, but reddit doesn't need your money. Please donate to the trans lifeline or the trevor project if you can.
tbh someone's dysphoria shouldn't control how YOU express yourself to begin with,,
like yeah they can't control feeling dysphoric and im sorry that gets triggered in some folks but if they're coming onto other people and telling them what to do that's just messed up-
like have they ever considered they could be making someone ELSE dysphoric by doing that? or just straight up invalidating people, like you for instance. It's NOT your fault 

like honestly they should avoid non-binary spaces entirely if they genuinely can't deal w ppl who aren't androgynous and it hurts them THAT much, it gets to a point where you need to take care of yourself- 

bc sure as hell nobody else will be changing their whole body and presentation for them 💀

If they think non-binary ppl can only look ONE way then they already lost the meaning-
like hello?? you can't be putting it into another restrictive box. There's sm non-binary genders and experiences, you CAN'T just slap androgyny on everything.

Be yourself, don't turn away from something that's important to you over someone else's discomfort or even internalized transphobia. It's NOT okay that theyre lashing out or telling people they aren't ""putting in the effort"".
That mindset they are holding is literally so transphobic and toxic. Those under the non binary umbrella do not owe anyone androgyny. Androgyny is not the definition of non binary just like be masculine and feminine don’t decide whether someone is inherently a man or a woman. Do you and wear whatever you want.
It just sounds like transphobia / enbyphobia to me. We come in more types than just 100% androgynous. Anyone who has an issue with it should just get over it, I think.
You dress how you want, your gender identity doesn't equal how femme, masc, or nuetral you are.

If others are being mean to you for being yourself then try to stand up.  I know it's hard to stand up but those people are being transphobic (even if they're trans) and aren't respecting you.

If it really does give them dysphoria then talk to them about it and see how you can both be happy in a situation like that.

I know alot of FTM trans people who love being feminine and wearing dresses and other stuff.  As well as MTF people who don't enjoy being feminine.  How you dress doesn't make you any less NB than anybody else.

I'm Non-binary but I ""act more genderfluid"" because I dress masc, femme, nuetral, and a mix of both depending on how I feel.  (I used to identify as genderfluid but found that I only like they/them and it's my fashion that changes depending on my confidence)


TL;DR : how you dress doesn't mean you're any less NB than any other NB
They’re being transphobic. They have a similar mentality as many cis ppl, the mentality about the binary, so they’re trying to put non-binary people into a third binary when that’s not what being non-binary is about

Do what you want. Do what makes you feel good, and avoid those types of people. Gender identity matters less when it comes to transphobia, anybody can be transphobic in different ways
Other people just existing can't cause dysphoria that's just controlling af. I'm a femme nb too and there's nothing wrong with being femme or masc, presentation isn't gender
Screw them. Be happy being who you are. Your priority in life is you and not worrying about how people might be uncomfortable because of their own issues. You be you 🤛
Honestly that’s such a stupid argument. What, you’re (general) a trans man and you get dysphoric when you see a trans woman? That’s fucking gross? Why’s it different for nonbinary people? There’s no one way to be nonbinary (or to be binary trans either ok) and so you being feminine IS a part of your gender. That’d be like you going up to a trans guy and going “you’re masculine and that gives me dysphoria bc I’m feminine, can you stop?” Like that’s crazy. I’m sorry you see that stuff
Sadly there are a lot of transphobic trans people...

They are not right, you can look how ever you want. We don't owe anyone androgyny.
And them getting dysphoria of you or others is not your problem, it's their own because this is something we can't look after. Your freedom and rights weigh the same as theirs.
If having a style you enjoy ""makes someone uncomfortable"". Let them be uncomfortable, you don't owe people androgeny. Anyone can be feminine regardless of gender.
Not conforming to an idea is the expression of non binary imo. It means I’m gonna go for what makes me comfortable and happy without an idea of what I “should” be looking like.
Yo, do whatever the fuck you want. It's not your job to make other people feel comfortable, it's your job to make you feel comfortable. Anybody who looks at someone else and is uncomfortable by it, it's their job to either ignore it or look at themselves and see why they're being a bigoted asshole. Doesn't matter who they are. Trans. Cis. Straight. Gay. Bi. Progressive. Conservative. Etc. Etc. Do what YOU want.
Enby people come in all shapes and sizes.

I present feminine in society eyes but personally I think I give off more neutral vibe.

If 1 word cannot define all people in a gender, then why should an enby present a certain way.

Never doubt yourself bb ❤
You can't control other people's thoughts. Present how you want
>They get dysphoria

That's frankly not your problem. Some people get dysphoria from seeing their deadname. Doesn't mean they can forbid anyone with that name to use it any more. If you're a femby, that's who you are.

>Believe nb people should look androgynous

We don't owe androgyny to anyone. Clothes and style aren't inherently gendered, it's just shit we made up. If men can enjoy wearing frilly dresses, so can enbies.

>they're not putting in effort to be labeled correctly.

That's just transmedicalist bs. If you're fine with being mislabelled, it must mean you're not dysphoric, which means you're not trans/enby. It's gatekeeping, nothing else.

>I don't wanna make someone uncomfortable

You'll always make someone uncomfortable over benign stuff. Doesn't mean you have to give them control over you. Someone will always want you to be different. But it's an unreasonable demand. If you give someone dysphoria just by existing, it can't be helped. Some *other* trans person will feel dysphoric over your most androgynous look. It just happens. But you can't turn invisible.

Plenty of trans people will have 0 issues with you doing your thing. I know my friends would, bc they've always been supportive of me, and I'm pretty femby myself.
[deleted]
You’re valid no matter what you wear ❤️ Clothes/aesthetics have no gender
[deleted]
Making other people comfortable with your presentation isn't your job (with a few obvious exceptions). Your presentation is to satisfy your own feelings about gender, not to kowtow to archaic and transphobic attitudes. And even fellow queers—even fellow *enbys*—can be transphobic, sometimes without even realizing it.

It is impossible to prevent oneself from making other people uncomfortable, regardless of what you do, regardless of what it relates to. Reconciling with this fact is one of the key lessons of maturity.

If the people you are concerned about are your friends, ask them openly how they feel. If they're truly your friends, they'll try to work with you on the issue. If they're random people on the Internet, fuck 'em (metaphorically). Their part in your life is insignificant unless you make it significant.

Unless you have reason to believe that your preferred presentation would put you in danger or at great financial disadvantage, you can generally not worry about how other people react. It's not their life to live.
I'm an androgenous enby with a lot of dysphoria, and I'm here to say: no matter how you present, what pronouns you use (including exclusively using he/him or exclusively she/her or exclusively using neos), how much dysphoria or lack thereof you have, and what other people think - you are valid and whoever doesn't like it has to deal with their own feelings
Hi! This is called internalized transmisogyny, they're projecting their own dysphoria on you, and how other people have made them feel at other times in their lives. Also no one gets to police anyone else's gender, that's the whole point of gender identity. You are valid however you feel comfortable. I hope this helps. 💕
there seems to be an uptick in enby-phobia lately i wonder what 4chan operation is going on?
I don’t give a fuck if my enbyness makes *anyone* uncomfortable.  Sure, if I’m being an asshole, by all means, tell me; the last thing I actually want to do is make people uncomfortable.  That said, however I present is MY business, not theirs, and if me looking feminine or masculine bothers them, they can eff right off.  I hope you can appreciate how important it is to dress and present the way *you* want to.  So yeah, mute that noise and do what makes you feel good, not strive to avoid making someone uncomfortable with your presentation.
You don’t want to be feminine, you *are* such a beautiful feminine individual that identifies nb and living your true colors, loving every aspect of it, will make YOU comfortable. And that’s all it matters. Fuck everyone else. Sending fem hugs to you! 🏳️‍⚧️
Fuck that.

You want to express your gender in a feminine way, fuck anyone else that gets uncomfortable by that. It's not your fault nor your problem. Especially if they set these dumb ass rules up and expect each and every person to be like ""Oh you know what, that actually makes sense."" 

In my opinion, and you can decide to do what ever you want. But I say express yourself however you want, be safe & stop letting these randoms that would throw you under the bus in a heart beat dictate how you feel on a day to day bases.
It's not your responsibility to deal with other people's internalized transphobia. You could present as masculine or as feminine as you want, and you still deserve to be treated with respect and not be misgendered. Even trans people are capable of being wrong, and it sounds like you ran into some truscummy types. They don't get to tell you how to present, nobody does. You are allowed to do what makes YOU most comfortable. Don't center other people's feelings in your gender identity
Dont listen to truscum, just keep on being you :)
What is it with like some members of the binary trans community being all truscum about nbs. I get theres like a phenomenon where they're kind of projecting their insecurities trying to cope but like tearing other people down is so unintuitive. We're all in this struggle together smh
Trans people can be transphobic. Black people can be racist. Gay people can be homophobic. 

Discrimination knows no boundaries, but if you want to counteract that, be the change you want to see.
Feminine enby here :3

I love going out wearing my dresses or skirts and doing my make up a little ( I am not good at it) 

No one can tell me to fuck of about my gender ^ ^
Fuck them. They need to work on their own internalised transphobia, not try to shame other people for how they present!
Dysphoria is an involuntary response, like as a transfem person I sometimes feel dysphoria looking at other people: either because they look like I want to look or because they remind me of myself in a bad way. However, that's not your problem! I don't choose what I have dysphoria over and sometimes that is annoying *for me* but I get through it and it doesn't impact my ability to befriend people who give me this feeling.
Don't listen to these people - be your amazing feminine nb self, and don't care about people who're not okay with this. If these people gatekeep your identity based on your presentation, I feel like they themselves don't have much of an idea of what identity means. Non-binary doesn't imply androgynous, and androgynous doesn't imply non-binary either!
 who tf cares, you can dress/present yourself however you want, if someone has a problem with it, that’s not a person worth your time
fuck the other people, you present how you would like to, if they’re uncomfortable then that’s their own problem
Binary trans people who put down nonbinary trans people are transphobic. This is one of those ways that trans people can be transphobic. 

Also if someone is dysphoric around me because my gender shifts around between ""she/her but in a drag way"" and ""he/him but in a lesbian way"" (im nonbinary fluid) then that is on them to unpack. I am not going to sanitize myself for other trans people??? Thats the same thing that cis people demand of them and of us, sanitizing their identity for respectability politics. They just have it easier than GNC folk, even binary people have the right to present outside of gender norms

Edit: typo and phrasing
You should do whatever makes you happy. If someone tells you that you’re causing them dysphoria, then that’s something they need to work out, and stop hating on non-binary people. Non-binary literally means not being part of the binary, so you are free to present however you feel comfortable. Don’t let anybody take that away from you, okay? Don’t surround yourself with people like that, because not every lgbtq+ person is nice.
You do not owe anyone androgyny. I'm AFAB and often femme presenting, I'm still nonbinary.
their bullshit is not more important than your truth. if you feel limited in your expression by others in the lgbtq community you havent failed us - we have failed you. do whatever the hell you want
Women don’t have to be femme, men don’t have to be masc, we don’t have to be andro.

Widening gender freedom helps ALL trans people, binary or not
No that’s genuinely non-binary-phobia at work. You have the right to express however the fuck you feel. Be feminine, be masculine, whatever works for you. You don’t need to conform yourself to others views of gender.
Just say fuck them and be who you want to be
Sometimes you gotta do you, other people may be uncomfortable (regardless of where they reside on hetero/queer/nonbinary-ness) to just be you, be happy with you and do you, sometimes we have to stop wprrying what others thing and care more about what we ourselves think about ourselves.
Just jumping in quickly to state that “nb” actually stands for “non-black” and should be reserved for those in our BIPOC communities for those who it is relevant to, rather than nonbinary communities. 

Some available alternatives are; enby and nBi 😊 
Not having a go at anyone, just trying to help educate and raise awareness as a fellow enby 😊 

Also OP, fuck what other people think, at the end of the day it’s your body and it’s your choice. Nonbinary doesn’t have any one single “look”, fuck anyone who says otherwise. You wanna be feminine? Well then babe go get it, be the most gorgeous person out there, you are still 100% valid. You got this xx

Look up Kate Bornstein she was a femme presenting non-binary person before most of us were conceived. Such an inspiration!
Be how you want to be
Do whatever the help you want,  the opinions of people on the internet don't matter unless you let them matter
I thought you were going to say transphobes were uncomfortable. There is some difference between what you are actually talking about, but not as much as those NBphobes would probably like to imagine.
Their thinking is garbage and seems extremely shallow.  I wouldn't want to be around people who had such feelings, so we could mutually avoid each other.  It sounds like they have small minds lol

I can go from masculine to feminine and back again several times through the day/week/year.  It's taken me so long to be okay with my fluidity, I'm not about to shut down parts of me for some random person I don't even know.  If it makes them that uncomfortable, they can look away.  We all have a right to exist as ourselves, and express our gender however makes us feel most comfortable.

I used to be afraid to look ""too"" feminine or masculine when going out.  I didn't want attention either way.  Random people out in the world don't know I'm non-binary, but I get very different reactions from others based on how I'm presenting that day.  I fear being oggled and sexualized if I dress too feminine, and appearing obviously genderqueer in hostile situations if I dress masculine enough.  I'm starting to realize that it's not my responsibility if other people have a reaction to me.  I still try to be safe, and will dress more neutrally if I'm going into a place that I think is going to be dangerous, but I've started to let myself just exist and take up more space when dressing for work or just going about my life, for instance.

No one has any valid reason to go around policing someone's gender identity or expression, and it's inherently sexist and transphobic to do so.  How would these people feel if someone else made up arbitrary, nonsensical rules about how they could present?  It's also not our job to convince anyone else that we're not ""fake"".  Being masculine or feminine doesn't determine your gender identity, and it's 100% valid to be feminine non-binary, regardless of your agab.
i feel the same way. i’m non-binary and i’m also afab and i feel like i’m constantly being sexualized whenever i try and embrace femininity. i’m also MORTIFIED of making anyone uncomfortable.

i think it’s important to remember that femininity doesn’t rely on your genitalia! i love being feminine!!! and i love mainly presenting masculine too. you’re so so sooooo valid. it’s hard to remember that sometimes. you’re beautiful even if you don’t think so!!! don’t feel embarrassed because you’re not alone! trans include non-binary people too.
You do you and don't let anyone else's opinions affect you
I am nonbinary. I also wear dresses and makeup and have long hair. Those two things can and do coexist. You are no less nonbinary if you dress masc or fem than if you dress andro. The way you dress or present yourself has absolutely nothing to do with your gender identity even though most people think it does. A straight cis man can wear a dress and still be straight and cis right? You can dress feminine and still be nonbinary. Anyone who believes otherwise is wrong. If you wanna talk about this more feel free to message me. Never stop being who you are ❤️
okay and? you’re gonna let people depict your happiness? fuck them.
If they are also being rough on anyone mtf then those are terfs, just mute those people they aren't worth dealing with.
You present yourself how you want to. Don't care what others think of you. You do what makes you happy. If presenting fem makes you happy present fem. If presenting masc makes you happy, present masc. Those other people saying that if your nb you have to present androgynous, are just being transphobic jerks, (even if they are trans themselves).
You don't owe anyone androgyny
It's such a shame that people who go through so much difficulty and hostility turn it on each other so often. We need to support one another!
Remember there no one/proper way to be non-binary. There is no specific look you have to have.
Sorry I believe I wrote it wrong, its multiple people who are trans.
This is a beautiful response.

Nothing I can say will top this.
AGREED
>so they’re trying to put non-binary people into a third binary when that’s not what being non-binary is about

It's rather ironic how the same community that is so opposed to being forced into a gender binary turns around and imposes their own gender binary of cis/trans upon all people. And anyone that attempts to opt out of that binary, or dares to question its efficacy, will face harsh ridicule and mockery. Last month I even had a nonbinary person come into my subreddit and tell me (very condescendingly) that I should just accept being ""cis"" gender nonconforming right on a post where I expressly disavowed being called ""cis"".
And as for that last sentence, “I don’t wanna make trans people uncomfortable or embarrassed” I don’t know your relationship with your gender, but. Nonbinary people ARE trans people. So why should you, a trans person, make yourself uncomfortable just for the comfort of another trans person who is being gross and judgemental?
Yep!!! Personal boundaries are important.
Lunarian, yay!  I'm so happy to see someone using the galactian alignments system in conversation.

The system resonates with me, too.  I think I'm probably eclipsian or galaxian.  I would feel very constrained and uncomfortable limiting myself to pure androgyny at all times.
Don't use that word except to refer to yourself.
 If a gay man doesn't like lesbians because they're lesbains, it makes them homophobic. If a trans person doesn't like another trans person because they aren't ""looking"" the part, they are being transphobic.
Transphobia can occur even within transgender circles, friend.
being trans and being transphobic are not mutually exclusive :)
I was deadnamed and misgendered by a binary trans woman. I'm a transfemme nonbinary woman. If anyone thinks I'm doing my gender wrong, I try my best to not take it personally. They are either a transphobe, a misogynist, or both.
You looking like yourself isn't supposed to cause any dysphoria as it is your body. You're not fake, I'm a transmasc enby but I still dress feminine a lot because I like it. Looks =/= gender
My friend, it seems like you stumbled upon truscums. They're a subset in the trans & non-binary community (although sometimes the cis join them) that basically dedicate themselves to enforce a closed, outdated and rigid definition of what being ""truly"" trans is.

Some of them don't even acknowledge the existence of enby folks, whereas others accept us but tell us shite like that, that we need to achieve androgyny in order to be ""truly"" enbies...

Bullshit, all of it. If you feel great being feminine, I say become fucking Aphrodite if you want! They aren't entitled to dictate how \*you\* should feel and present. You're the only one whose opinion matters here, since \*you\* are the one living in your own skin.

Besides, their claims are nonsensical. Dysphoria doesn't work like that??? How the hell do you get dysphoric at ""masc or fem presenting enbies""??? Doesn't make any sense, they're straight up lying.

Being fem is absolutely harmless. If they get uncomfortable at it, it's a \*them\* issue, not yours. I encourage you to follow what makes you feel full and dismiss ill-intentioned claims such as these.
It’s just outright hypocritical. I support whatever gender ppl identity as, I support you for being gender noncomforming(although tbh I don’t fully understand that, I’m still learning things)

What ppl identity with has no effect on me, and I see no reason to put others down for it

It’s like they only expect cis ppl to not be transphobic, they don’t hold themselves to the same standards
[deleted]
No better example of that than Caitlin Jenner
>enforce a closed, outdated and rigid definition of what being ""truly"" trans is.

That's not true at all. It is actually the reverse. The *new* definition of ""trans"" is what is closed and rigid since it only allows for people that claim a ""gender identity"" to be part of the community. Transgender was originally conceived in the 1990s as a broadly inclusive umbrella for anyone that was marginalized for breaking the social rules of gender regardless of identity or expression whether it be drag queens, crossdressers, transsexuals, genderqueers, butches, femmes, etc.
Of course non trasphobia is achievable. You wouldn't say no one is truly not misogynistic just because certain women push a patriarchal view of femininity or something. Doesn't make sense.
bro literally the only other posts in your history are questioning the validity of nonbinary identities and you want to come in here arguing about what defines ""true transphobia"" lmfao
Truscums aren't exactly a new thing so it's still outdated. You deliver a great point, though, by pointing out what it was defined like at the beggining :)
[deleted]
Keep in mind that Trans-medicalists also don't represent the broad consensus of the trans community. They are a fringe group, not unlike the relationship of TERFs to feminism. The definition they cite isn't confirmed by any major medical journals, encyclopedias, or other reputable sources.
You’re literally just typing words to type them. None of this makes any sense. Hot garbage.
Ehm circumcision deff aint pointless i needed to get that done when i was 3 because of medical reasons (that i dont remember i was 3 xD)
I understand your sentiment. It's really a fight of nomenclatures here. Provides no one anything.
[deleted]
I think it really depends on context. Circumcision for medical reasons, such as the example you gave, are generally fine and understandable. Circumcising a baby that just came out of the womb on the other hand, not so understandable and, to put it mildly, pointless. At least that's how I view and understand it.
How is it stretching the definition? If you're saying a trans person can't present a certain way because of how you personally understand their identity, that is transphobic, because they understand their own identity better than anybody and it's literally none of your business. Prejudice targeted against trans people and their identity is the very definition of transphobia. 


It just sounds like you don't really understand nonbinary identity all that well, which, given that you made a post on r/tooafraidtoask wondering what is even is, doesn't really surprise me.
Really feels like you’ve missed the point so I’m not trying to be rude I just wanna spell it out plainly that a feminine non-binary person existing is neither rude or transphobic. But if you’ve got a problem with any non-binary person existing & presenting as themselves, or if you try to make their identity about you, then that’s pretty much rude AND transphobic. Whether it’s said by a cis person or trans person. Live and let live right?
Yeah, there are a lot of factors worth considering for *any* infant surgery. Pediatricians used to think [circumcision](https://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15) [prevented cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10699138/), but newer research suggests that [other variables may make the difference ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758146/pdf/v074p00368.pdf). Basically, circumcision might be like[ tonsillectomies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C28&q=tonsillectomies+overused&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DuMuK5eP40eYJ), which are really beneficial in some cases but were overused for awhile.

Either way, the whole topic tends to be a magnet for antisemites 😅
[deleted]
Oh yeah, I mean it's not a topic I'm hugely familiar with in the first place, but I can imagine how many antisemites and reactionary chuds flock to it the way middle aged British white women flock to a Simply Red concert.
OK. What labels are you referring to specifically that seem unnecessary to you?
[deleted]
Transphobic isn't a label, though. It's a descriptor, more than anything. Also, no offense, but you don't get to decide what is and isn't offensive to a particular group of people. If they say it's offensive (or in this case, transphobic) to them, then it is. I really don't get why you're arguing this. /gen /nm
[deleted]
Does it matter? Either way, it's not a contest to see who's the most/least upset at something. The important thing is to actually listen to people and understand why they (be it on an individual or collective level) find certain things upsetting in the first place, instead of holding these rather pointless discussions about where we ""draw the line"". Again, if you're not part of a particular community, you don't get to say what is and isn't offensive to said community. /gen /mn"	qrw8m4	NonBinary	601	1.0	2021-11-11 22:03:30

How do y’all feel about „non-binary“ being included in the term „trans“	"Hi! Binary Trans man here looking for opinions on this from people who are actually effected by it. In my mind the term Trans just meant you identify as a different gender than the one you were assigned with at birth so I always just naturally included non-binary in the term because y’all have a different gender identity than the one assigned with at birth. But a lot of the times I see stuff like „trans/non-binary“ which just seems like a little bit exclusionary to me personally but I have no fully formed opinion on it so I was wondering how yall feel about that.

Yall are awesome btw, been checking in on this sub from time to time and you all seem like such kind people! Have a great rest of your day! :)

&#x200B;

edit: thank you all so much for commenting and sharing your insights! I sadly dont have the time to reply to everyone rn but be sure, i have most definetly read your input! :)"	"For me it depends on the situation. If the question is; Am I cis or trans, then trans, but in general conversation I would say I'm non-binary. This is mainly because in every day conversation, if you say trans, binary trans is more commonly assumed than non-binary. Also generally when trans issues are discussed these are about transitioning or people being able to use facilities that don't fit their AGAB. And these issues aren't applicable to my experience, therefore I only participate as an ally in those situations and not the target demographic.

So to explain it simply, I don't identify as trans, but my gender identity falls within the trans umbrella. So, I can be catogarized as trans, but that might cause confusion or misunderstandings about my actual identity.

Hope that made sense.
My opinion is simple: if you identify as a different gender than you were assigned at birth the trans label is available to you and it's up to you whether to take it.
I think some nonbinary people have a complicated relationship with calling themselves trans either due to internalized transphobia (not feeling ""trans enough"" to claim it), or because they actually do in part identify with their AGAB (fluid or demi genders that happen to partially include their AGAB for example) and so don't feel that the term fully fits them (of course people in this category are welcome to call themselves trans if they want to, I have just occasionally seen people who do not for this reason).

From what I've seen, the most common position is that yes, nonbinary people are trans (due to the definition you gave), but not all nonbinary people may necessarily choose to use that term to describe themselves.

(edit: The above is not an exhaustive list of potential reasons, of course. 

I have no specific thoughts on whether saying ""trans/nonbinary"" when referring to our collective communities is exclusionary or not, my first reaction is that it doesn't bother me and I would take it as the person just trying to be extra clear, but I could see how it might bother others.)
I always thought of it as trans, it never really occurred to me that it could be anything else. Although I have heard of some people who identify as cis nb.
Hi. I started identifying as nonbinary within this past year, after a lifetime of not really being aware of, or not really understanding nonbinary identities - thinking that either I was trans (i.e. a binary trans woman) or I was not, and since I was not, therefore had to make do with going through life as a cis man.

Now that I've embraced my nonbinary identity, and learned so much from communities like this one, and have come to understand the way the term trans\* is used as an umbrella term, and in particular now that I've come to appreciate how much I do have in common with binary trans folks - how much their issues and questions and experiences are similar to my own - I'm happy to feel welcomed in trans spaces and to think of myself as falling within that umbrella.

...

But, while I can absolutely see how ""trans and nonbinary"" or ""trans/nonbinary"" can be seen as odd or even exclusionary to those in the know, I personally like these sorts of compound phrases, because to many people (especially many people outside the community) I think the word ""trans"" still conjures up a relatively narrow set of ideas or identities (i.e. certain ideas or images of binary trans folks, incl. esp. trans folks pursuing a ""full"" \[whatever that means\] medical + social transition). So, having the word nonbinary actively included helps with the visibility of nonbinary identities, if that makes sense.

...

When I was first engaging in earnest with questioning my gender, the first person I came out to was a friend who happens to be a trans woman. She said, essentially, ""sounds to me like you're a trans woman too. You'd better get on HRT immediately, and start thinking about social transition and all sorts of other things or else you're in for years of horrific mental health issues like me,"" and it freaked me the hell out. I spent the next day or so, or more, my head spinning, thinking about all the things I had to do, and how difficult it was going to be, all the things I had to change (physically, legally), who to tell, how to tell them, all this stuff, fearing that if I didn't do it, I was already on my way to some kind of mental breakdown.

Learning that nonbinary was a real option for me, that it was something I might actually be and that I had a right to claim, and learning more about what nonbinary identity means and looks like, took me out of that spiral of worrying and agonizing and thinking the only two options are trans or cis. ... Yes, now that I've learned more I understand what ""trans"" includes under its umbrella, and I've grown more comfortable seeing myself as being under that umbrella.

But I still think that for others who are still questioning, or for cis community at large, the visibility provided by phrases like ""trans + nonbinary"" or ""trans/nonbinary"" could, potentially, be a rather good thing for helping people to know that we exist, that there are these other ways of being and that they're equally valid, and so forth. If I had known that more fully, more truly - if I'd seen more nonbinary representation and understood more properly what it meant sooner, I might have been able to come out to myself and be living my best life, so to speak, sooner.  


That's me; that's my personal take on it.
I am trans because I am nonbinary and not the assigned identity that was thrust upon me. I feel very firmly that:

1) nonbinary identity is a core part of transgender community, culture, history, and future. When someone says trans people, that should and does includes nonbinary people full stop. When binary trans people exclude us, they’re doing themselves a disservice.

2) no one has to use words and terms that don’t work for them.

If someone tells me they’re nonbinary, I use that word for them. If someone tells me they’re nonbinary and not trans, they are not trans. Just because I have such a strong connection between the two and therefore a desire to see nonbinary people recognized for our part and position in trans circles, that doesn’t mean my political thoughts supersede how someone else views themself.

I love being trans because I love being myself. The negatives of being seen improperly by the world are because of power structures and erasure of nonbinary identity. Being trans is a very positive and beautiful thing to be because my (lack of) gender is wonderfully freeing.

I love being nonbinary because it’s the honest version of myself.

Linguistically, we fall into speaking patterns that reflect what we see other people say. A lot of people arrive at this community saying “trans and nonbinary” and they often see them as separate things. The binary is silently expected. I think this is because in many trans circles people first find as they begin exploring gender, binary trans is the absolute dominant narrative and most power plays are between trans men and trans women for space and visibility between each other, with nonbinary trans people often discriminated against or harassed by people with internalized transphobia. I tend to write “binary and nonbinary trans people”, “binary trans people”, and “nonbinary trans people” or “nonbinary people” in order to avoid assumptions that the binary is a silent but integral part of “trans”.

#TW Nonbinary-phobia written out here.

-

Most times I enter an online trans space that is meant for all of us, I end up leaving because of ignorant statements about how nonbinary people make binary people look bad because we ask for too much, or that we’re not trans, or that we’re not real, and so on and so forth and very rarely do other binary people call them out. I’m usually left to defend myself and a huge class of diverse people alone. And then in heavily moderated spaces where this doesn’t happen, we’re usually all pushed into separate threads or channels etc where trans women are in one group, trans men in another, and everyone else in a third like we’re a third gender.

This is all VERY different from my experiences online a decade ago and my current experiences in person with trans groups. These are the spaces that affirm my connection to trans identity and keep me grounded. These are the spaces that make me feel joy having a shared experience that celebrates being authentically individual.
I consider myself Trans/Genderfluid/Nonbinary. That white stripe in the flag is for Enby. I fought it for a long time, because I thought I could not uset the term Trans, because I do not want to transition into a different part of the Binary. It took me a long time even though I knew I was Nonbinary, and even before that I had no idea there was such a range in the Rainbow community. I knew from an early age I wasnt like others in my school....I had no idea there was lots of other aspects to it. What really made me realize it was that defintion you gave, and then a little image with a large umbrella with Trans then two smaller ones, one being Binary, one bing NonBinary. It was like, my egg finally broke.
I do consider myself trans, but I'm also aware that most people think of binary trans folks when hearing the word trans. In many situations I'd feel the need to clarify because of this. It kind of depends on the situation how exactly I'd describe myself. If someone asks about my gender identity, I'd say I'm nonbinary. If someone asks why I care about trans rights, I'd sipmly say ""because I'm trans"". If someone asks me if I'm trans I'd say yes but specify that I'm nonbinary.
[deleted]
I wonder if, because being non binary is a wide spectrum of experience and identity, that's why some of us struggle with ""trans"" as a label because it feels quite definitive and to an extent limiting.

I think many of us started feeling that being trans was a sort of obvious explanation for not feeling cis, and then through a (usually very slow) process felt uncomfortable with that because it too didn't quite fit.
For me, and definitely only speaking for me here, my personal brand of enby involves a connection to my assigned gender (man) which is a large part of my presentation, as well as a connection to my femininity, and a large dose of agender as well. I just don’t fit the binary. I don’t feel a connection to the term trans, so I don’t associate it with myself. This might be some internal transphobia to work through so it might change over time. It’s also because I still feel connected to male pronouns while also feeling connected to neutral pronouns.

I don’t have many irl connections to the LGBT2Q+ community, and so I’m just figuring a lot of this out from looking inside of myself for what feels right on my own (with the exception of my awesome genderqueer therapist).

Politically/socially, I feel very aligned/connected with trans folks, but the label just doesn’t feel like me (at least for now).

That ramble probably isn’t helpful, but there it is! Have an awesome day beautiful people!
I absolutely identify as trans... Some enby people don't, and like... 🤷? That's their prerogative. I didn't really feel comfortable accepting the trans label earlier in my transition when I was still questioning. But for me realizing I'm definitely not a woman cinched for me the fact that I get to call myself trans.
Yes, non-binary is included in the trans umbrella. Some non-binary people, however, don't call themselves trans and that's totally okay. It's up to each individual.
I identify as trans and non binary. I do so because there are traits about being a woman that make me uncomfortable. There are traits about being a man that make me uncomfortable. Neither of them are just the *right* fit for me, so I’m doing my own thing. BUT, and this is why I call myself trans also, I have a lot of body dysphoria. I’m on hormones. I’m getting surgery. I, too, have fears about being beaten when people see I have a beard and my ID says I’m female. I, too, struggle with being afraid to pick what bathroom to go into.
Idk, the only thing that separates me from being FTM is that I’m uncomfortable identifying as a male. I’m uncomfortable with that solely because of American society and the ways that makes abuse the privilege that they have. For that reason, I don’t want to be identified with them. But I share all the struggles a FTM would face. 

So anyways, I identify as enby and trans.
I’m non-binary, but don’t really consider myself trans. I have done nothing to change myself or to transition since accepting being non-binary. I’m not changing my name, and have no surgery or hormone treatment planned. 

I’m just me. And yeah 1000% of people will look  at me a see a women, but I know. My partner knows. My friends know. And im gonna go about my life not having nearly the same social struggles as someone who is trans and transitioning. 

Just my view point.
I don’t like being called trans. Even though it technically fits I just don’t like it, and I’m a firm believer that I don’t have to use a label I don’t want.
To me, I've always felt like being nonbinary isn't ""trans enough ""  even though I know that's not really a thing. But also I feel like to use the term transgender as an underlying term for an entire community of gender non-conforming folk,  might be, somehow, taking a peace of identity from the transgender community, whose already had so much taken from them. So in a way, I feel like I can't use the term trans because I personally have not had the same battles. . . Ish. This is how I feel personally about it, the logical part of me would slap the trans-insecure part of me because I know thats not true at all. It comes from a place of insecurity I think. Maybe its denial? I'm not sure. But that's my reasoning behind it, and I'd like to rehittorate again- this reasoning is ONLY pertaining to me personally. If someone said something like this to one of my NB friends I'd lose my shit. Again, this comes from a personal place of insecurity and shouldn't be used in anyway against my trans friends.
It depends on the person really. I personally consider nonbinary to be included under trans, but one of my nonbinary friends doesn't consider themselves to be trans. I think for me, since I feel more fluid, it naturally feels like I'm trans on days I don't feel like my agab. For my friend, I think they feel close enough still to their agab that it doesn't feel like they are trans
At first I didn’t see myself as trans bc I didn’t think it/I counted but now I do. I relate to the trans expierence so I do consider myself trans.
Hello! I agree with you. To be transgender is to not identify with the gender you were assigned at birth.

To me, this means anyone who is not cisgendered is transgender. This can be people who identify as the opposite gender (I use ""opposite"" loosely as there really are more than 2 and they don't all oppose each other cleanly), or as someone who identifies as a third gender from the binary, all genders, no genders, any gender, or some combination thereof. 

Personally, I'm proud to be transgender. I'm also proud to be non-binary. Sometimes it's easier to say I'm trans then open with non-binary as that's still a bit new for some people. I'm always happy to elaborate if they ask, though. And I tend to anyway since my pronouns are they/them.

I'll add a disclaimer that I'm still new to this community and don't know all the different terms, so I apologize heavily if I've said anything wrong. Everyone has the right to identify however they want, and be happy. Love you guys!
I am trans. I had a discussion with my doctor not so long ago filling out a form and they asked me how I identify. I said, “Trans”. 

Because she was looking at the form and I wasn’t, her next question was, “Are you a trans man or a trans woman?”

Of course, I simply said, “No”.

Then she turned the screen to me and I could see that there was a completely different box for non-binary. So I said to her, “I’m trans non-binary. Tick non-binary then write what I am in the ‘other’ section. Nice to know that in an attempt to be inclusive, my identity is still relegated to being ‘other’, even if only partly.”

I think it’s an important distinction. Not every enby is going to be comfortable with being called trans, and in the context of intersex people it’s not an accurate label, but in the case of many of us, it’s our identity.
I dont identify as trans because while my internal change has been vast my external change has been nuanced and feels minor by comparison. It would just feel wrong to me personally.
I think it depends on the nonbinary person as to whether they identify as trans or not. I identify as nonbinary and genderqueer. I do consider myself to be trans, because my gender identity is not the one that was assigned to me at birth.

However, when I talk to cisgender folks about this, or anyone else outside the NB community, I don’t bring up that I’m trans right away. Because there is a lot of cultural baggage surrounding the word transgender. And as lots of other folks have pointed out, cisgender folks, and those outside the Trans and NB communities, seem to always tie transitioning with transgender. And this can complicate explaining being NB to folks.
The definition of trans that I use is “doesn’t completely identify with gender assigned at birth.” So, being non-binary, I am technically trans. But I understand that my experience may differ quite drastically with someone who transitions from mtf or ftm so I honestly don’t mention it that way a lot. Only when I’m explaining it to someone.
My definition of trans is ""I do not vibe with my agab"" (to make it short!) 

Also the white stripe of the trans flag stands for non binary.

So yeah. I am non binary, I will call myself trans.
I'm nonbinary because I'm not a man or a woman, and I'm trans because I don't identify with my gender assigned at birth/have taken steps to transition to alieviate my dysphoria. :)
Being trans means identifying with something other than what you were assigned at birth. I am both nb and trans. Its difficult for me to understand how you could be nb and not trans since not identifying with the binary or any gender means not identifying with the gender you were assigned at birth.

Why is trans/nb excluding? I would say that trans is the umbrella term so not sure why you would put both next to each other in that way, but I also can't see what is wrong with it.
I am nonbinary (AFAB) and don’t identify as trans. While I don’t identify as female, I just started fully identifying as nonbinary in the last year or two, and I am still in a lot of female roles (mom most specifically). I don’t feel trans enough, I guess, to take on that label. I’ve never experienced transphobia against myself or had to deal with convincing doctors to give me hormones or surgery.
I think for some people the word ""trans"" carries the implication of binary trans, hence the phrasing of things like ""trans/nonbinary"" -- this is language that I like to use personally, because I feel like it removes some ambiguity from the words. like if we were to use the umbrella term ""trans"" on its own, implicitly including nonbinary people under that umbrella, we'd run into the problem of a kind of erasure/exclusion due to the ambiguity of the language. for example, some trans people would push back against the idea that nonbinary people should be included under that umbrella, and some nonbinary people might be reluctant to take on the label of trans for any number of reasons.
Personally, I identify with being ""trans"" because I am actually medically transitioning- just halfway to androgyny instead of fully across the way. Hormones and surgery have made my body distinctly different than it was.

Obv I understand this doesn't apply to everyone and anybody can label themselves however they prefer, that's just my individual rationalization of words meaning things
Hi. I’m non-binary. I’m proudly transgender because I don’t identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. I’ll say “trans/non-binary” to be specific when necessary.
To my thinking, if 'trans' means 'doesn't identify with gender assigned at birth', nonbinary would be definition be trans.
I love the trans flag and I love the label for me! I feel like it describes me, and the white stripe in the middle of the flag is a little special treat. I don’t feel in between genders, not in the middle, but outside of them 
I usually write it, or say it, as non-binary trans-masculine, so without the / . For me that just means that each of the pieces go together and are one, rather than either/or (not saying anyone else is using it as either/or! That’s how it reads in my brain when I specifically write it for myself, it’s also a way to put ‘and’) 
I am really curious, to better understand where you’re coming from as well!! You have an important perspective and are coming to the subreddit to learn, I’d love to learn more about you too! Can you say more (and also don’t have to) about feeling “exclusionary”? Doesn’t have to be a fully formed opinion, just what it brings to mind :)
I include the term in my nonbinary identity because fully living as a nonbinary person for me includes certain aspects of medical intervention to transition, even though realistically the cost is prohibitive.
I personally identify more strongly with the trans label than the non-binary label.   

I didn't realize that some NB people don't consider themselves trans, which is...confusing to me.
i am a nonbinary person, and i absolutely identify with trans. part of why i identify that way is because i am physically and socially transition, like binary trans people do. i have changed my name and pronouns, i take hormones. i feel very strongly that i am “transing” my gender lol. some nonbinary people might not feel this way, or they may identify as trans without physically/socially transitioning. i think anyone who doesn’t identify with their assigned gender at birth would be totally within their right to identify as trans, but don’t have to if they don’t think it’s accurate

another note is a few friends of mine that are intersex personally identify as “cis nonbinary”. for some this is complicated, because intersex people might be assigned a binary sex at birth despite being intersex, or they may undergo unwanted medical changes in order to look like a binary sex. and because of this, if they transition away from that coercively assigned sex, they still might identify as trans. but! a few intersex friends of mine feel as though their body correctly reflects their gender, and for them being intersex and nonbinary is not trans because they find their body to be “nonbinary” on its own. so they would identify as cis nonbinary

that’s a complicated idea bc in our binary society there really is no way to exist and be raised as truly cis and also nonbinary, purely bc of how we are treated. the binary touches every part of our lives, even if our body doesn’t look binary. but identifying that way is important for some intersex people, and i think listening to them on that is necessary. sorry for the super long post haha, i hope it was interesting at least!!
I really struggled with this one at first. For as long as I can remember, I've always thought of myself as just a human being, rather than particularly identifying as a girl/woman (AFAB) but it didn't really occur to me that I am non-binary until I was into my 30s. 

My wife is binary trans and I've known about that since we were in our early 20s so I guess I initially felt that 'trans' was an exclusively binary thing because that's all I knew.

I'm also only out to a couple of people so the world generally assumes I'm a woman. To me, this makes or has made it hard for me to consider myself ""properly"" trans because I go through life mostly being seen as and treated as my birth sex and I feel a bit like an imposter in the trans community because of this.

These days, my understanding is a little bit different though and I definitely consider myself to be both nb and trans, for the reasons you and others have already mentioned: I don't identify (solely) with my assigned gender at birth.

I don't know if that answers your question. Sorry if I've just rambled!
I use both words. Trans is easier and a little more satisfying of a word lol. But I’m also not FTM and so I will use nonbinary as like an extra explanation for the majority of cis people who don’t understand nonbinary identities and think trans just equals ftm/mtf.
For me personally, I’ve always identified as non-binary but I was never sure if I was able to call myself trans. Sure, I technically could since I was identifying with a different gender than I was assigned, but it didn’t feel right to claim that identity since I wasn’t actively transitioning or even trying to present masculine or even androgynous. I’ve been on T for two months and have been working to masculinize my appearance, and I have been starting to use trans as an identifier. However, I still prefer non-binary overall since my goal for my medical transition is not to be a binary man
Not all nonbinary people identify as trans for whatever reasons so I think it's to include them, I personally do identify as trans.
I always thought of it being included too because it's a gender other than your agab, it just makes sense to me that way.

But I can see why some NB folk don't ID as trans as it can be so nuanced. Especially I guess if you are agender or something like that where you don't think of yourself in the way of conventional genders.

I might be biased towards thinking of myself as trans though as I did ID as binary trans for a few years before I knew that nonbinary is a thing.
I’m genderfluid and sometimes I identify as a binary man but the rest of my identities (that I’m currently aware of) are non-binary. I used to identify only as a man, which is not my AGAB. So I considered myself trans as well and I started transitioning. I still very much identify with how I’ve transitioned, if that makes sense. I just do not always feel like a binary man. 

I personally consider myself trans cuz no matter what gender I am, I am never my AGAB and I have been on hormones so I have definitely changed physically. Actually, quite a few people think I’m the opposite AGAB now. So even when my identity does not fit the binary, I still medically/physically identify as trans, if that makes sense. For me that’s just what fits. 

The label “trans” is always sort of an afterthought for me when referring to myself. Trans is never part of my gender identity itself, but I use it to explain my experience with gender and my body. This is just how I feel and other people are more than welcome to use these labels in a different way for themselves.
Someone mentioned that the trans term is inherently inclusive of non-binary identities, but it's up for the person to decide if the label is for them. I very much agree with that statement. With me, my reasoning for not identifying with the trans label is that whenever I have been in trans spaces, I have experienced issues with binary trans people minimizing my issues, saying I have it easier for only going ""halfway"". At best, I've been treated as if I'm a trans man, and at worst, I've been treated as if I was essentially a cis woman. Neither were gender affirming, especially since I get dysphoria around both masculinity and femininity. 

Even in a support group setting, I was told trans women have it harder when I was talking about experiencing dysphoria in my French classes due to the language being so gendered/not having any gender neutral options. I never said I had it the worst, but that doesn't mean that I don't experience my own struggles unique to being non-binary. I kept being told my issues were just a watered down version of the issues trans men face but that simply isn't true. 

Now I don't feel comfortable in trans spaces nor do I feel good anymore when people use the term ""trans"" to describe me. I've talked about this before with other non-binary people and it seems that I'm not alone in my experiences, although I'm definitely not saying that all trans spaces are like the ones I have encountered. 

Maybe someday when I'm over that trauma (I was harassed by binary trans people over these matters), I'll identify as trans again. But I'm not there yet and the label is currently triggering for me.

Edit: Meanwhile my partner doesn't identify as trans for a completely different reason. They're agender. They have basically described it to me that since they do not experience gender in anyway, it doesn't make sense for them to identify as transgender; being ""transgender"" would imply having a gender.
basically: eehhhhhueueuehhhhmmmm hoo uhhhhhhhhhhh wheeewwwwww yes???? I mean definitionally yes, and if any nonbinary person identified as trans they are entirely correct, but as has been said its circumstantial. my sister is a full on trans woman, and shes on hormones and stuff (which I don't plan to ever do) and.... it would just feel really odd for me to compare NY struggle with hers, yknow? I'm not on hormones, no surgery, alterations, nothing. any ninbinary person who considers themselves trand is definitely right, and I sorta do with some people, but just for me, in general, because of my sister, no, not really.
If you realize that you are not the gender you were assigned at birth, then you are trans. That's how it's always been. ""Transgender"" isn't magically tied to the binary; all non-binary genders are valid, so they count for being trans just as well as the more well-known binary.
I do not identify as trans at all. To me, claiming that identity feels almost appropriative, acting like I've had experiences (like experiencing transphobia) that I haven't really had. I'm don't feel like I'm transitioning to anything.

If someone asked if I were trans or cis, I'd answer the same way I would if they asked if I were a man or a woman: ""No.""
The words are for you to use. I call myself a non binary woman, and I feel no reason to explain myself. It’s how I feel I am. It’s the word that make the most sense to me right now, and they can always change.
I am non-binary (agender) and also identify as trans. I do not intend to look like my birth gender as I have no… I guess I would say connection to it, but I don’t connect with an identity of the opposite of my AGAB. 
I have altered myself and my lifestyle to better fit how I identify.

It’s freeing for me. 

However being non-binary is different from person to person. One person may like how they are and embrace it and that’s totally valid. 

On a side note my fiancée is a binary trans woman we will often commiserate over similar things. It is nice to have someone who understands.
Trans is an umbrella term but not everyone under the umbrella has to use it. Every body is non binary but some people still attach to the label and they're welcome to it.
When a form or whatnot has “trans/nonbinary” I have to assume it in an attempt to include nonbinary folk who do not identify with the label of trans, regardless of whether or not it applies to them. For example, someone who was AMAB who is actually agender, may be uncomfortable with the label of transgender, as they are not a “different gender”— they have NO gender.

It’s much similar to folks who prefer to be known as genderqueer rather than nonbinary. Rather than an intrinsic difference in definitions, its more-so a difference of identity labels.
Nother question, doe genderfluid count as NB?
Food for thought:

The root word Cis- means “on the same side as”

The root word Trans- means “on the opposite side of”

Both terms imply a binary. So, semantically speaking, trans and non-binary is a contradiction.

Of course these words mean more than just their etymology, and culturally the label trans is becoming more of an umbrella.

Personally, I don’t use trans because I’m a very logical person and it’s hard for me to reconcile that binary implication.
The flag has the white strip for a reason !! We're just a different type
Personally I do not believe that non binary people should be included as part of the term trans, because what you decide you identify is what YOU decide, not other people. I identify as non binary because I do not wish to identify as any gender, specifically my AGAB, but I don't identify as any other gender either. I don't feel like Trans fits me because of this.
I personally dont see myself as trans due to mostly idemtifying on the side of my AGAB,I just dont see it as really fitting me,but Nonbinary is Trans.
Until very recently, I thought it was the other way around and that “Non-binary” was the umbrella term for any gender identity that wasn’t cis and that trans people fell under that category but now I guess “Trans” is the umbrella term and enbies fall underneath that? 😅 I don’t know and I could’ve made the wrong assumption I’m new to this thing haha
[deleted]
Some nonbinary people consider ourselves trans, some don’t. Technically we do fall under the umbrella from a dictionary standpoint, but whether a person uses the term “trans” is just down to individual choice. I say “trans and nonbinary” a lot, to make sure I include those nonbinary folks who don’t consider themselves trans, and also cause people can be both : )
This is just my personal explanation why i am nonbinary but dont consider myself trans. Of course others will feel differently.

Basically i didnt ""transition"" from anything into nonbinary. I always have felt and presented nonbinary. Even as a toddler i would express my gender/personality through my clothes or who i enjoyed playing with. I never felt like a guy or a girl specifically, i just exist in a human body. I never had a word for that until recently though. Like i couldn't care less if my body was like a barbie doll or if it was like a macho man, or somewhere in the middle, my gender is internal and it defines itself within. I have always been nonbinary, i never really made any huge changes that would be called a ""transition."" I feel like i just accepted my identity.

I do feel uncomfortable when i dress overly feminine but maybe thats just self esteem and not necessarily my gender identity.

To me, the persons AGAB/body has nothing to do with their gender. For example, i may dress androgynous because i enjoy that, but someone dressed otherwise could still be any gender and i dont know that unless i ask. Someone can call me she/he/they and i don't care what they pick.
NB falls under the trans umbrella, but there are quite a few reasons to separate them when discussing. The general public is pretty aware of binary trans people through media, but a lot of people are still confused or unaware about NB. Unfortunately there are binary trans people and general public who want to exclude NBs from the term or discussions or like to invalidate them (there's a lot to dig into there so I won't expand on that). It increases visibility because they are often overlooked. Some NBs are uncomfortable using the term trans, this may or may not be related to the above reasons, they can also be related to  privileges, passing, or identification with their agab.
I identify as bigendered: I am my assigned gender at birth, but I am also the other gender.

Therefore, I do not feel that trans fits my experience, because I have not ""transitioned away"" from my birth gender but added another gender to it.
I think non-binary people should be able to choose individually if they identify with the term. Non-binary may ""technically"" be under the trans umbrella, and some NB people embrace it and should be welcome to. Others don't, however, and shouldn't be forced to. 

I personally don't identify with it because I'm mainly agender in a way where I don't feel or understand an ""innate"" gender, and I have only experienced gender peripherally through socialization. So I'm not ""a different gender than my assigned gender,"" I have no gender and I'm slightly aligned with female-ness through my agab. (e.g.: my prefered pronouns are they/them, but she/her does not cause me dysphoria, but if you called me he/him I'd be like what???? where did that come from?)

So, because of the way I personally experience gender (very subtly if at all) I don't identify as trans. It's not a community or experience I feel like I'm part of, not because I'm being excluded but just because of who I am. I know many people have very different experiences and may feel both trans and non-binary, or they may feel that cis/trans is itself another binary they don't happen to fall into.

Basically, it's good to be inclusive and welcoming, but don't try to force/convince someone to adopt a label that doesn't fit! It's not always because of an internalized phobia, sometimes it's just a different experience than you understand first-hand.
I identify as nonbinary but not trans. I've not experienced the same intense disphoria as my trans friend nor have I gone through any of main struggles associated with the binary trans experience. I don't want to discount her experiences. I am fine with being under the trans umbrella, it's just not a label I'd use for myself.
Outside of the internet queer community the vast majority of people still define the word transgender as the opposite of cisgender. The idea of trans meaning anything other than your agab is relatively new (within the last couple of years). Prior to this it would have been insulting to my trans brothers and sisters for my enby ass to be calling myself trans. Now that it seems to be ok with the majority of trans folks it’s too late, if I told anyone in my life that i am trans they would understand that to mean that i am a male (afab), i am not, however male. If i say I’m nonbinary they don’t really know what it means, but they don’t assume I’m going to start taking testosterone and change my name pronouns.  Until that changes, transgender used to mean anything other than the opposite of cisgender   confuses people, including myself and in an exhausting and invalidating way. Nonbinary still confused people but it was not in use with one meaning for decades and now has a different one. 

But don’t worry, I’m old, I’m probably the last generation that will have heard trans used exclusively as the opposite of cis my entire life.

This is a tired and worn out question. Nonbinary is a subset of the transgender lable, just the same as being binary trans
[deleted]
Well I'm not cis, so...
I like being called trans. I call myself a trans enby
i think its fine

it certainly makes things easier to explain 

and trans means not being your AGAB so nonbinary is trans anyway

also some nb ppl are also transmasc or transfem
For me I find it tougher to say I am trans even tho non-binary folks ARE included in there (the white stripe). I’m afab and demigirlflux and this means at my most feminine I’m partially connected to femininity/womanhood (demigirl) and at my least feminine I’m not connected to gender (agender). Since most of the time I’m *partially* connected to my agab I feel like I’m more a mix of intrafeminine and Transneutral.
i think about it the same way as you.  if cis is using your assigned gender at birth then, nonbinary falls under the umbrella of trans.  i know some people might disagree and thats fine (as long as you're describing your own identity and not mine), they get to identify how they want, but i identify as nonbinary and consider myself trans.


i never felt bugged by seeing ""trans/nonbinary"".  it feels nice to be seen and i dont mind the distinction between binary and nonbinary trans folks.
I am a genderfluid demigirl and, like many others, I struggle with being not “cis enough” to pass as non-binary, let alone trans. 

Which, I feel like many uneducated or open ppl think of trans as the opposite of what you were assigned to at birth, since I was assigned female at birth, in what I imagine most people’s minds, if I don’t look like a man then im not trans. 

Realize, that when I say “most ppl” I mostly mean uneducated closed minded and cold ppl like my father who has always pushed for my domestic and female side, and that brought along all types of anxiety about having hair and acne on my body and other insecurities about mu body. 

All this is to say that I’ve always loved feeling “cute and being cared for” and I’ve always loved being nurturing and caring for others.” I believe that ALL ppl can do and be these things, so I want it without the connotation of “female” attached to it. 

Anyway, I’d love it if one day non-binary could be 100% accepted as a part of trans and that one day I could be comfortable enough to call myself trans, bc until it’s a bit more accepted and I don’t have to give a small lecture explaining what I mean by “I am trans” it’s not going to get better (for me), it’s not. 

lol sorry couldn’t resist the Lorax rhyme ^w^
I'd consider myself trans as I'm no longer the gender I was assigned at birth. 

I also do it to be in solidarity with my binary trans brothers and sisters. Queers together strong.

I do have days where imposter syndrome hits hard though and on those days it's just hard in general to identify with anything and feel right about it.
It's accurate. I am non-binary and I am trans.
I feel like the enbies who don’t identify as trans are the ones who still have some connection to their AGAB. Maybe they don’t feel trans enough or don’t feel like the trans label gets across what they are, which is perfectly fine. 

I do identify as trans because I have no connection to my AGAB or the other binary gender.
i've identified as non-binary for years and have been a trans ally for even longer. it only dawned on me when i started physically transitioning to more femme presenting that i am in fact trans. i honestly have always felt a strong kinship with the trans community and while I recognize that my (mtx) experience is not totally the same as an mtf trans person, it felt so validating and so *right* when i started to refer to myself as trans. i *am* in the process of transitioning from my agab to my authentic gender, after all.

i know some people feel differently about this topic, but no one's going to stop me from identifying however I choose, and the general consensus does appear to be that non-binary folks are considered trans.
Personally I find I fit under the trans umbrella, for the same reasoning you stated of not being my agab. I usually am specific in conversation, but gravitate towards trans friendly spaces because they are more likely to be ok with me.
I'm nonbinary, and while I *do* fit under the trans umbrella I don't use the labels ""trans"" or ""transgender"" verbatim. I use transandrogynous. Also in terms of unicode emotes I don't use the trans flag or rainbow flag emotes but I do use the trans symbol emote.
I was super hesitant about the term because I thought it implied you're transitioning, but once I learned it really just meant not being AGAB, yeah I'm proud to say trans. I would just say non-binary if people asked, but I identify as trans.

I think it especially makes sense for me because yeah, I don't see my gender in the mirror. I'm fine with how I look, but I almost see someone female even though I look very male. And I don't call myself genderfluid, but I have felt fluid. That's not a cis experience. I'm not cis for sure.
i really don't mind it honestly. it depends on what i tend to go by
As an umbrella term yes.  Since when it is an umbrella term it just means not cis.  Which nonbinary is, so I don't mind.
I wasn't assigned non binary at birth so I consider myself trans, plus our needs are similar enough that I'm happy to fight alongside my binary siblings
We are trans by definition.  Some of us don't want to accept it, but all of us are.  If you don't 100% identify as your agab then, congratulations, you're trans.
isn’t the white stripe on the trans flag for nonbinary people
As far as I'm concerned, as a non binary person, transgender means that you have transitioned from your assigned gender to another. I have transitioned from my assigned gender to my real gender, so I am transgender. 

However I have no problem when people say ""trans/nonbinary"" and feel the opposite of exclusion. Many people don't know about or understand non binary genders so when you specify non binary it lets me know that you are not just talking about binary trans people. It lets me know that I am included.
i am very comfortable with the label trans, I call myself trans all the time because I see the trans community like a huge diverse place where people experiences gender differently and that's really beautiful to me lol, but yeah there's been times when people mistakes me as a trans man despite being non-binary (more specifically agender) and it really sucks because I always specify that I'm non-binary on my social media and on conversations so people won't be confused
I think it’s fine tbh
they/he pronouns
I personally see it as I was one gender in the past, and then I later transited my gender to being non-binary. That being said, I know some people prefer to not see themselves this way and view being non-binary as outside of being trans, so I don't mind making a distinction for them. This doesn't make my own view seem excluded to me. I personally don't care much for labels as these exist for the benefit of other people to get a rough idea of how I identify before they really get to know me and all my unique qualities. I am me, non-binary is just a description of one little aspect of me.
I’m non binary and I’m trans. As far as I’m concerned, trans is a big umbrella that holds a lot of things, non-binary being one of them.
I don't identify with the gender I was assigned at birth, which means I'm trans. Of course it's an individual thing, but generally yes I think non binary is under the trans umbrella.
For me, (as a non binary identifying queer) I personally question why they are always lumped together. I feel honored to be sharing space with trans folx but many times I feel like when we’re lumped together in such spaces, I wonder if I’m taking up space that takes away from the trans community feeling seen and supported enough. 

Yes, I’m having my own personal journey, experiences and struggles as a NB person but I think trans folx have had it historically really hard and continue to in a different way than NB folx. I just want to make sure I’m not taking away from the trans advocacy initiative that still needs all the support we can give it. 

And not all trans people are non binary. Many want the exact opposite; to be seen FOR their gender. I don’t think it’s fair to assume all trans folx want to be lumped together with non binary & vice versa.
I’m trans as fuck and proud to say it
i recently came out as non-binary & am still figuring out how i want to present myself. currently i acknowledge that me being non-binary falls under the trans umbrella, but i don’t feel right calling myself trans. even though i use they/them pronouns & don’t like being called a girl or anything of that nature, i still have a very femme appearance. because of this i also struggle to feel like i fit in with the non-binary community, tho i have been getting better with accepting that i am a part of this community no matter how i look. i guess i just don’t feel like i should call myself trans when my appearance still lines up with my AGAB, especially when i’m still working on accepting that i am non-binary no matter how i look. this is just how i feel personally, everyone is different. i’m working on figuring out what labels feel right & right now this is how i feel. i am non-binary through & through. though i don’t mind being grouped in with trans people, even though i feel like i don’t belong. i just personally won’t say i’m trans if someone asks, ill always say i’m non-binary.
I definitely consider myself trans. I automatically consider all nb people as trans too, unless someone specifically doesn’t like it for themselves.
Am non-binary am trans. Some people want to highlight that they aren’t binary trans because people automatically assume that most of the time. Some people don’t feel comfortable labeling themselves as trans for a number of reasons, like associating being trans with transitioning, or being agender so they aren’t moving to a different gender.
In my opinion, trans is an umbrella term, so as has been stated here by others, if there is only an option between cis and trans (on forms for example) obviously I’d pick trans, but if I have the freedom, I’d say that yes, I’m nonbinary. Also, as someone who uses neopronouns and is also leaning towards xenogender type identity, trans is a very helpful and useful blanket term because very few people seem to “get” nonbinary, let alone the xenogender aspects

Also just a quick note for the other posters in this thread, “nb” stands for “non-black” and should be reserved for our BIPOC communities, opt instead for enby, nBi, nonbinary etc
I like it
on an individual level first - if you feel you are nonbinary then call yourself that, if you feel you are trans then call yourself that, and you may pick one, the other, both, or neither. it's NOT up to any member of the community (trans or not) to police whether or not you technically are/n't something - you are whatever you say you are, end of story. 

that in mind, i prefer ""trans/nb"" or ""genderqueer"" to just saying trans because not all nb folks decide to also take the label of trans. this way is *more* inclusive because of that.
Im not sure really. I think trans (as a nonbinary person) refers to you having to actually transition. Like if you have to actively make a change, instead of realizing that oh damn I'm just non binary. I suppose its different for everyone tho
Logically it does make sense and I would consider myself trans also the trans flag the white part is to signify a nonbinary so we're part of the flag
I think, as someone who’s used both to explain my identity and experience; it’s really important to keep identities open to whomever wants to use them. Gatekeeping that you can’t be both trans AND nonbinary keeps things exclusive and just separates our community more than helps explain any one experience.
In my opinion nana bananas aren't cis, of course and I believe that they are trans because trans is changing your gender, and non-binaries change their gender, also personally as a non-binary I don't really care if I am considered trans or not but others might do so, it's always better to be a member of a group when other people don't support you. Anyways that's my opinion, goodbye to all the eggs and nana bananas.
I'm non-binary. I consider myself to be trans because I am not the gender I was assigned at birth
I actively don’t like when non binary is not included under trans.
I used to use non-binary as a way of telling myself I'm not trans and now I feel like It's not considered trans enough
We are the white stripe in the trans flag. We’ve always been included. 

There is MTF, FTM, and us: NB.
Maybe interesting wrinkle I haven't seen addressed here yet: I know at least one person who is intersex and nonbinary but doesn't ID with being trans at *all* because their agab from birth is nonbinary. I wonder if this will come up more for intersex folks when more countries have more gender options on IDs
Nonbinary people ARE included in the trans umbrella. It is an opt out not opt in identity. Every single argument against including us has been recycled TERF rhetoric (ie you need to transition, you need to be binary, you need dysphoria, etc) 
(Ofc nobody needs to id as it if they don't want to but I really think people need to begin examining WHY they don't for the reasons above. Nobody should feel like they aren't ""trans enough"". There is no test you need to pass.)

I personally hate it when people automatically exclude/separate us.
I'm non binary and trans but was a more binary trans person before I came out as such so I don't feel that's gonna be very illuminating for you as I think it's very common to do so in that situation.
I 100% consider myself to be transgender but I always describe myself as ""nonbinary"" or ""nonbinary transgender"" to others because ""transgender"" by itself is often misinterpreted as meaning binary transgender. When using words, I have to consider how they will be interpreted by others.
I does! Thank you for commenting! :)
This is very eye opening to me. What is your specific identity, if you don’t mind me asking (or do you just identify as non-binary)?

I’m bigender. Depending on how I’m leaning on any given day, I’m either a trans man or I’m transmasc. I have no tie to my AGAB, and therefore have always found identifying as trans a no-brainer; after all, I’m transitioning. 

I usually present myself as binary trans in situations where the non-binary aspect of myself is not specifically relevant, because no part of my experience *isn’t* transmasc, despite my being non-binary.
Came here to write this but didn't knew how but then i saw that you already explained it perfectly lol
I can see this entirely! When meeting new people I always say “non-binary,” or “non-binary transgender,” to differentiate from trans men / trans women. 

Then again, I’m from the old school (tm) Leslie Feinberg era when “trans” was an inclusive label for us all. I also use the “t-word” (trans, not any slurs!) as a pushback against the internalized transphobia I felt for several years. 

If “trans” today really does mean “non-non-binary,” then I’ll stop using it. Would hate to misgender myself!
~*smol gasp*~ there are others like meeee!
I like the way you put it: available to you. Labels are there to help us define our subjective perception of our /own/ existence to other people. If we don't feel it defines us, then we don't have to let others tell us that it does.
That makes sense, thank you for commenting!
Great way of saying it, I often use the phrase: ""Labels are descriptive, not prescriptive."" It's short and catchy (In my opinon), but your phrasing makes it clearer.
If I had a Reddit award right now, it would go to you. Remind me to come back in approx 17h when Reddit gives me my next freebie.


I am living for the eloquence of ""available to you""! 😭💜
I agree with this, but I wanted to add:

>OP:

>Trans just meant you identify as a different gender than the one you were assigned with at birth

We're entering an era when parents are given more freedom regarding their parenting choices and gender. Some places allow people to mark birth certificates with an X instead of male or female. 

There is a chance that in the future, a parent might assign X at birth to a child who is nonbinary and we'll start to see cis nonbinary people.

Thank you so much for your insight!
It does bother me a bit, because it implies only non-nonbinary people are trans and non-binaries are something else, or even cis. That’s just my personal feeling, however.
Your reasons are wrong for me- i am a nonbinary person and my “complicated relationship” is that the word trans means across or to cross over, it is, quite literally the opposite of cis and that is the way the word was used and understood by the community for over 20 years. Only in the past year or two am I suddenly hearing the word trans as meaning your gender not being the one assigned at birth. If I started telling the people in my life that I am trans they would all think I meant that I am a man (afab). If i say I’m nonbinary they do not make that assumption. 

I’m fine with them being separate. I’m not trans as the majority of people still define the word today.
This exactly.
This is a pretty good explanation. I consider myself non-binary, but I don't consider myself trans because I'm demi.

However, I think non-binary can fall under the trans umbrella.
Idk if this is still as much of a thing anymore, but at one point, like 3-4 years ago, there was also a transmisogynistic movement in the non-binary community.  Those particular folks were trying to avoid the trans label specifically to remove themselves from the proximity of trans women.  It's been awhile since I've run across it, but I've always been wary of other non-binary people who don't identify as trans after getting harassed by them.
yeah I'm afab and like demigirl or something so I'm fem presenting and trans (as in I wasn't assigned nb at birth) but definitely not transfem.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for sharing your perspective! I really appreciate your insight! :)
>I started identifying as nonbinary within this past year, after a lifetime of not really being aware of, or not really understanding nonbinary identities - thinking that either I was trans (i.e. a binary trans woman) or I was not, and since I was not, therefore had to make do with going through life as a cis man.

It was similar for me. The only trans people I heard about when young were people who matched the stereotype checklist. Not matching up to their experiences exactly made it hard to accept being trans when being cis didn't match up either.
Im sorry you go through that, nobody should be subjected to that amount of harassment especially from people in your own community! Thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight with me, I really appreciate it! :)
I agree entirely

Thank you for sharing your perspective on it! :)
Alright, thank you so much for your insight! :)
Thank you so much for you perspective on it!
Huh I feel the exact opposite on your take on the trans label. I actually see it as less limiting. But tbh both labels, in a cis world, are limiting. Non binary people must be androgynous and use they/them pronouns while trans people must dress masc or fem and use pronouns that align with such (in a cis world). While we know that isn’t the case, I think it’s important that people realize that these labels only need to mean something to us, not the world around us.
It was helpful! Thank you so much for sharing your perspective! :) have an awesome day too!
Thank you for sharing your perspective!

Thank your for sharing yours and the perspective of your friend!
Thank you for commenting!
I also don’t think it’s wrong but I was wondering about the opinion of y’all because it actually affects you. So thank you so much for your perspective and insight! :)
I feel like i can be nb and not consider myself trans necessarily because i actually never worried about my AGAB. Honestly this could be because my family didnt dwell too hard when i chose something outside my AGAB. So i can understand if your family kinda forced a gender onto you then coming out as nonbinary can literally be transitioning. But since i never had a ""transition"" cuz i was able to be myself gender wise, i dont consider myself trans.
This definition of trans is relatively new (within the last few years) for decades before that trans was meant in the binary sense, so for those of us who have understood and used the term exclusively in a binary sense it’s not as simple as it is for you. Language is fluid and i appreciate that, but before we had the word nonbinary it would have been insulting to my trans brothers and sisters for my gender non-confirming (the closest word we had to nonbinary) ass to walk around saying I was trans.

So it’s been difficult for me to understand how you can be nonbinary and also be trans when trans quite literally means to cross or across- the opposite of cis.
Yeah to me too. I just see trans as the opposite to cis and cis is when you vibe with your agab. Anything trans - to me - means not vibing with your agab.
That makes sense, thank you for commenting!
You very succinctly said something that has been talking me paragraphs to try to explain.
Thanks for your perspective!
This is my personal view as well. 

In fact, it’s almost jarring, and feels almost misgendering, to read all of these “trans is the umbrella term and nb falls under that.”  As if just by stating that, someone is trying to tell me what my gender is - that I’m not non-binary, or not solely non-binary, but that I’m trans as well. And I’m not. I have no connection to the term trans. It has nothing to do with internalized transphobia, or external transphobia, or trying to exclude trans people. 

It has to do with, I took a long time on my gender journey, including trying to figure out if trans fit me or not. And it’s just not the right term or definition for me. Non-binary is the right identifier for me. 

I usually see either two different umbrellas, or sometimes three. (And this is what was explained to be for years, prior to joining this community)

Either, the two umbrellas are “Binary” and “Non-binary”, with both binary cis and binary trans under the first umbrella, and all the varieties of non-binary (including agender, bigender, genderfluid, genderqueer, demigender, etc) under the second umbrella. 

Or, I see three umbrellas- Cis, Trans, and Non-binary. I don’t feel / I am not cis. I don’t feel / I am not trans. I am non-binary, currently specifically genderqueer, but possibly other enby terms as well / instead. 

Tbh, this is first time, in online spaces or irl, that I’ve heard so much “trans is the big umbrella that nb fits under”. I’m much more used to “nb is the big umbrella that trans fits under”. In the sense that, anything other than aligning with the AGAB is going outside of the cis gender binary. 

It’s weird. It feels very “othering” for so many comments to assert that all nb are trans. I feel a lot of dysphoria from trying to force myself into a trans box or umbrella that just isn’t the right word for me. Whereas I feel no dysphoria with “non-binary”. 

I totally accept that for some people, the umbrella is trans —> non-binary, and they identify that way. That’s v cool that they know themselves, and know that that’s how they identify. I’m not trying to argue them out of that view. 

But to try to force that onto other people? That doesn’t feel good at all, and feels like someone is trying to force a label onto me. 

I feel like I’m setting myself up to get downvoted here, and/or accused of transphobia. So I legit feel nervous even posting this. All I know, is for me, I am enby and I am not trans.
That just sounds like trying to decide someone's labels for them (isn't that the common thing we're all trying to get away from?). I'm under no obligation to call myself trans because I'm nonbinary.
I've always presented this way, too (unless someone forced me into something else)! I've been working on social changes, but it feels more like getting the world to see what's always been there, rather than transition. Especially considering that the changes I'm making are legal ones.

That's definitely a personal take though, and doesn't apply to everyone.
It can also relate to what transition would look like, as well.
But isn't that all umbrella terms that are not mutually exclusive?

trans -> nonbinary -> agender.

It falls under the umbrellas, doesn't it?

Obviously, I am not telling you what labels you have to use, that is only your decision.
I identify as agender, more specifically apagender. For me it feels like my gender isn't a part of ME. There isn't an absemce of gender. There is something there, I just feel no connection to it and also couldn't tell you what it is. That's also why I've just identified as a man up till recently since it felt to me like the only thing determining/communicatong my gender was my body. I still present masculine and use he/him, but that's just for convenience and experience.

I could magically change genders tomorrow and except for the practical changes and adaptations, I don't see myself feeling any differently than I currently do.
If you don't mind me asking, what is transmasc/ what is the difference between transmasc and trans man?
Happy to help
Trans doesn't exclusively mean ""non-nonbinary,"" don't worry. Some nonbinary people choose not to use it, but technically, it can refer to anyone with a gender identity different from their AGAB, as it always has. You're not misgendering yourself if you choose to use it.
Yeah, as u/AngryAuthor said, trans still includes non-binary as I said as well. For me it also generally comes up when talking to other people in the lgbt community, so it might also from there that I'm separating non-binary from binary-trans.

And probably also that I feel a bit disingenuous when using it, since my experience with gender is very different from the trans people I know. Especially around disphoria and transitioning.

So please, don't feel that you were wrong the usage of those terms because of me.
u/NBnoemi you didn't remind me! Luckily, I happen to remember just now.
Ooh that didn't even cross my mind until now! Thank you so much for making me aware of that.
My state allows you to update your gender marker on your driver's license, and they've gone out of their way to give you cloak and dagger level plausible deniability so that only you know that you're doing so. You tell the clerk you want to ""update your details"" and then you re-enter all your details (address, weight, height, eye color, gender marker) on a little touchscreen. The clerk doesn't see what you entered, or what it was before. Then they take a new picture, you pay a $20 fee and they mail you a new card.

[Edit]Oh, and I almost forgot, my point was that X is one of your options[/Edit]
Woahhh I didn't even consider that possibility, that's wild! Pretty cool.
Just like in my comic! 😍
Damn, that's kind of weird to think about. Although I'm wondering, what would people be that had X assigned at birth, but identify as either male or female.

They would be trans, because of AGAB, but what about the binary/nonbinary? Because currently binary-trans would be people transitioning between male and female, and nonbinary-trans would be from the binary to nonbinary. Would from nonbinary to binary also be nonbinary-trans.

I might have come to a conclusion while typing, but would still love anyone's opinion.
It's funny to me you say that as an agender, because I'm gendervoid and i prefer to be included under the trans label. Because I'm still trying to transfer myself out of my agab (into redaction, but still)
I get this—the trans community has often been exclusive to anyone who isn’t non-non-binary (that is, binary trans). 

Transgender has been used in other ways, however. Leslie Feinberg (the person who wrote *Stone Butch Blues*) was nb and popularized the term transgender back in the 1980s and 1990s.
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it's the same reasoning for me. Language changes over time, and it can sometimes be hard to apply those changes retroactively. I don't see any issue with defaulting to a term that's easier for the other person to understand; sometimes you just don't want to go into the full explanation.
Sorry it's so long and rambling 😅. I wrote it while listening to a talk and was kind of distracted haha.

Thanks for saying so, though. I know everyone has different experiences and perspectives, and mine will likely differ from yours. But I appreciate you taking the time to read it :) thanks.
Yes. These stereotypes are so harmful, in so many ways. Not just for how cis people see us, and treat us, and legislate against us, but also for how we see ourselves - struggling against those stereotypes, and against the shame and fear they bring.
Ofc 💖
I feel like its a societal thing where stigma has a lot to do with it. If everyone didnt assume you were for example gay, coming out wouldnt be as big of a deal either.

I think the change I made was larger than just my interaction with my family but it did play a role. I have dysphoria for example.

Being nb can mean different things to different people though and I'm ok with that.
Trans isn't short for transition. Transgender does not mean transitioning gender, it just shares the same root word in its etymology. 
No one needs to transition to be trans. 

If a dfab trans guy was raised as a tomboy would he not be trans? 

I'm not telling you to change your identity ofc I just really don't understand this line of reasoning because it just seems like a misunderstanding of the word at its core
Even with that definition, opposite of cis, nb still works though. It seems to me like you mean trans people are ""the opposite gender"" which is a very binary way of looking at things.

I have changed my name, pronouns, wardrobe and appearance. I have also changed the way I interact with others and think about myself. These are things you dont have to do to be trans, but something many trans people do. In the same way many nb people have these experiences. 

I think this all comes from a sense that the barrier of entry is lower for enbies. For trans people there is a long way to go before you pass. The issue here is that there isnt a way for nb people to pass. There isnt a correct way to be nb in our society because it isnt really accepted. It might seem like anyone can just say that they are nb and also trans without changing anything and that might offend you. Thing is that dismissing someone for not passing regardless of if they are nb, mtf or ftm (I know these terms are dated) is kind of something that has its roots in internalized transphobia.
>before we had the word nonbinary it would have been insulting to my trans brothers and sisters for my gender non-confirming (the closest word we had to nonbinary) ass to walk around saying I was trans.

I don't miss the ""you're not really trans unless you do x, y, z just like me"" attitude that was prevalent.
I really don't think this is the case at all. Trans as short for transgender has been a broad inclusive term that included basically all people doing weird stuff for gender my entire time as an out trans person and based on what I've heard from others going back to the nineties? Perhaps this varies from place to place but as far as I know it is/was specifically in opposition to the term with your definition (transsexual which has fallen out of use). Of course both of these can be shortened to trans which may explain contrary associations for that word.
I feel like it’s more Venn diagrams. In fact I made a post a very long time ago to that effect, low quality drawing and all.

Saying that binary contains all cis and trans people would imply that me and other transgender nonbinary people of past and present are not nonbinary because we’d have to be binary to be able to be trans.

It also kinda sets up binary and nonbinary as exclusively opposing things, but there are plenty of people with both nonbinary and binary aspects coexisting in themselves, these people would straddle your proposed umbrellas in yet another different way than I would (since I don’t feel any connection to binary gender).

Beyond all that though, you’re not trans and I am not trying to say that you are. Just noting that at the end because I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to argue against who you are or anything wildly inappropriate like that.
[deleted]
You still present masc and use he/him, so it sounds like possibly you’re not attempting physical or social transition. In that case, I totally understand why you wouldn’t identify as trans. 

I personally see the term as typically describing people who are physically or socially transitioning in some way, even if it’s a really slight change.

Edit to clarify: Of course this wouldn’t mean people who aren’t physically or socially transitioning can’t identify as trans.
Transmasc is an aesthetic or feeling and trans man is a binary gender. A nonbinary person may be transmasc meaning they present masculine or feel masculine. Transman is a binary man
Transitioning to be more masculine vs transitioning to be fully a man
This is honestly how it should be everywhere. My state requires a court appearance and almost a month’s salary (for the average worker) worth of fees. You essentially have to sue the state to allow you to be who you are legally. I’m going through this process now. It’s so backward.
That’s so cool! Can I ask what state(s) are doing that?
Nice!
My opinion is a bit different. Whatever was on my birth certificate, the vast majority of people in my life have never seen it and have decided to assume what I am regardless. Plus, the further majority of these people independently agree with each other. Even though my parents raised me in a very neutral way, everyone else pushed gender on me like I needed to be marinated in the binary.

Unless people get to grow up with the majority of their interactions acknowledging them being nonbinary AND they don’t need to coalition with other trans people to gain the resources they need (like medical transition needs are still there for many even if everyone around them validates their identity), that’s still transgender-ness of having to deal with misgendering due to societal assumptions.
It's interesting how many of us (I'm agender) vary on this. I personally don't refer to myself as trans, because it doesn't feel like it properly reflects my experience. By definition, I am trans, but I'd rather just call myself nonbinary or agender. 

I think part of this has to do with the way a person's disphoria manifests, if they have disphoria. For me, it's mainly social, but there are plenty of nonbinary folks that have pretty narly body disphoria. Since being transgender has such connotations of physical transition (which is a whole different topic), to those of us that don't need much (or potentially anything) in terms of physical change, it can feel like an inaccurate lable.

I think that difference is why it's useful to include nonbinary when talking about non cis identities.
I said “for me” but people use voting with an upvote to mean “i agree” and a downvote to mean “i disagree”.

Language changes and evolves and so do the emotions we have associated with words, if the word trans as an umbrella term becomes the predominant understanding of the word I’m sure my feelings about it will change. But my entire life (including the 5 years I worked in transgender medicine) the term was used exclusively in a binary sense and it would
have been offensive and invalidating for me to apply that label to myself- that was the consensus for many many years. Yeah, i realize I’m a fucking dinosaur talking to people who were born this Century. I only this year learned people are now using it as an umbrella term and I’ve been really struggling to understand and accept this because now I feel like it’s being forced on me, for the second time in my life.
The root isn't just ""transition"" and ""transgender"" means to ""transition gender."" You can go to other online lgbt+ spaces and ""transitioning"" is a common word everyone can use.

You've never heard someone say that?
You understand that the word “cis” means same, as in same gender assigned at birth, so the opposite of that would be the opposite- yes, this is a very binary way of looking at things and what was drilled into me by both the gay and straight community for decades.

Edit: also, I’m not thinking or speaking in terms of presentation or how people look or are perceived, I’m talking about an inner feeling (or absence of feeling) about what your gender is- how someone appears to the outside world or chooses to present is irrelevant to me here. A trans woman or man pre hormone therapy is no less a man or women. Our bodies are vessels that may or may not match up with our internal feeling of gender. I’m exclusively thinking in terms of internal feeling, there is no “barrier for entry” like - wtf? Your gender is your gender is your gender regardless of how the world sees you, fuck that noise.

Edit #2: this is not to dismiss the pain or dysphoria anyone feels when the vessel they were handed does not match. I’m just saying that you are whatever gender you feel you are regardless of how you look or how anyone sees you.
I’m not saying I was a fan, I’ve always tried to be respectful and not invalidate anyone, I’m just tying to explain to people why I’m having a hard time shifting my understanding. 

And this isn’t not directed at you or your response- but I’m getting really frustrated with the downvotes when i am trying to have a discourse to help wrap my head around something I’m struggling with. We’re all Family guys, if you were born this century your frame of reference about this stuff is totally different from mine, try to muster the patience and compassion you wish people who didn’t understand would have with you rather than jumping to judgements. 

Everyone here is fucking valid and words are mostly bullshit anyways.
I see- and how long have you been out as a trans person? 5 years or less? 

Seeing as I was working in a clinic that was one of the only ones providing hormone treatment to transgender individuals at the time (have never used or even considered the term transsexual it’s been out of favor so long) I can say with confidence this was, indeed, the case and several other people on here have agreed with me. I have trained medical professionals all over the country and given talks on hormone therapy for transgender patients using informed consent at conferences and schools, my doctor colleague was is a transgender man who volunteered his time to give more people access to hormones, he was one of my mentors. I personally have prescribed hormones to dozens of transgender patients (the best job I ever had btw). My point is I’ve been in the middle of this community for a long time, long before I had any words to describe my own gender (or lack of). In fact it was hearing transgender men and women speak so firmly about feeling male or female that started me to question myself as I did not understand what on earth “feeling a gender” was like. 

Perhaps the fact that I was primarily surrounded by binary transgender folks due to the nature of my work has some influence. I’m glad for you that your experience was different, but I’m not just making this up.

Edit for a lot more words and context cuz I’m verbose
Personally, I don’t mind labels too much and I think that’s why I like non-binary cuz it perfectly captures how I feel and I’m fine if that’s under the trans umbrella! The only part that really confuses me is people writing “trans means you don’t identify with your AGAB and that’s always been the definition.” But I heard that definition the first time this week! I always assumed it included some sort of physical or mental or societal transition at least and that’s why it was called transgender.

But again I’m new to this community and even though I’ve been lurking in these spaces for a while, I still have a lot to learn! I might have made a wrong assumption because I don’t think I’ve ever been directly told the definition. But non-binary and trans have always been closely connected for a good reason and the most important thing is that the communities look out for each other :)
Oh I don't think there are any people in here arguing that nonbinaries aren't allowed to identify as trans if they want to. The phrasing in your previous comment just sounded very definitive to me.
Yes you got, that's how I think about it too. In regard to my situation of course, everyone can make their own decision on that.

Exacty! Like, in what circumstances is my gender going to be legally relevant? I don't need to prove to a jury that I'm 5'5"" before I can put it on my license, why is my gender so carefully regulated? What do they think the grift is? What could the grift possibly be that I would be defrauding the MVA by putting one letter there instead of another?
My state requires you have bottom surgery before applying to change your gender marker 🙄
I can probably say it's Maryland without doxing myself. The MVA appears to have taken the stance that they don't need proof for your gender any more than they need proof for your height or weight or eye color... not because they don't think people will lie, but because they don't think it matters at all, just like your weight and height and eye color don't matter. Which is in it's own way even more progressive than believing that nobody will lie about their gender (Which, for the record, is not a thing that anybody actually does).
Oregon does too.  We were the first state in the country that offered it.
Personally, I don't miss the ultra gatekeepy attitude of who was included in trans last century. If you didn't match the binary stereotype close enough, basically get told you don't belong as cis or trans.
It’s very interesting to me because the word trans has become used *more often* for binary people alone in my experience over the last decade, not less. It used to be used in a very open way around me and that was a strong foundation for me to feel that transgender is a thing I am. It was heavily enforced that no one needed to transition across, through, beyond, from, around, whatever gender to another gender, but that we all shared the experience of not being well defined by the gender that was presumed of us (then or in the past). Cisgender was only coined as the alternative, people whose bodies and presumed genders and actual genders all aligned. And now I see more nonbinary people think that trans excludes them due to this or that reason.

Still, I am happy that some people decide to decline existing in the cis-trans dichotomy. Less rules, less enforcement of labeling others without their say so.
wait this confuses me - I always thought it was the other way around: that transgender was the umbrella term. I've found it's only more recently that it's come to mean mostly trans women/men?
That is not correct. Transgender and transition just share the same root word of ""trans"". 
Just because it's common doesn't mean it's correct. Trans is a latin word meaning across from or on the other side. It isn't short for transition. 

And implying that transition is required to be trans has a lot of truscum implications for both binary and nonbinary folks.
Basically i never ""transitioned"" because there was nothing to transition to, i already existed as is. There isnt technically a way to be perfectly nonbinary so in my mind i already was nonbinary since the beginning.
I mean.. in that case, yes, it is about definitions changing. Not much more to say. If you dont learn it there will be a lot of misunderstandings
Fwiw, I've been an adult all of this century. I understand the difficulty when terms you're used to develop a new common usage.
No considerably longer and I find your whole comment kind of patronizing. I've been out for a decade (though originally as a binary trans person), the older people I spoke to 30 years. These people are largely binary trans folk. Several people here have also agreed with me. Transgender was categorically the inclusive option in these communities in my country until relatively recently. I'm genuinely shocked you could be this confidently wrong. Perhaps existing in a primarily medical context gave you an overly narrow view? 

Edit: We don't have informed consent in my country so I imagine we are not from the same place though which might contribute to our differing exsperience.
Since transsexual and transvestite were the first common words for us in recent western history, there has been a strong implication that people who aren’t the gender society assigned must undergo medical and social changes to meet some yardstick amount of “transition” in order to be real and (very marginally) acceptable. Medical professional pathologized something that happens naturally in humans. We’ve slowly taken our labels and identity back from the medical establishment and moved towards self identification over diagnosis.

People like me who don’t want surgery because nothing will make my body feel more correct the way my brain is configured couldn’t be called transsexual in say, the 1960s, couldn’t get certain kinds of support. Maybe I would have been called a transvestite. Maybe my orientation would be blamed as the root of my “disorder” and gender never strongly considered. But there were community made groups of trans and bisexual people that certainly could have recognized me as my nonbinary self, even if we used different words. It just would have been much harder for me to find the words and the radical people who would have been my community.

As language evolves, many people will come to a conversation with different definitions. My definition of transgender is formed on the basis of knowing our history and knowing that we took back ownership of what we’re called from doctors who gatekept who was allowed to be what. So that leads me to a very inclusive definition. There are trans people out there who would come to a conversation with your definition because they intentionally feel that there needs to be limits and restrictions on who is *allowed* to be trans. And still more people can use the definitions that I use or that these hypothetical others use without the political reasoning behind their definition but simply because that’s what they learned.

All to say that I have strong biases, ones which I have a incentive to promote. I’m not blind that I have a message I want others to listen to and to agree to if they find it compelling.
I do agree with you on the etymological origin of trans, and I have argued it as well, but language also changes. 

Although if we want to stay with the arguments based on language. If you're planning to take hormones to look more genderneutral, you would go from a gendered state to an ungendered/genderneutral state, which would be transitioning by definition.

Please take that second part in jest. I'm happy you found yourself and are taking action to become the best you, you can become.
While you don’t have to identify as trans, know that by definition, taking hormones is a form of transitioning
In my state, the rationale is: because Mormon Jesus says gender can’t change and is just genitals at birth. Seriously. This state is a borderline theocracy.
Wow, that's awful. It must be one of the Deep South states, I'd imagine. 

Also, in their mind, what bottom surgery is supposed to turn someone non-binary?! This is basically a way to prevent us from legally transitioning at all.
That’s awesome! I hope more states adopt this practice
I love this. It almost makes me want to move to Maryland—but the lack of mountains and oppressive summer humidity keep me away!
Oregon is pretty chill about this as well. Dunno if the DMV person enters it in or not tho.
Yeah this is the impression I got and it's been really weird even in my life as an out trans person seeing transgender go from broad inclusive category to trans men/women. I was speaking to an  older trans person recently who found it genuinely odd that this word word they thought of as a broader more inclusive alternative to transsexual had come to, in their eyes, mean the same thing.
Just curious if your experiences were online or irl? Because i am relatively new (4 years) to the online queer community but lived in San Francisco and was very active in the community irl from 2000 until 3 months ago. I also worked in a clinic that was one of the first to use the informed consent model for hormone therapy for 15 years.
I am a year late to this party, but I just wanted to say that I’ve been out as queer for a decade and this has been my *exact* experience.
Well hop on board and be confused right along with me fellow traveler- i kind of give up. All i know is, right now, trans doesn’t feel right for me. I’m fully aware that might change and I’m fine with that, but this discourse has helped me feel less emotional about the topic which means mission accomplished.
Transitioning has nothing to do with being trans. You can be trans and not transition. Technically that's me, since i didnt transition but i am still nonbinary which others would call trans. I just dont consider *myself* as trans. So if im truscum then i guess its only against myself. I didnt really imply that transition is necessary to be trans except for myself. So if you do want to ""educate"" someone, maybe choose someone else who is actually hateful against others.

I didn't say that someone needs to transition to be trans. I understand the difference between etymologies. I was just using the term transition as an overhead for my internal feelings and external presentation meaning because i was always nonbinary. I didn't necessarily need to feel like i am trans because i just exist, i dont need to label myself to be comfortable.

I dont know if youre the person that sent me a concerned reddit support, but if you were, why?
Well currently there are a lot of misunderstandings because the majority of us old folks not on the internet and especially outside of the queer community aren’t up to speed with this definition - trust me when i say if i walked around calling myself trans i would have to spend a lot of time clarifying that no, that doesn’t mean I’m male. Nobody gets confused in that way if i say nonbinary. It’s still a minority using the word trans in not in a binary way. 

But don’t worry, I’m a dinosaur- and I’m sure I’m the last generation of queers that is working with the i guess old definition. I knew this day would come- it will come for you one day too. It’s the official marker of me being old and out of touch. FML.
Thanks for being chill about my struggle here
Thank you so much for providing that insight into the recent history of the trans community! I didn’t even think about historical context (which sounds silly now) but that will definitely be something I look into more! I appreciate you sharing with me :)

I've heard it said that the reason conservatives are so angry about trans rights is that because they can't understand what gender dysphoria feels like, they don't believe it. They think we have to be lying about our reason for wanting to be addressed differently. They think that it's just some kind of con, and they try to figure out what the grift is, and either they come up with something horrible or worse, they can't come up with anything so they think it must be something so /incredibly/ horrible they can't even imagine it.
Yeah you can even get X as a gender marker here. It's only M or F. I can't wait until I can move!! Also it's Idaho. Not south but still conservative
I mean, it's not like anybody goes anywhere anymore. The furthest I've been in... weeks is the grocery store. I could be anywhere in the country, I couldn't tell the difference.
There are mountains in western Maryland.
Yes, exactly!! It feels like some people want to put the medical establishment gatekeeping back into transgender.
I have been in online and in person groups and had trans friends in both those spaces for just over a decade.

I would say that my in person groups have always been very welcoming of nonbinary identity, but I self curated and was often the first out person in those groups anyway so that influenced it. Online I’ve gone from communities in the early 2010s where most trans people I knew online were nonbinary (genderqueer) or had explored it as an option to now where it feels like many trans places I poke my head into have core community members who would prefer to gatekeep me out.
fair, for what it's worth I'm not from the USA which might explain the difference.
I don’t have a gender either. I Identify as genderless and don’t even like using the labels of agender or non binary to describe me because it feels too limited. However the trans label makes sense because of my journey. 

You don’t have to have dysphoria to be trans. If you want to start HRT just for the sake of doing it that is cool, but your body will undergo transformations into that “aesthetic” that you’re trying to achieve. 

Again, you don’t have to use the label, but in terms of definition it’s just what it is.
As a centrist-conservative (and an enby), I think you're spot on here. They simply don't understand, and see it as some kind of leftist fad. I kind of see it as my activism to let them know that we are real, that we are just as human as they are, and that we don't all think alike (""leftist zealots"" as they would say). 

I think all bigotry comes from a lack of understanding of another's perspective, to be honest.
No way! I live just south of Malad (but on the Utah side of the border). Isn’t Idaho “great?”
I still travel, and have since being fully vaccinated. But I get that a lot of people feel safer to hunker down, which is valid.
Ooh I didn’t know that!
Self-curated- thats a mood and a great way of describing my experience as well. Can I ask when this was happening for you? For me m transgender in the binary sense started to become much more known, accepted and access to hormones started to increase rapidly in the early 2000’s. Not long after I side-stepped the pressure and expectation to transition I began to describe myself as genderless-then i fell into an 8 year lesbian relationship cave and lost touch with the community. When I emerged in 2015 I learned I was nonbinary! But I was definitely the first person (and only) amongst my queer and hetero peers talking about gender in anything other than binary terms.

All the ridiculously conservative parts of Oregon want to secede from our state to join Idaho ... It's a super conservative state. In some ways more so than the deep south. You don't even have individual cities in Idaho that are liberal or diverse. It's all conservative white folks.
Is less that and more that now that I telework I don't really have a reason to. I actually take 15 minute grass-touching breaks throughout my work day to keep from turning into a shut-in.

It feels more like PA imo. Beautiful though for sure.
I “discovered” trans people were real in 2009, found online groups to question my orientation and gender in immediately, and came out to myself in 2010 as being genderqueer. From then on I was openly nonbinary on my (rural, southern) college campus which led to me finding other people at college who were closeted but had something going on under wraps. Eventually many of them came out there, or I’ve kept up with them on Facebook where they’re now using the names and pronouns that match their gender.

In both my online and in person groups from 2010-2014, nonbinary trans people were prevalent, probably roughly equal to the number of binary trans people. After that I also went into a cave of sorts, had no safe way to stay in touch or express my transgender self (except in secret talking to my wife and with this one nonbinary person I met in this truly unsafe town). A few years later, I couldn’t handle it anymore and I moved away and came to a large urban center where I’ve re-integrated online and in person. My new groups I’m involved in offline are for trans people and explicitly include me, not so much organic friends coming together but more community center based support/activity groups.
A lot of non binary people use the term trans to describe themselves and they do not have a gender. People use hormone therapy or do body and social adjustments to feel comfortable within themselves. It’s not always about achieving a “gendered” look or feeling. It’s about maintaining comfortable and just being able to feel fully like yourself. 

What I’m explaining is essentially the label of trans can be seen as being just as wide as the non binary label as they are both umbrella terms and everyone’s experience falls along a spectrum under here. 

You keep saying you don’t use the label to describe yourself and that’s not a problem. I’m just making sure that the existence of the trans label isn’t seen as something as limited or binary when it simply isn’t.

Sadly based off a true story (original)		"""Sorry I keep getting it wrong""

""No Dad, you keep *never trying*. I could accept getting it wrong.""

Basically a conversation a friend of mine had with their parent
My parents irl
Ugh my mom. I haven't even told my dad because I know he won't get it.

Plus, I'm still going by my given name! It's just my gender neutral middle name instead of my super gendered first name.
Yeah, I feel that. At this very moment, I'm at a friend's house because my mother and I got into an argument and she's being transphobic as hell.
i havent even tried to tell my parents bc my dad is so vocal about how transphobic he is /:
god i am SO scared of coming out to my parents. i dont think theyd even understand it
My parents.
I stepped in people who misgended others as a joke.

33 Non-binary, feeling sad today, my boomer parents (I’ve been out to since January) said they can never use my name/pronouns because they are an attack on God’s Kingdom... no shade on religion please, just need some support and encouragement.		"I’m really sorry to hear that, god loves you no matter who you are, god loves you because you are you. I’m proud of you for coming out to them even if they don’t accept you. We will. Feel free to talk to me any time, we’re here for you.
I'm sorry your parents aren't accepting of you. You'll always have a family in the nonbinary community, though

P.S. you cute as hell and total goals
I’m usually a lurker but this connected with me. I know how much it sucks when the people who’ve raised you and are supposed to provide you unconditional support fail to do just that - know that you’re not alone and sometimes the bravest thing you can do is to just keep on living as your true self unapologetically. Sending good vibes your way.
Hey, I'm 22, amab, I love God, and still living at home. I'm out to my immediate family except my dad. My mom isn't supportive. I jokingly (only partially a joke) asked if I looked pretty one night after coming out and she said ""well, that is not a word I'd use to describe my **son.**""

I still love God, I know that he still loves me, and I know that there is nothing wrong with me. And for tou that goes double. You're not alone out there. Mad respect.

Hope this helped.
I can really empathize with how difficult this situation is. I'm thinking about you.
Galatians 3:28, ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" I'm sorry that your situation is what it is. You're valid, and you have the support of every single one of us.
Ugh, I wish I could send a hug, (one of those really solid ones, you know?). I don't get my pronouns used by my family either, and my mother has a huge stigma about my transition.

Are you from Canada too?
I feel. My SO's family indirectly (I'm not out as anything to them- straight passing) called me an ""abomination against God and nature."" 

You heckin cute.
Sending positive vibes. 💙 Remember that you're valid, no matter what.
I'm sorry they're like that. I'm 19 and I came out to my mom a few years ago. She never cared about my sexuality cuz shes not exactly straight but it took her some time to get the pronouns. Her excuse was that when she was learning german she got made fun of misgendering things I guess? Idk

Anyway, now she says the right ones. 

You are valid
An act of love, compassion, and respect can NEVER be a threat to a God whose entire shtick is based foundationally on those things. I'm sorry for the intolerance you're facing, by people so close to you. You are so, so loved, you are so incredibly valuable, and you deserve every good thing. I hope you are holding it together despite everything. We are here for you.
sending love your way <3
You’re very courageous and I’m sorry they are reacting that way now. I’m too scared to come out to my parents and I’m about your age, you’re braver than I am. I don’t know if they’d hate my gender or sexuality more....
Play this for them.

I'm right there with ya. I recently decided to cut my parents out because of it (and some other things) until I felt they were willing to see me as I am, but I know that's not for everybody. If'n ya need some good scripture to know that you're loved and affirmed by the creator, regardless of gender, Galatians 3:28 is a good one. 
Just know that you're fearfully and wonderfully made and you have a huge family of queer folks here supporting you. I'm sorry your family of origin is working from some bad theology. I know how that feels to not only be told who you are is an affront to ""gods kingdom"" and that it's a choice that negates any claim you have in their eyes to a relationship with God. Please know that's some bullshit, and we're here for you.
I just wanted to let you know that God loves all His children and nothing can change that. if you are still open to Christianity I invite you to join r/GayChristians and r/OpenChristian .
*virtual hugs* Please never give up on being who you really are, the world is better with you showing your true self!
You are not an attack on God's kingdom.  He sent His son to die for every human on this planet- yourself included, because he loves you more than anything.  He wouldn't create you just to damn you to hell, and I will beat up anyone who tells you otherwise.


-A demiboy who has been struggling with his church for a while
If god had a problem with you, he would have made you different, but he didn't.  Your parents are wrong. Do something nice for yourself today, fam. You deserve to be well and feel well.
I'm sorry to hear, friend. Hopefully, you have people around that will respect you for you. Find them and keep them close. Love and light ❤️
I'm sorry. Just want to send support from one 30-something NB to another. You were brave to come out to them and staying true to yourself, no one can take that away.

University Administration Thinks That They Know Who I Am Better Than Myself	"I'm so frustrated. I graduated with my masters from a pretty prestigious school last year, and I only mention that because it's important to note that this school also attempts to pass themselves off as very progressive and they care a LOT about their carefully curated reputation.

This week, my school reached out to ask for an updated headshot and bio, so they could update my listing in the alumni directory and potentially use it for promo materials (you know, things like ""our graduates now work in XYZ fields!""). No problem, I sent one in, using they/them pronouns in my new bio. 

Well, they were quick to respond, showing me the formatted/finished product for my approval, and that's when I noticed that they took Every. Single. Pronoun. and changed them all to she/her. 

I do dress and present fairly femme. And I'm generally okay with people using a mix of they/them and she/her pronouns to refer to me. But the fact that they took what I wrote, the way I describe myself, and intentionally changed it?!

I know that when strangers look at me they see a cis woman, and I feel dysphoric enough about that as it is. I'm just so upset/sad/disappointed that even after being clear about who I am, some stranger really felt like they knew better.

Yes, I emailed them about it so we'll see what happens, but I'm just so frustrated and I wanted to share this. I'm sure I'm not the first person to deal with this, but why is this still an issue? At supposedly very ""liberal"" schools? It's ridiculous."	"That’s so frustrating! A similar thing happened to me in medical school. I hope the shape up.
Absolutely infuriating. I'm sorry you're dealing with this!!

By the way, I've found that casually cc-ing people's supervisors or department/unit heads gets some pretty magical results (only if you're looking for and have the emotional wherewithal for a bit of conflict of course).
Can you withdraw consent for them to use your image and stuff?
I recently graduated from my school and the dean reached out to see where I’m working. They deadnamed me. 

It’s frustrating when you think they see you as a person but at the end of the day, we’re numbers.
""I regret to inform you that I am revoking my consent for [school] to use my headshot and bio as out values do not align. Thank you for your time and consideration.""

I'm sorry you're going through this.
That's insane. I go to a run of the mill online school (SNHU) and even though they aren't prestigious and have thousands and thousands and thousands of students, since the day that I changed my name in my student portal, I have not been deadnamed on any of their sites nor by anyone I called at the student center/admissions office.

It's crazy how some places truly just do not care when they have the reputation saying they do, and other places where you'd least expect a personal touch, they actually notice and care.
I can't imagine the rage. I don't really know what I can do for advice but I hope it gets resolved.
That shit makes me so mad. If they refuse to use your pronouns, you have every right to refuse to being used in their advertising. Very possibly just a single person in the office reviewing who doesn't think singular they/them pronouns are ""academic"" or something, but definitely escalate and don't let them hide who you are.

So sorry this happened 💜
A lot of “progressive” schools like this are run by people who are either too out of touch or bigoted to understand the messages they preach. It’s like they want to be *seen* as advanced, but they don’t want to do the work to *be* advanced. My school makes all the admin put their pronouns in their email signatures, but it’s a performative gesture because they all refuse to use correct pronouns for students & other staff.
I feel your frustration. Not at the same level but my university is also “progressive” including about gender and also even how it relates to the native culture here, which recognized a third ‘in between’ gender role. My uni has some unisex bathrooms to be gender-affirming, for example. Also has a system of changing what name shows on everything to a “nickname” in the cases of trans and cultural students. So everything has my chosen name on it from the class roster to scholarship forms.     
Yet for some reason the admins sent over my info form (that I filled out) with the correction of my legal (dead) name to my fieldwork placement. It’s caused a ton of confusion for my placement and there was literally no reason to correct it as there isn’t any government/directly legal stuff for my legal name to be necessary for. It’s been since the start of August and my required nametag still has my dead name on it. Frustrating .-.
Tell them you are pulling your photo and listing until it’s resolved.
I wanna hear what happens
It's Possible It's Just A Bad Editor Paid To Edit The Stuff Or Something, Who Heard Someone Say ""Singular They Is Incorrect"" And Didn't Think Harder, I Remember A Story Where My Dadd Wrote An Article For Something, And Then An Editor Changed A Sentence To Make It Less Correct Grammatically Before Publishing, So It's Not Impossible. Still Sucks Though.

If It *Wasn't* That, And Was Actually Fully Intentional, Then That's Like Honestly Disgusting That They'd Do That.
welcome to transsexualism
I'm so sorry you had to deal with this too! I really don't understand why other people feel like they have the right to dictate how others describe themselves.
Something tells me that OP does have some sort of say in this, especially if this is in the US, not to mention the fact that OP is an adult so they can easily email the school and say “if you choose not to respect my identity then I would like for you to remove the updated information completely. You did not ask for clarification on my pronouns and you decided for me that I must’ve made a mistake. I can assure you that I am old enough to know how to refer to myself.”
I’m not sure, but I would assume they should have a right to not being listed if they don’t wish to. 

I’d be beyond pissed. If I was OP I’d be causing a *scene*.
I would definitely not okay something so disrespectful.
They just emailed me back and all it said was:

*""Glad I checked with you, gnomieebee.  I reverted back to your submission.  Thanks, so much.""* 

So on the one hand I'm glad that they're going to change it back (although I'll definitely be checking to make sure that actually happens), but on the other hand WHY did they do that in the first place?!? And also the ""Glad I checked with you"" is so ridiculous and condescending--they didn't check with me, they sent me a form email asking for confirmation before posting. They probably thought I wouldn't notice. That is very very different from asking for permission or checking in about it (which would be inappropriate already, just not quite as bad).
Wow. Real class act there. 

I mean, if I had to guess I’d say that probably someone higher up (usually this is an editor but who knows) was insisting that “they” is incorrect and that you wouldn’t care if someone “fixed your mistake.” And now the person submitting it can go back to them and be like “actually no, those are OPs pronouns, its not a mistake, and if you keep insisting it will be transphobic as hell and cause drama that’ll make us look bad publicly. Mind, this is speculation, but I’ve seen it play out that way more than once. I’m so sorry you’re having to put up with this nonsense.
That’s inaccurate and condescending. If you don’t mind the conflict, I would loop in the next step up individual from that person if you know them, or just a head of whatever department is doing this if you don’t, and specifically point out that you were not asked at all then ask why your pronouns were changed without your permission.
You should say something about that. Ask why it was changed at all and when they think that they checked with you about it.
I would ask for either their supervisor or the person who made the edit and grill them about Why this happened"	xs2zjt	NonBinary	394	1.0	2022-09-30 14:36:29

Does anyone else feel really isolated by all the “assigned gender doesn’t matter” rhetoric?	"I’m constantly seeing discussion in nb spaces about AGAB not mattering, and I always come away feeling sad and isolated. Like I don’t have a choice y’all, society sees & treats me as a woman 100% of the time even though I do everything I can to look masculine (I’d love to wear some more femme stuff but I can’t with my current body). I’ve never had someone be attracted to me who wasn’t attracted to women. And I’m still working to unlearn all the shit I internalized during childhood being raised as a girl - even though I knew I was trans then it didn’t protect me from what society was telling me although I know some people will claim it should have

Am I really the only person having these experiences? Based on some of these posts it seems like most of y’all can just ignore all of this and I just can’t relate at all :/"	"I don't think people necessarily mean that AGAB doesn't matter at all, or that they aren't affected by it.  I interpreted it to mean, ""It's okay to just say that you're 'nonbinary' without having to specify 'nonbinary amab'/'nonbinary afab' etc.""  unless of course you want to specify, just that you don't have to.
I say this with a lot of empathy towards your perspective - I think you're somewhat misinterpreting the tone of those posts.  I, personally, don't mean that AGAB doesn't matter in the sense that it has no bearing on our lived experience.  Of course it does - binary gender is deeply embedded in almost all aspects of society and it will always affect us.

What I mean, at least, by ""agab doesn't matter"" is just that it SHOULDN'T matter, and if you can't ""tell"", it's rude to guess.  And it's also rude to make assumptions about a person based on your perception of their AGAB.  And separating ""afab enbies"" from ""amab enbies"" tends to create the same binary we try to get away from.  BUT, that doesn't mean that afab nonbinary people and amab nonbinary people don't have experiences unique to their assigned sex and how they were socialized.  


Other people expressing a feeling doesn't invalidate you, and those people are entitled to feel the way that they do just as much as you're entitled to feel the way that you feel.  I'm sorry seeing posts like that made you feel alone, and I do totally get where you're coming from, but I don't think hostility or resentment towards people who feel that way is the way to go.  Your experiences are valuable and you deserve to talk about them, but so does everyone else.
I don't think people aren't struggling like you are, I think it's just venting and being frustrated online when agab is seemingly brought up for no reason and nonbinary ppl constantly being put in afab/amab categories (which sucks massively bc when ur enby you don't fit the binary or the two categories)

That's kinda the discussions I'm seeing lately that's why they want to be distanced from agab.

Obviously agab can still be relevant in your life and its often not a choice sadly, like you described here, many of us still have to deal with that bc transphobia and in those instances it's normal to bring up agab in enby spaces. It just gets on people's nerves or even gets them dysphoric when having to see all the time ""for context I'm afab enby"" then as you continue to read you realize they really didn't have to mention that at all :/ it happens SO much.

Just constant reminders, strong attachments to agab, nonbinary ppl being categorized or judged based on agab by other enbies etc 

I hope you understand.

Some nonbinary ppl are connected to their agab though, that's valid and this isn't meant to stomp that.
I’m more so feeling that my AGAB is relevant because of health issues. My personal identity as a trans nonbinary person actually is not as potent and life impacting as my identity as a person with endometriosis and adenomyosis (because of these conditions I’m struggling socially and physically.) Those disorders, while not explicitly pertaining to AFAB people, do relate to my reproductive organs. I have to go through AFAB healthcare means to have help with it. 

This leads me down paths of sexism/misogyny mixed with transphobia. My doctors don’t really recognize my gender nor do they listen to me based on my sex. It’s really frustrating and I have no where to really talk about this. Endo support groups are not always very supportive of trans individuals 

**So sometimes, AGAB matters. But I think of it like this: it only *really* matters in the context of referring to yourself.** You can talk about *your* experiences with *your* AGAB, but you shouldn’t generalize the experiences of all people who are assigned a specific gender at birth. This is because many trans people could transition earlier on and live socialized lives that match their preferred gender, and intersex people exist (these terms were really originally for them, and their experiences do not match perisex ones), so AGAB means different things to everyone depending on their experiences.

AGAB is relevant if you want to talk about your socialization or how you’re read and treated by people. But it’s often used as an identifier, which it isn’t. The point of talking of *assigned* gender is precisely that it’s a coercive practice that’s forced upon us, which is why it’s sometimes called CAGAB. It’s okay to use it when talking about being mistreated because of an assumed gender—that’s what the term exists for.
EDIT: My original comment below is a bit of a rant, not so much of a rant that I think I should delete it, but enough of one that I’m adding this disclaimer; I’m having a bad day and other user have posted more eloquently version of my feelings.

It’s because of experiences like yours (which are very much like mine) that I don’t like seeing AGAB mentioned. If I can’t escape my AGAB then I least want a break from it. Seeing people point out their own AGAB when they don’t need to reminds me that everyone treats me like my AGAB and if NonBinary people keep on mentioning what their own AGAB was then it must be super important and really matter and I don’t want it to matter. 

The real shitfuckery of the whole thing is that when someone mentions their AGAB it’s almost always obvious what their AGAB must have been, if what I think is obvious is actually wrong, IT DOSENT MATTER.

When someone posts a rant about their Mum insisting they wear a dress to their sisters wedding, obviously AFAB right? maybe not, IT DOSENT MATTER. What matters is they are being forced into something they are not comfortable with. Maybe because it’ll be restrictive post surgery, or show scars, or they don’t want to make that gender presentation on that day, or ever, or they hate the colour, or they don’t want to shave and will get grief about that, or they do want to shave and are embarrassed about the rash it’ll cause, they could have been AFAB and hate the idea of conforming to expectation to wear a pretty dress, they could have been AMAB and feel pressured into wearing a dress to present androgynously because Mum says that’s how NonBinary people dress, they could be AFAB or AMAB and the real issue isn’t the dress the issue is Uncle Creepy will be there and will stare at their tits, they could be AFAB or AMAB and the issue isn’t even the dress it’s that their Mum is a dominating control freak and they just want to defy her wishes because they are tired of her shit.
I've started saying things like ""I am usually read as a gnc woman and have been my entire life"" rather than ""I'm afab."" It's longer but it more precisely captures the meaning in trying to get across using afab as a shorthand.

I definitely feel you, though. So much of my life is shaped by being perceived in this way, and so much of the support for people who are treated like women is branded as being ""for women"". It's frustrating that I have to choose between lumping myself in with women (invalidating myself and drawing the ire of the online enby community) or isolating myself from the support structures i very much need, because I operate in primarily male-dominated spaces and it sucks to be treated like a girl in there a lot of the time, y'all.
I think the point is that we are all nonbinary. The way society treats all of us should be the same regardless of how we present. Identifying as nonbinary should be enough. 

That said, I get where you’re coming from. I’ll always be clocked as my AGAB. It’s the body I’ve got, and HRT isn’t exactly a buffet where you can pick what changes. 

You are valid. You are nonbinary. And it’s perfectly fine to talk about your AGAB, particularly where it intersects how society treats you as an enby.
It's not about agab not mattering to your journey and experiences, it's that a ton of people bring it up in completely unnecessary conversations almost like a ""look at me, look how good I'm doing at looking non-binary, could you even guess my agab if you tried? Tee-hee"" and it's really fucking dumb because that's not what being non-binary is about. I don't know what your conversations have been like but if you're receiving that sort of feedback often then perhaps you're unintentionally reinforcing a gender binary in an attempt to validate yourself. Validation is hard, especially when you may feel isolated and misunderstood, but we must find ways of feeling valid without reinforcing the binary.

Honestly even if I were writing a post like this I personally wouldn't mention my agab, because I feel it is entirely irrelevant to the conversation we're having unless I bring up specific things specifically related to the specific agab. 

I think pretty much every enby has struggled with similar things, feeling like people are only attracted to them for their agab, you're definitely not alone there. I struggled with this until I started getting out there and meeting a lot more queer people and learning that just like I have a unique sexuality that's not easily classified and labelled, a fuck ton of other people are like that too and it's very nice to know that.

Tldr: agab does not matter in almost all conversations, as there are commonalities in the trans and enby experiences across any agab which makes it irrelevant to bring up any specific one. Really the only times it makes sense are when you are talking about a specific experience and how that experience specifically related to the agab. Medical talk is really not about gender it's about sex but given the fact that we call female and male 'genders' in the context of agab it makes sense to use the same terms, even though I really do think we should use a different acronym for genders Vs sexes but it's whatever :p
AGAB is what the doctor said you were as a baby. It doesn't 1:1 correlate with how you're raised. I've found the ways autism affected my upbringing make autistic people assigned the other binary gender at birth more relatable than allistic people assigned the same gender as me at birth. It's also massively culturally dependent.

It doesn't correlate 1:1 with puberty. While excessively gatekept (and also a shoddy compromise) some trans kids do get access to puberty blockers, and so never go through the puberty typically assumed based on their assigned gender at birth. Similarly, some intersex people go through an endogenous puberty that isn't the one you would assume. Plus even for trans people who have gone through the ""expected"" endogenous puberty, they can then go through a second exogenous puberty.

There are common experiences, but they aren't universal. The factors that go into both gendered socialisation and the development of sexual characteristics are both far more complex than a boy/girl binary that can be divined from an infant's genitals.
For me, I want to be able to have conversations without my AGAB constantly getting inserted into it. I identify and present the way that I do because I don't want people to constantly keep reminding me that I'm ""biologically female"" and ""AFAB"" and generally considered by everyone to be a woman. I don't want people thinking that's okay or that I ""don't mind bc it's true"" or whatever.  I don't want that to be assumed to be a good way to talk about things in every conversation I have around gender.

But I do relate to your experience. I really do. There are some times that I want to be able to complain to people wo understand about being constantly seen one way, or erased, or not taken seriously. And I've still found ways to do that amongst friends.
My partner even. ""Far as anyone can see you're just a dude with long hair.""
I get what some people are saying about it, I just hope it's directed at cis people who see us as only our agab, and not nb people like me who find validity in using afab at certain times. Society also unfortunately sees me as a woman despite me trying my best to look androgynous, and I think it's important, at least to me, to be able to tell my experiences of misogyny I've had to deal with that come from people seeing me as a woman, so I use the afab as a clarifier in those types of discussions. Most of the time I just use transmasc nb.
AGAB does matter to people’s individual experience but many people assume universal experiences that are not. That’s it for me imo. Don’t project on me and I won’t project my shit on you.
It's not just you, and I feel like every day here there's a new ask that other people not talk about AGAB or being transfeminine/masculine or gay/lesbian/bi or how we're described with this or that term that gets labeled ""binary"" from out of the blue.

But the reality is, unless I emphasize that I'm \*transfeminine\* people will assign a masc gender to me, often with a side helping of euphemisms for gay stereotypes as well. Or, people assume that if I'm nonbinary I'm AFAB and under 30 by default because that's what they assume nonbinary people to be.

I'm definitely not a man (in spite of appearances), and I'm not a woman right now either. But my gender journey includes recovering from toxic masculinity and embracing both androgyny and transfemininity. If that description doesn't work for someone, they are free to leave it on the shelf for someone else to consider.
Kinda same. As I said in the last post about this saying the opposite of what you’re saying, I’m AFAB. I use she/her.. I present feminine. To everyone but me I’m a girl & even then I’m fine with the word girl (not woman tho). It’s the fact people immediately will assume I’m cis & that’s it, no one will ever look at me & go “yeah she’s nonbinary” unless I tell them & that makes me sad :((

My AGAB absolutely matters & even plays a role in how I personally identify not just my experiences, because part of me is fully convinced that if I was AMAB I’d be exactly the same but reversed like I’d use he/him & be masculine presenting while still being nonbinary. My AGAB influenced my experience with gender & therefore has an influence on my actual gender. I don’t feel any attachment to gender as a concept, but because I’ve lived so long as a “cis” girl I do feel slight attachment to that & I still identify with a lot of feminine words & things, & identifying so closely with my AGAB compared to all other genders is the reason I don’t identify as trans, even though I’m not cis (please no one try to convince me “you’re trans because you fall under the nonbinary umbrella” like.. I know, it’s just not a word I identify with & won’t be using on myself anytime soon, but ppl exactly like me can & that doesn’t make them any less valid)

For other people if they don’t feel the same connection to their AGAB or they don’t want anyone to know then that’s okay, that’s none of my business & I don’t need to know. If they do feel their AGAB is important & would like to share that then absolutely I would love to know more about them in a way they feel comfortable. It’s up to the individual & no one, cis, trans, or otherwise, should be dictating the relevance of anyones AGAB except their own.

However. It actually seems like you’re agreeing with the other posts (even though you’re initially saying the opposite), because ultimately what you’re both saying is that AGAB *shouldn’t have to* matter, but it can if you feel your own one does. A lot of those posts are addressing cis people, people who look at a nonbinary person & categorise them based on their AGAB, etc. & you’re completely right that this shouldn’t be the norm. The difference in what you’re saying is the wording & way it’s been interpreted honest. I normally agree with those posts but some of the comments make it seem like AGAB can & should *never* matter & that’s what I feel is invalidating. Not the “AGAB shouldn’t matter to others” thing. I think these opinions could be worded better but most of us all seem to be in agreement, again including you! <33
As an AMAB transfeminine nonbinary, faeflux to be specific, I understand how you feel.  No matter how hard I try I am seen by most people as a man. On days I feel more nonbinary, or even agender, I cant dress less feminine or I will just be seen as a cis male. So I continue to present mostly feminine because of that.  I wish my body was still as feminine as it still was in my 20s. If I could still have people look at me and not be able to tell what gender I was unless I presented more strongly one way or the other, that would be ideal.
I don’t ignore it, I just don’t like it. I’m trans non-binary bc I don’t identify as my agab and I’m tired of being labeled as non-binary agab. Someone else just did a great post about it recently - I recommend checking that out.
YES! I think people tend to take the concept of AGAB not being destiny, AGAB not being something that invalidates your internal sense of gender + the material reality you live as a trans person (All of which are good things that should be normalized), and in the process nuance of how your AGAB actually influences who you are and how you interact with the world as a human tends to be flattened. 

I def share the experience of feeling alienated from trans/ NB spaces because although my internal sense of gender is much more complicated, womanhood has been metaphorically shackled to my ankle since way before I was young enough to understand it. It has formed who I am, whether I want it to or not, and I cannot get rid of that feeling when cishet society constantly reminds me of it.

I think its important to remember that lot of the rhetoric emerges from a place where trans women/trans fems are considered Ontologically Bad due to being AMAB, and keeping that in mind when observing ""AGAB doesn't matter"" helps me to understand why people adopt that framework, and that I am allowed to have my own complex view of my own gender that IS influenced by my AGAB, without forcing that on others, or feeling that I am ""being nonbinary incorrectly"" because not everyone feels the same way.

Edited for typos/grammar
I think it's more of ""you don't need to tell people your agab, you're still nonbinary"" sentiment. agab does matter unfortunately because I'm also constantly seen as my agab and am expected to fit to society's standards based on it. I think people here are more trying to say ""agab shouldn't matter""
It is isolating. Your feelings are real and valid. 
AND your experience is just as real and valid as anyone here. One experience doesn't have to exclude the other. They can exist at the same time. 

And I relate in the sense that I don't feel like I can wear a dress because I am aware of the assumptions that go around with that. (And to your point, there is also THAT expectation of ""good looking"" female, whateverthat means...). Unfortunately the way I dress (not in a dress or skirt) still gets people assuming my gender. It's exhausting.

I see people trying to explain some aspects, concepts etc and I feel that isolation when this starts to happen to me. If that is what you were looking for, I hope they've helped you. Very valid points here. Misunderstandings happen and getting clarity on concepts and ideas may help (they help me) 

And as I said in the beginning, all experiences are real and valid. No one has to hide theirs because it doesn't match some group. It's nice to find comfort and community, but I believe that has a better chance of success if the stories add to each other as oppose to silencing others. 💛
I get you. Anyone who sees me is going to think""skinny man with long hair"". I'd feel unwelcome in non-male spaces because I know that's how I appear. Dating app suggests me lesbian's and straight men and I know they're not interested. It's rough,I know I'm not a man but that's not how I'm seen. I think that's what you're talking about?
Whenever someome says something ""doesn't matter"" I always wonder ""doesn't matter to whom?""

They probably mean it doesn't matter to them but are just speaking a bit too generally.

If it matters to you, that's OK.
I feel the same. As much as we tell ourselves it doesn't matter the fact is that AMAB's and AFAB's have different experiences because we were socialized in a different way. Mentioning our AGAB's is good shorthand for where you came from, isn't that important sometimes? I happen to occupy a female body. The way the world sees me and how I experience the world have a lot to do with how my body looks. Not to mention I have biological functions that cis women do, that's part of my experience.
I feel similarly, I think there can be space for both feelings about it. I think overall our goals should be “AGAB doesn’t define you or determine your gender or presentation” but that doesn’t mean you can just ignore your socialization. And I don’t think that people calling for less focus on AGAB are asking this either. I am AFAB as well and I feel similarly, although I’m not masc. i was raised in a patriarchal cult so the misogyny and SA/gendered violence I experienced runs deep. I’ll never be able to let that go, and I don’t have a huge problem letting people know that I’m AFAB. because I just don’t know how else to define my experience. I’m not a woman. I’m just in a body that made it so they treated me like this. I’ll always be a feminist and allied with anyone that’s victim to misogyny. I still feel a lot of ties back to I guess femininity or womanhood maybe. On the other hand, I totally think that it’s valid for non binary ppl to not want to disclose their AGAB and want to have no relation to it but that’s not all of us. There’s always a lot of range of experience when you’re non binary. Which is why I think it’s pretty neat!
It's honestly pretty naive, too, for most people to come into this thinking they don't have any internalized misogyny or prejudices, have never been traumatized by the world's sexism or bigotry, and that their experiences being mistaken for A Single Binary Gender will never be an influence on their personality or future. 

Not all trans folk realize really young that they're trans. Not all of us get to come out as teens and enjoy hormones during the period of our life we're still being ""socialised"". And few DON'T have any negative experiences or trauma observing/being the target of sexism (which also fucks up cis straight men - toxic masculinity is just more sexism). 

It also took going online with a masculine name for me to realize how thoroughly society WAS gendering me, against my will, because it thinks it can perceive my AGAB and behave accordingly. That's a real problem, and it's a problem we need space to discuss. 

It shouldn't be unusual to mention one's AGAB in online spaces when you absolutely know people see it looking at you IRL and you're trying to contextualize explaining an experience. Here, people see your words and take you at them - if you say you're nonbinary, for one, yes you are and you're welcome here, but we also can't look at you and see why any rando on the street might be shitty about it, so we often feel pressured to explain how we're not passing - which, for many, will always simply be a mention of AGAB, because the idea of ""looking androgynous"" is its own, overlapping but distinct category, and nonbinary doesn't have a look or a third space all of its own. We're not ""ambiguous looking solely by being precisely smack in the middle between masculine and feminine, and still related only to those two concepts"" - not all of us, at least, and that's not a prerequisite for being nonbinary. 

I think the conventionally attractive, slim, white, able-bodied folk who can effortlessly achieve an ""androgynous look"" take for granted the entire concept of passing as nonbinary and therefore being able to escape their AGAB/being instantly clocked any time, any place.
No because I am me and you you. I don’t listen to all that. Just be you
Yeah I get this. I know why people don't want to be seen as if their gender is just the diet version of their AGAB, but we also have plenty of reasons to discuss our AGAB. Particularly us AFABs with our shared trauma from being constantly physically intimidated by half the population... Plus other physical things like periods and such... The experience of being AFAB is unique in ways that are worth discussing. And we live in a cis-normative society, so people are judged by what gender matches their physical appearance more. Which is often the same as the person's AGAB. So it's like we can't ignore the fact that NB people come from having an AGAB and that is a major part of our lives, even if we also want to distance ourselves from the gender label we were originally given. Obviously it doesn't feel like it always fit or we wouldn't be NB.
I am feeling feminine rn but am non binary and bisexual and i am a good nb now.
Being afab nonbinary is a HUGE part of my identity. Just because my gender is not within the binary doesn’t mean I can’t still have pride and relate to my birth sex.
AGAB not mattering refers to what we can and can't do, and is usually mentioned in response to ppl who say ""women and afab nonbinary people"" which generally makes it seem like they don't see us as nonbinary but ""woman-lite""


our AGAB affects a lot like our upbringing and our struggles with dysphoria and with how society perceives us, but should not dictate who we can and cannot be :)
Same but I think those posts are just trying to separate our NB space from the cis-het binary influence. I too need to continue working to deconstruct my AGAB despite being fully out, people in general still see me as a woman no matter how many times I tell them otherwise.
Literally every time someone refers to me: sh- they
there are a lot of experiences that a lot of people have that are influenced by their AGAB, and there are some pronounced patterns in how being assigned a particular gender can result in specific experiences. i don't think anyone is trying to say that, in a particular person's experience, their AGAB was not a factor — what people mean is that there is no universal ""AFAB experience"", (beyond ""was assigned female at birth"") that all AFAB people have. i've had a lot of assumptions made about my experiences based on my AGAB that were completely untrue. 

also, particularly with regard to discussion of things from the perspective of being AFAB, some of the experiences generalized as being ""AFAB experiences"" are very commonly shared by transfemme people. 

another thing is that the the... idk, laws of mutability?... are not necessarily the same for being AMAB vs for being AFAB. idk if others will find this helpful, but i'm going to try to explain this the way that made it make sense to me: 

for me, growing up as a transmasc person, my experience was that 100% of the time, unless i was interpreted as AMAB (which, as a GNC transmasc, was only in the most recent years when my beard finally came in), the determining factor in how others treated me was my AGAB. this went across all kinds of situations, all kinds of people, whether i was seen as a cis woman or a trans man or nonbinary (but AFAB). the same was true for my other transmasc friends. so my working assumption about society was ""society treats people according to their AGAB."", and i never ran into anything in my experiences that prompted me to question that. 

but this was before i'd heard much from transfeminine people's perspectives; i didn't happen to have any in my very small social circle, and i hadn't gone out of my way to read about others' experiences. but what i have heard is that in a lot of situations, it was very common for transfemme people (whilst being known/assumed to be AMAB) to experience the same treatment that was shared by the cis women and transmasc people i'd spoken more with. 

""society genders trans people in the way that justifies harming them most in the current situation"" — under patriarchal norms, in most situations, women are treated worse than men. so for transmasc people, between ""woman"" being the default worse treatment AND that being the option that misgenders us*, the way of gendering us that justifies most harm is almost always going to line up with out AGAB. with transfemme people however, transphobes are presented with a dilemma: ""woman"" usually justifies worse treatment, BUT it runs the risk of being affirming*; ""man"" is the most misgendery option, BUT it often would mean treating someone better... so, with transfemme people, the way their gendered varies more with the situation, and doesn't always line up with their AGAB

(* obviously ""transmasc"" and ""transfemme"" are very broad terms, and include individuals for whom either binary gender might be equally dysphoric to have applied to them, so ""woman"" isn't always the most misgendery option for every transmasc person... but transphobes in general are operating on the assumption of ""AFAB + not cis = girl who wants to be a boy"", so ""woman"" is generally the one they pick if they're trying to misgender us (and so on for transfemme people, if you flip the binary gender terms)) 

but also, even for those whose experiences DO align in the expected way with their AGAB, different individuals are going to have different ways of dealing with that; for some people, communicating those experiences is what feels right, or is what they need to cope with those experiences; for others, they might be in a place where they can forget those experiences, and don't want them dug up by other people

sorry, this got a lot longer than i meant and may have strayed a bit from the point, but what i'm trying to say is: the experiences you're talking about, and their relationship to your AGAB, are real and deserve to be talked about. but at the same time, these experiences won't be the same for every other AFAB person (and there may be a lot of AMAB people who share these experiences). if you feel your AGAB is relevant to your experiences, it is — but that's for each individual person to tell us for themselves. AGAB shouldn't be the lens we interpret a person through, or a shortcut to a set of assumptions to make *unless* that person decides that is a useful tool in understanding them.

TLDR: AGAB labels (like any labels) are fine to use for yourself, but a) they need to be opt-in and not put on others (or something you expect others to announce), and b) be wary of the ambiguity of these terms, and the ways they might not convey the information you're trying to convey (and the way they might lead you to make inaccurate assumptions about others)

that, i believe, is what people mean to say by ""AGAB doesn't matter""
Its not that AGAB doesn't matter it's just that it doesn't justify people disrespecting you. As a group we don't want to be defined simply by our AGAB regardless of what other people say.
This right here! If you're nonbinary, you're nonbinary. Your AGAB does not, in any circumstance, make you any less nonbinary (at least within the community).
This is really well said. To add on, I feel that people will often making sweeping generalizations based on AFAB/AMAB status—even nonbinary people themselves—and they’re all too often often woefully reductive and ultimately transphobic.

Yes, there are absolutely times when having these terms is useful and important. But if we’re bringing them out to talk about every frivolous thing, then it’s just like you said about recreating the binary.
> I think you're somewhat misinterpreting the tone of those posts

Maybe. Some former friends of mine told me that if I thought I had experienced misogyny then I wasn’t actually trans, and I’ve seen sentiment like that other places so I’m kind of paranoid. 

That being said,  even if I talk strictly about my own experiences I’ll often get downvoted just for mentioning any impact, while people vehement disagreeing are pushed to the top (even on this thread). Obviously people have a right to their opinion but I that’s why I made a post specifically seeing if there were others who could relate.
>That's kinda the discussions I'm seeing lately that's why they want to be distanced from agab.

I think there's a huge difference between ""*I* want to be distanced from agab"" vs. saying ""by mentioning it, it feels like erasing the non-binary gender identity and turning it into: male lite and female lite."" 

One is a statement that applies to only one person. The other is microaggressive *at best* under an umbrella that includes some GNC *cis* people (according to our nonbinary cultural ancestors). 

I hope you understand. 

> (which sucks massively bc when ur enby you don't fit the binary or the two categories)

In my experience, a trinary model is just a binary model ""with extra steps."" I don't fit into two categories, I don't fit into three categories either. Adding more categories to a bad model isn't going to fix it.
I mean, usually when someone is saying ""for context I'm ___"" it's because it's actually relevant to the story.
> It just gets on people's nerves or even gets them dysphoric when having to see all the time ""for context I'm afab enby"" then as you continue to read you realize they really didn't have to mention that at all :/ it happens SO much.

Shouldn’t people be able to decide for themselves if it’s relevant context? The problem for me is it shapes basically every in person interaction I have as well my history in the LGBT community, choice in clothes, dating life, body etc - it just feels inescapable in many areas. This is the top comment though so I understand I’m in the minority in feeling this way
Word.
AGAB _might_ be relevant while talking socialization but many people on here quickly assume what everyone else’s socialization entails by AGAB without realizing there’s other influences. This leads to erasure by implying some stuff to be physically and culturally and socioeconomically (etc.) universal. An assumed “default” experience.
I prefer to give trans people the benefit of the doubt that we're talking about being mistreated because of assumed gender when we reference CAGAB. 

But a part of what disturbs me is that this sub keeps having similar discussions about transfemme/masc, nonbinary man/woman, and nonbinary people who use mixed pronouns. And I perceive that as essentialist and gatekeepy in a different way.

EDIT: And my experience with being queer and trans is that unless I'm very clear in telling my *own* story, other people assign a gender and sexuality story to me anyway. That includes LGBTQIA+ spaces. IMO the only way to challenge those biases is to be explicit about who we are.
This reminds me soo much of 1990s anti-label arguments that terms like gay, lesbian, and bi are uncomfortable, essentialist, and universalizing. And instead of explicitly labeling the forms of prejudice we experience, we should dance around the issue like a pop song (read early Melissa Etheridge or Pet Shop Boys) and trust that the astute reader should be able to pick up what we mean from pronoun games and context.

My experience is that when I'm not explicit, people jump to the wrong conclusions based on cultural defaults and stereotypes. If I play the pronoun game with my relationships, the go-to interpretations are mostly straight with a handful of cases where someone assumed I'm gay. And the result is that I'm still erased from view. 

That's a reasonable defense strategy, but not when I need visibility to talk about the specific issues I'm experiencing. I'll just post a clip from the Meatpunks Manifesto here:

> 2. SUBTLETY IS FOR FUCKERS   
> if you’re going to say something then say it loud and say it clear. there are times for clever metaphors and there are times when you gotta punch a fash’s lights out and we live in the second time

There's a direct connection between the transmisogyny I experience in day-to-day life and the legislative attempts to restrict trans cultural expression, education, and gender-affirming health care. My partner and I are looking at huge life changes in the next year in response. There's a thousand things with that situation where CAGAB makes a difference. So yes, it matters.
I imagine that post inspired this.
and i want to clarify, when i say ""whether someone's AGAB is relevant to them is for them to tell us"", i don't mean that it's necessarily within their control — obviously we don't control our experiences, and they can affect us in ways we don't have a choice in. the fact that the experiences you had in relation to your AGAB aren't universal to EVERYONE of your AGAB doesn't make them any more ""yours""; i can see how some of the things i've said or that other say about this could come across that way, and i want to make it clear that it's not like that

the specifics of a person's experiences aren't universal, but i think the reality of arbitrary environmental factors shaping our lives in ways outside of our control (in whatever shape that may take) is universal
That thing you call ""frivolous"" may be a big deal to the next trans person who spent months or years finding the self-love to express themselves authentically.
> Some former friends of mine told me that if I thought I had experienced misogyny then I wasn’t actually trans

That's just nonsense! People are discriminated against based on what other people assume about them, not on what they are. Those things often come hand in hand, but they don't have to. This is especially true, when it comes to trans people, because a lot of transphobia is rooted in making wrong assumptions about someone's gender.
I’m sorry to hear about your friends, though they don’t sound friendly. This sounds like a misunderstanding of how systemic violence works.

_Cis men_ can experience misogyny if they’re mistaken for a woman. White people can experience racism if mistaken for a race (ex. happens to white people who wear a hijab). The point of misogyny is it’s about hatred of women, femininity, or perceived womanhood. Transphobia happens to GNC **cis** people and that doesn’t make them less cis. 

This is why the LGBT+ community is together in part. We are all mistaken for each other, often. Consequently we experience a range of bullshit.

It’s _about_ the target (and even if you don’t identify as the target the oppressive system and oppressive people will judge and sort us the way society thinks we SHOULD be), but pretty much anybody who is tangential will also be sideswiped. That sideswiping can be just as shitty (and invalidating!) and horrendous and mentally _traumatizing_.
Welcome to the world of transmisandry and gender essentialism. Unfortunately, people can in fact be trans and transphobic and that’s exactly what transmisandry is: A unique form of transphobia used to erase the struggles and sometimes even the history of the transmasculine community. 

Really, though, its just assholes projecting their unresolved trauma onto the transmasc community rather than going to therapy.
Well what that former friend said is nonsense. You absolutely can experience misogyny even if you are jot a woman, just as you can experience homophobia even if you are jot gay. The bigotry lives in the mind of the bigot, not in the reality of their target.
We have totally different interpretations because I find usually it has no relevance to the story at all.
The problem with talking about your AGAB as a shorthand for your presentation and identity is that it’s imprecise. An AFAB nonbinary person can be transmasc with a masc presentation, femme-aligned with a femme presentation, someone with a similar experience to yours, or any combination of presentation and identity. So saying you’re AFAB by itself doesn’t actually communicate what you want it to communicate. This is different from saying that you were assigned female at birth then going on to expand to say what you’ve said: “The problem for me is it shapes basically every in person interaction I have as well my history in the LGBT community, choice in clothes, dating life, body etc.” In this case, mentioning your AGAB does add context, because you’re talking about how people treat you based on your assigned gender.
I second what u/na-deem said here and wanted to add that assuming that other people with the same AGAB will necessarily have meaningfully similar experiences and that people of another AGAB won’t can feel like erasure. It’s almost always better to be specific. For example, if you’re sick of how people perceive you as a woman or girl, or treat you as less-than because of it, that’s an experience that nonbinary AMAB people may share if they present in a way that people see as feminine or as looking like a woman. So when you assume those people won’t connect to your experience, you’re excluding them in ways that probably mirror how they have been excluded by people in real life in the past.
haha yes....I imagine so as well...
I’m confused about what you mean by this, so maybe I should clarify. There’s no particular thing I’m calling frivolous; rather, what I mean is that the use of AGAB where it isn’t relevant is frivolous. I recognize that I didn’t say so literally, and so reading it another way is totally understandable. If a trans person feels that their AGAB is relevant and important to their relationship to something—anything—then using the term wouldn’t be frivolous.

EDIT for clarity!
Exactly, exactly. I think OP was also talking about socialization stuff which is hairy, but beyond that I also just generally agree people treat labels like pokémon types a little and think the world responds to said labels as such. It genuinely depends.

This is how [cis people also end up getting affected by transphobia](https://www.advocate.com/news/2022/11/01/cis-woman-mistaken-transgender-records-being-berated-bathroom)— the world goes by first glance not necessarily the contents of your pants. These things **can** overlap, but don’t inherently.

And— before anyone says— no I’m not saying cis people should be centered here. I’m just saying I think a lot of people run on an incomplete picture of how intersectionality functions on the day to day experience front.
The only times I've seen it used are when it's important for us to know how the person is being perceived or what their transition means. Other than that I don't see it.
And in the end, it's up to the poster to state that info or not, about themselves. Some people don't mind their Agab being known.
Same
Unless we toot our own horn in lgbtqia spaces, people who are transfeminine, genderqueer, or over-40 are routinely erased and marginalized. Other people make similar criticisms about how mainstream nonbinary spaces tend to be very white, western, college-educated, and allosexual. 

So it's honestly a catch-22. While I appreciate the advice to be explicitly clear that we're talking from our own perspective, demands that we not mention AGAB at all unless it's ""relevant"" are not particularly helpful.
>There’s no particular thing I’m calling frivolous; rather, what I mean is that the use of AGAB where it isn’t relevant is frivolous.

I think we should put faith in people describing their AGAB that it's relevant, and therefore not frivolous. 

Because even the little bits of gender dysphoria and euphoria matter.
I do often see it used when it's important to know how the person is being perceived but it would actually have been way more helpful is they had just said how they're being perceived. There are afab enbies who are usually perceived as men and amab enbies who are usually perceived as women.

Other times it would be more helpful if people said ""I was socialized as a \[gender\]"". It's true that you're often socialized as your agab, but there are some cases when that's not true. All I want is for people to actually consider what's relevant for the specific context.
I would say that pointing out your personal circumstances to avoid erasure is not what people are critiquing at all.
I think we’re talking about two different things here.

Trans people have every right to talk about their own experiences however the fuck we want to. *However,* we do not have the right to generalize our experiences and attempt to superimpose them onto everyone else’s.

For example, saying “being AFAB and socialized as a woman really impacted my ability to stand up for myself” is real and reasonable. Saying “being socialized as women impacts all AFAB people’s ability to stand up for themselves” may point to a real societal trend, but it’s a reductive way to talk about the issue because it fails to be specific about who that trend affects. It lumps people into that group who may not feel that statement applies to them, and (often implicitly but *intentionally*) excludes others who absolutely belong in that conversation—thus constructing another simplistic binary that does not serve us in our path to deconstructing gendered oppression.

I hope that makes sense!
\*You\* have not said this. But you're not the only person in this conversation and we've had four threads in the last day describing using AGAB language as unnecessary, generalizing, universalizing, and essentialist outside of medical contexts. 

When someone steps forward and says, ""I'm not comfortable with the implications of this act"" maybe y'all should hold back on the ""nobody is doing this.""
> Trans people have every right to talk about their own experiences however the fuck we want to. *However,* we do not have the right to generalize our experiences and attempt to superimpose them onto everyone else’s.

I agree, and I think that's *exactly* at stake here. If we're not open and honest about *our own* experiences, community biases and stereotypes will be superimposed on us regardless.

But I don't see how this relates to frivolity, relevance, or important. Is ""skirt goes swishy"" frivolous? Probably. Is it relevant to people who wear skirts regardless of CAGAB? Yes. Is it an important part of my own gender history of internalized transmisogyny and hypervigilance? Yes.

If it's not important or relevant to you, or you think it's frivolous, I'll happily give you your money back and put it back on the shelf for someone else to appreciate.
From what I was reading, and this can be wrong, the people you are responding to in this thread are not doing this.
Why is it at stake? I’m very expressly supporting that we be open about our own experiences and condemning the use of inept generalizations that turn into biases and stereotypes.

I already explained what I meant by “every frivolous thing,” but again: I am not calling any specific thing frivolous, but instead am referring to the over-reliance on generalizations based on AGAB. “Relevance” and “import” are, again, concerns only in the context of generalizations. I wouldn’t presume to make judgments about what is relevant or important to an individual.

At this point your disagreement feels a little disingenuous, but I am trying to understand your perspective and respond in good faith because I think I’m fully in agreement with you at the end of the day. I’d appreciate (but do not require) for you to show me the same grace.
From what I'm reading, and this can be wrong, the people you are responding to in these threads are not generalizing.
I think ultimately we agree. My frustration is that it feels like every day under this sub, we have a post that starts with something like ""I'm sick of people narrowing down non-binary people to their agab,"" (reasonable) then going right into ""the whole point of being non-binary is to go outside of the binary, no?"" (less reasonable, and incorrect), right through to ""I just don't see why agab should be relevant much, by mentioning it, it feels like erasing the non-binary gender identity and turning it into: male lite and female lite.""  (Holy poop in the punchbowl, Batman!)

The details change from post to post, and ""nonbinary man/woman,"" ""gay/lesbian,"" and mixed pronouns are frequent subjects of censure. But the overall trend seems to be nonbinary people calling out other nonbinary people for not being nonbinary enough.

This struck a nerve on a number of levels. Nonbinary is not a single gender identity, it's big tent that includes people with multiple gender identities and complex gender histories. On a personal level, I prefer ""genderqueer"" because that term acknowledges both my history as a queer man and my future as a queer not-a-man-TBD. So this kind of rhetoric feels like directly erasing me (or erasing myself), from a big tent that was *originally created for people like me.* 

So, honestly, the post I quoted was egregiously bad and gatekeepy, and I'm shocked at the defense of it. In the future, I'll just roll my eyes and move on. I encourage people who don't like me talking about assumed-gender history to do the same.
The first thread I brought it up in was to add to the conversation, not to correct people. Then two separate people misinterpreted my post and I responded to them. Those are the only posts I can see you referring to, and you’re right. I was agreeing with them or they were reading my pitch wrong and I was explaining myself.
Your entire conversation here (and under the other post) has involved aggressively lecturing people who don't generalize (and in my case, are actively anti-essentialist) about the evils of generalizing language.
Not really. I can see reading my tone that way, but if long paragraphs are aggressive I’ve never been told."	1237xbk	NonBinary	309	0.9	2023-03-27 02:12:24
Oh no, I made myself sad...		"we're unlearning bad habits too. 29 years of calling myself one thing made some pretty ingrained language. don't worry, that doesn't make our truth less valid 🥰

When I was first accepting my identity (and realising I was 'trans enough' to demand gender neutral pronouns and surgeries) I used to misgender myself in my head when I was mad at myself.

Its sad that i'm getting this many downvotes for saying this		"Had a guy respond to my comment with ""People who don't agree with me are bigots!!!""  
So I just responded with ""Well, If the thing they don't agree with is people's very existence, then yes... they are bigots...""
It's so easy to assume hate, I don't think it's blatant hate. It's blatant ignorance. The concept of gender outside of the binary is completely foreign to many people, especially older people because they've simply never been exposed to the concept. You can't expect people to understand something they've never been taught about. They disagree because they don't understand.

My dad, for example, is a boomer and was taught that there are two genders and that being gay is dirty and a sin. Then he had a queer kid and had to take the time to unlearn the crap he was taught growing up. He was never hateful to me, but he was often confused and straight up didn't understand. It took him time, but now he is a killer ally and actually corrects and educates his boomer pals who were never taught better when they say ignorant stuff.

Of course we don't owe anybody education, but I think encouraging someone to go educate themselves would be so much more useful, even if they are being hateful. Google is free and there is all kinds of info out there.  Going off on people for not understanding something is just going to make them more adverse to it. If it's pure ignorance and they're decent people, they can go educate themselves and stop being ignorant. Worst case, they really are hateful and then you can tell at them.
people like to use ""facts don't care about your feelings"" as a gotcha moment. But as these past years have proven, the inverted phrase ""feelings don't care about facts"" is just as true, and should be more relevant
This made so much more sense to me when I read it’s in a sub for teenagers. Downvoting has a major group-think, bullying mentality to it sometimes. Everyone just piling on.
What sub is this?!
I disagree that it needs to be fueled by hate. More likely it is fueled by ignorance.
Oh my god what kind of sub were you on that’s terrible
dont take it personally really. people on the internet are just searching for people they can denounce. like 90% of my comments on worldnews get downvoted because my opinion is rather.. radical. no reason to feel bad because ignorant people disagree with you.
Where’s this criminally downvoted comment? Asking for a friend…
Yeah my mom keeps telling me that even if someone doesn't agree with LGBT stuff we can still be friends, but you can't have a friend who doesn't validate your identity, it's just not a thing that can happen? How can you have a friend who you can't even talk to about shit?? If you can't confide in someone about something as basic as who you're seeing or who you like, they're an acquaintance at best. Definitely agree that you can't disagree without being hateful, because most often it's just an excuse to be homophobic that really doesn't land right.
Finally I have a good reason to hate teenagers.

I left another comment on this post mentioning how I also mentioned ignorance a lot but it was my mistake I left it out of this particular comment
My best friend, a 20 year old woman, is the most loving and accepting person i’ve ever met and still had trouble understanding when i came out as NB! ofc she said she’d always love me no matter what but confessed she totally didn’t understand why i wouldn’t want to be a woman

it’s so hard to understand if you’re not living it but it’s not nearly as hard to just be loving and accepting of others
Ignorance breeds hatred, as the saying goes. Anyway these aren’t new concepts, and even “ignorant” people have heard them. Right now what you run into most often is people who know and understand the theory, but “don’t agree” and lash out to maintain their world-view. In other words, they’ll do anything to preserve their “ignorance” so they can feel innocent. I don’t think it’s as simple as “either they’re ignorant or they’re hate-filled”... an awful lot of people use one as cover for the other.
The thing is 'not understanding' doesn't equate to 'disagreeing' or outright resistance. There are many things I don't understand that I am not hostile to. If someone has encouraged you to learn and there is easily accessible information and you continue to use disagreement as an excuse, or even willful ignorance, that is a form of hostility. I understand wanting to give people a chance but nonbinary people are absolutely allowed to be angry or hurt when people say and do hurtful things even out of ignorance, because the harm was caused regardless of how it was caused. And often times ignorance and hostility are not as neatly separated as often thought. 

Ignorance doesn't always equate to innocence, as you yourself have acknowledged. In my experience at least, I have very *very* rarely come across people who are just ignorant but genuinely well meaning. I constantly meet people who use ignorance as an excuse to remain doggedly hostile or resistant, and who expect to be dragged or carried into thinking differently, especially on the internet. Ignorance *can* be willful and hostile. If someone's first and consistent response to new ideas that pertain to people's actual *wellbeing* is to consistently resist learning and consistently be hostile, then they're being shitty, ignorance or not. The option to say 'I don't understand, so I'm going to try and learn without attacking' is absolutely always there. If people refuse to take it, nonbinary people are allowed to be mad at that. Lack of understanding doesn't *have* to lead to hostility and that has been used as an excuse to justify harm towards marginalized people for decades. I want to be more optimistic but my experience absolutely has not taught me that. There is usually some level of hostility and bias in ignorance.
Plus by facts they mean outdated science from like 10-15 years ago
This is exactly why I hate downvoting. It's original purpose was to filter out posts that didn't contribute to a discussion.

Now it's often just used to silence those who don't agree with the majority.

You can tell this is the case because often times you'll see a really well written comment that goes against the grain with a ton of downvotes and absolutely no responses.
It was a pride post on teenagers. Most of the comments were supportive but all the people who saw mine were really toxic. Guess i was just unlucky
I did mention that ignorance could also be the cause but i forgot to put it in this comment but i do mention it several times
It was on a pride post on r/teenagers
Its hard to be friends with someone who will never fully accept you
Thank you!
That's good. The assumption of hate most likely is the reason for your downvotes though. 

It's so easy to want to scream at ignorant people (just in general, not saying you did). I'm really looking forward to doing my part to raise the next generation so the shit that was taught to my parents isn't passed on.
I'm glad you have such a supportive friend!!
Of course they're not new concepts. That doesn't necessarily mean people have been exposed to them or understand them. Kids still used ""that's so gay"" when I was in elementary school because we hadn't learned better yet. 

Of course ignorance breeds hatred, but we who aren't ignorant have the power to stop that hatred. Educating someone rather than going off on them for possibly never having learned better is going to have a more productive impact at least some of the time. 

I'm not saying there aren't bigots in the world who have no intention of changing, but that's not the case for all of them. When a puppy poops on the floor, you don't go off on it (I hope), you teach it to tell you it needs to go out into the yard. It's really the same thing. Some puppies are harder to train than others.

LP- Lost on you. I don't know if they identify as nonbinary, but they're sure as hell androgynous and super cute too.
Not until the third season, but The Dragon Prince has a canon Non-Binary character, amongst a bunch of other good rep.
The first season and a half of my urban horror podcast [Midtown Mythos](https://midtownmythos.podbean.com/) features an explicitly nonbinary hero named Alex Oberlin. Most of season 1 also features a nonbinary half-angel named Rain and then late season 1 and early season 2 feature *another* nonbinary character named Sam Marlowe.

Doesn't hurt that both myself and my cohost (and the former *third* cohost) are all enby c:
If you're into cartoons : Steven Universe includes a non-binary character AND is written by Rebecca Sugar who also came out as non-binary.  
I also love the show One Day at a Time, where a non-binary character appears in season 2 (and is still on the show so far) : the way they appears is kinda akward but they is gendered correctly (in the original version at least) and there is an adorable relationship between them and one of the main character <3  


(And now I'm gonna read all the comment section in search of other representations because I'm also trying to feel valid)
Watch Asia Kate Dillion in Billions!
Transparent on Amazon (or piratebay...)
JayR Tinaco, non binary actor, plays non binary character in 'Another life' (netflix)
Their music makes me want to go to a festival in a flowery skirt with long hair, and I love it
depending on what a good representation means to you one day at a times alright

Rae Spoon is a nonbinary musician that has some fun music 😊
Dorian Electra. Absolutely Killer Gender fluid artist.
StyleLikeU's podcast have some guests who are non-binary. Love all of their content and would highly recommend!

If you're interested in podcasts check out The Penumbra Podcast, The Domestic Life of Anthony Todd, TAZ Amnesty, and Sector 0. The Strange Case of Starship Iris is also excellent, but the primary nb rep is an alien who doesn't identify with the human concepts of gender, which I know is something not everyone enjoys. 


The Magnus Archives only has very occasional nb rep, but at least 3 of the VAs are nonbinary.


The Underwood Collection also has nb rep iirc, and is a fan based spin-off of Magnus. I couldn't get into it, but it gets good reviews.


Likewise, Less is Morgue wasn't my jam but it does have nb rep and the creators are lovely people.
tiktoks by nonbinary creators can be super validating !! scrolling through their pages, even if they post content that isn't related to being enby, is really neat nonetheless. [https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nonbinary](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nonbinary)
If you like podcasts, in the junoverse on the Penumbra Podcast, the main character Juno Steel non binary! It’s amazing
Aria Rita is a non-binary Brazilian musician. She studies and plays medieval music. Listen on Spotify.
Have you read ""I Wish You All the Best""? It's a book about a nonbinary kid's coming out and getting used to things. It's pretty good
Thank you, this looks really good
YES I LOVE THAT SHOW, every charector is just amazing
If you like dnd live play stuff, transplanar stars a mostly nonbinary cast! You can watch it on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/2JGi5-F4uxA)
I’m exposing myself here but there’s a chinese web novel called “heaven official’s blessing” with a side character who switches genders every scene bc they’re an amab wind god who is often worshipped as a woman
Just found out that Pokémon team Mystic’s leader is non-binary. :)
I love Powderpaint's new EP, both the musicians are non binary I think. 

I just watched Work in Progress which stars Theo Germaine a non binary actor (the character is a trans man though). Theo Germaine is also in the Politican but their character doesnt have as big a role.

I also loved Felix Ever After by Kacen Calender which has a non binary protagonist.
I used to watch a YouTuber named Riley J. Dennis, she's a nonbinary trans woman and I think these days she mostly does couple vlogs and sometimes TV/movie reviews? I don't watch much YouTube these days but I always found her older stuff very funny and she had an amazing positive outlook so I hope you can find some good stuff on her channel :)
Jes Tom is a NB comedian and they are so funny! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfThT4Glq7Q&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfThT4Glq7Q&feature=emb_title) found them via Autostraddle.
I'm not non-binary, but I liked Steven Universe for the way it portrayed gender?
Jacob Tobia!! They have an incredible book called “Sissy” I highly recommend
I would say Dorian electrica, bc I love them.
Sam Smith (classic)

I want to say video games 
Bloodhound from Apex legends.
And Xaku from Warframe.  (Xaku comes out soon)
Lachlan Watson is a non-binary actor who plays a trans man going through transition in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - their own personal experiences shaped the character and got the writers to extend the journey from a few episodes long to 2 series
Outside Sabrina, Lach is simply amazing on their insta etc
Not sure if you're into anime, but if so, check out Stars Align. There's a canonically nonbinary character (Yuu Asuka — they're so wonderful!) and deals with some pretty deep stuff; not just about being lgbt+, but in general as well.

For video games, Bloodhound from Apex Legends is also canonically nonbinary and they are absolutely badass. Plus, their voice actress, Allegra Clark, is the sweetest ally you could ever come across.
She-Ra (Netflix) has an nb character and also just tons of lgbtq representation overall
Perfume Genius is the best! I really love him! 

He is pretty androgynous and his videos are super creative and artistic. 

He's got a softness and is shy, but he still can be strong and empowered!
ahh okay cool your bracelets totally gave me a klaus vibe so I had to share!!
This show looks like it’s gonna make me cry so damn much, I can’t wait
Yes I love Steven universe and she ra. Todxs nosotrxs is new tho, I’m definitly going to watch it
Steven Universe is amazing. Stevonnie and Rainbow 2.0 are my favourite characters!
All of the gems (SU) are they/she too annnnd the show was made by a Nonbinary Woman :   )
I just binge watched the whole thing and lemme just say THANK YOU, also Vito is WAY too attractive
“Vico Ortiz is cute af” -whit__, also thank you so much I’m gonna check that out now
I just started to watch it, I'm already in love with this show and I didn't even finished the first episode yet !  
Thank you so much for sharing it here !
🥺aw thank you, also that is the best username of all damn time
Freckle is amazing!!
I will be binge watching both of these ty
In Zoey’s Playlist, I think they use the term genderfluid for Alex Newell’s character, and I recommend that show for the representation AND just in general. There is an episode that focuses on Mo’s gender identity and it made me cry so hard
I **love** Ally, they're so wonderful and funny!! 

I'd totally recommend their podcast Tales from the Closet as well! There are some... questionable guests but for the most part they're really wonderful!
Love Ally Beardsley, they play a non-binary character on the fantastic and largely queer one-shot Cinderbrush on the Critical Role YouTube channel!
add [https://inlovewithaghost.bandcamp.com/](https://inlovewithaghost.bandcamp.com/) to that list!
This is all really interesting music, way different than what I’m used to, it’s all spooky like and I kinda like it
[http://theydevil.bandcamp.com/](http://theydevil.bandcamp.com/)
Omg, I’m sorry I just didn’t realize that there was non-binary people succeeding in life like this and this makes me really happy, they’ve got hella good songs
I don't believe Janelle Monae is Nonbinary? I know there was the whole tweet thing, but I read an article from The Cut where they talked to Janelle and apparently that tweet was just supposed to be support for the community. There was no explicit confirmation or denial about being nonbinary. Janelle very well may be, but until there's an explicit say so I don't know if *I'd* say so.
I will be checking out them. but I LOVE KLAUS, favorite charector of all time, I binged season two the second it came out. also thanks for the compliment that really made me smile
OMG Klaus is NB?? I JUST finished season two. Love Klaus. That makes me so happy.
Yesssss dude I’d die for klaus
Yes I love Dorian electra
Ooo, that was a really pretty person and a really pretty song, thank you for blessing me with it
Oh, Midtown Mythos has been on my to-listen list for a while. Might have to bump it to the top of the list!
This sounds really cool, I’m going to lieten to it for sure, That’s so cool that y’all are all non-binary, now I’m supper excited to watch it
Yessss I love Steven universe and Rebecca sugar, and one day at a time is one of the best shows of all time. Sid is an absolute diety. And also you are valid 😁😁😁
Ooo, their pretty, and I definitely will be
Heavily second this, I had been putting off watching the last two seasons for a while (not realising there was an NB storyline) and when I finally got around to it it coincided with a lot of realisations and made me feel valid
One day at a time is GODDDD
Oml thanks for the heads up, and I really liked fever ray and izuna drop
Ooooo, I really like their sound
Yesssss
Too cute for two genders is an amazing name and I’m so fricken excited to listen to it
This is so many suggestions thank you
I scrolled for a good while 10/10 when I’m sad I definitely will scroll again
@nonbinarycowboy and @adesso.laurenzo are my fav nb tiktokers, they’re both hilarious asf
Ooo, I have been looking for podcasts
No, that sounds really cool, that’s honestly something I could really use right now, thank you
Ooo, yes múltiple non-binarysssss
I might look into that, that would be very new and different
TEAM MYSTIC ALL THE WAY
Ty, Ima look into them, hopefully that positivity will rub off on me
I watched some of their stuff and they’re really funny, thanks for recomending
Me too, Steven really said screw you to gender norms
I just looked up their insta, and they are now my new personal icon
I’m not huge into anime but it sounds like it’s definitely worth a check
Yesss
Sounds like I’m gonna love it, soft shy boi sounds just like me, or who I wanna be atleast
that makes me so happy to hear
Rainbow 2.0 is my king
All hail Rebecca Sugar!!
Thank youuuuuuuu :)
The non-binary episode was particularly helpful for me when I was coming to terms with my situation.

I actually worked at CollegeHumor and tried to get on the podcast, but by the time I worked up the nerve to ask, they'd stopped producing them.
These songs are really cute
Yeah! Scary enby music is the best.
No need to be sorry! I only found them recently myself. :) But yeah, to see them doing so well and being out and confident is so awesome.
A lot of songs on dirty computer were about being a woman. I don't know if that means she's not nb, but it doesn't really support that idea either.
Ahhh got it. Thanks fr the info
Yep! here’s a [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.refinery29.com/amp/en-us/2019/02/225048/umbrella-academy-klaus-robert-sheehan-ex-girlfriend-dating-sexuality) to an interview from s1 where Robert Sheehan talks about it :) (I think he’s also referred to Klaus with they/them pronouns during a s2 promo but I don’t have the receipts for that)
Die for klaus and then spend the rest of my life as a ghost with klaus
I'm glad you enjoyed!!
You may never know just how exciting this was for me to read. :D
there’s an episode in the baby-sitters club also that has a mtf kid in it and i think that one is alright
It is! And Janaya Khan is super cool
Ive been finding the BBC podcast NB interesting

Also not exactly non-binary, but I always have to recommend the first campaign of The Adventure Zone.  It’s a comedy D&D real play podcast that has apparently earned a following for their portrayal of LGBT characters.  [article](https://www.thevermilion.com/opinion/the-adventure-zone-by-the-mcelroy-brothers-is-the-ally-you-need/article_abaa63d2-28f6-11e9-9b24-939fb1ebab80.html)
I'm not surprised, I'm kinda in love. If you haven't yet, look through their saved videos too.
This is big smile time    :))))))))))
She could still be nonbinary, since you can be nonbinary and still partially identify with being a woman (e.g. demigirls) or she could have written Dirty Computer before she discovered she was, but like you said, it doesn't really support the idea of her being an enby, and you kind of have to start with the assumption that she is nonbinary for those points to have full sway. I'd say her writing about being a woman isn't an entire dismissal of the possibility. It could be true, it could not be true. 

I generally go by the principle that unless the person themselves has explicitly said they are X (or said something to indicate they are X - that they haven't then gone back and reinterpreted or corrected or changed) then we shouldn't presume they are X. They very well might be X, but I just don't think it's entirely respectful to knowingly explicitly say they're something before *they* do. With Janelle Monae, I bet a lot more people heard about the tweet (and interpreted it in the most intuitive way - to believe that it *was* Janelle coming out) then about the article (where she explicitly says the intention of the tweet was something else entirely). So I'm definitely not shaming people who say she is nonbinary lol, they probably just don't know about the article where she corrected assumptions, but yeah I'd caution against it (unless there's some huge bit of info I'm missing). 

Here's what I got from wikipedia in reference tl the article:

*Monáe stated in an interview with The Cut a month after the tweet, that it was made ""in support of Non-binary Day and to bring more awareness to the community.""*
Aw nice, thank you! Also I hadn't seen that red carpet outfit they link to before and it is extremely my shit.
Apparently they are going to start broadcasting the NB podcast on BBC radio 1 this Mon at 3:30! The general public shall be exposed to our wonderful world 😅
I don't disagree with anything you said. I just wanted to compliment you on a very well written response.
ah yes Rob has some truly iconic looks!! his fashion sense is chaotic af but the way he plays with traditionally “gendered” clothes is so refreshing, I need more cishet guys to get with the program
Interesting, I guess I assumed BBC was like NPR and their podcasts were more or less archived radio broadcasts. It didn’t occur to me it hadn’t been broadcast yet.
I know you don't disagree! I was just expounding/resonating with what you said and adding to it. Hope it didn't come across that way!

I also wanted to clarify what I mean to OP. I probably should have replied directly lol
No, you're fine. I just wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page. The internet is so aggressive it's nice to see people have a normal conversation.
You're very right lol. People start arguments over everything and anything and things spiral so quickly sometimes out of pure misunderstanding. I'm glad we're on the same page."	i554qb	NonBinary	282	0.99	2020-08-07 01:58:37
having a rough time and feeling super sad. could use some positive nb love (he/they)		"I love your hair and your look, I’m sorry you’re sad my friend. I hope you don’t mind but I looked at your account a bit and I’d like to say that the piece of art you had was very well done. I hope your day improves. You’re loved here.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you have a very anime look going on.

I love it!
Sorry to hear you are feeling sad.  Hope things get better for you real soon.
You look absolutely phenomenal I really love your aesthetic!
Sending positive vibes your way <3
Holy shit, you're eyes look like amber! So cool!
dude, I can't really tell what color you eyes are but they're really neat looking, nice hair btw!
I love your look! Reminds me of the scene kid I always wanted to be when I was in high school!
I love the way your hair goes with your makeup and nose ring, you have a very nice aesthetic
your nose ring looks badass
I am here for this entire aesthetic. You are lovely and loved.
Hey there! I love your hair & septum piercing!! You look very androgynous and I hope you feel better soon, my thude!
i love your hair!  i hope you feel better
Hello! Saying hi to a fabulous enby~
You look amazing! ♥️ I'm sorry you feel this way, and I hope you day if filled with only happiness and joy. I wish you all the best my friend, and if you ever need to talk, we are all here for you :)
Sending you good vibes, I hope you can feel better soon. Also your hair is awesome, do you know the name of the cut or how it might be described? I might want to get something similar.
[removed]
thanks so much <3 this made me smile. i appreciate that you liked my art!!
that’s actually one of the best compliments i’ve ever gotten!! ; w ; thank you so much!! this haircut was very inspired by sasuke and noctis from final fantasy
thank you so much!! 🤍
thank you!!! my eyes are brown c:
thank you so much!!  c: i appreciate you !!
thanks so much!!! :D i call it “casual gay mall goth and is very tired” LOL
aaaaah thanks so much!!! ; u ; i am feeling a lot better, day got significantly better due to some IRL stuff.
thanks so much! i’m feelin a lot better now !! also you have great music taste ! :>
i had a (now not) friend who was a cosmetologist do it at the time! i just asked for straight bangs, leave longer side pieces to frame the face, then cut the back shorter so i could fluff up with gel if i wanted to (but i’m growing it out now so it’s a tad longer than that in this pic!)
I wasn’t begging for compliments, I just wanted to ask for some support from my community. You’re right. You don’t know me or how I feel rn. I don’t feel like I need validation to feel good. I feel good about myself. So if you don’t like it, you could have just ignored or hidden my post. But no, instead you decided to be an asshole and make a remark assuming you know who I am or why I made this post. I’m allowed to have bad days. I’m allowed to need support even if it’s just “like your hair!” or an upvote.
Of course
Most welcome :) I feel you on the tiredness!
That's great to hear, I'm glad ♥️
Haha thanks! (≧▽≦)
Ugh I'm so sorry you got a response like this.  Asking for a little help to cheer up is perfectly fine, it happens a lot on this sub.

Anyway, I think you look amazing and I really like your hair color and and how you style it, it looks great!  I hope tomorrow is better for you! 🙂
thanks so much!!! 🤍🤍"	ej1i8s	NonBinary	267	1.0	2020-01-02 17:51:43
I wish the binary folk would Respect Me but alas Am Sad pls tell me I’m handsome [they/them, he/him]		"VERY handsome.
hey handsome! love ur septum!!
Fuck what people think. Only validation you need is yours. Who cares what people think if you. Love yourself first all else will follow 
Handsome as heck.
Who is dis handsome snacc 😍
You are the HANDSOMEST
Handsome af.
Hey you're quite handsome, I'd ask you out if I knew you well. 
The most handsomest of all
You look like you'd be hella dope to kick it with. Now get out there and be a badass.
A heckin handsome
HANDSOME
You are handsome 
You remind me of that kid from Stranger Things
The handsomest boi 💜💛
Hecking handsome!  Love your piercing too 💙
Sup with you, handsome fella?
i've stopped noticing septums, does that make me more or less homo?"	atty29	NonBinary	252	0.98	2019-02-23 10:03:27
Making a kinda sad point		"You mean, people post here for.... *validation??* (gasp!)

Seriously though, what's your point?
In general I try to upvote and comment on things that I like. And sense of style, color choice, makeup skills, title of post, etc are all stuff that I can vibe with and be like yeah I like this human. On the same thing though- I have posts that got hundreds of upvotes and some that got like tens. There is a big difference based on time of day and day of the week you post as well.
I don’t think it’s fair to say that likes equals validation. Non Binary people are valid, and like are just likes :)
That’s life tho. Even on Insta, Twitter, any public forum, the conventionally attractive peeps will get more likes. For enbies, extra points for thin, white, afab, etc. It’s a good point, it’s not just here tho
I try to upvote all selfies because everyone deserves validation. I'm sorry you feel invalidated :(
The amount of calculations i do when considering when to upvote lol  


Are they hot? If so are they already swimming in likes? If not do they look like they need the extra validation? If they're in a sort of middle ground of upvotes do they look otherwise overprivilaged? Are they representing a side of nb i see all the time? Do they often post pics that get decent upvotes?  


On an unrelated note has anyone got a solution to an overthinking problem?
I’ve noticed this too :/ glad I’m not the only one.
as a cis man I own this to you, it's my job and purpose
my point is that if someone’s seeking validation but don’t look good, they don’t get validation. I know from multiple instances
not my point. my point is that people post pictures of themselves hoping for validation, but only the good-looking pictures are recognized
This. Sorting algorithms on reddit will just get some posts seen more than others - it's like chasing post click rates and momentum. I know I can say that I don't get to click through every post and upvote, but all enbies are valid.

Only issue I have is excessive posting and cross-posting, everyday, 'for validation'. How much attention does one need?
never said it was just here unfortunately
usually auto dislike if they are using binary language such as ""get u an nb who can do both""
thanks :)
I tend to upvote what I see, since we all need a boost from time to time and I know that's what people posting here are looking for. They want a connection with someone, to have someone see them and validate them. I provide that when I can.

I thought perhaps I'd missed some posts from you so I went to check your history to correct that, but I don't see any other submissions here from you in the last 3 weeks. If you'd like to share a picture of yourself, I'd be happy to give you my updoot.

Be well, friend.
I feel like I did address that- like i upvote things I like and I can like a lot of things not just people being good looking. And that a lot more than what someone looks like goes into what gets upvotes because I get very different number of upvotes based on different factors. There are times people can post where way less people will see it and thus you will be less likely to get upvoted.

I hear you. I also feel kind of like another commenter said- so say in AU everyone upvotes everything they see, will people feel validated or will they want different things like comments then? I am inclined to think the latter, but that could definitely just be me.
The post specifically mentioned this sub so I wanted to broaden the convo. It is extremely unfortunate tho
thanks. those aforementioned experiences were definitely over three weeks ago, but I didn’t want to mention it because I wasn’t sure how people would respond. 

my point isn’t that liking good-looking photos is bad, it’s that all those seeking validation deserve it, not just those who look good. 

I’m sorry, it’s a difficult perspective to explain with words.
well in response to the last part, people wouldn’t see everything, which massively contributes to the problem. but let’s end the discussion before it goes too far, please.
ah. 

also just realized ur username fits the situation
I am confused. "" my point isn’t that liking good-looking photos is bad "" so, persons who managed to get a great photo of themselves doesnt deserve validation?

&#x200B;

edit: DONT MIND ME I AM BLIND AND CANT READ OMG :D sryyyyy
I think their point is in the last bit: ""all those seeking validation deserve it, not just those who look good.""

I could be wrong, but I interpreted this as a comment about how people who fit certain attractiveness standards tend to get more validation and more upvotes than those who don't. The point, I think, is that everyone needs validation sometimes, regardless of how good they look, but that validation tends to be disproportionately piled into people who look on certain ways and others are left without. Validation is not allocated according to need, but rather according to perceived attractiveness, to put it another way.

I get that people upvote what they like. But I also think OP's feelings about that are valid. Attractiveness privilege exists.

Also I think you misread the part you quoted. OP is explicitly saying they *don't* think it's bad to like photos of good looking people.
no, they do deserve it, but just because someone looks bad doesn’t mean they deserve total ignorance! my point is that all enbies should be helped to feel valid
"" Also I think you misread the part you quoted. OP is explicitly saying they *don't* think it's bad to like photos of good looking people. ""

&#x200B;

THIS, you are right omg i read is instead of isnt. damn thats embarrasing :D
yes but you just cant force others to upvote things. thats not how it works. i try to validate many persons here and i can imagine that it hurts if one compares the own upvotes to others ( one of the reasons i dont post photos of me- plus you cant really delete posts on reddit like wtf)

but i think you wont be happy with more upvotes, next thing will be comments. ""yeah ok now we all get validation via upvotes, but the ""good looking ones""(which is highly subjective) get comments, we all deserve validation through comments..."" edit: next thing then is ""the comments seem not honest it doesnt feel like they are real"" yes. it wont stop. maybe its tricky to seek validation via digital interactions with strangers

sorry, thats not how this works i think
Happens to the best of us :)
not tryna force anything, just a topic in much need of awareness
well not actually ""forcing"" but it seems you try to make others a bad conscience for not liking fotos. I get your point, beautystandards are fucked up and everyone needs dopamine, but i see the difficulty in seeking for validation via fotos in a digital interaction. its way safer to work on getting more and more independant from the opinion of others.

you cant just tell people what they should like and what not. maybe they grow their own way of breaking beautystandards and are able to see the beauty of people falling out of these standards, but that needs time. it is a process ( im on my way but it doesnt happen overnight. years of sociallization have to be broken up) and because we all have a different paece, we will sadly not see the day where everyone is valued by everyone.

&#x200B;

but by discussing this you did a great job working on that and getting it into peoples sight :) thank  you <3"	mxhhxa	NonBinary	250	0.96	2021-04-24 10:44:05
Thank you AMAB nonbinary friends!	I'm an AFAB agender person and I am always really happy when I see AMAB enby people on this subreddit for the fact of my childish brain does a sad when only AFAB enby people are represented. It makes me worry that if someone on the outside (be it cis people or closeted AMAB enby peeps) saw our community, they would only see females and I don't want to be looked at like a female ever again, and the AMAB representation helps a LOT for that. Please keep it up and never be afraid to share your pics and stories! We are here for you welcome you with open arms <3	"This needs more up votes because AMAB nonbinary people do need more love!
My body confidence as a not skinny amab is sub-par, thanks for making a bit of room for us. This sub is great, also
Yay! I’m AFAB as well and I have met people who basically ignore AMAB NB’s and thus assume all NB’s are “confused lesbians” or “women who want to be special”

I think the more AMAB NB representación the better! It’s fighting misrepresentation for all trans/non-binary people.
Thank you. It is exhausting how excluded we often are from the community that should give us a home. It's also kind of disheartening how frequently the AMAB nb representation we do see is young, thin people. Coming out really helped me learn to love my body, but I am still trying hard to lose weight just so I can wear so many cute pieces of clothing that just don't come in my size.
I'm an AMAB enby and I appreciate your love for us. We're so hard to find!
<3
!!! This is honestly a huge thing for me too as AMAB. Like for the longest time I always felt like I didnt really ""count"" (you can thank some tumblr nonsense for that) until I finally realized/grew more comfortable with the idea of being nonbinary, that I could be. And honestly you're right it does seem to heavily skew AFAB (I would argue b/c toxic masculinity is a much *narrower* mind set / less pro-free thinking (see also: why college/honors courses skew femal)) but that's why I now feel so excited to be exploring what it means to be AMAB and nonbinary for myself. And not just me but I'm so excited for people of different backgrounds who are AMAB like SonicFox. We stan intersectionality.
Thank you. I'm an AMAB trans femme person (playing with the title demi girl or just NB trans femme. Not sure. Gender is weird). Anyway, I love this post
Thank you for this post! I definitely agree. I definitely don't look feminine, but love the clothing. The longer I've been in this community, the more comfortable I feel in ""womens"" clothing. This is the reason that I try to post almost everyday. I want to help fellow AMABs feel comfortable in their skin, like others have helped me. So again, thank you! 🥰
You're Welcome! Care For A Spot O' Tea?
Awwwww thankyu <3
Thank you. It's been one of the most difficult things about being out is feeling like I'm doing it wrong, and seeing AMAB enbies, especially masc-presenting ones like me, has really helped me feel not just like I truly believe the whole ""I don't owe anybody androgyny"" thing, but feeling more like ""I don't owe anybody anything other than myself"".
No, thank you <3
Aww, thank you!
Absolutely yes
This really means a lot! 💜
This, dramatically. I like blending a lot of femme clothes but being genetically taller/bigger/hairier makes finding femme clothes that fit atrociously difficult.

Once I met AMABs I started to actually conceive of the concept a little better since I could relate, so OP has a point about closeted AMABs for sure
felt this one in my soul.
You've got a point there with the toxic masculinity thing
Hello fellow trans-femme enby!

That's all, just wanted to acknowledge you and remind you you aren't alone!

There's dozens of us! Dozens!
Dozens sounds about right 😂"	ghqy6y	NonBinary	241	1.0	2020-05-11 16:33:16
I have been coming out as enby [he/she] these past couple months but no one uses my he pronouns and it makes me super sad. Guess I'm just shamelessly fishing for some masc compliments since I never get any irl. Also thank you for being such a rad community!		"You're handsome af
He is elegance. He is grace. He has the handsomest face!
It takes people a while to get used to new pronouns, start correcting people to remind them gently and they'll get it eventually.
Those eyebrows? Killer. I'm honestly getting super masc vibes from you! You're hella handsome!!!
you look like one of the guys on my school's baseball team
Honestly, you look great!
I used to happily accept any pronouns (he/she/they) but people only ever used he/him. I've since switched to exclusively using they/them and it's helped a lot.
Goddamn, you're handsome as hell and the way you look at the camera just nails me to the spot
Hey, me too! I asked my wife to start using my he pronouns exclusively around other people to model and that has really helped. If you've got allies, lean on them to show good behavior when you're not around!
This happens to me too! Once, someone used he, she, and they all in one sentence and it was somehow the most valid I’ve felt ever!
But look at you! He’s looking hella good and confident!
well I definitely scrolled up on you and thought to myself \* his look \* after reading that you have been coming out as envy . This is a brilliant photograph and I trust in time, you will be been more, int he way that you feel and want to be seen. All the power to you and congrats on taking the step to be open and may that continue for you!
You look really rad and masc and I love your septum piercing!
With people you are comfortable around try wearing a pin with the pronouns you are feeling more that day.
sup bro
I understand you perfectly, but you look pretty andrógino/masc, let people used to. It’s not comfortable but at time you are going to make it. 

That happens at my job, some people uses she, her, they, they. And are people that’s it’s a bit difficult make the effort hahaha 

Keep going and keep looking so damn fierce!
You look v handsome!
You look like a young dad who’s ready to coach soccer. ❤️
you look awesome dude
Ohhhh when the euphoria hits. Thank you 😊
Thank you ! A beautiful poem
Thanks I guess since my pronouns are he and she I feel weird correcting bc she is correct. I just don't like when all I get all day is she. It's confusing to deal with.
I've been feeling serious eyebrow euphoria if that is a thing haha thank you!
Oo this is a very specific and good compliment
I've been having the same issue (he/they), and part of me wants to switch just to they but at the same time I don't want to erase or deny the ""male""/masculine part of me.

Idk, gender sucks and this is all a scam
Thank you this is great advice!
Omg I'm literally just trying to be a cute dad thank you! Dad bod Rad bod for life.
You're most welcome
If you have people close to you try saying on days you're feeling more masc ""Hey friends, today is a He day and I'd appreciate just He today"" the more you do it people who care about you will get on board.
I get Sir-ed a lot when wearing my army field jacket (it's super warm in the winter with the liner in it)

Maybe a masculine coat or jacket made of stiffer material for He days could help?
That is such a great idea thank you!
I just bought a men's winter coat that's pretty baggy and stiff and I love it so much ! And it's my fav shade of clay yellow. Hopefully it will help with gendering by strangers!"	e3oki9	NonBinary	235	1.0	2019-11-30 01:28:25
right before clocking in at work vs during work. my femininity rly disappears in my work outfit. which is a bit sad. but that makes the time i dress up a bit even more fun.		"Looking absolutely stylish my friend
I honestly couldn’t tell from the pics alone your agab. 😁👌
So um... Can I draw you?
love the bangs!!!! you look so cute and i also love the labret:D
If you wanted to bring a little femininity back, you could wear a visor and have some high space buns sticking out! Either way you’re BIG cute
Älskar Smakis lol
SÅ gott!! min kollega slutar inte dricka det så han fick in mig på att dricka dom lmaoo
I'm certainly not telling you what to do, because I also grow facial hair and enjoy it. However, I think you'd made a super cute girl if you went all for it and shaved the face. 

You're adorable and I love your chin!
thank yaaaa
its tricky haha but thats really what i’m aiming for :)
HELLO? YES!!! omg no one has drawn me like ever before 🥺
dm me the final product if u do 🥹
aaaah ur so sweet!! thank u :)
we have bandanas but i dont like them hahah (i could try tho 👀 but i’m more of a hat person tbh so i’m just embracing the femininity in my personality c:
i will never go back to being a girl tbh. years of dysphoria has finally gotten me to a point where i’m happy. and i feel more comfy being non binary, being nothing and just myself. i’m more comfortable when people take me for a dude. it’s what i want to be viewed as if anything other than enby. trying to grow my tiny beard out for the extra enby look haha

otherwise, thank u so much c:
Absolutely!  Promise!
Just know that I meant only good things and you are valid. 🙂 ❤️  I am sorry if I misidentified.
no no youre good dont worry c: i totally understand"	x355h6	NonBinary	232	1.0	2022-09-01 11:27:47
Sad, single and gay. Making enbyfriend applications...jks. Unless 😳✋		"You look like my ideal lover and my ideal myself.
Unsure if I want to be or to be with.
you're def v cute, but since I'm mono and I'm a relationship and demiromantic I can't. Still, I found an enby who loves enbies so that means you can too!
Where do I send my CV?
I'm always happy to make new friends

I’m down to make new friends, but not interested in any relationships ATM.
Your hair is so pretty! Where do I send my application lol
I would love to have more enby friends honestly! You got style too
You're cute af, but way too young for me
Would be fab to befriend other enbies, I don't know any irl.
Where can I apply?
Honestly same bro, I just wanna find someone I can relate to, but none of my enby friends like me romantically ;(

I don't know what to do	"When I (19NB) came out to my friend (20F), I sent her a link to a 'What's my gender identity quiz' as a fun activity because I was nervous about telling her straight up.

My results showed I was transgender and I shared it with her she was like ""nah, you're a woman. Everything about your body says so.""
And she's been saying stuff like ""that's my girl!"" or calling me a woman because she knows I don't like that.

I told her I don't mind her using she/her for me because there are no gender neutral pronouns in my language.

This really makes me sad, she's my friend for 7 years and the only friend I've ever had."	"If she won't stop treating you disrespectfully, you'll need to spend a lot less time with her just out of self-defense.  Explain that to her, and then follow-through if she doesn't start treating you with respect.
Real friendship involves respect for the other person. To intentionally misgender you and say things like that indicates she doesn't actually respect you. I can't advise you what to do, but if I were in that situation, I'd rather have fewer or no friends than a false friend who treated me poorly.
What she said about how ""everything about your body says woman"" is really bugging me, among every other dismissive thing she's said. We don't exactly have a great deal of control over the bodies we're born with and all.
Been in a similar situation. It really hurts when the person doubles down on the misgendering but it a seemingly “positive” way.
If you haven't been direct up until now, you should try that. Tell her straight up you're not a woman and she needs to stop referring to you as a woman or the friendship will end. If you're not willing to be direct with her, your options are to continue to deal with the situation as it is now or end the friendship.
Nope you gotta sit her down and show your serious, this is not ok to do and she's gotta know it is a big deal, tell her your serious about it and stand up for yourself even if it may be a bit scary because she's your friend, she's treating it like a joke but a joke shouldn't make someone uncomfortable to the point your asking for help
I'm gonna be completely blunt. That isn't a friend, that's emotional abuse. You deserve to be accepted and respected and embraced. I won't tell you what to do, as everyone handles problems differently but for me, I think I'd probably say some stuff to her that I ***should*** regret, but wouldn't. Friends don't do that, and I was once in a similar state of mind where I was perfectly okay with someone being shitty just because I wanted to have a friend. I eventually realized that I deserved better. ***You*** deserve better.
Did you actually tell her? 

With no other context, that quiz probably doesn’t seem like something to be taken seriously - not saying it wouldn’t be a hint, but if she did not actually hear (from your mouth or from your hints or otherwise) you say you’re nonbinary, maybe she doesn’t realize? Or at least the extent to how hurtful the comments are?

And if she does know, what you do is leave. Someone here suggested an ultimatum, and I think that’s fair. She’s been your friend, sure, but now she’s intentionally adding distress to your life/interactions, and that’s not a solid friendship now. She broke it.
“Everything about your body says so” 

Hell, everything about my body says I am an obese, lazy, cake lover! 

yet all my blood tests prove I have a great diet, have medical problems that keep my body large, and not to mention I take hikes, and have a housekeeping job. I also hate sweets. 🤷‍♀️ 


What you see on the outside is not some end all explanation of who you really are. Such bs 😞 sorry you have a “friend” like that..
>And she's been saying stuff like ""that's my girl!"" or calling me a woman because she knows I don't like that.

she's actively doing things you don't like BECAUSE she knows you don't like them. this girl is a horrible friend and you deserve so much better, i'm so sorry
I'm sorry, but the answer is to give her an ultimatum. If she doesn't stop purposefully misgendering you, stop talking to her. Honestly, I'd stop talking to her anyway. I know that losing a friend is absolutely horrible and painful, I've gone through it, but you will be better off on your own than with a friend who doesn't respect you. And at some point you will find new, better friends.
Sounds like a shitty ""friend"" You deserve better than that
buddy she ain't a real friend. if you think there's a chance she'll listen and change, sit her down, have a serious discussion and let her know that this is a big deal and she needs to stop. otherwise, it's best you try and ease yourself outta that friendship, and find some new buddies to hang with. good luck!!
Does your language have any neopronouns? I know some languages are making some, but it is most common in English. Sucks about your ""friend"" :( She seems like she's not going to be accepting of you. I hope she comes to her senses, but it doesn't seem likely to me.
have you tried lecturing her?
Well, just talk to her about how you feel about her telling about that stuff. Tell her that it hurts how she’s treating you, and if she doesn’t, try to spend less time away from her and more to yourself.
I know it’s harder said then done, but in my experience it’s been much easier to deal without people like that. I’m older than you - 32. My friend of 20 years ended our friendship when I came out. Of course it was upsetting. Way happier with friends who support me.
You can't control her reaction, only your own ♥️ Keep in mind that who YOU feel you are is all that matters. But it sounds like she's been a close friend otherwise, and that sucks. At the end of the day, all you can do is be honest with her about how her language makes you feel and take comfort in the fact that you did all you could do. The rest is up to her to put in the effort and be a good friend. Best of luck and remember that you deserve acceptance at the very least!!
Talk to her about it. Explain how important she is, and explain how important this is. She can take you as you are or leave you as you were.
if i were you, i'd try calmly correcting her. if she refuses to stop excessively calling you a woman, ask her specifically why. explain that gender and gender expression aren't set by birth sex. tell her that she wears pants (i'm assuming she's not from the 1850s here) and that a hundred years ago she would've been attacked like she's currently attacking you. ask if she would be happy if she had been born as a guy, or as intersex and her family incorrectly decided that she would be raised as a boy. these are just some suggestions of things that've helped me before. they might not work for you, but questioning her along these lines (like what if people didn't see her as the gender she wanted to be seen as) will probably start her in the process of accepting you.
Sorry you're dealing with that. Some people get upset when you challenge their idea of you. Dunno how long this has been going on, but if you let it keep going, it'll eat you like a cancer. She isn't being friends with you right now; she's being friends with her idea of you, while dismissing the actual you.

 I wish I had a magic spell that would make her turn this around, but I don't. You might need to brace yourself for a sad ending.

Please take care of yourself, be safe, reach out of you need help.
I’m curious, what language?
That’s not a friend
I would counter argue with something like: Since when gender is in the body? Gender is psychological and social. Get your facts checked. 

Also this might seem petty but- i would misgender her and when she says something, be like: oh im sorry i thought we were playing to gender other incorrectly

I know, im not fun at parties :(
i understand it can be hard but if she isnt accepting of you, distancing yourself is probably the best bet for your mental health. if possible you could maybe look for lgbtq groups in your area to see if you can makes some friends that are understanding of your gender identity?
Seek a professional therapist for an outside pro opinion.
That's easier said than done :(
Yeah! If she invalidates your experience because she ''believe'' you're woman, even if she loves you, she doesn't have the voice to explain you who you are.
One possible response to this is, ""Well my brain is a part of my body and my brain says otherwise ...""
Some people just dont understand :(

They think they are misgendering you for your own good...
Yes to this. Open and honest communication is super important in making any type of relationship be more effective, even if that means ending it due to incompatibility
Precisely
Other than the quiz, no, I didn't say anything.
She has a special place in my heart and I don't want to lose her and I'm scared of being alone.
There's a possibility that the intention isn't ""because she knows I don't like that"". Not to dismiss OP's experience at all - I would ask OP how do they know that is their friend's intention? It could be that there is very real evidence to base that POV on, but it's also a common thought-trap to project your own internalised transphobia onto others. (This is something I do ALL THE TIME.)

Could be that OP's friend is part of cis-het-normative society and thinks she is acting for the best. The question is whether she's open to listen in a more direct conversation, and then to make effort to do better.
Yeah and as part of this ultimatum give her a copy of the book Gender Outlaws and have her write you a book report on it. If you’re feeling kind you could make it a book club style discussion.
She would just dismiss it and say it's not a big deal
Arabic. It's a heavily gendered language.
Some therapy to help get you comfortable with asserting and defending boundaries would be really helpful for you, then.
I feel you. It seems the consensus in the community is to cut off / stop spending time with whoever doesn't acknowledge our identities, but if I did that I would lose so many friends and family, idk what I would do.
I know what you mean. It's too easy for us to dismiss your friendship without worrying about the consequences.

Remember tho: you aren't stuck with only her forever.  Try to make new friends, ones that start off respecting you. (Introvert here: I know that's also easier said than done.) Perhaps if she sees some examples of respectful friendship, she'll figure it out. Or, if she still doesn't, at least you won't be as alone.

Best wishes!
I’m assuming that space in your heart is because of your past relationship/experiences. None of those need to leave. They’ve happened already. Nothing about your response to this will cheapen those. 

But what’s going to happen if you don’t lose her intentionally or tell her straight that you’re trans is that her presence becomes one of anxiety. Sounds like it already has, maybe. And at that point what’s the point, ya know? 

Please think not about why you want a friend in your life but why you want *her* around. Besides the fact that you’ve been together a long time. And if you consider transphobic treatment a dealbreaker - which I highly recommend - then you need to either fix it (telling her and telling her how she better not refer to you, technically you can’t make her do anything) or break that seal.
If you haven't said anything other than the quiz she might be thinking that you shared the quiz with her because you're uncertain if you're 'womanly' enough to be a woman, instead of trying to say you're not a woman. She might be trying to encourage you with her words, and not realise that you came out as enby. Before dropping her I'd make sure you have stated clearly that you aren't a woman and that that's why you shared it, so you don't want to be called a woman.
you need a new friend
If something is a big deal to you and your friend doesn't think it's a big deal, they're not your friend because they don't care about the things that matter to you.
Yeah it sucks for people who have to deal with heavily gendered languages.
I'm sorry that you don't seem to have many friends, then, because someone who doesn't want to acknowledge your identity is not a friend.
I too am sorry that I don't have many friends. But I mean I've got what I've got."	voc2xk	NonBinary	211	1.0	2022-06-30 16:09:38

Oml you‘re honestly really fucking gorgeous! Would love to play with your hair! :0
That makeup has strong Ziggy Stardust vibes and it's really working for you, you look great!
Very pretty 😘
I L.O.V.E. your hair, and your makeup skills are better than mine by a long shot. My only critique could ever be that if I were painting your look, I'd give you matching blue eyelashes. Wonderful color choices; positioning/framing, and expression are on point.
Damn I wish I was that good at make up

You look bomb, but sad so I want to cheer you up
You are gorgeous and your curly hair is glorious. My straight flat hair could only dream.
I know you are feeling sad, but you gotta recognise you are looking cute at least! it’s something!
Aaaw thank you, it means alot

Yeah, this whole look was centered around the fact that my friend gave me blue mascara but then it just came out clump :ء
I’m honestly not that good, I just do a lot of lame color theory research n stuffs
Aaww ty
Will do, right after exams
Nooo, flat hair is so flop and adorableee❤️❤️❤️❤️it’s very 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌
But not girl cute so it don’t count
Like I need to learn to do wingtips that good.
:0
Aww dang, that would have been killer! Nice of your friend, though.
You are absolutely very too kind. I will always be Samara from the ring chic
Hmm sorry you feel that way :(
I used the tape trick, then put back on the foundation that the tape ripped off, and then dragged the wings down a little to make up for the powder that got messed up with the foundation
I never heard of the tape trick
You basically get a piece of masking tape, line it up with your bottom eyeline and it creates kinda a template to do wings, and it makes it come out vry sharp
Thank you so much!

Dad here. Help me, please.	"I’m hoping to gain some insight and understanding from you all. Here goes:

My kiddo Jessica (not the real name) was born with lady bits and spent a vast majority of their young life as my little princess buddy. We fished together, worked on house projects together, listened to music together, etc. I love that kid.

I’m an army dad- currently away from my family, and got an email from Jessica that she is genderqueer and wants to use “they/them” pronouns from now on, that she wants to dress more like a guy, etc.

I don’t know why I am having such a hard time with this-I’ve been very involved in their life and it totally caught me off guard. I also knew that my response was pretty important. I’ll copy and paste what I wrote back:

“The only way I would be disappointed in you is if (A) I thought you were compromising your future, or (B) I thought you weren’t being true to yourself. I love you no matter what you do, and no matter what you believe. I will never allow there to be anything that divides you from me.

About the pronouns, you said I don’t have to call you by them if it makes me uncomfortable. If I call you she/her, it’s because I’m old and old habits are going to be hard to break.”

I’ll wrap this up. I don’t understand any of this. But I want to. I just don’t know why this is making me feel so sad. Any other parents going through the same thing?

Thoughts?"	"Change can take time to process. Good on you for accepting your kiddo as they are! [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/nq7d9n/im_writing_a_sort_of_guide_to_parents_of_trans/) are some notes from a previous post on how to be a supportive parent. I hope that you get something useful out of it. Do you have any specific questions we can answer for you? Terms we can define, or aspects of our own non-binary/genderqueer experiences we might be able to describe to give you more context?
I’m glad you’re trying to educate yourself. This is a gentle reminder that the only person who lives inside your kid’s brain is them. Trust them about who they say they are AND try your best to see them for who they are too. They/them pronouns are not that hard to get used to if you put in the active effort to make the change and if you do your best to see your kid as the person they’re telling you they are. Most of all, continue to support them and allow them to go on their own gender journey. Your grieving is unhelpful to them and to yourself— instead of being sad for who you thought they were, be proud that they’re being true to themself and telling you who they truly are.
Check out this zine, it’s written exactly for your situation! https://www.alyssagiannini.com/nonbinaryzine 

The biggest things, you’ve already done, great job. :) continue to be supportive and open to learning, use their pronouns/name(s) they might want to try out as best you can, and maybe ask if there are other things that are important to them right now (like gendered terms, if they’d like you to use certain pronouns with certain people, etc)
The best thing you can do for your child is to take them serious. Ask them unassuming questions and listen to them. Its an important part of their Identity now. You could simply ask: what does genderqueer mean to you , you could find genderneutral nicknames for them together(if you used feminine sounding nicknames till now) it would have meant the world to me if my parents would have done that.

Also little anecdote: it has been 3 years since I told my Parents and they still get my pronouns wrong. And because of this I never feel like calling them or being around them. It just hurts. I know that habits are hard to break, but you could practice using they/them pronouns for your child  I think it would mean alot to them if you could do that. Just tell someone about them. when they are not around. You will fuck up but thats okay. It will come naturally to you after a while.

My mother was sad about me coming out because she thought it would take certain experiences  away  from me. But that is not the case. I still want (and can) have kids, marriage is still an option.

Your kid may also still be your princess buddy, maybe they wont feel comfortable with the term princess or buddy, but you still can have the same  great relationship that you are describing.
I'm curious why it's making you sad, too. Is it possible that you're attached to the idea of them being your *daughter*? It's pretty common to have hopes and dreams for our kids. Is it possible some of those hopes/dreams were based on the gender that was assumed for them, and so now it feels like they won't come true? If that's the case, try asking yourself why you had those hopes/dreams for them in the first place. Was it because you wanted them to be happy, or because you had ideas about what they ""should"" do in life? If the latter, you may need to let them go, and put your kid's happiness before your expectations for them. If it's the former, then remind yourself that nothing has changed! They can still be happy. Support them in that :)

I realize that's a lot of ""ifs"" based on a guess. Something I can be more certain of: don't tell them that you're going to mess up, or give your excuses for doing so (eg ""I'm old,"" ""it's just hard,"" ""I always thought of you as a girl,"" ""I was taught 'they' is plural,"" etc). Most trans people have heard every excuse under the sun too many times to count, and often coming from people who continue to misgender us after weeks, months, years, even decades. They say ""I'm trying,"" but somehow they still can't get it right, even though they correct themselves with no problem when someone says ""actually my dog is a boy.""

If you don't want to misgender your kid, you're going to have to change the way you think about gender. Most people automatically sort everyone into either ""man"" or ""woman"" based on appearance, dress, voice, etc. No matter how hard you try to remember your kid is an exception to the rule, the automatic sorting process will always be faster, and so it will win unless you carefully plan every sentence for the rest of your life. If you want to get it right, you need to get rid of the automatic process. Teach yourself that you don't know people's genders, no matter how obvious they may seem. Stop using gendered terms like ""sir"" unless the person you're referring to has told you their gender. For strangers, use only they/them pronouns and gender neutral language unless someone tells you their pronouns. When you're telling someone a story about your day, don't say ""there was a woman on the bus,"" say ""there was a person on the bus."" When you *do* accidentally gender someone, correct yourself and keep going. Ask the people around you to catch you and correct you, too.

Oh and for the love of all that is holy, when you do misgender them, do *not* make a big deal out of it. Just correct yourself and move on. ""My daughter -- I mean, my child -- was telling me how blah blah blah whatever."" When you make a big deal of a mistake you've made, you're drawing attention to someone who already probably wishes the ground would swallow them up, and that's not helpful. When you tell us how hard it is to get our pronouns right, we hear that deep down in your heart, you just don't believe us. When you explain that you're old or the grammar is confusing or whatever other excuse, we hear that you're more worried about being blamed than you are about hurting us.
If you can get to the root of why you're sad, it may help. I'd recommend taking some time to talk to yourself and sort out where your feelings are coming from-- or hell, enlist a professional! Everybody benefits from therapy, and it'd be a huge boon to you and your kid for you to sort out what's happening for you emotionally without either placing the burden on them, or you having to slog through this alone.

I don't know if you need to hear this, but you haven't failed as a parent for not seeing this coming, nor have you failed because they're trans. If they felt safe enough to tell you, you're probably doing a pretty bang up job.
And your kid is still the exact same person at their heart. You haven't lost them. 

If you're a comics kind of guy, there's a guide to they/them pronouns by Archie Bongiovani:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36580693-a-quick-easy-guide-to-they-them-pronouns

(And 'Queer' by Meg-John Barker and Julia Scheele is a great introduction to queer theory, history, and community terms if you think that will help with building a better understanding and foundation for you!)

All my best wishes for you and yours.

EDIT: If you have any questions, I'm an open book. I'm not a parent, but I am an older nonbinary person who has had to do a lot of work on parenting myself and dealing with parents on opposite ends of the acceptance spectrum. I don't have a problem answering on this post right here, but you can DM me if you'd like.
I've heard some parents say that when their child transitions, it feels like their old child is dying. But I like to think of it more as a metamorphosis- like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.
You are doing great! That fact that you want to understand and support your kid goes a long way. It is kids like yours being their authentic selves that helped me accept who I am.
Op, I'll offer some light criticism here. It's generally not great to disclose a trans/nonbinary/genderqueer person's gender or sex assigned at birth, unless it's medically necessary or otherwise a significantly important distinction. Otherwise, keep up the good work
Ok so your doing great and I saw someone answering a couple questions so I’ll answer the same. 

When did you feel like you didn’t fit into the 2 gender mold:   Well I’ve always had, curiosity about male things etc but some days I wouldn’t? Then I after figuring out I was (don’t use this term anymore tho) a lesbian I started questioning gender. I realize now that the reason I could never exactly pinpoint a label was because it changed. I’m genderfluid so I realized eventually that I was a more masc leaning in general genderfluid.

Is it hard for people your age to grasp:  hell yeah I’m relatively young (teenager) and nobody really understands genderfluid.


Does it continue to change for you: if we mean in like a literal sense yes because I’m genderfluid (probably said that a million times lmao sorry) but also I began questioning me gender because of sexuality
it makes my heart happy that even though you don’t understand you’re trying to, i dont have much advice to offer as i joined this thread to learn more about non-binary people and people who use they/them because i several co workers who identify as they/them but i think you’re doing a great job so far! parental support helps children so much, and it seems like you honestly want to help them feel comfortable during their transition and that’s amazing:)
Hey, your support is the most important part, so keep it up! Like someone already said, you will need to accept that they are your kid and not your 'princess'. Of course this isn't easy, but you should try to work on accepting they aren't a girl. Genderqueer is a very general term, it might be that they are still searching for who they are, so support that process. For me the most important realization was that gender isn't binary, it is a scale. Be aware that they might slide on this scale in the coming period. Transitioning isn't a one day process, usually it takes years, for some even decades.   
It is very difficult to come out, especially if you don't know how your parents will react (even though  they're supportive more often than not.) I can imagine that you didn't see/expect anything from your perspective and that it is difficult for you to accept, because it feels like you missed out (especially knowing you try really hard to stay connected from the base.) Please try to keep doing that and keep doing the stuff you already did with them (fishing, house project, etc.) They didn't change their personality at once, just the label they used changed. Some people change a bit after coming out, but this is usually expressing more loudly who they were already. Maybe you can use it as a chance to connect with them on a deeper level again.   
I don't know how much you gave them 'feminine' things, but if you can, support them with more masculine things, maybe you can give them a knife or something like that for Christmas. Especially as an army dad, you're probably their example for a masculine person. If they allow/ask for it (and you can), try to help them find their way to be more masculine.   
One thing I want to add is that it also is important to show that you support them in general life. If someone says something homo/transphobic, just say that it's not cool, even when your kid isn't around. Show that your proud at them and support them.
I joined this subreddit because I'm the father of a non-binary child. I came here looking for ways to be supportive and everyone I've talked to had been super helpful. As a stubborn old veteran, it's especially hard to break old habits. I told the kid ""look, I'm gonna fuck this up. It's not malicious, I'm just old. Call me out when I get it wrong, misgendering and dead naming isn't deliberate I'm just struggling to adjust."" To my kid, intention is what's important. And our house golden rule, don't be a dick.
Fellow parent here.  There are a lot of emotions that come with this. And they are valid. Some of the sadness for me is knowing that we live in a world with a lot of really terrible, unsupportive bigots and having a kid that doesn’t fit into the typical gender molds guarantees that things will be harder for them.  It is always hard to watch your child struggle with anything and this can be a huge struggle.  Also, you kinda have an idea of future things you’ll do with your kid and some of those might not happen how you envisioned it (wedding dress shopping was one of those for me). It’s ok to go through the emotions you have. And you’ll go through them multiple times as new things come up. Just continue to be supportive, ask questions as things come up (we’ve had many conversations about it as new questions arise), and love them for who they are (or are figuring out who they are). I was already a pretty fierce mama bear, but I’ve become so much fiercer and more protective now. I’m the wall between them and the crappy parts of the world for now.
As a child (and by extension, grandchild) here, I love the steps you're taking for your kiddo. It means a lot that you're trying to learn more about this community  and be apart of your kid's life. I was worried about coming out as nonbinary to my conservative grandmother but was welcomed with warm arms, and now she asks me about the lgbt+ community, and we can have open discussions about what enby means to me, what does it mean to be queer, how does my SO feel about this, etc. I can tell she is making a genuine effort. On the other hand, my mom has said it will be hard for her to use the correct pronouns because she has known me as she/her for +20 years. I can forgive mistakes here and there, but she is a teacher and I feel she puts more effort into her students' pronouns than mine. So please be mindful, if you make a mistake try to correct yourself immediately then move on with the conversation. Don't constantly make excuses. I'm asking as someone with parents who don't fully understand, please just try. It makes a world of difference having someone in your corner as you're trying to find the words to explain what you're feeling inside.
I'm really happy to see this here.  I don't know how old your kiddo is but I'm almost 30 and I have been struggling to have this conversation with my dad for almost ten years. It took a lot of courage and resolve for your kid to share that news with you and you should be proud of them for knowing themselves well enough to realize their truth. 
I'll tell you a little bit about how I hope my eventual conversation goes with my dad- I want to reassure him that I am the same person I have always been. Nothing about my gender changes anything about my moral character or anyone's ability to love me. I am capable of being professional as myself and I am worthy of a good life. 
I know my dad is in your boat, he won't ""get it"" right away, maybe not ever. But if he's willing to keep an open mind and TRY to understand, that will mean the world to me. 
It makes me so happy that you're reaching out to learn more. Please ask anything!
Dude, from all your replies I'm so happy you're here to learn how to support your kid - they're lucky to have you :)

Change can be difficult, especially if it's someone you know and love changing something you see as fundamental like gender identity. My advice for pronouns is don't make a big deal if you slip up, just correct yourself and move on and you'll have the muscle memory retrained in no time. They're still the same person and your kid will really appreciate having a parent who doesn't treat them any differently to before coming out so you're doing a great job.

Feeling sad makes sense in a way, you're adjusting to the news that you have a genderfluid child instead of a daughter and that's a valid reaction to have, but like I said remember that you now have the chance to get to know your kid even more as they trust you enough to come out. Good luck man
Not a lot I can say that hasn't been said, but I wanted to make a little note that may mean something to you: The fact that they felt comfortable opening up to you about their gender and pronouns says a lot about the relationship you have. You talked about how close you two are. It sounds to me like they still love and trust you, and if anything your bond will only get stronger if they can be their true self around you.

I would reccomend looking on youtube for any nonbinary people who talk at length about their identity and experiences. Or ask your kid to find somebody they relate to and send you a link. My mom was a lot like you when I came out as a trans man. Accepting but confused and a little sad without really understanding why. I sent her a trans youtuber's ""best of"" video that was basically a montage of moments from the videos he made while coming out and transitioning. Seeing the visible change in that guy's mood and the improvement in his life really helped her work through her feelings on it.

Good luck to both of you! Change is hard, but as long as you put in some effort I'm sure it will mean the world to them!
It really seems so far like you’re handling this with a lot of care and love :) Change takes time. Remember that, at the end of the day, this is still the same kid you’ve always known!
Thanks, Dad 💜🥰 Mine was Navy and died before I came out, and we were best friends my whole life. Your post here for support has me feeling lots of ways, and I thank you for the glimpse into what my “Daddy’s kiddo’s” Dad may have experienced. 

(I’m in my 50s so may have different POV than your kiddo’s peers but/and as you and I are likely closer in age, I hope to have some insights for you!) 

IMHO, telling your kiddo that they will always have your love and support is HUGE and WELCOME. 

I see your parenting approach in your two bullets, and hope this is not the first time you and your kiddo have talked about those? They land on me as potentially in conflict, as some people would consider being out a HUGE risk to one’s future — but/and your commitment to your kiddo being their authentic selves is EXCELLENT :-) so keep that up, Dad! 

The risks to / for trans folks (especially younger ones) tend to be rooted in the nature and level of support and family (biological and/or chosen).  Seems to me that your kiddo has solid support from you, and you are honoring your confusion, your emotions, and your questions — all very natural things and all very similar to the experience your kiddo has had / is having as they explore their identity. Your empathy for them and for yourself will be a wonderful foundation for your continuing relationship growth! 

As for pronouns: you’ll get there :-) I switched to they/them pronouns in my 40s and it’s funny how I will misgender myself sometimes talking or thinking about past events lol. Be kind to yourself as you re-tool your habits and expand your approach beyond the male/female binary! Correct yourself in the moment if you notice; I really appreciate when folks do that for me. Big apology isn’t needed, usually? But checking in periodically can help make sure there aren’t any “ouch” moments unresolved. 

I am so excited for you! You have a wonderful relationship already with your kiddo, and you get to be their #1 fan and support during this important part of their personal development and identity! :-D 

As for clothes: I wore mostly mens in the 80s :-) Better quality, better prices, more consistent sizing — so many benefits! And for me, part of being non-binary is access / rights / options to wear whatever I want to :-) which is really great, as I’m more comfortable wearing what I’m drawn to day-to-day. Mostly yoga pants and flannel shirts during COVID lol but I do have some femme options in my closet. 

TLDR: YAY, YOU!! Thanks for being such a great Dad to your kiddo 🥰 They will continue to thrive and become their full selves with your continued love & support! 💜
""Went fishing together, and did house projects"" and you didn't see this coming? It was obvious all that time. 

Best advice I can give is to let them explore, but keep an eye out for impulsive decisions that might be permanent (that doesn't include hair or clothing chooses).
You likely feel sad because you've got this image in your head of a daughter that would grow up to be a woman, etc, and it was just such a happy feeling, a family.

You didn't lose a family. That kid is still yours, just a different but also happy future. It's natural to somewhat grieve for an idea of a family member you lost in a situation like this, but focus on the kid you have and envision a new happy future with them.

It might also be concerning, because well, having a trans child can be scary. We're a minority that gets discriminated against. Your child might run into new difficulties in life for not being cis - but y'all just didn't know they were never cis in the first place. It's okay, they just need more support in other ways.

This doesn't change much except the idea in your head of what your child would look like in the future. You might've felt very attached to that idea so it's okay to feel detached and sad, but also try to feel some new happiness for a happier child that has the courage to be themselves and still love you as their father.

Your kid still loves you, you still love them. Just be supportive and focus on the new future, not the one that was in your head.
there’s a lot of good information already in this thread that others have left, so i encourage to check that out. but i just wanted to say that i’m happy you’re trying to learn and be supportive. i wish my parents tried a bit harder but they’ve gotten better over time. i am a 24 (almost 25) year old human who just recently came out this year to my family. none of them understand still and have a hard time getting my pronouns right. i understand it’s hard to see us as a gender other than what we have grown up presenting as & living as all these years. i knew as a child that something was different about me compared to everyone else. i always thought maybe i was a boy but i realized that i don’t feel like i could be a boy but also didn’t feel like a girl. i learned a couple of years ago about the non-binary umbrella and that’s when it all clicked. i am happy to now present myself as a non-binary/possibly genderfluid person. that’s my experience with my gender, hope it helps in some way. you’ll get the hang of it and will also get the hang of using their pronouns. just please don’t make a big deal about misgendering them when it happens. if you mess up just instantly correct yourself and move on with your convo. when people make a big deal about it and apologize profusely it makes me uncomfortable and embarrassed. and also don’t use being old as an excuse for using the wrong pronouns. my parents do ALL the time and it just makes me feel like they never want to try. please try to use their pronouns. also make sure and check what terms your kid is okay with you using for them. some non-binary/genderqueer people only want to use neutral terms and some are okay with using some gendered terms (ie: son, daughter, girly, princess, dude, etc) i know i am more on the neutral side but that’s not the case with everyone. it’s going to be a big learning curve for you, but i think you’ll get the hang of it! just be respectful and supportive and make sure to ask unassuming questions if you feel like you need to!
Love them for who they are, not for who you imagined they would be. They are their own person, and having your support and love is more important than I can put into words.
It might feel like you’re losing part of your child, or that you somehow missed signs that they were genderqueer growing up, and so you feel sad because you must’ve done something or neglected to do something that resulted in you not truly knowing your child.

It’s important to remember that people are changing all the time, your child has been changing since the day they were born. It’s not something anyone can really control, and that doesn’t mean they aren’t still the same person they’ve always been. 

Try thinking about it like this: this is a step towards your child figuring out who they really are, it’s something to celebrate and be happy that they’re growing and figuring things out, which of course comes with nostalgia, but so does a lot of things. As time passes you’ll come to understand this part of your child more.

Your child isn’t changing the definition of themself, and they aren’t redefining who they are, but rather they are adding a new clause to the definition of themself; they’re adding onto the list of things that makes them who they are.

This video is long but it’s helpful in understanding what change and identity really mean, and that someone evolving past your current understanding of them isn’t as concerning or different as it feels: https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg

The fact that you’re trying to understand and that you’re taking your child seriously is fantastic and you’re already doing better than a lot of parents.
You sound like a great dad ❤️
One thing I would like to say is that a lot of people over-apologize for misgendering someone. I had a girl once who would not stop apologizing and actually started crying because she misgendered me. Everyones eyes were on us. It made me very uncomfortable. If someone misgenders me I don’t want attention to be drawn to the situation. A quick “oops sorry - they” will suffice. 
Anyways, I’m free to answer any questions, best of luck to you and your child.
So my name is Luna and go by They/Them, I was born a male but I don't view myself as a boy/man because I don't relate to that stereo type that society has created. Now when a child is born people assume that if they have a penis, they are to be masculine, boisterous and such and if they have a vagina they must be femine and girly. People who identify as non-binary don't feel as though they fit into either of those binary categories or they feel like they fit a combination of both. In my case I like to be viewed as more femine hence the name but I do still associate with having a male body physically. My personality has always been towards the femine side and it's surprising how long my family has taken to recognize it. Hopefully you will come to accept Jessica for who they are even though they don't fit into the binary gender you assumed they belonged to. Hope this helped 😊
Maybe you don’t have to understand it? Just accept that they are having a human experience and try to respect them and their wishes as much as you can. It’s completely understandable that this is new and strange to you, but someone coming out to you isn’t exactly about you or your feelings or understanding. Someone coming out is about them being able to be honest with themselves and the people around them. Just put your attention on your child and watch how they are still the same person you know on the inside, just with different characteristics than you’re familiar with. If you focus on your love for them instead of your own sadness or misunderstanding then I promise everything else will fall into place 💕
I like the metaphor of a butterfly and a caterpillar, same person but certain traits like gender expression and pronouns change when the person find themself, it can take time but as long as you try Jessica should be happy and loved by you, supporting a child means a lot to many transgender folks, hope it added.
I think you are off to a great start. You obviously love your kid. I believe that this will be clear no matter how comfortable with their pronouns you are, or how “well” you handle it. Focus on your relationship with them, and keep loving them. 

Being non binary or genderqueer doesn’t change anything about a person, nor is it a major part of a person’s personality. You already know how to care for this person better than anyone on the internet, trust your instincts
Such a sweet thought that you are supporting your child!!! The world needs more people like you!
ask them what they need,
practice with they them pronouns.
do some researche (which u already did ofc on this sub)
your doing great that email is amezing and a lot of trans folks could only dream of a response like that, make sure to follow up on what you say by simply trying and listening.
People’s experiences of gender can vary a lot, especially in the nonbinary community. 

It is hard to generalize, and so can be hard to understand. Some nonbinary people feel like binaries gendered categories just aren’t a good description for their experience. Some feel like they don’t find gender useful for understanding the world and it’s more intuitive for them to navigate the world without it. Some people are experiencing difficult gender dysphoria. 

Gender is a social construct. Like money is a social construct. But this is very hard to see clearly when you’ve been raised to consider the boyness and girlness of everyone as their primary identifier. 

It’s also very confusing because the social construct of gender is continually changing. And every person, and especially every generation, is understanding it a bit differently. Can girls have short hair? Do boys cook? Can women be unmarried? Do men wear colorful clothes? Do you teach your daughters to handle money? Do your sons receive emotional support? 

Your grandparents will have differing opinions from you. This social construct is passed in from one generation to the next. Gender is primarily enforced by parents, and then other authorities like teachers, church leaders, and other adults in their life. 

It’s helpful to consider different gender norms in different cultures. 200 years ago, if a woman was too educated and independent, she might literally not be seen as a woman, and thus not marriable, because she was fulfilling the social role of woman. 

When someone is transgender, it means they don’t identify within the range of their assigned gender within their particular societies gender construct. That living in that identity limits their personal growth and expression in a way that is painful. They want to live more freely, and be seen as themselves. 

As society has been working towards greater gender equality, it can be a little confusing that people feel the need to change their gender or live outside the binary. To me this is a clue that gender experience is truly based in biology on some level.

Thanks for replying, I’ve been literally sitting here waiting for someone to weigh in. I’ve read the articles, everything I could find… but none of it put a human face on this whole gender fluid thing. 

When did you first feel like you didn’t fit in the two gender mold? Is it hard for people your age to grasp? Does it continue to change for you? I think my kiddo still likes boys, but will it make it harder for her to find dates? Are people cruel about this whole thing? 

God this is awkward for me. If I’m being offensive, please don’t take it that way. I genuinely want to understand. I won’t allow something like this to spoil my relationship with my kid.
Thanks for your words. My… advantage in all of this is that I won’t be home for a while. I have time to sort things out in my mind. I think the ideal outcome in all of this is for them to see we are taking it in stride and not making it a big deal. Kind of a Schitts Creek approach, if that makes sense.
This is a really awesome resource!  Thanks!
Thanks a lot for telling me about your experience. I’m taking the nickname idea and running with it. 

And by the way, I’m sorry you are having that experience with your parents. Consider yourself virtually hugged.
Thanks so much- I’m having a weird kind of cognitive dissonance. Thank Thor my kiddo isn’t watching me make this all about myself. I’m light years away from any kind of therapy support where I am working, but I’m also not in danger, psychologically, about this. I’m getting everything I need from your patient and thoughtful replies.
I like the simile!
Thanks- I don’t know the rules. Please send me a link for a rule book and I will read it cover to cover!

Honestly though, thanks for telling me that. I consider this the most anonymous way to share my thoughts, and I would rather look like an idiot online and discover errors from people like you than do it where it could hurt my kid.
Thanks for sharing your experiences with me. I want to handle my hang-ups with all this before I come home and allow my kid to just BE.

Not ostracized, not celebrated, just loved as my kid. That’s what I want to provide.
Thanks for the encouragement. I probably make more than the average amount of parenting mistakes, but I recognize a colossal blunder when I see one. I just don’t want to hurt my kid.
Thanks- it would probably make a big impact on them emotionally if I was to send something affirming like that. I’m doing it.
We sound similar.
Thanks for that- I guess a lot of my sadness is associated with the events that may not take place now. And also… people were CRUEL when I was in high school. I can’t protect my kiddo all the time and it devastates me knowing that this is a harder path.
Thanks so much for that. I can’t allow this to be a thing that creates distance between me and my kid. Hearing how you feel helps- I mean that.
Thank you so much for sharing. I mean this for everyone providing inputs here that I’m hanging on every word. I’m just trying to avoid a blunder that all parents make. There are three:

1) Never engage in a land war in Asia

2) Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line

And

3) don’t make this all about myself when it’s my kiddo that needs my support.

Seriously though, the truly interesting thing about all of this is, my kid is going to do what they do. It’s ME that needs time to process this and absorb it. Being away from family for my job sucks big time, but I’m grateful for the space right now. When I get back I’ll be equipped with the tools to handle this appropriately. 

In no small part because of everyone’s feedback on this sub.
Haha! Thanks for that. I guess bass fishing and woodworking brings out the man in all of us.
Maybe I can answer in my own small way, and from a former mil member. Everyone’s experiences are different. I’m 37 now, but I knew I didn’t fit even before middle school. I had no name for it then, and because of those around me, buried it deeply. It’s only been in the last few years, really thanks to people like you kid and other kids who are starting to be true and open, that I’ve been more open. They are inspiring to me. I would say make every effort to use the pronouns they asked for, but if you mess up, do better the next time. The worst thing is to purposely do it just using the I’m old as an excuse.

For relationships, there is someone out there for everyone. Encourage them to be themselves and find people who will support and love them. It’s only different because it’s not what you experienced.

I learned very quickly who would be an ally and who would be hateful. Sadly, people can be jerks. Maybe some self-defense courses, CCW, and tactical courses?
You're doing fine, dad :)

> When did you first feel like you didn’t fit in the two gender mold? 

I remember being 4 years old and my mother had taken me and my siblings to buy new clothes because we'd outgrown our old ones. She was busy with my younger sibling, so when I announced I needed to use the restroom, she decided I was old enough to go on my own. I remember looking up at the two bathroom signs, knowing which one my mother expected me to use, but knowing that neither one was the right place for me.

That doesn't mean I had everything figured out though. I didn't come across the term non-binary until about 3 decades later, and even then it still took me time to recognize that it fit me. We're all works in progress, constantly growing and evolving and learning more about ourselves and the world around us. And just like the clothes I was wearing when I was 4, the labels we use to describe ourselves may not fit us very well after a while, and we may choose something new that fits our new selves better. That doesn't retroactively make us naked or invalidate the utility of the clothing we were using before. All of life is made up of phases, and we're all growing and learning.

> Is it hard for people your age to grasp?

I'm in my fourth decade on this rock, and I think folks my age are around the tipping point where we start to get it. Older than my age group may be accepting but sometimes don't seem to fully understand. Folks younger than me seem to be a lot more comfortable with less strict concepts of gender. I've come out to kids around 5 years old and they don't even blink. Highschoolers are familiar with non-binary identities as almost invariably have a gender-diverse member of their friend group they mention.

> Does it continue to change for you? 

Every day!

> I think my kiddo still likes boys, but will it make it harder for her to find dates?

It may decrease the potential dating pool, but that just goes ahead and eliminates a bunch of people who would only see them for their body, so I'd actually consider it a win. There are a lot of people out there, of all genders, who are willing to date people as a whole person rather than life support systems for genitals. And just like with societies understanding of diverse genders, I'd say we're on the same track to a less strict more accepting understanding of orientation at the same time. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/r9ja6g/would_you_care_to_explain_the_terms_nonbinary/hnc8ksw/) a recent comment I made about orientation labels if that helps.

> Are people cruel about this whole thing?

Some people are, there's no denying. But sentiment in the US at least is trending in favor of being supportive of trans folks. [Here's data](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/public-opinion-trans-rights-us/) from a few years ago saying that 73% of US folks think transgender people deserve legal protection against discrimination. But just like there are still racists out there, there are transphobic and enbyphobic people out there too; people who object to someone living their truth and being happy with who they are, and aren't afraid to tell them so in the meanest way they can think of. But hate isn't as widespread as they'd have you believe, and love continues to displace it.

> God this is awkward for me. If I’m being offensive, please don’t take it that way.

Not at all! Genuine questions are always welcome here :) and we'll nudge you in the right direction should you accidentally stray into offense. Not to worry.
I’m an adult (35) non-binary person, who knew at a very young age (3-5) that I didn’t feel like a boy or a girl. Back then, no one understood being trans, let alone non-binary, so I just thought I was weird or broken. 

I tried so hard to suppress who I was, until I finally came out when I was in my mid 20s. My parents were very disappointed and hurt at first, and refused to call me by my true name and pronouns (they/them). 

After a while—with them (and my ‘friends’ at the time) continuing to use my birth name, he/him pronouns, pressuring me to be more masculine, and guilt tripping me about who I was, I decided to take my own life. I couldn’t deal going back into the closet and living a lie again, but also couldn’t take the constant rejection of my deepest identity by those closest to me. So I saw suicide as the only way out. 

I fortunately survived my attempt, and made some positive life changes afterward. I stopped talking to family and those phobic friends, and worked on myself. Eventually, my mom came around to accept me for who I am, and today she’s one of my biggest supporters. 

Still, I bear the scars from my deeply conservative, religious upbringing—where gender roles were set in stone—and the insecurities I gained from this will never really heal.

You also said you needed to see a human face of being non-binary, and, well, I’m pretty human. My name is Hayven. I work in statistical analysis, love outdoor adventures, and go all out decorating for the Christmas season (my house is covered with blue lights, wreaths, garlands, etc.!). I have a partner who loves me, and two kitty cats (Oliver and Copper) whom I adore. I’ve traveled to every continent except Antarctica, and speak 11 languages. 

I hope telling a bit about myself helped you understand that non-binary people are still *people*, and can still live fulfilling lives. 

Thanks for coming here to ask how to support your child, and how to be supportive to them. I wish my dad had done this when I came out, instead of calling me a shame to the family and an abomination. 

All the best to you! :)
I’m 35 and genderfluid.  I was assigned female at birth.  I’ve felt like I didn’t fit in with either gender since I was little.  I fit in better with boys than girls, but still not 100% either way.  As for dating, I’m bisexual and autistic and have never had problems finding dates.  I’ve been happily married for 10 years and have two beautiful children.  My husband is super supportive and sweet.  There are a lot of people my age who don’t understand, but I’m fortunate to have good friends who do and a family who is trying to.  I live in a very conservative area, so I do face some cruelty.  Having my wonderful friends and family around me helps me to handle that cruelty, though, and overall my life is a happy one 😊
That’s awesome man :) I love that, yeah, just treat ‘em normal. Best of luck to you!!! :)
Hey man, imo you're not making this situation all about you-- you're finding a place away from the person who would be hurt by any dissonance or upset you're having, considering their feelings while dealing with your own, and letting yourself have a minute to address being sad (while seeking out advice and resources, no less)! This is one of the most mature and least selfish ways I've personally seen a parent handle this. I'm glad the subreddit has been so helpful! And I'm glad you came here for advice in the first place. 

I remember being a kid in the early 2000s and how aggressively homophobic and transphobic everything was. While there's still a lot of work to be done we're making steps towards a better future and things are yards better than they were. I think your kid is going to be okay, especially with a dad like you in their corner.
Your doing a great job as is! More than my family tried
It's a struggle, and I still really don't understand a lot about it. But in the end, I don't have to. They tell me what they would prefer to be called, and I call them that.
I feel the exact same way. My kiddo is still in middle school (and middle school is also brutal) and already didn’t feel like they fit in and this definitely doesn’t help with that. We’re hoping that we can find some LGBT clubs in the school or community when covid isn’t such a problem to try and find a good tribe for them.
LOL @ Princess Bride references! Truly words to live by (or die by, as I think of Napoleon lol). 

I really like your approach and awareness of change being on your side too :-) and having the space and time to work through that is definitely a “plus” :-) Best to you & your family!
This comment made my day. It just radiates a peace that comes with accepting who you are, and a clarity of thought (that comes from continuously reevaluating what is generally believed about being human?). Or am I reading to much into this?? Either way, loved your comment!
Thanks Hayven- I’m chewing on all of the many responses and yours is helping me too. Isn’t it crazy how, even though we’ve spent more years out of our parents house than IN, that those years seem to have the biggest impact? 

I’m sorry you went through what you did. I’m glad you are still around.
Thanks! I'm just a person doing the best I can :) I'm glad you found value in what I wrote."	rafso8	NonBinary	162	0.99	2021-12-06 19:42:49
I (26MTF) accidentally misgendered my nonbinary partner -- how do I make sure it never happens again?	"Throwaway in case my partner somehow sees this. 

My lovely partner and I have been dating since October and it's been a dream. We are so great together in so many ways, we're nerdy and bookish and have the same sense of humor, etc. I have thought for at least a couple months ""I could spend my life with this person,"" and I think they feel the same way. They said they loved me (first time anyone has ever said that to me) a month ago and I cried-- now we say it all the time. 

This relationship is also the closest I've ever been to a nonbinary person, and I've always had some (impermissible, ofc) difficulties with using they/them. Like, I had two nonbinary friends (one is now a trans man) and I would get their pronouns right 95% of the time but the other 5% I'd screw up and correct myself and move on. I knew this going in but thought ""hey, it's different with X because I've always known them as nonbinary"" and for the first five months it was. but yesterday when they were having Easter brunch with my family, my family was screwing up their pronouns off and on, and I'd correct them. I guess that got into my head a little, because when we got back to my mom's house and they were in the other room, I told my mom ""Thank you so much for inviting her--shit, them."" I was fighting back tears in the car on the way to the train station because of what happened. They asked me what was wrong and I told them and apologized. They said they heard and were sad about it but they accepted my apology. 

I cried a lot. I told them they need to believe that I see them as nonbinary and not a woman, because if they have any doubts about that, they shouldn't be with me, and should be with someone who they can be absolutely certain sees and loves them for who they are. I know I'd never want to be with someone I thought there was any chance saw me as anything other than a woman. Now I'm worried I broke the glass and they'll never truly trust that I see them for who they are.

 I would like to hear from others about how you healed from this (or if you didn't, what caused it to create a rift). I also want to hear from cis partners how you got to be perfect with respect to your trans partner's pronouns, because that's the only thing acceptable to me going forward. I love them so much and I can t bear the thought of hurting them again."	"Misgendering could happen and it's not something that lead to the end of a solid relationship.

It's one thing to misgender every now and then out of a mistake. It could happen.

It's another thing to misgender out of the lack of respect, because you don't respect people perspectives, feeling and lifes.


We're humans and it's ok to make mistakes without malice. If there is love and you show them by your actions, day by day, a single mystake it's not the end of the world. 

My partner misgenders me every now and then, but i love her anyway and i don't see this as something she does like out of malice.
I think you're overdoing it. Slipping on pronouns happens. As you said, your family was having trouble, so it was in your head.

It's at least partly linguistic, I think, too. English doesn't have a universally accepted non-gendered third person pronoun, so if you don't grow up reading and hearing they/them used as a singular pronoun much, it's not as firmly in your vocabulary. It takes practice. You didn't deliberately misgender them, or habitually do so.

And, gently, don't make a grand dramatic show about your massive guilt. That's exhausting.
>I cried a lot. I told them they need to believe that I see them as nonbinary and not a woman, because if they have any doubts about that, they shouldn't be with me, and should be with someone who they can be absolutely certain sees and loves them for who they are.

This is making it about you, which makes them have to comfort you for your mistake. Just work on not doing it again and try not to make a huge deal out of things if you do. Practice in front of a mirror at home. Write letters to your partner using their pronouns
Honestly it sounds like you were just around people who couldn't get it right, which in turn makes it harder to comprehend for yourself. If there was a cat but everyone around kept calling them a dog, you'd probably at least once slip up and call the cat a dog. It's not about what you believe at that point- it's just the confusion of people around you not being able to get it. 

My ex once got my pronouns wrong after being around my family- but the response to my correction was ""I forgot"" and that was hurtful. Instead it's better to say something short like ""I got confused because people around us keep getting it wrong, I'm sorry. I will look into ways for myself to prevent slip-ups like this in the future.""


That's it. That's all you can say- anything more unprompted and it's overexplaining/overcompensating. You know that you didn't mean it, you made it clear in the simple apology, and you stated that you're going to work to be better, and so everything that needed to be communicated was already said from that simple two-line apology.

The other commenter was correct in saying that too much of an apology makes it no longer about the other person. It can be hard to admit, but if they accepted your apology right away [and even if they didn't immediately accept it but they acknowledged it], then anything more is centering it on you.

Here, to make it easier to understand what I mean by that an example:

-

I broke your favorite cup by accident. 

apology 1:
""I'm sorry, I know that cup meant a lot to you, and I was careless when handling it. Next time I will be more careful with your dishes.""

apology 2: 
""Sorry, but I think you should keep your dishes closer to the table.""

apology 3:
""Oh my gosh I am soooo sorry. That plate was your favorite and I broke it and I feel so bad for breaking it, please forgive me! I will never touch your plates again because I'm so clumsy and I can't be trusted anymore and I need to use plastic dishes for the rest of my life! I'm so sorry.""

-

Which one felt the most sincere? 

Most people would say apology 1. It's simple and straight to the point. Not long-winded, and it doesn't use ""but.""

Apology 1 offers a reason, an apology, and a way to move forward. That's what you need for apologies to sound sincere.

Can you see how apology 3 kinda feels like it's not about the plate or you anymore, but about how I feel bad about it? It sounds like you're starting to do this, which doesn't feel good.

Other than that, ways to prevent future confusion/misgendering would be, in this case, getting used to using a different word for certain things regardless of what people around you call it. Something like deciding to use the word ""image"" even when everyone calls it ""picture"" or ""pic"" is a way to just practice keeping the things you know to be true to be the things that will come out of your mouth.

Specifically with misgendering, you can work through things that you might internally be thinking incorrectly due to society/those around you. This might look like relating your partner to women [could be men, too, but I'm using women as an example] characters a lot of the time, even when other things are not present that remind you of them- like if you put them in the role of women characters in tv, movies, and books, even when they have nothing in common with the woman character.

And yes, misgendering hurts, but it hurts way more when you're intentionally misgendering. Unintentional, accidental misgendering is similar to using the word ""disintegrate"" when you meant ""disassociate"" because it is misspeaking, not believing that the incorrect word was right. I don't get upset if someone doesn't know the word ""disassociating"" and goes through this big ""wait no, disassembling, I mean disintegrating, no I mean that thing where you aren't in touch with your body- dissasocociating,"" but I might get upset if someone is telling me ""The word for that is disintegrating. You're wrong, it's disintegrating,"" even when they're told the right word.

All in all, misgendering happens to the best of us and we do it to ourselves/each other and it hurts, but the best way to move forward is finding ways to make it easier in the future and moving on swiftly. Hope this helps.
There's no such thing as perfect. That's literally not a thing. Your partner understands that I'm sure. And the sooner you do too the easier it will be for you. Like the more you focus on...omg I might misgender them, the more you're gonna misgender them, because it's gonna be constantly on your mind.
your biggest mistake was crying about this and making it about you. from a non-binary person- just correct yourself, apologize quickly, and move on.
So, similar situation here. Both my sibling and I are nonbinary. We're not out to the majority of the family yet, so we kind of ""code switch"" and use our agab pronouns when we're around family. We use the correct pronouns for each other any other time, and it honestly feels weird when we use our agab pronouns. However, the only time slip-ups seem to happen for us is right after a family event when both we and the people around us have been using incorrect pronouns. It is very likely possible that the people around you repeatedly saying ""she"" got into your head and accidentally caused you to slip. When this happens, we simply say ""sorry"" and then correct ourselves. This doesn't mean you don't see them as they are. It seems like it was environmental. No need to overly apologize, as that not only draws the attention to you, but it drags the whole situation out even longer.
Oh sweet child of summer. 


You will make the mistake again. And that's okay. 
When you use the wrong pronoun, if you realize in the moment. Stop, apologize, correct, move on. Dont make it a big thing. Just keep on pushing. 


If they want to talk about it let them lead the conversation. If they don't but you have big feelings. Find a binary gender person to talk about that with. 

And most importantly. Stop going for perfection. Strive for improvment.
My partner accidentally misgenders me sometimes too. I accidentally misgender them sometimes as well. We immediately correct ourselves and move on with the conversation. It happens. I don't honestly see this as a super big deal?
I can't speak for your partner, but it's probably not as big of a deal as you're making it. Unfortunately, non-binary folks get misgendered pretty often. It's almost never intentional or malicious and (at least in my case) it's relatively easy to tune out. Sometimes mistakes happen. My partner still misgenders me accidentally sometimes and I know she usually feels worse than I do about it. It's when someone starts making a big deal about it that it becomes uncomfortable.
Just apolgize and move on, it's more annoying when ppl constantly correct themselves to appear contrite. We can tell ur not doing it malicously and we know ppl screw up pornouns
Your feelings actually moved me. I guess all people are different and nonbinary people are different from each other too.  


>they need to believe that I see them as nonbinary and not a woman, because if they have any doubts about that, they shouldn't be with me, and should be with someone who they can be absolutely certain sees and loves them for who they are

Gosh I wish someone close to me said that when they got my pronouns wrong. Felt validating to read. 

I don't think your response was necessarily inappropriate. You are a trans person and know how much it hurts for other to not see who you are and not use the right pronouns. Your family was screwing with the pronouns, that will stress me out for sure (I'm neurodivergent and gatherings of people already stress me out. Also people not using my pronouns stresses me out and it hurts).

I understand you where emotional. I hope your partner understand too. I say believe what they said, that they accept your apology. Don't beat yourself.

Sometimes when I'm stressed and people keep using other pronouns I screw up my own pronouns (It doesn't happen often but when it does I hate it, cause what the hell I'm I doing missgendering myself?!?). I understand it was a mistake, your partner understands too.

It could be a nice opportunity to bond with your partner if you ask them what they think about how you acted in that situation and what could you do different if ever happens again. Maybe wait for your feelings to settle down first, so you can both focus on your partners feelings more this time :) I hope this helps!
People often misgender themselves by accident when exposed to environments where the pronouns get twisted up. I’d really think about why this hits me so intensely if I were you.

This isn’t to say misgendering is okay, but people have to be allowed to make mistakes without it being a one-hit KO for the relationship.
Yeh this really isn’t that big a deal. Its only when its regular that it’s a problem. 

Great example: before my egg cracked I also had some issue with getting the right pronouns with my partner. After about 2 months it was super easy. But, I have a fun speech disorder that makes it difficult to use words sometimes and my coping mechanism from childhood is to find the fastest words so I don’t stop a sentence dead. Mistakes will happen regularly because of it. It’s not a big deal unless it is made into one.

The bigger issue (and is also a solid “you problem” to solve) is honestly why are you hardcore flipping out like this. As a long term trauma survivor, this should be explored (preferably with professionals). You’ll probably learn more about yourself and maybe ease your partner’s mind as a side benefit.
when you two aren't around, repeat their pronouns in your head with a mental image of them  


it worked for me when I was starting to question things
This will always happen from time to time and will happen again in the future. Even people who have their correct pronouns 20yrs ago can slip and and misgender themselves. 

The human brain is a weird thing. 

The overwhelming advice I’ve read online is quickly apologize and correct yourself then move on. Making too big a deal out of it actually shines a spotlight on the issue and can make the other person more uncomfortable. 

I know you said it personally upsets you a lot when the wrong pronouns is used. But not everyone has that same reaction. You might be transferring your own feelings onto your partner. 

You do sound very sensitive like myself and it’s taken me a lot of time to figure out how differently other people operate and to try to not get worked up worrying about it. 

This might actually be more about soothing your own anxiety and relationship panic. If your partner has accepted your apology and has moved on there is no need to revisit.  Rehashing this it might actually make things worse. 

If you feel like you have an insecure psychological attachment style and are very sensitive (again this describes me 100%) it might actually be those false alarm bells going off in your head. And trying to resolve them with your partner may actually be unnecessary. It might actually just be your own internal feelings you need to soothe. 

If any of this rings a bell with you. Working on these things and your reaction will also make you a much better partner because it will help you feel more confident and loving. So you can focus on your partner more without having these whirlwind of emotions and constant fear or anxiety that someone might leave you if you do something wrong. 

I might have misunderstood your feelings and perspective so if I’m off base you can just ignore me.  And I apologize if I misunderstood you. A lot of what I wrote in the post describes me. I just saw in your comments a lot of similar things I’ve also experienced so I figured there may be some overlap between us. Hope some of this helps! 💜🌈. You’re doing ok!  Everything will be ok!
It seems to me like you worry more than I think is reasonable. It's a bit endearing that you're so dedicated to not hurt your partner, but most of all I think you should consider why you are still having such a strong reaction when your partner said they accepted your apology.

Because, listen, most of us enbies slip up every now and then as well, because gendered language is so deeply rooted in us and it's everywhere around us, and it's hard to break free of such concepts. We know it happens, and it hurts, but we also know that it doesn't automatically mean someone sees us as that gender. In the end, what truly matters is how a person reacts when they make a mistake. You did exactly what most enby people would consider the right thing to do, you corrected yourself, apologized, and now you're doing your best to make sure it doesn't happen again.

But you seem to have not accepted that your partner has accepted your apology? Do you not trust that they have truly forgiven you? And if so, why? Do you have some internalized transphobia that you're scared of facing? Do you have a history of rejection and you're just waiting for your partner to find any reason to break up with you? Has your partner been dishonest at some point and you haven't sorted it out properly?

I think you need to reflect upon why you're reacting like this, and then try to talk it out with your partner so they know what's going on.
We live in a society where everything and everyone is constantly divided into gender binary boxes - a society where its even viewed as impolite to many, to not treat them as female/male based on their gender expression. That’s very unfortunate for gnc/enby people, because “passing” as female/male will make people address/view you as such.

So I’m not surprised or upset with the person if I’m misgendered by them every once in a full moon (especially if they’re someone who genuinely tries to use they/them most of the time + correct others). Everyone messes up sometimes - especially when they’re around other people who misgender people consistently. 
That being said, such a strong reaction/emotional outburst would make me feel extremely uncomfortable. I’d never expect anyone to never mess up they/them pronouns - but I would be extremely upset by a reaction other than saying whoops/sorry, and just quickly correcting themselves when they notice. 

You might want to talk to your partner about what reaction they’d like you to have (like, should you just say sorry and move on). I don’t think any of you should expect it to never happen again. That’s in my opinion unrealistic (especially when you’re around people who misgender your partner), but of course it’s fair that it’s upsetting to you and your partner. :)
Probably not the first time being misgendered. You did your part and apologized. Seems like you genuinely are working on it. No worries. A real relationship will transcend a pronoun slip.
just say “i’m sorry” and move on. it wasn’t intentional.
you’re centering yourself in this, and this isn’t about you. your partner appreciates you always trying but you need to realize that crying and putting yourself makes them feel even more uncomfortable. 

listen, i misgender *myself* sometimes. it happens. you correct yourself, apologize, (with a short sorry) and move on.

(edited to remove “dude” from a sentence as i mistakenly read “FTM” instead of “MTF” originally)
Just continue correcting yourself when you get it wrong. And... dont make a huge deal of it next time. Your partner shouldnt be feeling the need to reassure *you* when you misgender them. 

Its honestly not as big a deal as you seem to think. 

People will absolutely default (even accidentally) to words used by others in the group. If everyone was misgendering them, its not a wild thought that youd use that pronoun too. Not an excuse, but its understandable. If you dont see them as a woman, thats all you need.
Sending love 💕. We need to have grace with each other. The world is already against us, let’s not do the same with our own community. Expecting perfection is unrealistic when we live in a racist capitalist transphobic heteropatriarchy. It is the air we breathe. 

We need to stop participating in the same kind of witch hunts that oppress us. Embrace radical forgiveness, for your own peace. 

Healing for me is coming to terms with everything life will throw at you, good or bad, and choosing to build the utopia we all want to live in. We need to stop thinking in absolutes and binaries—no one is all inherently all good or all bad. The capacity for love and evil exists in all of us and we are complicated humans, all too human. We are all people in process. Learn to forgive yourself and forgive others. Mistakes help people learn—if you forgive and focus not on whether someone is “good or bad” and instead focus on righting the specific wrong, you can help others act in better ways. We all need help and have had help, we are not islands born into absolute goodness. 
This is not to say that people shouldn’t take responsibility for messing up, just that when they do, what we can control is helping them not mess up again or making sure we don’t make the same choices. You aren’t a bad person for a momentary mistake. Learn to trust and rebuild trust and give yourself and others the space to do the same. Forgiveness is the way to end suffering. It is not simply absolving the evil and moving on, it means doing the work with others and recommitting them and you to be better. It is a commitment to our shared humanity and a commitment to bringing about our shared goodness. That is what is important. We have too little time in this world to be trapped in hate. Love deeply. love love love 💕💕
My wife has slipped up a couple times for me and I’ve gotten some language wrong for her. We apologize and move on. Brains are weird and get tired/stressed then make mistakes, it’s normal and ok to move on from. Love transcends bloopers!
Sometimes mistakes happen. If you set the bar at ""I must ABSOLUTELY NEVER mess up again"" then you *will inevitably fail,* and you'll feel like a colossal failure when you do.

Instead, understand that you are human and shit happens. When you mess up, immediately correct yourself and _move on_. Do not make it about how upset you are that you messed up, don't make them have to stop and comfort or reassure you. 

Just make the correction and move on like normal.
I've been with my bf for 2 years now. He has misgendered me a handful of times on accident. I still wanna spend the rest of our lives together. It sucks but just try harder. Just talk to them.
I don’t think it is realistic to come from such a place of severity. We have been taught to recognize “boy or girl” since infancy. Our brain wants to make those connections. Breaking the binary is working on changing that. I have occasionally misgendered afab friend who dress more feminine because my brain is filling in the blanks. My partner occasionally misgenders me. I occasionally misgender myself. I also occasionally call my pets by the others names, or make other silly mistakes. Today on the phone I meant to say “she was talking to her friend about you.” And instead I said “she was talking to you.”

We are humans trying to rewire our brains. Slip ups will happen. Just apologize and correct yourself, the. practice correcting yourself in private. Making it into a huge ordeal just piles onto an uncomfortable moment. Treat it like a “whoopsie! Silly brain!” And not a malicious attack on your partners identity. If it is an accident and you correct yourself, it’s fine.
I'm enby and my wife has very occasionally made this kind of mistake, and it in no way changed my mind about wanting to marry her.  It's not a big deal for me. I know she gets me and truly doesn't see me as a gender.  I know she corrects people endlessly on my behalf.  I know she gets me affirming gifts like clothes/accessories that don't match my AGAB, to cheer me up when I need it. As it happens she also has an enby godchild and I know how much thought she puts into their Christmas and birthday presents to make sure there is a range of differently gendered and non-gendered items.  Basically, I know from her actions towards me and towards other people that she takes my identity seriously and sees me as myself.  That is a big deal.

Full disclosure I also occasionally make this kind of mistake about myself.  Like I'll be saying what someone thought of me and I'll accidentally put the wrong pronoun into their mouth.  Life goes on.
I think if it happens rarely, the pain will pass and it will be forgiven. I've accidentally misgendered non-binary friends I've known for years and only as non-binary, and I'm non-binary and use they/them pronouns exclusively myself. We all slip up sometimes and making sure it happens as rarely as possible is the best we can do.

Remember that we all grew up in a society that, at the very best, ignores the existence of they/them pronouns as personal pronouns, with more and more places actively excluding them. even if you learn about they/them pronouns as personal pronouns when you're relatively young, you are still bombarded with the idea that he/him and she/her are the only ones that exist and it's really hard to completely unlearn that since it's everywhere. 

Maybe in a few days, once it's less fresh, ask them how they want you to handle slip ups when they happen, but really, don't be too hard on yourself and do whatever it is you usually do to show them you love them and value them
The whole freaking out and crying while over apologizing: don't do that. 100% made the situation insanely uncomfortable for them because you made a huge deal out of something that they probably wouldn't have put much more thought into had you just left it at ""I'm sorry.""

I understand there are circumstances that may have caused you to react that way, but you NEED to recognize it's not healthy for either of you and learn how to identify when you're starting to do something like this (if its a common occurrence) and learn what helps stop the reaction in it's tracks. I know it's easier said than done, but it's worth the effort. Over apologizing can be just as bad as not doing it at all, imo.

Edit: wanna clarify I don't mean for this to come off aggressively or rude at all btw, I'm just trying to be direct.
Chile I promise accidents happens — I’m nb and I’ve accidentally misgendered my friends and MYSELF and while rare, I just correct and apologize. You’re only human.
I mean I have misgendered cis people before. It just happens. Same as calling your teacher mum as a kid.
My stepfather misgendered my one year old baby earlier 😂 It can happen, people mix up words all the time. I think it’s better to quickly move on after apologizing and/or appreciating a correction, otherwise the groveling can feel like a burden to respond to.
It sounds like you misspoke, rather than misgendered in this situation. When people are talking quickly or if they are flustered, they sometimes say a word different they mean.

I would be very surprised if you don’t accidentally say a different pronoun than you mean for a cis person at least once a week. I know I do. But then I do what you probably should have done here, correct myself, move on, and basically forget about it. 

Other people have said this, but I think they are right. The thing you are doing that is probably hurting your partner the most is making a big thing of this.
I misgender and deadname \*myself\* sometimes.  I also get mixed up and call my cat by the name of my pet chickens and visa versa.  Words get jumbled up every now and then.  It happens.
I think maybe? In your shoes I’d conclude I’m mixing a lot of feels from other things into this.

Anxiety about not screwing up my first BIG relationship (and awww it was cute how you described it)

The embarrassment and stress of family loved ones accidentally or thoughtlessly misgendering my person that I brought into that family space, and who may not self advocate as strongly for themselves out of a desire to not create waves. 

And you are thinking that you want it all to go perfect cause you’re now thinking longer term potential with your partner, and part of that is how well family meshes with them.

I know that I take (sometimes excessive) ownership when my family has not done right by my spouse, and sometimes it can feel like their rudeness is on me too…

And then the final nail, it was on your mind so much that you accidentally did it too. 

And the guilt of that one word, plus the likely stress and anxiety of those unfortunate mis genders by your family, anxieties about not effing up, etc likely pulled it all into this bigger thing.

But in the end? Right now you’re putting so much more pressure on this one word than it deserves, and it’s not fair to you or your partner, specially since I am sure it’s not even the core of why you have such big feels. Maybe write out a letter to yourself, explore where these feelings may be coming from?

I hope this helps
I’m (he/they) also dating a nonbinary person (they/them) It’s perfectly okay to make mistakes as long as you correct them and move on. 

We don’t get to consciously choose every single word that comes out of our mouths. If we did, we wouldn’t misgender anyone.

Did you know that some nonbinary people will occasionally accidentally misgender themselves? That doesn’t make them any less nonbinary. It just proves how hard habits are to break and how common slips of the tongue are. 

I would try hesitating before you speak about your partner, taking an extra fraction of a second to double check which pronoun you’re about to use?

Remember how Buggs Bunny and Daffy Duck argue over whether it’s duck season or rabbit season? They go back and forth shouting “duck season!” and “Rabbit season!” so fast that Buggs is able to trick Daffy into saying “Duck Season!” That wouldn’t have worked if Daffy had been speaking more slowly, going over what he was about to say before he said it.

If it happens again, it’s not anything to beat yourself up over. That doesn’t do anything but draw more attention to the mistake. For your own sake and your partner’s, just apologize, then forgive yourself and move on. That’ll give them a chance to forget/bury it.

Best of luck with you and your partner!!
I mean, we’re all socialized into the same system that assumes a binary, and none of us is to blame for being raised and socialized in that system. I misgender myself periodically, because I used a particular set of pronouns for 38 years before having the understanding and self-connection to figure myself out. I think that it happens, because we’re human. My wife slips up from time to time, so do my kids, so doI. 

When somebody does, we correct ourselves and quickly move on. We don’t belabour the apology or let it bog us down either. Humans slip up. I know that my wife sees me, knows me, and doesn’t expect perfection from me. I similarly recognize the humanity in her and don’t expect perfection in her either.

We’re all navigating this language shift in a colonial culture that has worked very hard to suppress gender diversity for hundreds of years. We aren’t going to be perfect about it. Although impact matters more than intention, intention still matters, particularly with those you know, trust, and love.
If it happens correct yourself and move on. Slip ups happen and don't make you a bad person as long as you are genuinely putting effort in it (which it sounds like you do).
In regards to your question, I'm not sure if there is a 100% solution to NEVER messing up their pronouns again. You said for 5 months that you didn't mess up once, that's great!! As someone who has trans & queer friends who often mess up my pronouns (they/them) I understand that it can happen. I'm sure your partner will understand and forgive you. ALTHOUGH! I will say that if you dwell on this event and are absolutely terrified it'll happen again, I'm sure that anxiety will make slips happen more. Just try to forgive yourself for the mistake, as it sounds like your partner already has, and try to move on! Don't be too hard on yourself if it happens again, it'll likely disappear with more and more time :)
Been there. I am cis, my partner is nb, and once my phone autocompleted a verb to a feminine form when I addressed them. This felt like a betrayal since we have a strong, trusting connection and both are from a severely homophobic, anti-trans country. I imagined they would always have this thought at the back of their mind that I internally misgender them — but guess what, they don’t think that. As time goes by, your partner will gain more and more undeniable proof of how you truly see them. You can’t keep up a lie when you’re constantly around someone. If you’d thought of them as a woman, they would have seen tons of red flags by now. Plus, it’s only human to screw up. You grew up in a binary-centered culture, and sometimes you say things you don’t mean. Just focus on doing better and don’t beat yourself up over it.
This right here, this is basically what I say to people who apologise after a mistake, mistakes happen it's not easy vernacular to people growing up at the moment, my wife of 12 years does too occasionally. The problem is when people do it out of spite, and you can generally tell those ones -_-
Honestly, I don't think it's op ""making it"" about herself as much as her actually having issues within herself. I mean it could be just anxiety because she cares about the relationship, but there's definitely a reason why she is reacting so strongly.
Yeah I also feel bad because I was the one who caused the harm but I was far more upset than they were (at least externally). And they were reassuring me, etc.

I disagree that its not that big a deal though. Like I'm trans myself. I know it would be brutal if they called me a guy accidentally. Even if I knew they didn't mean it.
this is an incredible and thoughtful reply.
Also, just to add, it’s worth noting that being a enby/gnc afab/FTX there’s also this extra risk of your identity being invalidated. Or being viewed as woman-lite. There’s a lot of prejudice that way (for everyone, just in different ways). Like when an Amab person wears  a skirt or nail polish or eyeshadow, they’re pegged as queer/gnc - that’s really upsetting if you’re an amab person who just wants to express yourself as a cis man. On the other hand, it’s really difficult as an afab to be viewed as gnc, other than maybe shaving your head.
Yeah, there is a reason, I'm not arguing with that. But bc of her issues within herself, the situation has shifted to being about how SHE feels about it, which isn't the goal
I am also trans/nonbinary. My girlfriend has accidentally misgendered me before. She apologized and moved on and it's fine.

Yeah when you make it all about how bad you feel for making a mistake it can make the person you wronged feel much worse since they now have to comfort you
One thing that stuck with me was ""The apology doesn't need to be longer than the mistake""  


And truly, Philosophical analysis of guilt and shame lead us to the recognition that:  
""Feeling guilty about something is too console one's own wounded ego, so as to avoid doing something more tangible about it.

Your intention was not to dehumanize them. That you simply acknowledge, and endeavor to do better, is enough.   


Life is short. Intrusive thoughts like these bubble up. When they do, ask yourself ""have I put in place action or plans for action when it comes time?"" and if so, you've done what you can do. Let that intrusive thought float away. That is not internal dialogue, it's just anxiety. Anxiety, like being flawed, is a human experience. 🫶
Everyone is different, but not all nonbinary people experience misgendering as having the same “sting” as it does for binary trans people. This is because it’s so incredibly common and because they/them pronouns are unfamiliar to a lot of people. I don’t know about your partner, but if it seems like they didn’t take it as hard as you would, that could be the reason
I don't mean to sound harsh, but I think you are projecting here. As a binary trans person, misgendering probably stings a lot more - if someone were to call you a guy, it would be awful. As an enby who prefers they/them, I personally accept any/all because I'm both not really either gender, but also all of them, and if someone refers to me in a binary way, it's more like a small prick on the skin that goes away within seconds - not a big deal

also, trans people misgender too. I have misgendered other trans people by accident (always apologize sincerely) and I've even ""misgendered"" myself! It happens and it's not the end of the world

you don't have to answer this: have you had a lot of experience with people misgendering and/or deadnaming you? Because if yes, you may be projecting your own trauma onto your mistake. And no, bottling it up is not the answer - talk to your partner and explain why it made you feel the way it did. You don't want to make it about yourself, but also an explanation for the, honestly, over-the-top reaction may do good
Maybe I'm just different from a lot of people in this sub, but to me the situation doesn't shift just because she's talking about how she feels. Rather, when someone talks about how they are feeling when they have hurt me, that makes it easier for me to take them seriously, to understand the situation and how to help them understand how they can do better in the future.

Of course there's a limit, like if OP had accused her partner of making her feel bad by requesting that she uses they/them pronouns, or if she had said something like ""how do you think that makes me feel?"" so that it would be more about OP feeling hurt than OP's feelings regarding having hurt her partner. And I suppose there are situations that are somewhere in a grey area. But I don't think talking about how you feel automatically makes it about yourself.

But that's just my experience. If most people feel like you do, it's more likely that OP's partner is feeling similarly. OP may have to talk with her partner about her reaction at some point though, depending on what's going on, but then it will be a new conversation, and I suppose that's a good thing so they can talk about that separately and after the apology.
I feel like I owe them a big apology because what I did was so bad. Idk if I would be ok with someone misgendering me and just being like ""oh, sorry, wont happen again! What do you want from Starbucks?""
As u/TheDreamingKind pointed out with a wonderful example, a huge apology makes it about yourself and centers your feelings. Honestly I would feel worse about this big giant apology than a quick ""sorry, I slipped up""
but would you be okay with them sobbing a lot and suggesting you dump them because of it? would you be okay with having to comfort them when *you'd* be the one hurt? what would make this right for you, if someone you loved misgendered you (during a day when their family repeatedly misgendered you too!)?
Honestly I think you're holding everyone to too high a standard. You called mixing up the pronouns of two newer friends ""inexcusable."" People make mistakes. I've misgendered myself more than once. My mom has called my sister by the dogs name and me by my sister's. She doesn't think my sister is a dog and I'm my sister, she just made a small mistake.


 You're taking a small mistake you made (not even in front of your significant other) and turning it into a massive drama that revolves all around you and your feelings. You're saying ""I won't accept how the person I wronged wants to move forward because I would handle it this way."" Thats way more insensitive than a slip up. 


Also I don't speak for all trans people any more than you do but I've never met one in real life that didn't strongly prefer someone just say ""Oh, sorry, I meant they/he/she"" and move on.
From what I can see, you are talking about what you feel and what others feel, but have you asked your partner what they feel? If no, why not ask? Again, it doesn't need to be super dramatic, just ""I was wondering how you want me to handle it when I screw up and use the wrong pronouns. I feel really bad, but I also don't want to make you uncomfortable.""
I think taking a bit extra care to make sure you show them love in ways that you know they appreciate (and not bringing up your mistake) and value them for who they are will be much more appreciated than a huge apology. 

From my experience as someone who uses they/them pronouns, a big apology is exhausting and I really just want to see that person take care to not misgender me again and show me that they care about me
I know that’s how you feel, but you have to de-center how you feel for their sake. The most selfless thing you can do is this:

When your conscience screams at you to make a big apology, trust that your partner knows what’s best for themself even better than your own conscience does. Sometimes you have to ignore your intuition and conscience when the evidence speaks against it. Bury your feelings, move on, and talk to a therapist or trusted friend about them later.

Better yet, FORGIVE YOURSELF!!! it’ll mean you don’t have to bury anything. Tell yourself over and over “I’m okay. It was an honest mistake. I’m okay.” And hopefully you’ll eventually believe it after repeating it a bunch
yep. I've fully misgendered my cis friends, brothers, sister, mom, dad, pretty much everyone I'm close with at least once. languages are hard and sometimes you just say the wrong word, it doesn't have to be a big deal."	12hkg9w	NonBinary	155	0.91	2023-04-10 14:28:13
Steven Universe's constant inclusion of nb people makes me so happy	"https://imgur.com/a/bBjvVCY

Steven Universe was quite possibly the biggest component in my journey to self-acceptance. I cannot begin to express my appreciation for this show. And as someone who still fights so much with themself over their gender, it's little things like this that make me so much happier, and truly believe that I'm alright. An openly and explicitly non binary/intersex character within the actual show, this moment from the comics, and another moment in the comics where said nb/intersex character has a meltdown while on a date because they think they're lying about their gender to the date (disguised, because it's a children's comic, and sadly we just haven't come that far yet, but you can obviously tell what they're implying with gender), and a shit-ton more queer inclusion within the show and comics. If you told me a few years ago that a cartoon would genuinely changed my life, I would've laughed. But now I fully understand why this show means so much to so many people. I only wish more struggling queer kids could have a show (or anything else) like this to impact them so positively. This is the first time I've ever wanted to genuinely thank someone for the thing they've created, and hope to one day meet the creator to do just that.

Thanks for reading this silly post about a dumb cartoon. Just needed to talk about it :>"	"It really is a great show! I would've loved to have something half as inclusive growing up, I'm so glad kids today have stuff like it.
There are some really great quotes from Rebecca Sugar regarding queer representation in kids' shows in various interviews, and they're 100% the reason I've come to support her and her creative output so fiercely. Shows like SU normalized queer identities and put it on par with heteronormative conventions without making it seem weird or different: it's just part of the world, and everyone accepts it. That's super important.
I know Steven Universe and the fandom it harbors is the reason I figured out I was enby. I got a tumblr account around the same time I really started to get into SU and being the show it was the fandom had a large queer fandom. And through that I was able to learn that nonbinary people even existed, and I finally felt like I understood a part of myself I never did before. And then through Stevonnie I really felt represented. I still cry hearing the song “Change Your Mind” because that song even by itself has helped me be ok with who I am. Without Rebecca Sugar and Steven Universe I don’t know how much longer it would have taken to understand and accept myself, but I certainly wouldn’t be at the point where I am considering hrt.
Steven Universe was also important to me for self-acceptance. At the very least, it came out at the perfect time when other things and people also helped with self-acceptance. It is actually funny how in 3 years I went from ""I don't believe the theory that this character is nb"" to ""This character is nb and so I am!"".
That's good enough to me
I started watching SU when I was around 10ish (I'm 15 now) and honestly the show has helped me so much with finding and accepting myself. I know so many trans and enby ppl who Steven university played a similar role.  this is why representation in kids media is important.
Maaaan this makes me wanna read the comics for sure. Showing Stevonnie shaving in the TV show was such a power move and the bravest nonbinary representation I’ve personally witnessed in the media, especially children’s media.
Like wtf. I've just learned about this series very recently. Wtf. It aired in 2013, back when I was a self denying complete mess. Granted, I started dating my now BF around that time, so that might have distracted me a bit. But honestly, I was so lost, I felt so weird for doubting my gender, like an alien or at best a freak. I wish I had seen this series then and came out as NB, that would have spared me 5 years of self doubt and anxiety.
I'm personally super happy that all Gems are technically Agender and Nonbinary, makes my lil queer heart happy :D
The song Change your Mind makes me cry 90% of the time I hear it because of the impact it has on me. I high key want a tattoo of the lyrics just to remind myself that I don't need to live to make other people love me. I love me and that's all that matters.
Agreeddd. I started watching when I was 14 or 15 I think, and in these past couple years, it was what genuinely taught me how to love myself.
Ikrrr. Also having an intersex character is a huge leap for not just cartoons but media in general. It even explicitely Stevonnie is non binary/intersex in one of the Dove self esteem shorts with them. It's amazing the representation this show has.

Envious of the cool androgynous looking people on here	"I pass as cis. I am fine with it, because it's the most comfortable for me. It's not ideal, but it's the best arrangement. However, it seems that nonbinary is actually treated as a third binary by most people in the queer community as well. So basically I ended up feeling like I don't belong anywhere both when it comes to cishets who will never respect who I am, and when it's in the queer community, where I get imposter syndrome.

I don't have anyone to tell me stuff like ""you're valid"", ""do what makes you the most comfortable and know that I will respect and understand who you are regardless""

And I think I'm coming close to my breaking point because I've been living like this for years and it hurts.

I don't want to change how I look just to please people who feel like nonbinary should be its own binary. I don't think I look good trying to look androgynous, i have tried when I was younger and it made me feel unattractive (not that androgynous people are unactractive, it's the opposite for me, but because of how I'm naturally built and my face, and my BDD i have a very complicated relationship with my body so I NEED to look good for myself and myself mostly)

So yeah, stuck in between. Rejected by society.

Cishet guys never wanting to be just friends and never acknowledging my pronouns. Sick of the disappointments. Cishet girls eventually noticing I'm acting ""odd"" because I'm not really one of them, also misgendering all the time. All this despite coming out to these people. But they have no idea or care for what I'm talking about when I come out to them.
Growing up all of my friends turned out to be lesbians. Only one of them ever respected my gender identity. So it's a queer people problem too. At least those around me.

""You don't need to fit in"" yeah, I do. Because the loneliness becomes unbarable and the depressive episodes are becoming darker. And I'm alone because I don't fit in anywhere and can't trust anybody to be my friend.

My gender identity is more complicated than just they/them pronouns, but it's more convinient to only ask people to respect that instead of explaining myself to them all the time, which is also a huge risk. And yet, yet these assholes can't even respect one simple thing such as pronouns and using neutral terminology with me. Fuck everyone.
I used to love people, now I'm sick of everyone.

Can't have friends, can't have a pleasing social life. Let alone partners. Or sexual encounters. Because I can't trust anybody.
Everything is just so sad and frustrating.
And when I go into details with therapists all they can do is say ""yeah, that's understandable"". So yeah. No solution. I'm stuck being ""the weird one that could easily have a normal life but chooses to seek attention by wanting to be different so badly"" (my parents and possibly most people I came out to)

EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing with me your experiences and for taking the time to write such kind words. I feel easily overwhelmed by this issue lately and I definitely felt overwhelmed also by the kindness of you all and the simple interaction with other nonbinary people, who finally understand me. I will go through all your comments as soon as I feel like I can handle it. Thank you again, despite the anonymity provided by Reddit, I still felt the warmth of your words and I don't feel so alone anymore."	"nonbinary doesn't look like anything, you ARE valid, people just lack empathy and the ability to try and understand. YOU are a gorgeous nonbinary person and YOU are so so so valid.
As an amab masc presenting enby I feel this so hard
If you can handle some dark periods of time then everything will work out, when I came out as nb but started to social transition as a man (being very masculine and accepting he/him pronouns from strangers) yeah I lost like all my friends and certain people around me distanced themselves from me, but I found my people (they kinda found me) yeah most of them are younger kids that look up to me but I still love being a parental figure in their lives. I had only one friend that stayed with me through it all, you can have people you hang out with but they aren't your friends if they don't accept how things are. The real ones will stay, the the real ones will come. With confidence people will see it and let you truly be you. I have basically replaced everyone around me. And with my confidence and feel good attitude because I'm living my life and not worried about people, I have friends, I have acquaintances, I have school buddies, people look at me and think I got my shit together. It works out in the end, it just takes time, you will have a period of time when you have no friends, you have no one to turn to. You become a hermit. But in that time you become the most YOU. You find hobbies, you find your true personality, you find what makes you happy. Find you before finding other people.
I’m neither him nor her. A French composer once said, “music is the space between the notes.”
I feel the same
You don't need to look a certain way to be NB!!!!
I also find myself jealous towards more androgynous people sometimes. 
But I'm AMAB and present very masc. The only times people were confused about my gender was on the phone and because of my name which is gender neutral but socially leaning femme. 
What I'm trying to say is, you can look like you pass without a question of a doubt and still not fit in the gender binary, and like others said. You are valid and accepted here!!!
Sending all the love your way and I know you can endure the hard times, you have so far💛🤍💜🖤
I’m so sorry you feel this way. It is so painful socially, sexually, emotionally, intimately to present a way that is not expected as “THE LOOK” for enby folk, and be excluded, even shamed for it. Please know that, like you, we are out here, a whole spectrum of gender fluidity inside and out—many of us don’t fit “THE LOOK” for the same reasons you don’t. Gender, and it’s expression, is more than appearance. Recently, many have often felt like the non-binary identity is being pigeon holed as a third gender with its own celebrities leading the charge and building media hype and social expectations of what we should all look like—defying the vast and varied spectrum of what we ACTUALLY look like, and ignoring that gender is far, far more than just looks. It’s very shallow to assume otherwise. Please keep the faith.  It won’t be easy, but you will find those that will get you for who YOU are.
I wrestle with this daily and then throw my hands up at the patriarchy for putting me in this damn box where I'm only 'safe' when I'm still performing for them, whether that be sticking to my gender assigned at birth, or going full on in the opposite binary's displays of gender, or being androgynous enough to signal to people I'm non-binary based on looks alone.

Fuck their furrowed brows at how we show up, that's the conditioning leaving their bodies. It's okay to care what they think, that's how we stay safe in our society. I think what's more affirming for me is working on winning myself over for my choices and caring what I think about myself more.
honestly, were on a similar boat, for one part I really don't present as NB, but I also don't really feel very identified with the nb community since sometimes I like some aspects of both genders and I like to present as both, but if I say someting like that I automatically get boxed in ""gender fluid"" even if that doesn't really feel correct. 

labels are inventions of society since we need to identify with something as to feel we're not alone nor too much different. some people really take it to heart since they formed such a strong connection with the label as their identity that's they can't just think of another way. 

so, in reality you really shouldn't worry so much about not fitting in the mold. if that's the case maybe something else is the problem, like, we know that it's important for us that people recognize our identity. but my question is, why is it for you? is it just the validation or maybe something else? 

as por people and your identity, maybe you should try to run in different circles. since we have a tendency to rotate to people in witch we recognize certain patterns, and the people you decided to mix with, simply weren't so considerate, after all, everyone is different and you can't say you have meet all of the planet population
Have you tried seeking out a group of friends that is also nonbinary/queer? Cishet people are not going to understand you in the same way that other nonbinary people will.
You’re valid :)
I am also an enby passing as cis, but I look very good androgynous but I don’t dare to dress that way in public.
Non binary does not necessarily equal androgynous. Androgyny is in between. We are other than. That’s how I think of myself.
as others have said u don’t need to look a certain way, the way how i see it bc i have days where i prefer to look more “feminine” presenting or “masculine” presenting, i jus’ want ppl to see me as me, and if they don’t see me for how i’m comfortable expressing on any given day i usually don’t spend too much time w them. anyway u choose to look is valid and i promise u u’ll find a community that makes u feel safe, i’m always here if u wanna talk ♡
You are not alone. I have the same struggle with body image and the androgynous look just doesn't always suit me. It sucks cause I have to push a lot to get the correct pronouns used for myself and that makes people uncomfortable (but that's very much a them problem, as my therapist reminds me frequently).

Many hugs for you. We don't owe anyone androgyny. You're still valid no matter how you present ❤
Hey. Wear the clothes that make you feel good. Do it. I do. You don’t owe anyone an outfit, except yourself. You’re nonbinary? Neat. Anything you wear that makes you feel good is a valid nonbinary outfit. Because it is your outfit. 

Don’t change anything about yourself to please people who are not interested in who you are. You don’t owe anyone any way of being other than the one that’s truest to you. 

I really get what you’re saying about fitting in, and I think that what you are actually looking for is your community, the people who fit in with you as much as you fit in with them, rather than to actually fit in with people who have mental walls up that don’t allow them to see the awesomeness of *you*. I also get that ‘find your community’ isn’t on its face helpful advice, because ok, that’s nice, now tell me how and who. I’m saying it here more because I hope that it may help change your focus, because I think that being unable to be yourself surrounded by people who don’t get you is just as lonely as being alone, and I want you to know that you 100% deserve to be able to be you and seen and liked and loved. Unaccepting people don’t mean there’s something wrong with you, it is entirely a reflection of them.
So, I'm probably not the best for talking about this (I'm a 14 year old demiboy who doesn't have his shit together by any means and still isn't able to help himself), but here's what I think. 

Yeah, I'm part of the enby spectrum, as I don't completely identify with my AMAB, but I'm still masc-presenting and that makes me comfortable. I haven't tried looking androgynous though, but I'm pretty sure that, even if I don't completely feel like a man, I like how I look in the sense as of what gender I look like (I think I'm ugly and I'd want to change that, but that doesn't have anything to do with the gender thingy). You can be an enby and not be androgynous. Non-binary IS NOT a third binary, it is an umbrella term for ANYTHING that doesn't fit into the gender binary of men and women, and if there's anyone who says it's not like that, just say ""who asked?"" And move on. There's a lot of people who can relate, so just know that the people that will accompany you for all your live are there somewhere, and they're looking for you as much as you're doing with them. 


So, as a summary of what I just said: YOU. ARE. FRICKING. VALID. There's a lot of people like you out there, and they will be the ones to help you truly be yourself. You do have to accept what we're saying in this comment section; after all, I recognize that I have the problem with not applying the advice that I'm given and denying that it is even true, so I do not want to be like that, it is hurtful, and I don't want my enby pals to be hurt.
I understand what you mean...before I even knew I was nonbinary this was my understanding of it, a gender outside of male and female...only when I came to truly understand nonbinary as a spectrum did I understand that I myself was nonbinary too. For some enby people, it IS a third gender to them, and for some it is not, it exists outside the binary. So please know you're not alone in feeling this way. 💖 I often hear the same struggle in my head and gaslight myself into thinking I'm still cis and making this shit up. No, I am nonbinary and always will be. As are you 💛🤍💜🖤
I can relate. ""Passing"" as cis, and feeling like an imposter bc I can ""hide"" behind the appearance I'm mostly fine with, and my hetero appearing marriage. All I can think of is to try and find a friend group, even if that has to be online. No matter what you look like or your presentation, it's about how you feel about yourself that matters. I wish I had something better for you, just know that many other NB's feel like you do, at least we're suffering together.
i feel you and am in a similar boat from what i gather. almost all people assume i'm cis from what i look like, even if i tell them my pronoun, people don't use it, apart from the few close friends i have. even my therapist lowkey does not understand anything about gender, even after multiple explanations. the will is not there.

so this is probably a bad idea, but since cis people overwhelmingly are a lost cause, i decided to completely reject any opinion on the topic from them outright. they never had any authority or knowledge of me, my inner workings, so any attribution they try to pin on me is false from the get go. at least it's mentally freeing, but it does not magically make patriarchal gender norms vanish
Not sure if this will really help, but non-binary is an umbrella term. Under that falls agender (genderless), and androgyne (a state of gender between the two binaries), polygender (melting pot of gender expression). It seems like you’ve had trouble with people conflating these identities with non-binary. You don’t need to be in a state of androgyny/genderlessness to be non-binary. Non-binary is existing outside of the gender binary. There’s a ton of other identities in the non-binary umbrella (demi-girl/boy/non-binary, gender-fluid) which have people identifying with a certain gender expression. They are just as valid. But yeah, it’s silly Bc non-binary is to exist out of the binary so to create a box of rules that you need to satisfy just negates the point of being non-binary. No single non-binary person identifies the same, and that’s what is so cool. It’s unique to you. It doesn’t and shouldn’t look the same for everyone. You don’t need to identify with a certain micro label to be valid, just express yourself and your identity and be comfortable. That’s all you can do. <3
It sounds like you've had an unlucky draw as far as the people around you. Or maybe I've just been lucky. I'm a fem-presenting AFAB masc-aligned enby. Only once have I had an issue with someone I've come out to not respecting my identity. I live in an extremely conservative area and I cannot be out openly for my own safety. 

Most of my inner circle is trans and/or non-binary. That could be a factor. Are you able to find better social circles? I mean, even if you were a woman, having cishet guys who can't just be friends is an example of bad people around you, so clearly at least on that front this goes deeper than the transphobia issue?
I am a masc-presenting amab enby and doomed to be misgendered by everyone until the end of my days.
Another one of us here as well. You are valid, OP. You are valid, tisjustbrandon.
That is a lovely way of putting it. Going along the music analogy line, I’ve also heard that, to properly appreciate jazz music, you’re supposed to listen to where the notes AREN’T being played. Or something like that.

In other words: defy convention. Embrace individuality.
Anyhoo, hi, I’m nothanks, I’m thirty…six?, Canadian, a fab two gender, adhd, anxiety, two small children, actor and student on hiatus from both, i like playing with words and would like to someday do it for money. Books are my friends. Nice to meet you. Feel free to dm me if you ever need to vent or just wanna chat with a random internet friend.
I discovered how to maneuver between the notes when I first stepped onto an EDM dance floor. A queer friendly place where you fall in love, dance, befriend, sweat, and shed away the pain. I also discovered radical empathy.
It is amazing what music can do. And what affirming, friendly spaces can do too.
It’s been nearly eight years since I put everything in my rearview. I never fully assessed the damage that place had done to my self-esteem, my mental state and all the whatevers too. 

THAT place embraced authoritarian conformity. THOSE people took it upon themselves to mow down the first blade of grass that grew taller than the rest. 

I used to dance in my room listening to my dad’s vinyl album of Pearl Jam VS. 

I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings... made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive...

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface... most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things

I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades...are raised...

Saw things so much clearer

Attention all NBs, the desert acknowledges us, and shows it’s support through natural beauty this month💜	Sadly no clouds today, so not much white	"I relate, I’m also dry and hot
Is that a Yamaha TTR I see?
Enby super bloom
What a gorgeous spot and lovely pictures. Do you know what species any of those flowers are?
The post title feels like a quote from Welcome to Night Vale, a weird fiction podcast with a very calming and deep narrator.

And I needed that, somehow. The idea of the earth itself appreciating us, and celebrating our existence through colors we've decided amongst ourselves represent us...is so healing for me.

Thank you for sharing this. <3
Perfect! So beautiful. There is plenty of white on those flowers and on the distant peaks.
Temperature is starting to pick up, all our rain has already come and gone
Why yes it is :3 230 ttr
No idea, not great with plants. They’re the wild flowers of Death Valley tho if you want to look into them!

I’ve come to the realization that a lot of people, even some queer people, are critical/unsupportive of people who are non-binary or use they/them pronouns	"I recently came across a Queerty instagram post showing Jeffree Starr speaking negatively about people who use they/them pronouns. Most comments on this queer news page were in agreement with his hateful remarks. Some comments even said things along the lines of “just choose a side” or similar phrases. Some were even supportive/tolerant of trans people who identify with either male or female. 

This and other examples have sadly made me rethink how I should identify. It has made me reconsider whether I should use they/them exclusively and maybe go back to using he/him, or she/her in the future. I am uncomfortable using he/him or she/her, so this whole thing is not making me feel very good. 

It has been extremely hurtful to see members of our own community come out against me and others like me. Has anyone else had experiences or thoughts similar to this?"	"Yuck.  ""Just choose a side"" is a decades-old trope some members of the queer community and their allies love to use to invalidate those who don't adhere to society's binary expectations of gender and sexuality.  They don't even see the irony.  As if it's not hard enough being bisexual or non-binary without members of our own LGBTQ+ community denying the validity of our experiences. 🤮
A friendly reminder that Jeffree is a complete bell-end anyway and that 100% of his opinions belong on the binfire that is his personality, and if someone is a fan of his, it's the same sentiment. But I understand. I think there's even a split in the enby community over the use of neo-pronouns. I've faced hostility from fellow enbies over it before (saying I 'delegitimise them' somehow. If you think that, I'm inside your walls). It sucks, but it's a sobering and sometimes comforting reminder that we *are* actually just like other people - there's dickheads and angels in every group, and most of us are somewhere in-between. It sounds easy to say, but don't let it hurt you - these people are pandering to cis- and hetero- opinions to get their slice of the pie, when really we should all be banding together to take the pie. Take care of yourself, mate.
i saw this same post and one of my friend’s friends reposted it on her instagram story and added commentary that was very transphobic/enbyphobic. it bothered me so much to the point i had a hard time sleeping. i did respond to her story in the hopes of having a conversation about her beliefs, but she left me on read. 

i don’t really understand where these people are coming from in their opinions? it’s pretty simple to respect people’s pronouns and how they choose to identify and present themselves. and it’s annoying when they hold these opinions but refuse to explain them or discuss them. 

knowing that someone in their early 20s held such outdated beliefs about gender and pronouns made me quite sad and hurt, but i just had to tell myself there really isn’t anything i can do about it unfortunately. i will admit it did make me reconsider whether it’s feasible for me to continue using they/them pronouns in my daily life, and in the end i realized those are an integral part of my identity and i finally feel comfortable with myself because i am non-binary. 

i’m sorry if this isn’t very helpful and is more of a rant lol but do know you are not alone!
I feel like anyone who is pro Jefferee Starr in 2023 has a lot of information they need to be gathering and thinking critically about. He’s awful, so the take on non-binary people in unsurprising. It’s really sad the queer publications are giving him more reach tho. Idk what kind of org queerty is tho, if they are just one of the sections that is very “lgb without the t”.
I have IRL gay friends that act like this in person and I'm not a big fan of confrontation, HOWEVER...

I quickly and frequently remind them that a ""third gender"" (hijras) have been recognized by indigenous Earth cultures as far back as 400 BC. I then proceed to ask them why they insist on disrespecting our ancestors with their ignorance.

Attention seeking bigots (especially western socio-capitalist ones) don't like history, or science, or shared reality. They just want clicks for their echo chamber.

Stop giving them the attention they seek. Unfollow, block, do whatever you need to, but don't give them more attention like this.

To performative humans (which most hetero normative humans are) enbies represent the chaos they avoid by compartmentalizing everything in to neat binary boxes. The fact that they are losing their sh\*t constantly means we are a threat to their unaddressed OCD (and income)

Take a moment and reflect on whether or not you may have your own internalized performance anxieties that are being triggered by someone else expressing theirs. Then find gratitude for releasing yourself from that trauma and grab a snack.🧡
As unfortunate as it is, I see why some people are like this. The gender binary is hammered into us right from birth, and by the time we're older, it's so ingrained in our minds that a lot of people just can't wrap their minds around the fact that there are people that exist outside of it.

That said, it's also extremely disappointing that others in our community have the opinions that they do about nonbinary people. You'd think that members of a community that has faced so much adversity would be more open-minded than they are. Of course, the majority of other queer people I've met have been cool about nonbinary people, but the voices that are against us definitely stand out. 

However, I don't think that this is worth changing your pronouns over (unless you feel unsafe using they/them, of course). While it's true that a lot of people think shitty things about us (nonbinary people), it's not worth censoring who you are for the comfort of bigots. You are who you are, and that's wonderful - no matter what anyone else says!
Considering it's someone like Jeffree Starr, does it actually matter, about anything he says? I've taken shits with more thought capacity than him and his mentally stunted fan-base. In a week he'll be trying to cancel someone for not having blonde hair right or something equally stupid. He has no functional brain activity except for actively sniffing out clout.
Yes I feel like I lived in a bubble previously but lately I see and experiencing more gender essentialism and policing from cis gay men, especially from people coming from more openly authoritarian cultures like anglophone, Eastern European and North African countries, not so much in Western Europe.

In the beginning I was more upset by this, now I just feel it helps screen dates and potential friends better.
Is it really that hard to understand that I don't want my identity based off my genitals?
The concept of being NonBinary in the west is still relatively new (I know about third and nonbinary genders across the world or pre-colonial and indigenous societies with no genders). It will take a lot of time before people come around to it.

It's hurtful when other queer people express hate towards anyone in the community because that label is meant to include anyone who doesn't fit the mainstream gender or sexual norm and they don't see how dumb they come across when they tell people to choose a side. They're the ones banding together with the cishets on this topic. 

I believe most people are nonbinary deep down. Nobody fits their so-called gender roles 100% and gender has never truly been a binary because of that which is why some people (mostly conservatives) are obsessed with body parts because it's their only argument for the existence of a gender binary. Some queer people also fall for this unfortunately.
I saw this post as well. It definitely had me uncomfortable to the point of sadness for the future of the queer community. I hate that someone with the following if Jeffery Star would even speak that way about another person. As a fellow queer person you’d think that outcasting a group of people would be a no go. The world feels threatens for some reason when the non binary comes into play. I know I kinda just shared my thoughts but I hope this helps!
I had a genderfluid friend who went by different pronouns over the time I knew them. The friendship ended with ""making people use they/them for you is presciptive language. You shouldn't force people to use certain pronouns for you.""

Like, wtf? Youve been asking me to use certain pronouns for you for two years, and when I decide to do it, I'm not allowed by your hypocritical standards?
I saw that clip of Jeffrey and to be honest, I feel like he's the type to say something for shock value and backtrack later on, after the side he's trying to play favorites with shows him that they aren't really agreeing with him. But with his controversial takes more to say. But I think the best scenario is to ignore him all together.
I will never understand why a marginalized group chooses to punch down instead of up. 

Even when I personally don't understand something and have some criticism or questions, I make my best effort to understand and learn and regard my opinion as something fluid and flexible and never a basis of fact or a reason to discriminate. SMH
JStar was pandering hard fucking core in that conversation. I think it's important to look at the context of the interview: I don't know all the deets but I know that it was for this conservative dude's podcast. The whole interview, Jeffree was pandering to that audience, which IMO makes this whole thing so much worse. This statement made by Jeffree Star: a man who created his image by being a gender bending individual who has SAID that he goes by ALL pronouns, including they/them. It's gross. The dude is really the worst. I mean on top of this he's an abuser, an alleged s\*xual assaulter (IDK how alleged it is because there's video), constantly manipulates his audience for money, etc. I know outside pressure is hard, I feel the same pressure sometimes to not go by they/them. But those are the pronouns I feel best going by! They're my pronouns and that's just who I am! And it's who you are too!
For a minute I thought we were talking about Jeffrey Marsh and got really concerned, they're a wonderful person
I've experienced the same thing irl with coworkers and family saying everyone is either a he or a she, and that they get people 'changing from one to another', but not peoole being non-binary. It's unfortunately been a massive factor in deciding to come out or not, and if I think about it too much it makes me very depressed. I know some would possibly be open to learning about it, but many wouldn't (because they've outright said so).
I know a trans lesbians who said nonbinary people were faking to steal attention from real trans people she's my friend i was eventually able to change her perspective by showing her some studies from the American association of pediatrics
Yeah I’ve chosen a side. The one that hates Jeffree Starr
Jeffrey Starr is not a good litmus for where the community stands on non-binary people. He’s a fucking bigot.
If you mold your identity to what other people want from you... its not really your identity, is it
I tell those kinds of binary trans people to fuck right off. You can be a bigot and be trans, but how sad that you think someone being non-binary somehow threatens your identity.
Seeing binary trans people supported but nonbinary people not, is so weird. It's even worse for those who use neopronouns. The point is that those people are just finding a place to put their bigotry that's more 'acceptable'. They're going to find a way to hate on us no matter what. As long as you are safe doing so, you should be yourself. The more of us genuinely out there, the more change will eventually happen.
Who gives a shit about Jeffrey Star 🙄 not worth the time of day
I've run into this problem especially those my age which socks but isn't surprising.
i wrote about this in my essay about non-binary identities last semester. even fellow lgbtq+ people like to say that a gender outside of man/woman isn’t real and really, it’s just a desperate attempt by them to reclaim the trauma of having the same done to them by a cishet dominated society. i used the term “lgbtq+” to describe them because (in my personal subjective opinion) i wouldn’t call them queer. queer inherently means breaking societal norms and people like jeffrey star & other transphobes are doing the exact opposite by re-enforcing the very same rhetoric spewed at them when their identities weren’t accepted.
Feels like my partner :( Agender, ""any pronouns"" which really means ""only ever uses she/her (assigned pronouns at birth) for herself, tolerates they occasionally, don't call her he, thinks neopronouns are stupid"", feels like just uses my pronouns when she actually feels bad about something bad she did or wants me to do/buy something, and as soon as I ever upset her at all will instantly switch back to misgendering me and calling me a man :( It's been bad enough sometimes that recentlyish when I said ""you almost never use my pronouns"" then I actually got the fucking response ""that's not true, I used them twice this week"" (both directly to me, I 100% know I'm always misgendered behind my back and she doesn't ever correct her fucking bigoted conservative parents, for example, despite the fact that we don't depend on them for shit, they already think she's some ""brainwashed librul"" who ""needs to watch less woke media"", and I make more than both of them combined).

Used to love to bang on and on about the usual ""they is plural"" bullshit while at the same time saying ""y'all"" including to a single person which is not only IMHO *more* explicitly plural (since you're **adding** a plural word to the **neutral** ""you"") but makes her sound like an uneducated hillbilly Trunt, but has at least slowed down on that a bit, presumably since making a friend who I know would 100% not be ok with that and working with children including queer ones and ones she has **specifically referenced to me as ""they""**, but still doesn't use even *they* for me (I use they and she, leaning more and more towards she but they is objectively still fine and honestly I wouldn't mind only ever being called ""they"" if it means not getting he'd...). And no, IDGAF if it's a thing people from the deep south 'just do', she only started after we came here, and where I grew up people didn't pronounce the letter ""H"" correctly but **I still fucking do because I don't want to sound like some fucking inbred country bumpkin from one of the most conservative areas of my country**...
The only side-choosing should be whether you support all queer people or you support none of them.
I also wanted to state that the other day, I saw a youtube video that claimed that the Trans and Queer movement completely highjacked the LGB movements because the LGB ""is all about sexuality"" and the ""Q and T are about gender identity."" And when I was aghast at the mention of this, I decided to look at the comments to point out the gross mishash of history and the blatant transphobia and to my dismay, the comments were almost all agreeing with this person. Like, did they not read the smallest amount of LGBTQIA history? Did they not read about Marsha P. Johnson or Silvia Rivera? Did they not see any of the footage of what Johnson and Rivera went through at the hands of the LGB community despite all of the work and activism they put into the movement?

&#x200B;

I came to the conclusion that arguing with everyone in the comment section would not work. On this particular video or in general when topics like this are being discussed by people who have no fucking clue about the topic they're speaking on with such authority. This person clearly had a particular audience but it is disgusting how they were grossly misrepresenting queer history while still claiming to be an ally. There is a lot of phobia towards nonbinary people. Lots of misunderstanding, lots of mis gendering, lots of bs. What we need to remember is that the LGBTQIA community harbors a shit ton of internalized homophobia, transphobia and compulsory heterosexuality. None of us are free from our society, and even within a community that is supposed to be our haven, that community is not a monolith. We're still all socialized in a horrific hierarchical society and that manifests in a lot of different ways."	117xcho	NonBinary	127	0.99	2023-02-21 07:16:52

"it sucks having to rememorize changing the femininity/masculinity when referring to yourself. now saying ""im tired"" makes me sad, THANKS SPANISH!!! >:("		"use the e instead! like in my username, i went with “latine” and not “latinx”. some people use the x too but it’s basically impossible to pronounce in spanish and the e takes care of that. for pronouns you just say elle instead of él or ella
Being non-binary in literally any language besides English blows
What about no binarix?
Basically The Same Can Be Said For Italian, I Try To Just​ Randomly Swap Which Gender I'm Referring To Myself By.
but forreal, how do you deal with this?? if i switch the pronouns of the verbs in croatian i sound like some tourist or a person who just learned the language...
I alway use e in place of a and o when referring to someone who's enby. Like elle instead of ella/él. I prefer this over using x because words like ""latinx"" or ""binarix"" sound really weird.

Edit: spellcheck doesn't like Spanish
I feel this so hard. I'm a language teacher who works mostly in Spanish and I think about this all the time. Normalize!! the!! e!!!!

 I use ""elle"" and the ""e"" ending with Spanish-speaking peers who know I'm nb. I don't have Hispanic or Latine heritage and I really want to avoid being appropriative or prescriptive about a language that's not my own, so It's validating to read things like [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2019/12/05/teens-argentina-are-leading-charge-gender-neutral-language/?arc404=true) on the use of the gender-neutral ""e"" in Argentina. 

I prefer the e for myself (though maybe others prefer x?) and from a linguistic perspective I think the e probably has a better chance of gaining traction because it fits seamlessly into Spanish phonology, whereas the /ks/ or ""x"" sound doesn't occur at the end of words in Spanish unless they're loan words from other languages (hearing it always makes me think of products like ""Kleenex"" or ""Tampax"", ha) and it can be a little awkward to pluralize.

The a/o binary is a big reason why I'm not out at work yet. Most of my teaching is in Spanish, so I am constantly misgendering myself and presuming others' gender every time I use an adjective. It's nails on a chalkboard. I hear co-workers say ""the Latinx community"" and ""Latinx families"" all the time because that ONE word is normalized in our school district, but so far I've never heard my Latine/Spanish-speaking colleagues or any other colleagues use gender neutral endings for individuals or for plural nouns like alumnes/compañeres, etc. I know it's so important for students to see gender neutral language by adults, but because I don't have a Hispanic or Latine heritage, I'd feel weird coming from my place of privilege, trying to introduce change to a linguistic/cultural community that's not my own. I feel stuck.

Luckily, incremental language change is possible if enough people use the new feature widely, frequently, and long-term! Once a neutral ending like ""e"" becomes more visible and more normalized, it will go a long way toward creating some gender-expansive space in Spanish.
No binarix ;p
I'm Brazilian and it's the same with Portuguese, so in my bios in social media I put ""any pronouns"" besides preferring they/them.
We said ""no binarie""
hey thanks!
serbian transman here. i think your best bet is to use masculine pronouns (especially if you're AFAB). it's hard to work with this language when there really are no gender neutral pronouns, especially when referring to yourself. notice how people will use he/him pronouns when talking about someone with an unknown gender? i think that's why you should use them

club Q shooter makes me gayer. i’m angry. sad. and also more motivated than ever. i love you queers. gender-expansive ppl. trans humans. we’re out here creating big change in the world. we will not be silenced🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈	"after the Club Q incident. i didn’t really know how to process. i felt sad. disappointed in humanity. angry as shit. couldn’t the fathom the fact that my community. my lovely, QUEER, gender-expansive, trans community. are targets for so much hate. so much anger & violence. 

all we wanna do is live. live in our authenticity. in our truth. show the world unique & expansive ways of expressing ourselves. why is that such an issue?

being who we are is so powerful. so strong. the shooting that happened has only created more strength & motivation in this city & BEYOND. has inspired a movement of acceptance & change in the way we show up for one another. coexisting in our differences. accepting & allowing all humans to be who they are without fear of violence / oppression.

this one’s for my trans community. my gender-expansive community. my queer friends & family. i love you. i see you. we’re out DOIN IT in the midst of the chaos 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈"	"Oh good god at first I read this as ""After the Club Q shooter came out as non-binary I felt inspired"" since this is on the Non-binary sub and holy shit that was a trip
This brought a tear to my eye, there’s so much love in the world to stomp out the hate but we just need to show it more
I was just saying this to a friend yesterday. Things like this make me want to be even gayer and louder. Just cover me in rainbows. I will not hide.
OMMGGGGG noooooo😭😂
yes!!! 100000% agree!! thank u so much for sharing your words & watching 🥺

I feel alone	I identify as bi and non binary and I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I am often excluded from straight, gay, male and female spaces. Today I found out 3 of my best friends (all female) invited my girlfriend (also female) to a make-up sesh in preperation of a club night we where supposed to go to together, and they delibiratly excluded me for the gender I was assigned at birth. The worst part is that the central theme of the night is gender acceptance. Even more so, all my friends and my girlfriend call themselves queer. I don't want to make to much of an issue about it because I understand that women need a safespace from time to time and I do want my girlfriend to get to know my friends without me being there all the time. Anyway I don't feel like chosing my outfit and doing my make-up on my own  and I don't feel like going to the club anymore.  I feel angry, sad, compleetly stuck and I am tired of being me.	"Honestly You need to talk to your girlfriend and your friends about this, yes women need safe spaces (sadly that is the world we are in), but you still need safety and acceptance too. Specially when they exclude you doing something about acceptance. Point out the hurtful irony. Hard talks sometimes need to happen.
You're never alone! I'm bi, nb, amab, and in a relo with a woman. If you ever feel out of place feel more than free to dm me. If you can, speak to your girlfriend about her doing your makeup next time you all go out, and mention that you not being invited hurt you.
Wow, thats so shitty of them. You deserve better than that. It's hard being NB sometimes and finding friends and our place in society can be really tricky.
You should talk with your girlfriend if they truely wanted things to be inclusive they should have invited you. I mean it could be that they thought you would feel weird in a group only women not thinking that not being invited would hurt you. Im NB afab and i dont do the whole makeup thing so i likely would have felt odd going. But my thought is if you wear makeup and ejoy that and they know that about you they should have included you regardless of agab. Im around if you need a friend just dm me.
I am SO SORRY to hear that. Am also nb and bi and me and my gf (also nb) usually invite all queer friends to hang and do make up etc regardless of gender assigned at birth. I believe that being assigned a gender was a violent thing that happened to us and it shouldnt be perpetuated by us. A safe space is a space where we can hang without bigots. You are not unsafe, you deserve to be loved and included.
I kind of get how you feel. I feel like there’s no place got me either. I’m nb, gay and amab and I can’t find a place where I fit..
I know hardly any queer people as well so it feels extra lonely sometimes
If you ever want to get ready together over zoom let me know, just offering that up as a nonbinary professional stylist who just wants to see people empowered and happy with their clothes!
Hey dang that sucks, I think your upset feelings about that are definitely valid. Hopefully you can explain to your friends from your perspective that they all got together to get ready and do makeup and pick out outfits and then you... did that by yourself??? Because???????? and that that made you feel excluded and it hurt. I hope that decent friends would understand that and maybe be able to think constructively about it.

I feel like it's easy for people to say 'ok, I accept and understand you' but sometimes living it out is harder.
Sorry, Most people really don’t want to make any effort for non-binary people. I hope you find some decent people to spend time with. I’m bi, non-binary, AMAB, and lonely, seems to be common unfortunately.
Hi I'm also non-binary and bu and I totally get where you are coming from. I'm sorry that happened and I would be upset too. Yes they deserve a safe space but you shouldn't be excluded especially with the theme of the night. Talk to them about how you feel. I totally get the not being accepted in either camp and feeling alone. If you ever want to talk feel free to message me. I hope things get better!
I'm really sorry that you experienced that transphobia from your partner and friends
No yeah that is super weird to exclude you from getting ready for a thing you were all going to together when they assumedly know you like to wear makeup? Like it's one thing for your gf to do things without you, it's another to exclude you from things relating to events you are already a part of because of weird gender shit.
Talk to your friends about what gender acceptance means if they are so eager to celebrate it while clearly completely missing the point.
If they deliberately excluded you because of your assigned gender at birth then that is transphobia. There are other ways they could have gone about having a female only make up session without hurting you. It seems that they do not understand gender and should probably educate themselves before choosing gender acceptance as a theme. If they cannot accept and be respectful for those outside the binary than what are they actually accepting of? only a single binary gender?

You deserve to be treated better.
that fucking sucks, I’m sorry :( talk about it with them when you can
Talk to them about this. They might have just thought you didn’t like make-up and would be uncomfortable. They should have asked you at least, but if you don’t talk to them about it they’ll never know.
I'm deeply hurt to hear that this happened to you since I am bi and gender diverse, and I have come to know all about that exact struggle you are talking about.

When you mix in what some people interpret as sexual and gender ""confusion"" rather than ""strictly gay"" or ""strictly woman"", then people seem to find it easier to disregard our needs, all because we don't fit into a convenient little binary box.

I really hope you will talk this through with your girlfriend, and let her know how important it is to be your authentic self in her company. I'm sure she will understand. I wish you all the best, and wish there was more I could do to help.
This. For the sake of my mental health I've taken my therapists advice: never assume malice that which can be explained by ignorance. It's helpful. People who love us are unlikely to want to go out of their way to do hurtful things to us but they may be hurtful without realizing it because of ignorance. If these people are really your friends you should be able to say to them what you said to us here.

Sad demigirl hours 😢		"Oh I can tell the difference, I just choose not to give a fuck :)
I mean, can anyone tell the difference between a boy and a girl, without resorting to bioessentialism or arbitrary gender stereotypes?
I can tell the difference between a girl and a boy. That’s how I know I’m definitely none.
""yes i do actually know the difference, but respectfully, i have decided not to care for myself as the concept of gender is not something that i enjoy applying to myself. now if you would excuse me, i'm off to commit some major arson.""
I see she never heard of femboys.

Definitely boys, identify as male, look prettier than about 80% of femme presenting afab people.

My dad recently asked me if RuPaul in drag was also a man. I had to tell him that yes, pretty much every woman except Michelle Visage and the occasional guest judge is actually born male, and most of the drag Queens still identify as male with the very rare trans woman thrown in.

I really love how cishet people are always so hellbent on being able to tell the difference and then they meet their first butch lesbian and get so confused. -___-

We're all just literally meatsacks, can't we just enjoy ourselves?

ETA: My dad once met two openly trans friends of mine and one of them doesn't give a fuck about voice training, so her voice is pretty deep. And after we had our dinner, he asked me ""Was she a gender?""

Yes dad, she's a gender. :'D

It was super cute because the term transgender is pretty new in my country and just recently replaced transsexual in the spoken language. He's trying.
*hugs* hope you're doing alright!
I know how it feels. :(
Hugs ❤️
Like why the fuck should I care what's in your pants
Heck yeah 💛
Exactly. I'm not even a girl if you look at my chromosomes, I have Turner Syndrome,  I even have part of a y chromosome

Aw, that's super sweet. My dad uses my trans friends pronouns when mom doesn't.

My mom told me that my short hair makes me look like I have cancer	"I've been out to her for 2 years. 3-4 months ago I started just shaving my hair off when I got tired of it. It's cheap, gender affirming and it's really great for my sensory issues. I love it. 

My step dad said something about my hair and I got annoyed. My mother stepped in to tell me how it made me look like a cancer patient, and then went on to explain why. I told her I know that chemo affects the hair, but that I find it weird to look at someone with very short hair (I was never bald, just shaved to 3mm) and just assume they must have cancer. It annoys me even more that they would think that about me when they know my gender identity (she even said that she doesn't think that about bald men). 

I'm AFAB and not on hormones, which makes it all seem like ""I see you as a woman and women are only bald when they are sick"". 

I'm just so frustrated and sad that they make me feel like this. I'm spending Christmas with them tomorrow, so I can't even distance myself from them right now. 

Sorry for the vent. I needed some air"	"I have cancer. And a full head of hair. They're being weird and shitty. The bald thing isn't what makes people look like they're on chemo, I promise you that. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with that! Just know that not only are they being transphobic they're *also* being ableist. Tune them out, only argue if it's a matter of safety. The people who matter won't care.
I'm a trans woman but I shave my head too (for each new moon), so I feel ya. I wear wigs most of the time now, but people have told me I look like a cancer patient without them; or of course, like a man, especially since I'm still pre-E/surgeries. I'm usually able to just filter out other people's assumptions these days, mostly because I don't want to keep wasting my energy on people who won't even try to respect me.

Hang in there, and keep on doing what makes you comfortable!
I shaved my hair in high school and college. It was nice not having to mess with it. The cancer part is weird; there are a lot of people without cancer with shaved heads.
I think it’s really important to pause and ask ourselves what kind of people use “_____ patient” as an insult, especially as a vehicle to insult someone’s looks. Let’s really reflect on that.
Response to such a comment: ""If I do, it's probably caused by your shit attitude.""
Your hair. Your choice. 

Isn’t it that simple? Your parents should accept your freedom to chose what works for you.
Her statement says more about her than it does about you. It’s not even about you, because as Fast Eddie said, “It’s not whether they’re right or wrong about you. Is that they’re giving you $h!t.” I’m glad your hair makes you feel good! Too bad they can’t just be happy for you too.
I’ve been waiting for summer (southern hem) to finally shave my head and feel that gender euphoria. 

I ended up injuring my spine recently and now use a wheelchair to get around. Unfortunately I can’t help but feel now is no longer the time to take the plunge :(
my dad told me the same thing when i shaved mine. fucked up
wow thats gross of them transphoia and ablism id leave or cut them off asap
Their loss 💅💕

hey this is owen my non binary ass is sad say smt nice please ?? (xe/xim)		"""something nice""

...what? I'm autistic, I take things literally.

Seriously though: I do like your look. You have a lot of attention to detail, very precisely done make-up and nails, so that your baggy shirt looks entirely intentional and helps offset the exactitude with which you've done your hair and make-up.
You look quite lovely. I hope the sadness passes and there is more joy for you and yours soon. <3
Your hair is so cool! Also I like the lipstick you’re wearing paired with your nails
I love your style, everything is well complimented and looks very good on you! Also, your skin looks so smooth, I have a lot of acne so I always get jealous of people with such clear skin!
I always love your look. Will you be offended if i say you have Kpop boyband hair? Or Kpop boybands have your hair =)

Interesting experience with dysphoria yesterday…	"Hi! A little background first: I’m AFAB age 38 and only figured out last year that there are actually words (non-binary! agender!) to describe how I’ve felt since childhood. In April ‘22, I finally worked up the courage to find an LGBTQIA friendly hairstylist and got the queer haircut of my dreams (shaved short on the sides and kept longer on top, to be gloriously pomped or swept aside as the mood strikes). I’ve also been slowly purchasing more masc clothing or borrowing some of my cis husband’s unused clothes. I still have and occasionally wear clothes from before The Great Change, but I realize now how often I reach for my newer “queer” clothes. And I know that clothes don’t have a gender, but I didn’t realize how much my brain thinks they do, until yesterday…

I was sorting through the closet I share with my husband, starting to pull summer clothes out to make room for fall (we have a small closet in our bedroom and rely on other closets to keep winter coats/sweaters/etc). My stomach turned when I looked at some of my old clothes—and I dressed pretty tomboyish before—but even shirts that had a femme cut or (gag!) DARTS in the bust area just had to go. Dresses were suddenly out of the question—except the ones that I sewed myself: oddball funky vintage/punk ones. And it may just be sentimental value for those. 

I hauled a few of last year’s warmer shirts out of storage and was dismayed by most of them. But I washed them up—along with my current fave set of masc house clothes to make a full load of laundry. Went out and ran errands in a newer, more balanced towards femme outfit just to try it out. Felt ok—still felt “queer,” if that makes sense. The dysphoria hit when I came home and had to change into pre-Change house clothes because my fave ones were still in the dryer. Friends, my anxiety went through the roof. I even cried—and I could not figure out why I felt so upset (I struggle with anx/depression, so the feelings are not uncommon but this was a SURGE). Had to lay down and try to nap into a mental reset—didn’t work. Still deeply sad. 

And then I I emptied the dryer. Even holding my clothes perked me up. Changing into them was like stepping back into reality. I was fine for the rest of the night and this is just so wild to me.

Has anyone else experienced this?"	"Yes, last year. I gave away all my dresses, skirts, vaguely fem clothes and I did not turn back. It happened one afternoon, as I opened the wardrobe and I just could not bring myself to wear any of them. In a black bag, they went! Current style is casual sporty and old Mr Wilson from Dennis the Menace 🤣👌🏿
It’s interesting how much power stuff like that holds. How we can go so long ignorant of it but then after we figure things out a bit it becomes a need for survival. I went my whole life never considering binding my chest. I tried on a top a few months back that was comically tight in that area and it flattened me completely. I couldn’t stop looking in the mirror. That gave me the idea to purchase a binder and now… I have no idea how I lived so long without it. Anyways. Rant over. Sending you the best!
Oh yes a couple of different ways. A fully masc outfit makes me sick to my stomach and I've gotten rid of almost all my masc shirts. Then I found out when I wore my first dress that I had a similar reaction because it was too femme. So now I wear a mix either masc on bottom femme on top or femme bottom masc on top. It was weird to have dysphoria on both sides.
literally went on a dysphoric rampage through my closet and took my femme/dysphoria inducing clothes to a thrift place yesterday lmao
I wonder if it's a physical/mental reaction to feeling like you're being forced into a box again? I have a lot of negative associations and memories with my old clothes. Even trying them on or thinking of it being required makes my anxiety/panic rise. For me at least, I think it's a feeling of regression and being trapped. 

This feeling has infiltrated certain activities. I used to think i never wanted to get married. But if i can have short hair and wear a white tux instead? Then sign me up. So, that's what I'm doing.
I didn't notice experiencing much dysphoria until I realized I was enby. Now clothes are complicated - I've always dressed somewhat masc, but I have a lot of cute fem clothes that I just can't really wear very often anymore
[deleted]
VERY MUCH. my emotions around my ability to both self express and not feel dysphoric are so so tied to clothes more than like anything else since that’s what’s most in my control. if my reliable favorite items that make me feel the most comfortable and good looking are dirty i’ll start thinking about what i’m wearing far in advance so i don’t panic later, because i notoriously take forever to settle on an outfit (this is mostly temp issues tho 🫡)
I gave most of dresses and stuff away last year, and most of my colored clothing. I tried to get more color into my life, my friends said I should, but I realized I’m so uncomfortable with it and I don’t enjoy seeing myself in clothes that aren’t black. 
Just this Friday I went through my clothes again and threw away some more summer clothes that are more feminine, a couple of sundresses etc. I decided there’s no point in keeping them if I don’t use them and always default to my clothes that are more associated with masculinity. I’m actually a bit relieved, not only did I declutter, but it felt good to let go of stuff that bothered me.
Late bloomer here. I’ve had the exact same experience, especially since I cut my hair short. I’ve heard from folks that often you don’t recognize dysphoria until you’ve experience euphoria. 

Once I cut my hair short and started dressing more masc, I just avoided wearing dresses and femme stuff mostly because I loved how I felt in my new clothes. Then one day I was home alone and figured I’d try my dresses on and it felt terrible. I’ll periodically try again but every time the result has been the same.
I've had kinda the same experience, when I first found out I was non binary I still felt alright in fem clothes but one day I just didn't (I think when I first tried making my chest flatter) and have preferred masc/neutral styles ever since
Glad to know that you experienced it all of a sudden, too! And I love the description of your current style😂
So glad you discovered this for yourself! Once I got my haircut, I couldn’t stop looking in the mirror either! And I could finally remember what my face looked like, which sounds strange? I had a short but feminine pixie cut before and my brain just noped out of facial recognition for me. I’ve generally hated photos of myself until now.
I can imagine! I am happy you have found a working combo for you—it sounds amazing!
Must be the changing of the seasons—both geographically and metaphorically!
I think you’re right! Some of those clothes do have some negative memories attached. 
Also—YES to the white tux! The day I can finally make/tailor a suit to fit me, I will ascend into Final Boss Form❤️
Yes! I recognize those femme clothes as “cute” but cannot wear them. They’re cute but not for me anymore.
Thank you so much! I agree—clothing that accurately depicts who I am matters much more me now that I’m NB/agender. Best wishes to you as well❤️
Agreed! I do so much laundry currently to make sure I have MY clothes available. It does require lots of planning—especially since my teaching clothes (only a few hours of my week) are different than my regular work clothes.
Yes! Freeing up our precious closet space for clothes that actually make us feel like us:)
Yes! I really do think my haircut was the trigger that set all of this in motion. It was the first time I was truly pleased with my appearance!
Thank you for sharing! It’s wild to me that so many of us had “one day it was no longer ok” experience!
It floored me. I spent the previous years getting at ease with myself, my sleeve, and then figured out I was not into the binary. Agender queer, here 🙋🏿 I want comfort and long-lasting clothing, and the society we live in makes that affordable for so-called men's clothing. 

As I'm growing more at ease with my authentic self, I remember what I loved to wear as a child and that's what I go for now. Waistcoats, suspenders, button down shirts, tracksuit pants, fugly loafers, dungarees. 

I now live in a small coastal village, and I'm relishing turning into this old guy by the sea. I went foraging yesterday, okay. 🤣 

Unfortunately, everything frilly is associated with my mother forcing me into certain attires, no matter how much discomfort they cause my unaware autistic self. I no longer care whether I look ""stylish"" or am pleasing to another's eye. Defiant? Yes, yes, very much so. 

I do enjoy causing uncertainty with my appearance because it is nobody's business to put me in any box. 

I have kept some t-shirts because they're so bloody soft and comfy. ☺️
definitely, and I’m really looking forward to putting together the new gender wardrobe of my dreams! I’ve been slowly accumulating vintage masc sweaters for the cooler weather that I can’t wait to wear. wishing you all the queer clothes that make you happy and comfy, and let you step into reality every day when you put them on!!!
Same! I describe it to people as the first time I felt like I saw “me” in the mirror. Couldn’t stop taking selfies haha

Quickly realized talking to cis people that this was not cis behavior lol
Ofc! It's wild to me too lolzz
This sounds like a WONDERFUL life and I am overjoyed it is yours:) Funny how we knew ourselves better as kids, in some ways—I stole my dad’s clothes and wore them for quite awhile as a preteen. I now have the sewing skills to make or alter masc clothes to fit me and the possibilities are ENDLESS. I become giddy just thinking about it!
Oh yes, masc sweaters! This is my fall in a nutshell:)
Yesss! I am AFAB and came out as non binary two years ago. When I now see my childhood photos and the clothes I naturally gravitated towards versus what my mother forced on me - I can see the baby enby in me so clearly. I also see myself feel like a cute boy in frocks 🤣

But off late I also realise clothes themselves are so gendered as a social construct and I also gave all my dresses and gowns and things away bec they were high femme and I just couldn’t stand it. Off late I feel less repulsed and when I do wear a one off dress I still feel like a cute goy (that’s what me and my enby friends like to call ourselves) and I do not see myself as a “woman” irrespective of what I wear.
We truly do!! I would wear my dad's clothes as teen, too lol

I am glad you get to do this! Learning to sew is my long list of skills I want to acquire, but fishing and photography are next 😅
Good to know! I’ll hang on to the dresses I made just in case I become comfortable wearing them again in the future. With the exception of my wedding dress, they all feel queer (duh…they were made by an unknowing queer person!)My brain may just needs time to dissociate them from the time back when I thought I was a woman. Those weird prints and styles were my way of undermining the stereotypical feminine—my brain just needs to catch up to my recent changes!
Fun! Both are excellent skills! Hit me up if you ever want to try sewing—I have pattern recommendations and a whole slew of sewing elders who can troubleshoot anything👍
Yeah I think it’s ok for us to what feels right for the moment. And our relationship with certain clothes can change organically. I struggle with BPD and sometimes even the slightest trigger of someone not seeing me an enby can make me spiral so I feel you when you say ur anxiety and depression can sometimes toss you over. 
Also I’m so proud of US for coming out in our 30s, I’m 34 almost and I love that we aren’t going to the grave not fully embracing who we really are.
Thank you, that's so kind! 😊
Indeed! We ROCK! The thirties have been so much better my twenties—I’ve learned so much about myself and feel so much happier:)
And I get you on the BPD aspect—I was evaluated last year and my doctors gently told me that I exhibited several traits of BPD. Realizing I was agender/non-binary helped alleviate some of the smaller day-to-day struggles but heck yeah, the spiral is real when someone doesn’t recognize or respect my gender identity. My husband is struggling with my coming out and this friction often pushes me up to/over the edge of dysphoria. We love one another, have a kid together, and he is trying…it’s just coming slowly. He’s grown used to the haircut and most of the clothing changes."	xhg5gz	NonBinary	102	0.97	2022-09-18 13:04:27

Tired of body shaming in queer spaces.	"Sorry, quick rant incoming. Fat enby here. I was recently in an online group where folks often share transphobic bs they encounter for the purposes of shaming/dragging the transphobes in good fun. All good so far. Problem is that lately it's devolved into body shaming, especially when people decide the transphobe shithead in question fits the fat incel stereotype. Anyone who's pointed out the harm caused by shaming the person's appearance is not taken seriously.

To be clear, I'm not defending the transphobes. Just tired of how those kinds of comments degrade, devalue, and dehumanize all fat people, including fat queer people (we exist!).

Sadly, not my only bad experience as a fat person in queer or ""woke"" spaces, and won't be my last. Just needed to vent, thanks for reading.

Just as I won't apologize if my gender confuses, upsets, or inconveniences someone, same goes for the size of my body."	"Wow I so feel you right now, if you ever wanna talk about fatphobia in queer spaces hit me uuup!
I feel this so hard. Like why sink to their level?!
The fact that you can own your body image as it is is amazing, frankly. My weight is one of my biggest causes of dysphoria, which is probably why finally starting to lose weight has dragged me out of my egg. It's hard out there for all of us, and that's why I mainly seek positive spaces myself, built around ideas of building each other up instead of tearing others down.
It always angers me that such an abused group of people can sometimes be just as abusive as the outside world. Gatekeeping and body-shaming do NOT belong in the community!

Even though I'm thin, I've always had so much appreciation for people with bodies not like mine (or perhaps that's why I like them so much, as I've got my own body issues). So it makes me so angry that people can't just appreciate the beauty in others. Maybe I'm just different than ""most"" people, but I genuinely see people for their inner beauty (not to mention, you can still be fat and attractive, like come on people). You never know what someone is dealing with, and I generally think it's never ok to comment on someone's weight unless you know it makes them happy (like if you KNOW they've been working out for the purpose of weight loss/muscle gain).

I know fat people who are outright gorgeous, I know chubby people who wear crop tops and are looked at as fashion goddesses, and I think the best thing any person can wear is a genuine smile.
I rlly agree, the queer communauty shouldn't recreate society's oppressive dynamics within our own spaces. It's just sad to see :/"	d10c8x	NonBinary	90	0.96	2019-09-07 19:20:39
i’m very feminine presenting and sometimes it makes me sad, but y’all know what month it is now! they/them pronouns; me n my pride flags		"Fembies are grand and valid!!!! They just hate bc they’re afraid of fem nby power ✊ you look grand, I love your eyes & freckles!
Your gender identity is valid no matter how you present yourself. So don't be sad!"	gypbbx	NonBinary	92	0.98	2020-06-08 01:32:34
I wish I could say this to some people… “My pronouns are She/They you can call me either… but if your pointedly call me “SHE?” I’ll be sad. If you call me they and or a combo you’ll make my day!” Can y’all relate? Who uses multiple pronouns here?	"And yeah I’d simplify it to just they/them… but that just doesn’t feel like me… in the same way just “she” doesn’t feel like me. Just one or the other without both feels just as wrong as “he” does to me…. So it’s tough to just stick with one. 

Will change things to They/She  (over she/they) and see if that makes a difference. I had no idea they could be switched!! Silly me!! Thank you all ;)"	"""Hi, my pronouns are she/they, please use them interchangeably when addressing me!""   
maybe you could also say you use they/she pronouns, putting ""they"" first implies you may prefer one pronoun over the other even though you use two sets of pronouns (:
She/They here. Literally, almost everyone I know strictly uses she/her for me and it's saddening.
Yeah I definitely recommend switching to they/she. It’s made a huge difference in my life, hope it works out for you!💕
There's she/they as a subset of ""any pronouns"" and as a subset of ""all pronouns."" The two aren't the same even if we don't have good words to indicate the difference.
For me it's opposite. I go by he/they pronouns, but people only use they for me
I use multiple, kind of

In an ideal world, my pronouns would be they/them. I'd be ok with gender neutral terms and would enjoy masculine and feminine terms in certain situations.

In the real world, I'm from a country that's very ok with gender nonconformity but is a bit prejudiced against non-binary people. Besides that my native language doesn't have gender neutral pronouns like they/them. So I end up cosplaying as a gender nonconforming woman using she/her. People who know I'm non-binary still use she/her but at least they also use genderneutral and masculine terms for me. Some non-binary people here have been using neopronouns; I'm basically waiting until that's normalized enough before I'll come out to everyone and actually start using them
I relate hard. I ordered a pronoun button specially to put the ""they"" first. Then I switched to a ""they/them"" button. I'm hoping people I care about are starting to get it and call me ""they"" sometimes, but it's also hard to explain ""if you call me 'she' you didn't mess up, I just want to be acknowledged as 'they' too.""

(Don't know if this is your exact experience, but I get it's a subtle thing and hard to get across to everyone.)
I LITTERALLY threw my she/her away (my pronouns were they/it/she) because nobody called me a they or an it, so i just threw them away
I used to use he/they but people only called me HE and that made me switch to just they.
 We feel it!! Told people irl to use he/they for me (I also use she and it, but that's more complicated) and like,,,,, maybe one person uses they/them for me.
She/He/They, and definitely relatable. Lots of folx take it as Carte Blanche to only refer to my AGAB (cause of my beard)
He/they but usually get called sir I'm indifferent about it
Fellow she/they here. Neither fits me right, so I feel this in my soul.
Yeah, I use it/ze/they/he and it's so uncomfortable when people get into it he/him loop, a lot of people who use multiple pronouns feels misgendered if only one is used. 

(I don't interact much with the outer public, so I haven't had to deal with assholes about it)
I go by any pronouns, but everybody uses almost exclusively she/her. My girlfriend will occasionally use they/them, which is cool, but there are so many other pronouns to use! I don’t really mind she/her, so I don’t feel there’s a reason for correcting people, but I would love it if they mixed it up a bit every now and then.
As a lack of easily used gender neutral pronouns in my language (french) I use the equivalent of he/him/she/her as pronouns, but I tell people that I don't like being uniquely called she (as I am afab and it makes me uncomfortable)  and I prefer being referred as he/him because it makes me feel less uncomfortable. Now most of my closest friends use he/him to refer to me, hope it helps!
I use a good few sets of pronouns (they're in my flair if you need to know), and I only get he most if the time from people who respect me, and everyone who doesnt just uses she, all the time. Like I'm very public about being not a girl, I simplify it to trans man for the unsupportive so I would understand them, bit my actual friends and super supportive people usually only use he and very rarely they, and I very much tell almost all of my friends that a use the solid four pronoun set. I have one maybe two people who use all of them, one changes them about every other time and the other just kind of uses whichever whenever super chaotically. And I mean, yeah it's better than outright getting misgendered, but like, please, I gave you the whole list use at least 2 of them, I want them all that's why they are my pronouns.
I use all pronouns & yes it feels especially good to hear something different from the folks that knew you before you came out as enby ♡
I can relate & I too wish I could tell someone.
I relate to that (when I went by she/they and they/she)—not that it’s the same experience as yours but for a while I told everyone I came out to that “my pronouns are they/she but use she sparingly” to the point that my girlfriend was talking about me to a family friend and told her that my pronouns were “they/she but not she” and the family friend just kind of went “so… they/them?” and coincidentally (I didn’t know about this until like a week after) I came out to my girlfriend not an hour later telling her I wanted to go by just they/them and drop “she” 😂
I go by she/they too ( though I prefer she )... everyone calls me they :|
They/He I don’t know about other people but i put the pronoun I prefer most first. Like someone calls me he I get excited and its nice. They is my default so I don’t mind of people only use that. Anything else I don’t like. 

If I see someone has multiple pronouns in their bio or on a tag or something I’ll use all of them at random. Whatever is written first I’ll most likely use more so that’s more a me issue but I definitely won’t neglect the other ones xD

I'm hoping people I care about are starting to get it and call me ""they"" sometimes, but it's also hard to explain ""if you call me 'she' you didn't mess up, I just want to be acknowledged as 'they' too.""

(Don't know if this is your exact experience, but I get it's a subtle thing and hard to get across to everyone.)
would be really annoying for me to be referred to as one pronoun. like please just mix it up. especially, if it aligns with my assumed gender to them. **they are doing what’s comfortable for them but not for me.**

I personally use she/its and love when people go back and forth using them, but somedays I will prefer one or the other set.
I’ve got to be honest, if you don’t want people to use « she », just DON’T TELL THEM to use « she ». It’s that simple. It seems to me as if you’re only looking for things to be sad about when at the end of the day, YOU are responsible of how people should know how to refer to you, no matter how you present yourself.
That’s good advice thank you :). I’ve had a few Karens who will use a very emphasized SHE!!! when they find out I use they/she she/they
And yeah I’d simplify it to just they/them… but that just doesn’t feel like me… in the same way just she doesn’t feel like me. Just one or the other without both feels just as wrong as “he” does to me…. So it’s tough to just stick with one.
But the unfortunate consequence of that is that people basically always just use she

definitely worth avoiding those kinds of people when you can, it could also be worth downright saying you use they/them to people you know are going to abuse your comfort with she/her pronouns and not respect your they/them pronouns (obvi if they already arent respecting your she/they pronouns they probably wont respect your they/them pronouns, but depending on the person this may be an option-)
It is! I wish there were more pronouns that describe where one is on the spectrum, not giving other folks the choice to choose hoe we're defined. But people struggle with they -_- we're ahead of our time right now lol. 

I want a pronoun for transmascs that isn't purely manly."	soy3d3	NonBinary	92	1.0	2022-02-10 04:57:28
Do any other non-binary ‘femboy’ type people hate being constantly asked for dick pics?	I am a very feminine presenting ‘male’ who identifies as non-binary. I do not like using my d*ck during sex and i absolutely HATE sending pictures of it. I barely even like having it. Yet I feel like everyone is SO fascinated with femboys and people like me because I’m so feminine and… have a penis. Im so sick of being asked for pictures of it constantly. And then when I say no, I get harassed or they say they’re SO sad they can’t see it…….. I feel like I’m going crazy :(	"This may not apply in your case, but if you have a twisted sense of humour like me and don't mind f'ing with them:

Get a picture of a HUGE dick, of a person who is obviously not you, then send them that.

I'm talking full pole porn star size.
Dont even say no just cut them out. They have no right to discussion with you and you certainly dont want to invite those types of people to even be friends
Not my actual issue but as an AFAB nonbinary person with bottom dysphoria, I dislike being asked to show my genitals. It's totally okay if that's a boundary for you and that boundary to be an important thing for those that interact with you in that way to mind.
hey u did nothing wrong! it's completely fine that u don't want to send dick pics, it's a personal choice! and these ppl should respect ur choice because consent is everything so don't feel bad about rejecting them. if they keep bothering you that's just sexual harassment and they are the ones who are wrong.
I am curious about the context of how you are being asked for dick pics. If it's on social media then that is very weird and I wouldn't even bother responding to those messages.

If this is on something like Grindr though then I wouldn't exactly be surprised that people are asking for your nudes. Don't get me wrong I hate nudes and don't send them either because they are boring to me. But I get that people are on Grindr to be sexual so I get it. I just make it clear in my bio that I am not into nudes and will not send any.

All that aside you absolutely shouldn't be expected to do something that makes you feel dysphoric in any way nor is it something you need to explain to people. I would just say if it's on a dating/sex app then you should absolutely be expecting it so preemptively putting something in your bio could help. But if it's on regular social media then just block those people because that's just creepy.
People who get upset with you after you say no can fuck right off. The right people will respect having your consent.
That is so intrusive and irrelevant. Its icky. Or hate inspired. Porn inspired. As if we are sexual objects. Shon Faye argues cogently I  her book that we must take possession of our bodies not allow our bodies to be public property.
I feel like I can relate to this in a slightly different way. My significant other is absolutely obsessed with my breasts. I've always hated them or at least hated having them. Now I feel pressured to send pics and be into it during sex and I'm just not. I don't really know how to tell her. I guess I feel like pics and attention on my breasts takes away from my status and authenticity as NB in a way. It makes me feel like I'm being used as an object that's shaped a certain way and feels another shape altogether. I hope this sounds supportive. I think feeling this way is exactly why this community exists - we have people who will understand even when our romantic interests don't. It's a complicated and messy world out there for NBs but we do need to continue to speak up about our discomfort with this because it paves the way for the next generation so that those conversations will be commonplace. Thanks for contributing to this awesome community.

If they ask specifically for dick pics, send a picture of Dick van Dyke. It'll shut down that conversation real fast lol
Red flag. Definitely.
I think I’m going to just start saying I don’t have one and see what happens🤣
I once saw a post by someone who sent Gordon Ramsay's forehead
It’s anywhere. But I’m on taimi and bumble the most. I usually do put in my bio “i don’t send dick pics” etc but people still slide in and ask. I just hate that the one part of my body I don’t love is just constantly being asked to be seen. Also, it kind of upsets me they assume I have a dick. I might just start saying I don’t have one to see what happens.
Awww thank you as well for commenting! It is really difficult being NB specifically because it’s so hard for other people to understand that there are maybe certain parts of our bodies that cause dysphoria but not others (and it’s different for every person) so it’s hard to understand. im sorry you have to go through it too :( Im here for you!❤️
[deleted]
As in they're showing red flags
Dry sarcasm is a great option for replying to people like that, in my opinion lol.

Something like ""sorry I cant send you a photo of it, I chopped my dick off back when I was 14"" should work lol
Well I wouldn't recommend lying about it to someone you have intentions of meeting and being sexual with as that isn't fair to them. 

I would assume they think you have a penis because their settings are set to showing them ""men"", I'm not saying that to agree that those things are mutually exclusive but that is what most of society will think because of how ingrained it is. But I understand your frustration especially if you are dysphoric about that part of your body how the whole situation could be uncomfortable.
Aww thanks!
[deleted]
The people asking for pics
EXACTLY LMAO. People are telling me i shouldn’t/can’t do that but watch me do it… like it even says in my bio i don’t want to send them and people are like “LEMME SEE YOUR COCK!!!”

Like, I chopped it off. sorry.
My setting aren’t set to those looking for men. And I would lie lmao. I don’t really care. They don’t really need to know and it’s not people Im meeting up with.
You didn’t understand my post then lmao. I said specifically not liking being asked for d*ck pics. Read the post.
Yeah i got you hahaha. Definitely a red flag:/
Play super dumb, be like what’s a cock??? Wym??
Ahh they are set to looking for women then? That makes more sense then. You are right it's no one's business ultimately, that's for you to decide. But I dunno I'm not really down with lying for sexual gratification as I find it kind of creepy and unfair to the person being lied to honestly but as long as no one is getting hurt I guess.
Lmaooo I can imagine someone being like “it’s what you pee through!” and OP sending a picture of an STP, or being like I piss thru my toenails hbu?
To be fair, i switch between men looking for women and men. and i guess when i say “lie” about not having a dick, i mean more just fucking with them. but i get what you’re saying as well. i wouldn’t say i have a vagina haha"	qi5ru9	NonBinary	84	0.99	2021-10-29 05:41:19
Got discriminated at work. SAD and HURT	"So today I found the courage to tell my superior at work that I am non-binary. I work as a teacher at a high school. 
She basically just told me that it's a hype to be non-binary. And asked where my proof is that non-binary people exist. She told me that I will always just be 'deadname' to her. I didn't know what to say and I was just sitting there in silence letting her say shit about me. 
I just don't know what to do with this. I am so hurt, angry and sad.
How do I deal with this, does anyone have a word of advice?

Sorry for this being a ramble, I just can't think straight. I am shaking with anger and crying like crazy."	"Omg I am so sorry :((

Can you reach out to HR, or someone supportive at work? Sending you virtual hugs 🥺😔
Usually there are anti discrimination laws that say you cant be discriminated against due to gender, sex, or sexuality. Bring it up to hr or some higher up, file a complaint about her behavior and if they dont do anything to stop it or it continues sue them. Make sure they know that you will sue for discrimination if they continue to do it, they are much more likely to do something to stop it if they think you'll actually do something. I'm sorry you have to put up with that. I wish you luck.
Yeah that sucks, so sorry that happened to you...

Is there a counselor of some kind at your school <where you're employed at, I mean can't be the first time they have encountered the topic, right..?> that you could go grab some advice from, if not HR on top of it..?  Would recommend that as well, to at least get her statements in writing so administration is at least aware of her shittyness at least in the long run..?

**HUGS**
Depending on where the school is and the general vibe, you could consider being out to your students. I'm a highschooler and I sort of go to two highschools every day, it's because of advanced classes but that's not important. There is a nonbinary teacher at each school and each is very well respected (as far as I can tell) especially the one at the school with more advanced classes. One of them is still ""Mr. blank"" but has told their students that they prefer they/them pronouns and I  haven't noticed any students intentionally mess it up.
I'm so sorry that happened to you, that was so wrong by them. :( I'd also reach out to someone higher, if needed, someone higher up in the school-district. I'm pretty sure you should have some sort of anti-discrimination laws, which are also for gender?
I had a similar thing happen to me when I tried to come out to someone at my work. He said anyone who is not a man or woman is ""confused by the devil"" and said I will always be a woman to him. So I empathize with your situation.

Unfortunately,  I work for an extremely small company and don't really have an HR to go to, and don't trust my boss to respect my identity any more than that coworker did. But if you feel discriminated against, you should be able to talk to someone higher up the food chain about it.
Do you have a teachers' union? If so, contact them. That is a hardcore discrimination grievance.
That seriously sucks but if you decide to tell your students there's no one quicker to jump down an ignorant adult's throat when they're wrong than an angsty gen Z ally.

When I was in college we even had a running google doc shared amongst the class if we had a transphobic adjunct so we could document every single micro aggression in real time to submit for professor reviews at the end of the semester and more often than not they didn't get welcomed back to teach the next semester.
“where is your proof that non-binary people exist” bitch it’s sitting right in front of you. i’m sorry this happened
Students are far more accepting than other staff. So don't let this stop you from coming out to your classes. As for the coworker you can speak to Hr or your principal /vice (don't know your school's layout) and talk about your issues. It's not their place to decide the validity of your identity. We have a staff and student GSA at our schools here to help with conflicts like that too.
depending where you live you can call what ever HR saying hey this higher-up is discriminatory that shouldn’t be happening
I will look into the anti discrimination laws, that's a good idea. Thanks!
I will do this asap. Thanks for the support, it means a lot
Thanks, it's really nice to hear that the students from your school are so accepting. I will consider telling my students. Thanks again!
This made me laugh out loud. Hahaha.
This is some great advice, will seriously consider coming out to my students. Thanks!
Look at Title IX, I believe they work for high schools.
Sure thing man, I would just wait till the end of the day before you go looking for advise from a counselor there that might be outside if their ""responsibility"" at school yet still in their wheelhouse...

Worse case they can get you in touch with an outside counselor/therapist they might know/be aware of due to their profession generally..?

Also don't forget to follow up with HR too, she could get the hook for saying/doing that to you and it'd be deserved IMO...
I work at a college and started coming out this fall. I didn't make a thing of it. I simply put my pronouns in my email signature and wear my they/them pin. I've had multiple students say something like ""I like your pin"" to subtly acknowledge that they see me and start using they/them for me. These upcoming generations are more accepting than you realize.

I'm currently working up the courage to talk to my coworkers about it. I don't think they'll have an issue since multiple students have come out to us and we've changed pronouns for them. It's more they're very well meaning and may ask questions I don't know the answer to yet. I also don't want to be come the go-to person about dealing with gender identity policy at my job since I'm unaware of anyone else on staff that's nonbinary.
I live in the Netherlands so I dont think that will work out for me unfortunately. But thanks anyway!
I found this link with information about anti-discrimination legislation in the Netherlands with contact information to some anti-discrimination services: https://www.government.nl/topics/discrimination/reporting-discrimination 
There may be more information available in Dutch but I don't speak the language unfortunately. Hopefully the link is helpful in some way because your supervisor's behavior is completely unacceptable!
I’m so sorry.😬 Thank you for being nice about it."	rhw7a6	NonBinary	82	0.98	2021-12-16 17:59:09
I’m kinda sad that I’m not non-binary.	"I know the title seems really weird, but let me explain.

For the past year or two, I’ve kinda questioned my gender identity, after hearing about non-binary online. Growing up, I didn’t mind playing with girl toys despite being a boy. But now I’m alright with being male, but may still like some stuff that many people consider “for girls” like pastels, dolls, the color pink, etc.

So after hearing about non-binary identities, I tried experimenting with different labels, such as gender fluid, bigender, agender (because then I felt like I didn’t understand and/or care about having a gender) and demiboy (because I still felt somewhat masculine).

However, as time went on, I started thinking I’m not non-binary, and that I may actually be cisgender male, because I’ve gotten used to being treated as a man and when I check my gender on online surveys I choose male because if I chose other, it wouldn’t feel right. Yet I also feel kinda sad that I’m not non-binary. I don’t know why, but part of me sorta wishes I was somewhere on the non-binary spectrum. I sometimes feel like I think I could be non-binary, when I might actually be seeking validation from others. Plus I feel like I don’t always think, behave, or feel like a man, so I don’t know what to do.

If you could offer to give me advice in the comments, please feel free to do so. Thank you!"	"Guess what, no one gets to choose your gender except for you 😊 

If it makes you feel any better, the whole concept of things being inherently masculine or feminine is made up...


Being nonbinary can seem freeing because you're not tied to the binary system. Well guess what? You spent all that time thinking about this stuff. You can use all that effort and be your true self. That's what matters most! 

Even you're cis, you can still act on those desires you have and be the man you want to be, rather than the man you were assigned to be.
i think the number one thing to remember is that we live in a world where bullshit expectations are what keep us held to that feeling of whats right as a man, woman, enby, etc. know that there is no right way to be non-binary or a man or a woman or genderfluid or anything for that matter. be kind to yourself and explore your gender identity personally or privately first and experiment with things other than pronouns and tests. try on fem/androgynous clothing or makeup! try wigs or growing your hair out even. if any of this is something you feel comfortable exploring, i seriously encourage you to try it. even so, being a feminine or androgynous male is absolutely and completely okay. don’t let anyone make you feel differently.
That sounds like a very non binary thought pattern to me. I struggled with some of those thoughts too, and I am indeed non binary. If you're not, that's 100% okay. But I don't think cis people are sad that they're not an enby
One thing I forgot to add is that while I don’t really feel like a certain gender, I still identify as male. And as I mentioned before, if I’m not non-binary, why am I kinda sad about being cisgender?
Wanting to be nonbinary is sometimes a symptom of being nonbinary btw
You might find this book helpful: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34138367-you-and-your-gender-identity. Sounds like maybe you still have some thinking to do, even if it’s just to confirm to yourself that you are actually cis. Best of luck on your journey <3
Lots of nonbinary folk identify as their assigned gender at birth in addition to acknowledging there's more to their gender.  You dont have to use different pronouns to be nonbinary.  You don't have to present any differently to be nonbinary.  Being nonbinary doesn't have to mean any more than you want it to mean.  I still mark F on most forms because it's just easier when I live in a state that doesn't recognize any markers other than M or F.  You don't have to dislike who you are to be able to become a better version of you.
It's so important to do self discovery. And if at the end of it you come back understanding yourself more but also learning that you are cis. That's not a bad thing. You can then go forward more assure of your identity than before, and that's okay. 

It seems like you might still be working things out right now, and that's okay too. You don't have to get everything exactly right all the time. Labels can be fluid, and that doesn't necessarily mean you were wrong for using certain ones that you find don't fit in the future.

I wish you the best in your journey, wherever you find yourself.
Aside from everything that has already been said and I fully agree that you are the only one who gets to decide/define your gender. 
I was wondering if you have spaces around you where you can explore healthy masculinity without judgement? It can be difficult to define our gender if we don't have spaces to experiment and you are still ""allowed"" to be masculine and male-presenting if you are non-binary. Anyways, I'd recommend r/bropill for a trans inclusive space that's very chill about masculinity.
You can be a dude who likes whatever he likes. Tonnes of men like different sorts of things and they're still men.
You could be a gender non-conforming cis male. Either way, there's nothing wrong with being cisgender, and there's no wrong way to be a male, cis or otherwise.

Just focus on being true to yourself and don't worry about trying to label yourself. Maybe somewhere along the line you'll discover something different about your gender. Or maybe you won't. All that matters is that you're kind to yourself and others.
Fwiw, there was a time when I thought I was ""a man ig"", but also wasn't afraid of ""women's"" activities: cooking and sewing especially. However, I was nervous someone might call me out on it, so I spent who knows how much energy coming up with various defenses in my head, just in case. It wasn't until after I came out to myself that that layer of noise went away.

Nowadays, my transition is progressing well, and I've started accidentally ""blending in"" with women. I'm non-binary (demigirl+a bunch more), but I do present femme more often than not, and it's just easier to stick to using the women's restroom or not speak up when I'm called a lady by a stranger. It can make me wonder if I'm actually just binary trans sometimes.

At a different end of a spectrum, I know someone who identifies as a man, uses he/him pronouns, speaks with a deep voice, and maintains a light stubble, but also prefers titles like Mx/Majesty/Mistrum to Mr/King/Master, wears heels regularly, and might even transition if there were fewer trade-offs. None of it's a philosophical stance either, and I know he's put the work into self-discovery and isn't an egg. He just says he's non-conforming, and all these things about him are what he finds most comfortable and natural.

So, you can have a lot of binary traits and still be non-binary, or a lot of non-binary traits and still be binary. Gender is weird and confusing, but if ""non-binary"" helps you understand yourself, that's what counts. You don't have to check any other boxes.

Oh, and you may have heard of these already, but you might just need the right masc-aligned name, smth like: demiman, neoman, boyprincess, and there's assuredly more that I don't know about
i can’t really give you advice, but you experimented with things and that’s awesome, you can always try new things to experiment this gender idea, it’s okay if you decide you’re a male too. speaking from my own experience i am also really confused right now if i am a trans girl or a non binary person, but i’m young and i have time to figure it out, and if i never figure it out it’s okay too, i’m just gonna try to live my best life
Hey :) it's absolutely okay. You don't need to have a certain gender to do and like whatever you want. A big part of nb for me is the realisation that there's no recipe, no ingredientlist, nothing you can't like or must do, to cook up your gender. If you like playing with dolls so what? Says *nothing* about your gender. Like wearing particular clothes that are ascribed to certain genders *by society*?! Doesn't make you less or more anything except yourself. Please think of gender as a fundamentally stupid thing.
You sound like me a few years ago.  


All I can say is this: Cis people don't generally say things like this, lol. Sure, you had a masculine upbringing and don't mind masculine labels, but you don't want to be a cis male... which isn't something cis males would ever relate to.  


As I've gone along, I've found that slowly taking steps towards looking what I want to look like, gender regardless, has helped me become more comfortable with the idea of being nonbinary. Grow your hair out, get your ears pierced, buy some more pink clothes. Try whatever you want to try without worrying about whether it's too masculine or feminine for you. Gender expression is way more important for your identity than any labels. Heck, I'm still not sure of what label to pick half the time and I still put male on most documents just to be safe. The internet might have you believe that being nonbinary is a declarative thing, where you must separate yourself from your birth gender entirely. It's not nearly that performative.
I thought this title said you were sad about being nonbinary. 😅

Re: what it actually says: Just because you were AMAB and you don't always object to male terms *DOES NOT* mean that you have to be cis/binary-gendered. You can be nonbinary and still use your AGAB terms sometimes, even be comfortable with that. 🤷 

Pretty sure most cis people I know aren't sad about being their AGAB. 🤔 Frustrated by challenges the world forces on them due to their gender, sure, but not sad.
There are identities like demi-boy and nonbinary man that might be a good fit for you! If you are a cis man, I'm so proud of you for exploring your identity, that's something many cis men are too insecure to do. But if you're this interested and invested in non binary identities, it's pretty likely you are gender non conforming! There's a million different ways to express and explore your gender. Think about David Bowie- a very gender queer individual who identified as a cis male, but still explored his gender expression his whole life, expressing femininity AND masculinity. Don't gatekeep yourself from a community if it feels good to be in it. There is room for you here!
Gender nonconforming cis people are a welcome part our community.
My advice is one day when your not to busy go sit on your bed and do nothing but just thinking about that and then you might come to conclusion, I wish you luck.
You're the only one who gets to define your gender.  You know yourself more than anyone else, and ""wanting to be nonbinary"" is... a sign of being nonbinary lol.  There's no application you have to fill out, no membership fee, no exam, nothing.  If you find yourself wishing you were nonbinary, chances are good you're nonbinary already.  That's literally all there is to it.

It took me an embarrassingly long time to wrap my head around that concept and I still have imposter syndrome over my identity occasionally, but I'm pretty solid in my self identity overall at this point.  I don't look, sound, or act any different than I used to, I'm still the same person, but I understand myself better.  And ever since it clicked I have these flashbacks to the most blindingly obvious signs I have always been nonbinary, such as the glee I got whenever anyone would say ""I couldn't tell you were a girl at first"" when I was a kid for example.
Unfortunately social media has people divided and confused “If you do XYZ, then you’re non binary/non cis” when people are young they often do want validation (not necessarily a bad thing) but this has become an easy way to do it. There’s nothing wrong with being a man and having feminine traits/ideas or ways of thinking, but yeah you’re probably not NB
You might be a nonbinary man, demiboy, genderfluid ranging from agender to cis dude, or just genderqueer which includes all the above along with gender nonconforming cis people. 

Honestly you don't have to label it at all if you don't want to but you're the only one who gets to decide what gender you are.
i think the way you express gender feels different than how you feel your gender is? like you maybe feel like a male but because you don’t like typically masculine things or don’t feel a connection. 

BUT remember that gender is a spectrum, you don’t necessarily need a label. maybe legally you’re male but who knows what you feel. you’re still figuring things out and that’s okay. 

i remember when I realised I wasn’t a lesbian, I was also sad, it felt like apart of me was missing and a part of my identity was gone. but i got used to the fact that i wasn’t a lesbian and i’m totally okay with that now, even though it took a while. you could be in this stage.

just sit on it for a while, don’t analyse how you feel for a bit and just be nothing. you’re just existing. i know you want to figure it out right now, but doing nothing and not labelling yourself IS apart of the process. you’ve got all the time in the world :)
I've been out as genderqueer for like 16 years and I still do not enjoy checking ANY gender boxes on forms, even when they have nonbinary options that make me happy they're available but still uncomfortable checking them. I don't wanna check your fucking box, Susan; stop asking people their gender when it doesn't fucking matter! Also I feel like I'm going to be singled out, or sometimes systems allow for Other boxes but then stop functioning if you actually use them / if they don't match your legal ID. So. Not liking that is not necessarily a disqualifier. Nor is feeling okay in your body or history, or even assigned gender if it's part but not all of you. Keep exploring until you feel right. Even if you don't choose the label, now or ever, you can sit at the enby table if you're looking for validation and people to have your back. The gender binary hurts nonbinary people, but it also hurts people with binary identities but gender nonconforming interests (see: almost everyone, until the world beats it out of them), and I will fucking FIGHT it for you.
I think this can be hard advice but sometimes I personally find the most clarity when I step back from spaces that talk a lot about gender (both in negative and positive lights). When we have too much of a spotlight focus on an issue it's hard to see what's there without any external pressure or forcing anything from the inside based on that. I kinda move back and forth between it and find myself more at ease when I step away from defining myself too acutely, or at least lessening the emphasis of labels. While I do love non-binary friendly spaces as I am an NB myself I find too much talk around gender can be overwhelming. For me it is part of who I am but it doesn't define me. Something that helps me is finding NB or genderqueer related media that has genderqueer people but the topic itself isn't discussing gender.  


One idea that helped me a lot is that labels should work for us, we shouldn't work for the labels. However you feel and whatever label you pick, at the end of the day you are you:)
Lots of good perspective and guidance here. Something to add that’s vital: patience. You don’t have to figure it out all at once or immediately. It sounds like you still have feelings to work through. Maybe you will come down on the cis side of things, but you don’t have to. You’re not signing a contract forever. You’re figuring it out. Try to be open and honest with your feelings and your questions and your searching. It’s OK to figure it all out as you go. In the meantime be as true to yourself and who you are as you can possibly manage.
The gender umbrella is very complex and tries to be as inclusive as possible. After all, this is what the LGBT community wants the most: inclusion and acceptance. The way you describe I believe you'd be gender nonconforming and if you want a more specific label it sounds like fingender (one who's naturally feminine but is not necessarily a woman)
You can choose to be non binary. 
I recognise your feelings. 

For me being non binary means refusing to put female or male as a label on myself. It’s an act of rebellion against others who always thought U was too much like a guy sometimes or too much like a woman etc. 
So now I am like: 

You know what? Fuck you society. I am non binary and I refuse to be anything but just human and me. 

You can do whatever u want and be whoever u want. 

Be non binary if that is what you WANT and what makes you more happy. 

Hugs
i can kind of relate to this in a way, because i had a similar experience of feeling sad that i may not actually fit into the LGBTQ+. 

My story: I always identified as pansexual and genderfluid, but I had a relationship with someone who was also genderfluid that was so terrible i believed that i was not actually pansexual or genderfluid (although come to think of it, i also had my doubts that i was pan when i was in love with a straight cis man too). It’s disappointing thinking you’ve found a label that describes you and a community that will accept you, only to come to the conclusion that it may not actually be the case and you’ve been a fraud and have to remove yourself from the identity and community. I’m not sure if your situation will mirror mine, but eventually i fell deeply in love with a cis girl and that reinvigorated my identity as genderfluid and pansexual. I know people always say you don’t have to have experience to know your sexuality, but having confirmation helped me feel more confident in presenting as pan. And i hated how much i confused people with my gender identity so much that some days I would just accept that no one sees me the way i would like to be seen and it’s just easier to present in a way everyone is familiar with. but when i’m alone, there’s just NO denying the euphoria i feel of switching through genders, the way i dress, the way i act, the way i think is all so undeniably genderfluid and I keep returning back to that no matter how many times i think i might be cis or trans. And at the end of the day, even though i absolutely attribute so much importance to it, it really is just semantics. If the worst thing I am is confusing, I think i’m doing okay.

tldr; i doubted that i was pansexual and genderfluid until i met someone that made me feel certain about those identities.

Idk if this applies to your situation or if you feel the same things i did, and i don’t want to put pressure on you to present a certain way, but i’m just throwing the idea around that you may just be going through a period of self-doubt. Your identity can fluctuate, and it’s a journey to discover yourself. I think the fact that you’ve put so much thought into this and you’re grieving that loss of being non-binary means something that’s not quite cis, even if there isn’t really a label for it. Anytime I thought things like this I would have to remind myself: cis people don’t think about things like this that deeply if at all. Of course, I could be WAY off base here and you could absolutely find pride in being a cis man that wants to overcome gender norms, and i think that is extremely cool and admirable. My favorite celebrities are cis men that love pink and fashion and otherwise “feminine” things. I’d say the best thing you can do is exactly what you’re doing right now, talking about it, especially with other queer people, and experimenting to find whatever makes you feel most like you. I think we sometimes put too much pressure on ourselves to choose something, and how can we not when society literally wants us to check off boxes for ourselves! I really wish we could answer with something more like “still in the process of discovering myself” lol. Maybe someday! Just try not to be too hard on yourself 💖 whatever you identify as, there is one thing for certain: you sound really cool!
The specific label you take doesn't matter, even if that means you're most comfortable just saying your cis and just like feminine stuff also. 

You don't need to be sad no matter what label fits you best it's just a description. As long as you respect the labels of others youre good in my book. 

And the nonbinary spectrum is very expansive you're always welcome if you feel not 100% male or female even if you actually feel 99% male or female. That still makes you non-binairy.
Non binary does not equal androgyny. Non binary also does not mean that you can't present yourself as male. If nonbinary feels right to you, then go for it! 

I struggled with this exact thing, and held off on using nonbinary as a label because I didn't feel like I was ""nonbinary enough"". But the thing about gender is that it has nothing to do with how others think of you, or their opinions, but how you feel. Not to mention, you only have one life, and you can do whatever you want with it. If you want to identify as nonbinary, if you feel that it fits you, go for it! Don't forsake your own discomfort because you feel like you're not ""xyz"" enough. 

Lastly... Cis people don't wish they were another gender 😉

- A transmasc nonbinary
Don't worry about norms.

Almost four billion of the worlds population are male. 4 billion.

Every man is different. Maybe you're nonbinary, maybe you're not. You will see in time. But whether you're a man or an enby, you have one life.

So fuck the gender norms bullshit and LIVE IT.
I often find myself going through periods of self doubt feeling similar. Then my depression and anxiety are a bit more manageable and I think maybe I am a trans man, and then I am much better again and I realise, yea I am still nonbinary, this is just part of me figuring out my feelings with social pressures to be “binary”.
Be proud of who you are, regardless. You took time for introspection which is more than what most do. That's a person who'd I want around.
Liking girls toys doesn’t a non-binary make. It’s about the euphoria you feel while presenting (whether with your name, pronoun, your appearance or voice) as nonbinary - versus the feeling of when everyone assumes you’re a man. Some people are nonbinary who are fine with presenting the exact same physically but they need their pronouns changed, some are fine with their pronouns but need to dress a certain way or change their name to feel at peace with themselves. It’s really down to you and what makes you happy. 

It’s also not your fault that forms demand us to choose between male and female - it can feel more comfortable to pick the one you currently present as than say you’re a woman which may also not be true. 

It’s really all about how you see yourself, what you’d be if everybody got reintroduced to you as a new person and didn’t remember who you were before. Little stuff like what toys you liked, what box you tick on forms and behaviours society sees as masc or femme - lots of cis people bend those rules so it’s not really about that so much.

I hope you find your truth about it all :)
I guess just remember that being non binary is a spectrum inside the gender spectrum and you can easily fit in it even if you don't particularly identify with any particular label inside of it.  


There is no specific way to be non binary. Don't beat yourself up over not feeling or being a certain way. Your confusion is valid and I myself can relate to it and I identify as non-binary. I guess just remember that being non binary isn't well binary even if it feels like that sometimes.
The way I see gender, the labels are just to help others understand. If gender is a spectrum, we ALL lie somewhere on it. The point is you are not confined to age old ways of thinking on subjects such as gender and sexuality. Be yourself; label it if that feels good for you, and most importantly, don’t worry about what others think. This is your experience, so live it true and to your fullest!

Hope this helps ☺️
gender expression =/= gender identity, express however you feel comfortable friend
Because you are struggling with internalized gender norms and toxic masculinity.  If you're not happy being a cis man because of what society expects of you, then... don't.
I think it's really important to distinguish 3 things. 

1. Bodily form, genetics etc, that's what is *sex*,  it's a spectrum with many different bodies from male over intersex to female, and all are valid, and say nothing about your gender.

2. Societal norms that are expected of you because of these bodily forms. That's what was called *gender* half a century ago. People seeing female forms thought ""woman"" and attributed all sorts of expectational bullshit to it. That's the gender that's been fought by 2nd wave feminism, aka ""gender norms""

3. I've never read about it, and i don't think it has a name yet. But there is an feeling inside many of us that says ""I'm a woman/man/x"". It's that intrinsic feeling that hasn't yet a name but is often confusingly also called gender in the last 20 years or so. Many people have that. It's what trans people mean when they say ""I am a ...!"" Some have it, some don't, like me.

If we mix these up problems ensue. And if you say you don't feel like a certain gender, do you mean the third? And if you say you identify as male do you mean the first? Because that is how i feel and I'm non binary.

Please note that this is how i make sense of stuff. I am convinced I'm inaccurate somewhere here, and possibly even wrong. I mean no harm,  this just makes the most sense to me. If you want to make me a smarter person and help me make *better* sense of stuff please don't assume I'm an enemy. I just wanna make sense for me.
Ok, no one hate me please, but I think you might be struggling because you’re thinking all these terms identify some real essence rather than just being our best human guesses at how to communicate ideas with one another. The words are not a gateway to finding the gender inside you. Whoever you are can be expressed in different ways. You’re just looking for the way that will work best for you. Who you are will stay the same no matter what words you choose
I mean, male is your biological sex, whereas gender is man/woman. Being non-binary doesn’t mean that you’re not male, and you can enjoy your body and how it works without subscribing to binary gender. I’m perfectly happy with being female, but have no desire to be treated like a woman. I just don’t feel like my body parts and DNA have anything to do with who I am as a person. I don’t think they should dictate how I act, what clothes/make up I should wear, or how people treat me. I’m just me, and the biology of my body is distinct from the thoughts of my brain. Not all non-binary people feel the same way (obviously), but to me personally I describe myself as non-binary because I don’t vibe with a specific gender.
Lol I agree :) I wanted to be NB and now I am.
When I first came out as nb, I thought that meant that I should be attracted to both men and women. This was not exactly the case and I ended up putting myself through some traumatic events before I came to that realization. Trust your gut, you’re not wrong and by no means should you let a biased computer program tell you any different! ❤️"	z2dydn	NonBinary	81	0.94	2022-11-23 03:23:27
The skirt I ordered a couple days ago arrived, and I was able to snap some pictures. Liked this one the best. Think it looks pretty good, bit might go for a brighter shirt. Bathroom lighting makes the skirt look more black than navy sadly.		"Yes! That's what I'm talking about! The jacket and the shirt make it a whole outfit. You look great! A bright shirt would add a good pop of color I think too.
Thanks! The shirt and jacket are what I normally wear too, so they help make the skirt feel more natural. Still need to get used to wearing one, but I really like how it looks! I can still experiment with other top clothes, so that'll be fun to work with!"	el21x8	NonBinary	80	1.0	2020-01-06 23:06:31
I first introduced myself on this subreddit as Moe, it was a name I wanted to use to feel included in a community that's sadly been stereotyped to the ground. I've decided to go by my middle name, Angelina/Angie, I feel like it suits me and my identity much more :)		"Hi Angie, I remember you from the cat tattoo! It's okay to change your name as many times as you need to find one that you really like, I hope this one makes you happy the now, even if you don't keep it forever 🙂 wishing you a great day!!
Wow, look at that joy! (And that pink hair is just delightful!)

Well, it's nice to meet you, Angie! Only Moe I've ever known is a delightful otter and, let's be honest, he smells like fish.

You claiming yourself is wonderful to see!
Hey Angie! Just remember that you are fantastic and it is alright for you to change your name as many times as you want/need. The name Angie suits you. From, Avery (my new name!).

I got to MX someone	"I don’t have anywhere else to put this, despite the fact I’m likely to get in trouble I did something at work that has made my year.

For context I’m not nonbinary, I’m a pride ally but my own journey got me back to where I started. A straight male. Also, I have Aspergers.

I work in banking on a till, I’m the dick head that comes at you with an tablet and asks you what you want to do today. 

A long time ago now a nonbinary customer came in with a deedpoll and changed their name. They politely asked if we could change their title to MX as part of the process. This sadly wasn’t an option and we settled on the best fit we had as not having one isn’t an option apparently.

I promised I’d look into it and that I would get in touch if it ever became an option. I’ve had that same note in two diaries and it had been a priority ever since. At every opportunity I queried and challenged it. Naturally excuse followed excuse. Then one day a change was made and it was possible. I got in touch...

This is where I’m likely to get in trouble, it isn’t live to the public, we’re not supposed to do it. It’s been trialled but doesn’t yet work 100%. It causes a few select errors we know about and likely a few others that we don’t. I... did it anyway. The customer was aware of the potential issues and was happy to proceed, it’s done, their title is now correct on our systems and I’m so so happy and if I do get in trouble, not even slightly sorry.

I can’t reveal who I work for and I hope you all understand, I wish I could shout about this and help the wonderful members of this group get the title they deserve. I’m continuing to push and challenge everyday for this to be made available to everyone.

If you’re reading this FO I meant what I said, you made my year, thank you so much. Feel free to get in touch but don’t out me on here please!

Love to you all and YAY YAY YAY!!!"	"Ahhh well done!!!! It's the kind of change you are making that adds up and makes for a more inclusive and nonbinary world! My heart is warmed hearing how hard you fought for us all
You have no idea how much difference it makes when people like you help us. This is huge, and everything like this is a massive step towards a more accepting world.

Thank you.
Way to go!! The world needs more people who are willing to get into Good Trouble for the sake of helping other humans 😁
You know, its never occurred to me to check my work systems to see if they can be set to Mx, since we send out so many formal letters (insurance claims). If it can’t I think I’ll suggest that - so agents can set that flag on a person. We have a system to make some claims ‘hidden’ for domestic violence victims, adding a little code to add Mx. to Mr, Ms or Mrs shouldn’t be *that* hard.
Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. It’s so nice to hear from someone that appreciates it. Everyone I’ve told a reaction has just been “whatever”.
Thank you very much, another small step towards where we should be already by now ;)
Yep totally worth it, I’ve little doubt there’s more out there.
It shouldn’t be but it is, I was baffled at the amount of issues just that we know about and more so that after years little or nothing has been done about it. I’ve done my bit now it’s your turn 😜
Ugh that's a very frustrating reaction. I understand how hard it is to push for something that's right, especially in a workplace environment when your superiors do not understand or agree. It's a huge triumph you kept it up and pushed through the ""no's"", and you deserve a lot more excitement for your achievement!
Turns out our system only has male/female options for participants - too lazy to check through a bunch of letter forms for examples where it uses Mr. or some other title, but at least the salutation is “Dear [full name]”.

Looks like I get to have a chat with my manager and submit the idea!

Baby steps. Here’s hoping this doesn’t take as long to execute as some other things since hopefully our legal team won’t need to clear it. I’m dangling the LGBTQ+ advertising/good will opportunity to them which has been a push within the company."	ic8r6e	NonBinary	83	0.99	2020-08-18 20:14:33
How do I parent my NB kid without breaking her huge heart?! 💔	"Hi everyone! I really need your help with how to proceed. My 7 year old came out to our immediate family (my husband, 5 year old and I) as NB. I feel we are supportive and just want her to know she is loved and we are happy and privileged to understand her more. We bought a book on gender, and she has since come out to her teacher, therapist, and grandma (husband's mom).

However, things get tricky when we talk about my family. My first instinct was to suggest that we don't tell them. I have a big and mostly conservative family. I have 5 sisters and two of them I know would be very supportive. I am deeply afraid that the rest, including my mother, will give her negative messaging and cause direct harm (worst case scenario) OR dole out ""I love you anyway"" and ""I love you but don't agree with this lifestyle"" (best case scenario, which is still quite harmful - especially to a 7 year old!)

She told me tonight she wants to tell my two sisters who I know will be supportive, but also wants to tell my mom. How do I do this?? I feel like we can't win here: either I tell her she should hide this part of herself, or I subject her to harm from her bible belt Trump supporting grandmother. Neither of these sit right with me. 

As a final note, I am fully prepared to cut ties. I have no hesitation if that's where we arrive. I'm just so deeply sad that my kid is potentially going to feel all of this and be devastated. Please, any advice or thoughts or support is greatly appreciated."	"Tell your mom initially *without* your kid present and if she wont accept it and would scorn your kid, cut ties and explain to your kid that bigots exist. 

Definitely easier said than done, but this is gonna spare feelings the most. 

If by some miracle your mom is willing to be half decent you can have your kid re-tell her if thats what she wants.
Your kid is very lucky to have you as their parent!❤
I think telling and discussing the matter with the two sisters you mentioned could be a good move, that way you can work together and talk about a variety of options with people who are much more familiar with the more intricate ins and outs of how your mother thinks and operates. 

It's all very easy for us online to say cut ties and never talk to your mother or family again etc but in person relationships of course can be incredibly complex. I did something similar when approaching to tell some of my family, and having a couple extra people (my mother and sister) who were on board with finding a way to make things work/back me up was very helpful, and they brought a couple of views on the situation I hadn't considered. 

Hope all goes as well as it can for you! You're a wonderful parent who obviously cares so much about their child and family and that's what's truly important at the end of the day.
A lot of people saying to protect the kid from bigotry by not telling the grandma. 

Kids are smart. This one asked her mom to tell her aunt's, who would likely be accepting. The kid seems to understand where to find acceptance. Sheltering kids from stuff they already kind of know exists can actually increase fear and model avoidance behavior. (avoiding danger totally a good choice most of the time. But you gotta pick which situations are dangerous vs uncomfortable) 

So it may be a good idea or involve the aunt's, provide support to the kid, and give the option of informing grandma. A kid feeling like they are supported while they encounter bigotry may help them feel more secure than just avoiding known bigotry. That kind of demonstrated, ACTIVE, support from mom and aunts may be hugely empowering for the kid. 

You know your family best, and what would be safe for everyone. But my two cents is to involve those who would be supportive so that they, with your daughter, can make battle plans.
I don't think that equipping your child to face discrimination would be breaking her heart. I realize she is quite young, but many children experience oppressive and harmful forces at ages we think they shouldn't, and being a confidant and walking beside her while she learns to navigate that world seems a much better choice than trying to hide her from it. If she is out as nonbinary, she will undoubtedly experience transphobia while you're not looking.

How are you moderating any other harmful messages she might be getting from her ""bible belt Trump supporting grandmother""?
If you think your child would be in danger, cut ties with such toxic persons. It doesn't matter that they're family -- toxic is toxic, no matter who perpetuates.
im all for the truth is the healthiest choice
BUT this is a child. so, lets protect them.
in ten years they can learn how harsh reality can be. but by then they will be able to handle it cuz their brain didnt had to process weird awful stuff way too early that they internalized in a deep sadness form.
they need to feel safe. so, you can cut ties, you can talk to the grandparents and instruct them how to react. or you can explain your worries to your 7yo and have them decide the next move.
Thank you for trying to be that good for your child. If you need help to understand or for your NB kid to explain other about the gender, I can very dear recommend [Me and My Dysphoria Monster](https://g.co/kgs/FUyDK9)

I read it myself and I love the artstyle. It could also help in school to make the other kids understand yours better.

I cut ties with 99% of my relatives, cause of stuff like actively opposing me being vegan (family Christmas party and to have ANYTHING to eat I had to bring cookies/whatever myself) and so they will never know I'm NB and it's ok for me. They wouldn't understand and I don't need this.

Please stay such a good parent and protect your child from this people who will, with very high probability, just hurt your kid.
Welcome to the messy reality of coming out. A lot of us get caught in tough positions like this. It’s sort of up to you to decide what is best for you and your kid. 

7 is very young. Not too young to know that you are nonbinary (I knew I was trans around 4 or 5 but didn’t have the language to describe it until much later), but very young to really be aware of the social consequences of coming out. I came out as gay at 15 and was not prepared to handle the reaction I got from some of the people around me. I wasn’t emotionally mature enough yet to navigate the turmoil that simply existing as a queer person caused in my life. So it was really hard. Part of me wished I had waited until I was older to come out, but I also know that being closeted was killing me. It’s a rock and a hard place situation. 

I learned some things from that experience and have since navigated coming out as nonbinary very differently. I actually just haven’t come out to anyone in my life that I know would not be supportive. It’s sort of been a balancing act between being my full authentic self while not correcting (some) people who misinterpret me. 

I think you’re right to want to protect your kid from bigotry. I also don’t think you need to totally cut off family that don’t “agree with that lifestyle”. If I was in your position, I would be assertive about your expectations for how your family will treat your child and the consequences if those expectations are not met. Basically, if they can’t say anything nice, then they better not say anything at all. 

I agree with folks who say you should tell your mom without your kid present. Don’t subject your kid to seeing your mom’s immediate reaction to the idea. When I told my mom I was gay, she immediately started crying. I have not told her I’m trans. I don’t want to go through that again. 

It will probably take time for your family to process this new information and actually decide how they’re going to respond to it. So tell your mom, set and expectation about the kind of relationship she will have with your child, and then allow her some time to process before even telling your kid that your mom knows. Figure out the result of the coming out before you present it to your child. To be honest, if I was seven years old and my mom came to me and said “we aren’t going to see grandma anymore because she isn’t supportive of you being nonbinary” I would be devastated. I would wish I could take it back, go back into the closet and have my grandma back. Cutting ties could hurt your child even more than hearing a negative comment once in a while. And it might be good for your kid (in an age-appropriate way) to learn how to navigate relationships with friends and family that don’t have all the same beliefs and values as you. I’m not saying you should dismiss it or say it’s okay, but the fact is that in life you can’t always just cut off the people around you that have shifty beliefs. Sometimes you have to learn how to love each other anyway. 

I chose not to come out to my parents as trans because I did not want to put them or myself through the emotional torment of openly disagreeing about such a fundamental part of me. I try to be authentic around them and let them gain an understanding of who I am just by observing. They have caught on in a lot of ways. My mom no longer buys me feminine clothes because she knows I won’t wear them. She’s still uncomfortable with the idea that I wear men’s clothes, but she keeps her mouth shut about it. So we get along fine because I just have decided not to open the can of worms and harm our relationship any more than it was already harmed when I came out as gay. 

Think about what behavior change you and your child would want to see from family by coming out. If it effectively would not change the way your kid wants to be treated on a day to day basis, then I’m not sure it’s worth opening the can of worms. And if it’s a change in language you are looking for, I think you can express that without ever using the word “nonbinary”. You can share that your child likes to dress a certain way or play with certain toys so your family will buy them things they like and not default to items associated with their agab. If your kid is still using the pronouns associated with agab then that makes things even simpler. Try to use language your mom will understand so she can maybe catch on to what you want from her without having to confront her biases about scary words like “trans”.
Maybe talk to your mother first and see if you can explain it all to her so when your child tells her, she is prepared. If you explain the situation and that there are two choices, respect/kindness and losing you family, she’ll pick respect/kindness. It’s so hard with coming out to family because it is inevitable that someone will have a bad reaction or say very hurtful things down the line or behind your back. That all has been hard for me from when I came out at 13 until now at 20. It was miserable, I cannot imagine doing it so young. Definitely try to protect your child but maybe do it a different way. Don’t hurt them in the process by telling them no you can’t tell your grandma. That’ll damage your relationship and hurt more because they’ll think you’re embarrassed of them regardless of how you’ve acted so far. It’s just a fear us lgbt kids have. Protect your child in other ways. Tell family members that you’re worried about ahead of time and see their reactions. Try to level with them and explain and see if they are willing to be civil and supportive when your child tells them. If not, then protecting your child would be distancing yourself from that family member so your child won’t have to see them much during their coming out process. You don’t want them to get discouraged or to become depressed over the situation. It can be traumatic. Just support your little one as best as you can. My parents made all the wrong choices when I came out and the advice I gave you is what I wish my parents would’ve done
I haven't read through all of the comments, but as someone who has gone through this situation with a tween, I would be very honest with your child about your reservations. It's not that their grandparent is likely to stop loving them, but that they would be confused/concerned. Your child seems savvy enough to understand this.

In our case, we told my parents and my m-i-l. My dad had a negative reaction but has never said anything negative to my child. He just avoid the topic with them and calls them by their legal name & pronouns. My mom doesn't approve, but uses my child's preferred name, but not always their pronouns. M-i-L is concerned and has decided to just pretend that the situation doesn't exist.

At first I avoided the grandparents because of this less than complete acceptance, but my child came to me and asked to visit them saying that they would rather still have a relationship with them because they miss them and understand that they just don't understand not that they don't care.
I would cut ties. I cut off my entire racist, bigoted extended family when my youngest was about your kiddos age. I’m so glad I made that decision now that my youngest has come out as enby.  While you can’t shield them from all bigotry and crappy comments, you can shield them from conditional love from people who are supposed to love them unconditionally.  That is horribly devastating (been there, done that).  And I would tell them that grandma is not a safe person for your family so you won’t be talking to her anymore. My kid has thanked me a lot for cutting my family out and not subjecting them to their bigotry, so I know it was the right choice.  Your kiddo is young enough that unless they had a super close relationship, it will likely be forgotten.
OP, is there a reason you’re referring to your non-binary kid with she/her pronouns throughout? It feels quite jarring in such an otherwise supportive post to see you referring to them in that way.
Equipping your child to deal with bigotry in a healthy manner is very important. It's something most queer people obviously have to learn by themselves, because cisgender and heterosexual identities are pushed on them since birth, which is why a lot of queer people, especially teenagers, don't really know how to deal with bigots. I have learned, it's important not to take interpersonal bigotry from people who don't really have much power over you as meaningless, and not to take it seriously, and obviously it's important to keep yourself out of harms way if they do pose some sort of  threat or have some authority over you. It's tough, but I don't feel it's important for an entire family to know your identity. Most of mine certainly doesn't, and I am happy with that, not only because I know that they wouldn't really get it, but because they don't really have much influence over my life. Don't shelter your child from the reality of the world, being openly queer is not accepted by everyone. And what's more, is that it's important not to come out to everyone. Don't come out to strangers, don't come out to people who's opinions you don't know, and most importantly, don't come out to people who's opinions you DO know, and you know that they're bigoted. 

Also, take all this with a grain of salt. Nonbinary kids are a pretty new occurrence, and so raising one I can imagine to be more than tough, so you'll have to find many answers to your questions yourself, based on your ethical system and what you believe is good and bad. Good luck.
I just wanted to comment to let you know I am in a similar boat(my enby is 10), although my family members haven't completely drank the koolaid, I still fear how they will act. I am glad you're ready to cut ties, because same. Thoughts and support to you and your kid! ❤
I think I speak for everyone in this subreddit when I say that you are an amazing parent for your kid.
This is a good idea. It would be good to have some accurate information on the topic ready because it wouldn't be a good idea to let grandma do her own research in this matter.
This!! Your steadfast support means more than you can know. To be safe in your home is everything.
She came out two weeks ago. I don't think they have even covered pronouns in second grade. 

Jokes aside, we have pointed out the pronouns section in her book about gender. We have talked about pronouns, and left the door open for further discussion. We are in the process of figuring out how she likes to be referred to. Our approach is to present information and let her lead the way as much as possible.
Maybe it’s the child’s preferred pronouns or they haven’t picked new ones yet
If you haven't read the post entirely, the child is 7 years old specifically which means the child in question would most likely be experimenting with pronouns. The parent in question would be coming by with the support and when you have a young child who is coming to terms with themselves, they will be experimenting with stuff regarding to their own identity. Things that you will need to keep in mind is that:  


\- Some people who identify as Nonbinary can still use Binary pronouns to describe their own gender, which means the child may be comfortable with those pronouns generally, however the child also may have requested to use They/Them or similar pronouns specifically. The parent here would be adapting to the child's new pronouns if that were the case, so of course there may be a few errors in the parent's attempts.  


\- Children are more likely to be exploring, which means the child may or may not have found the right pronouns individually. Once again the child in question is at least 7 years old and still coming to terms with Identity and Pronouns, with the parent attempting to support them (By no means do I attempt to gender the child alone, in fact I'd prefer not to refer to one individually until I know of that individuals pronouns).  


Normally this would be explainable for the Pronouns in question, although once again we do not know if the child is specifically comfortable with those set of pronouns and is rightfully set as They/Them until confirmed. My apologies if I am coming off as offensive, I just tend to see that sometimes people do not use a set of Pronouns until they feel it is comfortable for themselves and asks to refer to them as such before they come to terms with it. So maybe the Child has requested, or that the Parent is adapting to the new set of pronouns as the Child has stated privately. I hope this clears up some explanation maybe, as this doesn't feel like intentional misgendering towards a child.  


Once again I do apologise if I have the wrong context, given that the individual in question is a child and children tend to be exploring so it could be one of the outcomes that I stated.
Thank you and to you as well. This is not easy or uncomplicated in many ways. And all because of cultural messaging.
That’s so cool that you’ve talked about it! I was genuinely curious (and I’ve seen a few cases online and irl where otherwise supportive friends and family didn’t even realise they were using a “default” pronoun, and were mortified when it was brought to their attention), so I appreciate your kind response! Letting your kiddo lead the way is absolutely the right approach. I’m happy for her and you.
Yeah I’m nb and I use she/her pronouns so it’s not inherently incorrect
Thank you! People using default pronouns is one of my greatest fears, if some day she decides to change hers. Until then, it's just people generally referring to her as female. 

School bully: ""You have boy hair!""

Well meaning friend: ""No she doesn't, girls can have short hair too!"" 

Neither of them gets it, and it really highlights how a binary is drilled into our heads from birth. 

I asked what I should call her instead of girl, because I'd often start a sentence that way: ""Girl, get your clothes on. We're late!"" Or ""Baby girl."" She thought long and hard about it and said, ""I like 'Honey.'"" 🥺🥰😄
Yeah. My ex boyfriend is nb and he uses he/they pronouns but prefers he in public as to not draw attention. It’s pretty common. Being nb has no rules, that’s sorta the point. You’re just uniquely you and you fall wherever you want to"	x2358l	NonBinary	80	0.97	2022-08-31 03:33:49
Im kinda sad right now can someone cheer me up :(		"You seems lovely and I like your hair! I don't know if I'm very good at cheering people up especially in comment form but here's a nice/silly fact of the day; a group of geese are called a gaggle and personally that makes me laugh. 

But, here's a tip, sometimes when were sad we need a distraction and I know it's rough to deal with that but usually sadness is like every other emotion, it will pass and you'll appreciate being happy a little more after it.

I hope you feel better, friend. You deserve it! 🖤🤍

I'm done with my pre-covid career. The company's local office has closed. It's sad. It certainly wasn't an entry level position. On the plus side, I'm free of all company restrictions. Ever shove earrings back in after 7 years? Not fun, but worth it. It's nice to be free. This is a good thing.		"A fresh start is always good, especially when you look as good as you do!

 Your aesthetic and earrings and makeup look great! I'm totally getting 👑 vibes from your post. 

For some reason, I get the impression that you're background is in the tech industry?  Regardless, I hope you know your worth and bring that confidence with you into the next phase of your career and personal growth 🥰
Wait, you weren't allowed to wear earrings? How come?
Wow! Thank you so much. That's probably the most thoughtful comment I've ever gotten on Reddit. Granted, I tend to post in subreddits that aren't really meant for that type of thing (which actually feels a bit embarrassing every now and then when I realize Reddit has some really good subreddits with thoughtful people and good conversation).
I think this is only the second time I've ever posted here, but I'll definitely be around more often. Thank you for the positivity. Stuff like this goes a long way with me anytime I'm feeling down. 😁😘
It was primarily for safety purposes. The other commenter guessed about half right. I was in the tech industry, but it might not be the first thing people what people think of. I was the draftsman for an industrial insulation fabrication company. I make the stuff that keeps insanely hot and cold things from exploding and from damaging everything and everyone around them. Used to make it 100% by hand. But now I work out the blueprints and a machine does the rest. We had clients all over the place and I spent most of my time climbing up, down and around giant factories and power plants jotting down measurements. I learned better than to use my phone the first time a huge gust of wind sent it flying into Lake Michigan.😂 It's a lot cheaper to replace a 🗒️ than a phone. 
Sorry, this explanation is way too long. I'm reminiscing a little.
Basically, lots of stuff happening in all directions. It was all a giant safety hazard, so you couldn't wear anything extra, even studs. Couldn't even wear my wedding band on the job. 
I might not have made it sound all that great, but it was a unique position and a great company. Kind of required an unusual skill set too. A Math/Science nerd who gets excited about climbing up and down into huge nuclear chimneys during ❄️ storms.😄
Looking at it now, with the benefit of hindsight 🤔, I'm lucky to be alive. I should have asked for more money.😜"	ky7qby	NonBinary	79	0.95	2021-01-16 00:21:59

Some days are good, some I remember that this world was not made for people like me.	"Today I was having fun with my friend, we where out shopping having fun eating ice cream. And I needed to wash my hands. I’m afab and unfortunately very fem presenting so I usually use the female bathrooms but cause u had my friend (who’s a cis man with me) he was like “yeah just go to the guys one with me”, so I did. A man yelled at me from across the bathroom asking if I was a woman or man and even after I said I’m a man over and over he wouldn’t stop. Eventually he made some comment about me not going any further into the bathroom well laughing and left.

Ik it’s not a lot and I’m lucky he was “nice” but it’s just sad knowing I’m not welcome in those spaces Ig. It was so scary. It’s been so hard for me to try take a stand and be confident in who I am. I’m not strong, I’m not brave, I don’t fight back. I don’t want my existence to be something worth commenting on. What if my friend wasn’t just behind the wall, what if that man was more aggressive. I don’t want to live in fear. I don’t want to live in this tiny female body everyone thinks they have a right to. 

I want to have a bathroom I feel welcome in. I want to feel safe."	"I wish all bathrooms were single person, but in public ones why can't people mind their own fucking business? I am quite masc so I'm not comfortable going in the women's washroom to avoid making anyone uncomfortable, but I'm uncomfortable going in the men's room. There's no winning. Usually I'll just hold it til I get home.
Ugh yeah I relate. I'm 5'3 and petite and I hate knowing that anyone who wants to could overpower me. Honestly it's a big source of social dysphoria for me :(
I was in a restaurant the other day with bathrooms labeled ""all-gender (with urinals)"" and ""all-gender (no urinals)"" and I can't use em but I'll be damned if I didn't march my afab ass into that urinal-bedecked bathroom like I owned it
I feel this. Some days when I’m presenting very masc and my friends say I pass as a guy I’m terrified to go into the women’s bathrooms because I don’t want to bother anyone in there. I have been given weird looks before and I hate making people feel unsafe. But when I go to the men’s bathroom, they also clearly see that I’m not a man, either. It just feels so awkward. I love when I can find a single toilet bathroom or the VERY few and far between gender neutral one. I typically just take family ones if I can manage to find them.
Same...
I don't use men's bathrooms for that reason, but I'm double equipped to react violently if anyone gets in my face about my gender presentation on the streets.

I was exposed to violence at home, in school (for being neuro-divergent and masculine) and attacked in some street crimes. I also grew up watching crime on TV. I ended up developing PTSD. You know, one day I just got tired of it all and begun carrying weapons and training in self defense. Its been a long time that nothing happens thou. I think that my thousand yard stare, short white hair and muscular build scare people away even when I'm not trying.

Weirdly enough most of the time when I'm in women's bathroom they don't bother me, in fact they tend to smile even sometimes. I keep to myself and avoid eye contact. I would prefer using gender neutral bathrooms thou.

But you deserve to be in this planet as much as anybody else, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
With guys, it’s all about not backing down, you did the right thing. If someone sees that you’re just not going to back off, it will usually cause them to at least hesitate. If all else fails, carry pepper spray
For your safety I would advise you not to use a man's bathroom if you're fem presenting. Most people are ignorant on queer issues and things could absolutely have gone wrong for you. The first rule is to stay safe.

With that being said, I am so sorry. It must have been really scary and frustrating. The world hasn't been made for people like us, but slowly we're gonna make it so everyone who comes after us, has it better and better until things work the right way. I hope you can find comfort in your friends and in the LGBT community. You are your identity, not what they see you. Sending you love.
Unfortunately holding it isn’t an option for people who have gut or bladder issues :/
Yeah it’s just soo harddd…
Yeah it’s awful. I feel so week. Most of my female friends are also taller then me. I hate everything about it
Omg that’s amazing!!
*Fuck* yes, that is how we **slay**.
Yeah. It’s soo hard !!!
It sucks
Thanks!! It’s so hard. I also am nerodivergent and have ptsd but the ptsd is just from my parents. It’s so hard for me to stand up for myself.
Yeah
Thanks so much. Yeah I always use female bathrooms but my cis friend convinced me to go with him.
Absolutely, it's not always an option to wait which of course is why they exist anyway. Just wish the norm was a private form of public bathroom.
There is not much you can do about parents, best is to put all focus on becoming independent. 
If you have the chance please find a krav maga gym.
Me too! I also just wish people would shut tf up about who goes in which bathroom. They should just mind their damn business.
Yeah I’ll try sounds like a good idea. Thx"	xvc9zj	NonBinary	71	0.96	2022-10-04 11:12:32
I got called sir the other day (I'm afab but also I'm 6ft so I get it) and even tho I don't want people thinking im a girl I also get sad when people think I'm a boy. oh well		"sorry I shouldn't really be complaining like this! I just get confused about what I want to present as  lol
I think you're cute.
I feel this (also 6 feet tall). Like I wish people would just never gender me in any way ever.
I feel this so much tbh.. 

You look great btw! C:
guess I don't have to present as anything. OK I'm just talking to myself at this point
Thanks. :))
Lol right
my perspective, that took me a while to develop, is that as long as you know who you are and you’re proud of that... others comments or opinions of you feel irrelevant, except those that want to know you and put in that effort. I think this is important just because a huge majority is uneducated about queer culture and the understanding of what it means to identify as NB. but I hope you get that chance to educate as many people as you can:) you’re lovely btw!"	gbekgw	NonBinary	71	0.99	2020-05-01 08:49:26
Pregnancy Feelings	"I’m 22, identify as nonbinary, use they/them pronouns and am 28 weeks pregnant. 

Maybe I’m just looking to vent but I feel like most people who fit into their assigned genders at birth don’t understand.

I’ve always prided myself in and enjoyed androgyny. I know I don’t owe that to anyone, but becoming pregnant has seemingly ruined all of that.. I’m frequently misgendered and deadnamed and it’s killing me. I look like a pregnant woman, my stomach is round and my breasts are considerably larger.. which is seemingly harder to fit in more masculine clothing, which is what i’ve always preferred.. and ALL maternity clothes are so feminine presenting. I feel like I am so permanently trapped as being labeled a woman due to this. I want this child and I am so excited to be a parent but I feel so invalidated and dysphoric. 

I’m sad. I don’t feel happy in my body and my social presentation. My partner has been lovely, he assures me I am valid in my feelings and that I don’t owe anyone anything.. but it doesn’t mean i’m ok with  not passing as well as i used to be able to."	"Come on over to r/Seahorse_Dads ! 
I’m 25 weeks pregnant with my second kid and I feel every word of your post. You’re not alone, you’re not invisible, and I’m sorry because the situation STINKS.
That is tough! I can only imagine what you are going through, as I can't gestate life...but I did do a bunch of work in the gym before my egg cracked and now I feel like I made myself less androgynous right before I accepted that I didn't want to look like a man anymore.

I keep reminding myself that gender doesn't look like anything, and that our presentation should be for us, not for others. Then I get misgendered, and it feels much less straightforward. I guess, in the end I feel like society is wrong, and there's nothing I can do to unfuck that. I will be harmed by their views, including the internalized transphobia that I learned as a child.
Hey, I'm sorry to hear this. As for the presentation - maybe try getting larger shirts? I know it's not much, but something to look into maybe?  
In either case, stay strong, you'll get through this! Everything comes to an end eventually! <3
I understand you very well. My kiddo is two and a half now, and when I was pregnant I just lost all sense of self and who I was. I didn’t recognise myself anymore. I love my child more than anything but somedays I do feel like I gave up a part of myself. I know I’ll never choose to be pregnant again and if we want a second child we’ll adopt.
As a enby who just had a baby, I found men’s shirts to be way better fitting and more comfortable than maternity clothing. I bought tshirts in several sizes larger than I got pre-pregnancy (S —> XL) and it worked out great.  

The other thing that was really helpful was my whole care team knew I was nb and supported and respected me. Everyone along the way (and all the folks at the hospital) asked me what titles (mom/dad/other) I wanted to use and used my pronouns.
I feel for you. Gender stereotypes are awful. But keep in mind that men can get pregnant. And so can enbies. Being pregnant doesn't mean you're a woman. You have every right to seek out clothing that best expresses your gender and wear it with pride. The only way to break the stereotypes is by expressing our gender identity and sexuality with pride, and advocating for equality

solidarity, comrade
I am so sorry you've been made to feel like this. Kudos to your partner for validating your feelings and being there for you! I wish there was a clothing line for pregnant non-binary people that don't wish to present as feminine. 

Someone needs to make clothes for pregnant non-binary folks!
I felt this post so hard. I spent my whole pregnancy wanting to climb out of my own skin. It was awful and beyond awful. But for whatever it’s worth, it IS survivable. And at the end you get a baby, which is also hard but also pretty rad. I’d do it over again to get kiddo here, hands down. Thinking about having the baby here in my arms and not occupying my body anymore was what got me through it. But you are super not alone in this feeling. 

*suckiest solidarity fistbump*
That does sound like a very tough spot to be in. I never thought about maternity clothes being feminine, because every pregnant person I've met has been feminine so it fit pretty well.
I hope it'll be okay if you keep thinking about your baby and how great that's gonna be. c:
I feel like as far as trans acceptance has come, the idea that not only women can bear children is going to take a bit longer for society to get. Push the envelope, you know we all love you for it!"	zotmls	NonBinary	70	0.95	2022-12-18 08:15:25
9 months on T + Finasteride (DHT Blocker) Update (x-post from r/ftm)	" 

Hello everyone,

It's  been a while since I made an update about the T+Fin combo. This post is  going to be copy and pasted from my last one and changed where there  have been changes. The purpose of these updates is to provide  information as there is hardly any out there from people who have done  it since starting T, and this is a combo a lot of people, especially  nonbinary people, are interested in. Fin is a DHT blocker which is  responsible for a lot of changes we attribute to testosterone, but not  all.

Sorry I don't have a video. I am too self-conscious to do vid updates :S

Note  that I am also on Wellbutrin (have been for a while) which is known to  affect things like libido (though usually increases it, which I did not  find to be the case for me) as well as other potential things T/Fin  might have affected, so keep that in mind.

Some  background: I started T and Fin at the same time. I'm on 50mg of T  cypionate subq weekly and 1.25mg of Fin daily. I am 5'4"" and when I  started I was 120lbs, pretty petite and very ""cute"" in a way that has  people vastly underestimate my age. I am 30 and have never passed as  male no matter what my hair and clothes are. I have pretty wide hips for  my size and smallish chest, and I'm starting out here with a figure  that wont pass as male without some physical changes. My starting voice  was pretty high and pretty west coast and difficult to throw lower.

What I wanted from T: voice, muscles, change in body shape, and a better self image, more energy

What  I didn't want: body hair, facial hair, losing hair, bottom growth, high  sex drive, the supposed thicker feeling skin? That's kind of whatever  but I like my skin how it is. Being smelly. Acne.

Anyway  so with all that in mind here is what has happened over 9 months on  T+Fin. I started in 8/6/18. My latest T levels are in normal male range.

**Hair**

* No  significant change in body hair. The actual hairs haven't gotten  thicker/darker, nor has much more of it appeared. Possibly more on my  legs, though I usually shaved and now I haven't so I'm not entirely sure  how it compares to what it would have been before without shaving. But I  think it's a little more. Arm hair has not changed at all. There might  be a tiny bit more on my stomach but not enough that it looks  'masculine'.
* No facial hair at all.
* Head  hair has not changed. I dont notice much more of a masculine hairline,  but I also naturally already had a pretty masculine hairline.

**Voice**

My  speaking voice is lower, at an androgynous level. It's not so much  lower that people always comment about it or ask about it but it's  definitely a lot lower than it was. I don't think it sounds male exactly  but I think that has more to do with the quality than the depth and I  could probably work on it to make it sound more male. I don't think I'm  going to until I start visually passing more and have top surgery. I can  sing many notes lower than I could when I started, but I still can hit  most of the high notes I started with also which is unusual. I can still  sing in my head voice. It's possibly even improved in sound because  it's more resonant. Weird. I haven't had much cracking exactly, but for  several months it felt kind of uneven to talk. It's a little better now  though still sounds kind of funny sometimes. Somewhere in the middle of  my range, the transition between my headvoice and not when singing was  kind of sketchy depending on where I tried to switch. I assume my voice  is not done doing what it's gonna do.

**Body**

* I  have noticeably larger arm muscles and shoulder muscle/trapezius, calf  muscles. I don't work out though my job is slightly physical. I notice  new muscles occasionally I never noticed before. I can do 10 normal push  ups now while doing even 1 before was difficult. Yay. I should actually  lift some weights one of these days.
* I think there's been bottom growth but I don't think it would make someone look twice if someone were to see it.
* Period  is... annoying. Two months ago it was weird. Then it skipped a month  but I had cramps from hell that I've never experienced before. Then I  had it as normal the next time which made me pissed off. So T is  definitely affecting it, but it's not entirely getting the memo. My doc  things if i took a larger dose every other week, it would stop it. I  might switch to that and see how I feel about the high/low.
* As  for libido. I am ace and my libido has always been pretty minimal. At  this point its like. Mentally it feels kind of high especially for me,  but physically its still kind of eh! Like my interest is much higher but  my actual physical response isn't really that high. And if I'm doing  other things in the day I don't really think about it. It's really only  when I start getting bored.
* I  don't think I've had a dramatic change in my physique/fat distribution  yet which isn't that surprising given that I don't do any cardio. My arm  muscles have made several of my smallest shirts not fit anymore, like  at all. I still have a small waist. I've gained about 10 lbs so am now  around 128-130. I wear the same pants size--I assume its muscle weight  (or maybe water weight as they say). I don't think I look any heavier.
* Body  smell is not significant. If I wear my normal deoderant its a nonissue.  The smell of nether regions is like. I guess different? I'm not a fan  of it but its not nearly as bad as some people here describe.
* Acne  has been irritating. But I have struggled with it as an adult so much  that I had been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for  the first month or two on T but then got off. THey're definitely  annoying but not horrific.
* No changes in hands or feet.
* Face  looks mostly the same, but the jaw has gotten more defined. The muscles  of my jaw are much easier to feel. But I still don't really pass lol.
* Skin feels the same.
* Energy  level is the same for the most part, although I find the physical  aspect of running to be much easier. Sadly I still get asthma attacks so  I dont do it.
* Appetite is the same.
* At  3 months I said: ""A lot warmer, sweat more easily, get cold less."" Well  either I got used to that as my new normal or it kind of went away  cause I feel like all that is basically the same as it always was again  now. Maybe still get cold a tiny bit less easily but meh.

**Mental:**

* I  haven't noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or  emotionally. I cry at the same level as before. Everything like that  feels the same.
* I think I'm a little sleepier.
* Slowly  getting more comfortable with idea of some of the things I didn't want  happening. But I don't know that I actually want them.

I don't pass. As far as I know my voice hasn't passed on the phone.

Hmm.... I can't really think of anything else. But if you have questions about anything, feel free to ask or pm me."	"wow, this is what I'm also trying to pursue, thanks for the post... looks like you found an amazing doc, may I ask which country? where I live is fucking hard to get T as non-binary
Thank you so much for providing this information! I was thinking about doing something similar but had no idea Finasteride is a DHT blocker or which changes are caused by DHT. Now I'm planning on starting Finasteride after a couple months on T since I do want bottom growth, but other than that, the changes I want are the same as yours. Keep the updates coming and good luck!
Thank you for posting this, I’ve been looking more and more into DHT blockers but haven’t found much information that’s not catered towards cis men. I’ve been discussing it with my doctor since I’m concerned about my hair thinning but we were both very uncertain. I’d love to hear more follow ups in the future if you’re comfortable with that
I would love to see an update of this

Thank you SO much for this!!!
Its been 4 years since this post and wanted to ask some questions. Are you still on the T and Fin combo? Ive been thinking of trying DHT blockers because I don't want the exact same thing you don't want. So i was wondering what other changes you have seen after 4 years.
I am in the USA. It's definitely easier if you just act like you're ftm. Everyone at the doctors will already assume it and sometimes it's better to just benefit from people's assumptions. Even if you don't want all the changes on T, just act like you do.
same
hi, I went off fin for a little while because I felt like I wanted more changes but ended up going back on fin before much actually changed. The only notable thing was that my voice dropped more when I went off fin so I know there is some level of impact there. Recently I went off both fin and T because after years of little change due to the fin I thought it didn't make sense to keep taking T. Though I will miss the muscle mass I'm sure... lol.

when my hair was short I passed occasionally. And on the phone it's half and half. But overall because I started as a petite cute person and I now have long hair, I don't pass much.
thanks for the answer, makes sense. but I'll see, I am really tired of pretending to be things I'm not, I'll try to be true to myself and if it does not work I'll find alternatives to the local official healthcare process...
When you went on Fin. Did you gain any weight? One of the main reasons I love T so much is that it helps me lose weight easier, but I also don't want bottom growth. So I'm having a hard time finding if there is a way to have both, no bottom growth and a faster metabolism
this is definitely a little late but just in case anyone else sees this: Planned Parenthood provides Testosterone prescriptions to Nonbinary identifying people. They use an informed consent model!
I know the feeling isn't good but in the big scheme of things you don't actually interact with these people much. Still, best of luck however you approach it.

fin doesn't completely stop bottom growth .. kind of like the voice I think it does somewhat but some degree will still happen anyway. I was on T four years and overall gained about 20lbs, some muscle and some from just eating more... I also am pretty sedentary. I don't know if fin had any influence on this.
I was told they don’t do micro dosing by my doctor when I moved states and was looking for hormones in a new area

What if it is a sin?	So idk im bisexual non-binary and i think homoromantic but the thing is i came out to my mom a while ago since then she told me that she knows that she cant cange me but she wants me to see things from a different perspective (she thinks being gay is a sin) and she talked to me on a few different ocasions and she explained why its a sin and stuff and some things actualy made sense and she told me that tonight she had a dream that i was reading something gay and there was a devil next to me and he was saying something and tgere was an angel that was crying and he said he cant help me and my mom told me she couldnt sleep because of it and that she is very worryed and idk what to do im scared of making a mistake because if it is a sin and i keep living like that then ill go to hell but if its not and i listen to my parents then ill probably live a sad life because im homoromantic i just cant be in a romantic relationship with a man and idk what to do im very confused and i dont care how many people tell me its not a sin i just idk who or what to belive and im hella confused does anyone have some advice?	"[deleted]
Ordained pastor here (in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America). Two masters degrees in divinity and theology. Also non-binary.

It’s not a sin.
If being gay is a sin, then so be it. If nobody sins, Jesus died for nothing and we can’t have that.
i really encourage you and your mom to look into some resources at The Family Acceptance Project. Your mom is not bad for believing what she believes, however, her beliefs are having and will continue to have a negative impact on you right now, right here, in this current life. Family Acceptance Project has some resources on families of faith learning to better support their children who are LGBTQ.
First of all: whether you sin or not, it doesn't matter: God loves you **unconditionally**   period.

And if you want to see a great video about why homosexuality is not a sin, you can watch this: youtu.be/WqYvkVqVLFo (you can watch this with your mom too)

He founded a non-profit which could be helpful for you: www.estuary-space.org

Hope I could help you. When you want to talk about why I don't think homosexuality or being trans* is not a sin you can write me here or send me a dm.
I'll pray for you and your family and that you can feel the love God has for you and that you can see, that he created you the way you are
Oof. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, friend. I also come from a highly conservative, traditional religion/family and have been dealing with those sorts of things by slowly leaving the “church” part of my faith behind while keeping what’s important to me. 

Dreams are often just reflections of our subconscious, and it sounds like you’ve been ruminating over whether who you are blossoming into is inherently “sinful” or not—that’s the most logical reason for that kind of traumatic nightmare. Idk if you come from a Christian tradition or not, but if you do, remember that God is Love, and God is Truth, and everything flows from that. Be gentle with yourself, and be kind to yourself. Sending love & support your way
Sweetie, you wouldn't be graced with the gift of being able to love so much, and being who you are, if it was a sin that could send you to hell. I am not personally a Christian at this point in my life, but I grew up in a sect of Lutheranism that was fairly strict and prioritized a lot of talk of repenting for original sin etc. All of my study of the Bible in those years, as well as my reflection on religion and the Grace of God etc, led me to believe this in regards to the Christian faith: if God is supposed to have created everything and then said ""it is perfect,"" even with the introduction of sinfulness after the fall from Eden, then the concept of being doomed to hell for traits that are inherent to you is fear-mongering by your church leaders to get you to fear them, not the divine. 

I am also bisexual homoromantic and non binary. Being true to myself and having the room to express this and understand it has been one of the most beautiful things in my life. I have a wonderful, lovely, wife who is a non binary trans woman of the same orientation and I have found that experiencing love and acceptance like this is incredibly healing and positive. I absolutely promise that things get better. 

Your gender fluidity is precious, it is a cosmic gift. There will be other people in your life who will understand and love and accept you as you are. Your bisexuality and homoromanticism are also both wonderful things because you have an ability to open yourself to love and intimacy in ways that some can't and that perhaps you didn't expect, but you get to discover it all for yourself and then share it with the people who love and respect you back and most deserve it. 

I can't fathom a divine entity who would reject its divine creations. I can't fathom a loving God who would punish you for these joyous, beautiful things about you. And truly, as difficult as it can be being LGBTQ+ in spaces that are less than affirming, especially if you don't know many folks who share that, your identity and your love is something that should be cherished. 

I can't tell how old you are, but it sounds like these revelations are newer for you and I just want to emphasize that it can be ok, it does get better, and if religion is something that makes you feel good, there are spaces for you as a religious LGBTQ+ person that will affirm you and show you the love you deserve.
If it’s a sin, I don’t care. I don’t respect any deity or god who considers love a sin, so if I end up being wrong about religion when I die (I’m agnostic), I don’t really care either way. I don’t want into a “paradise” full of judgmental assholes, and a heaven without gay people isn’t a place I’d want to be anyway.
Sounds like she's trying to guilt trip you
If being gay/non-binary/homo romantic is a sin, why would God have made you that way?

I grew up in a 7th Day Adventist home with really strict rules (for example, couldn't wear pants unless it was 20 below - always had to wear dresses and skirts). I knew I was gay from the time I was in 3rd grade. My father figure, in addition to spewing constant rhetoric about all gays being perverts and pedophiles, also told me that heaven was segregated, and me being mixed, he wasn't sure I even qualified for heaven anymore. That hurt. I knew his God couldn't be the same God that made me. I studied other forms of spirituality, moved out, and now I'm living my best life with my beautiful nonbinary boifriend and all our supportive friends and colleagues. Idk what the exact point is of me sharing this story besides letting you know that, if you're a teen or just a young adult living with your mom, there's so much more to this world than feeling shame for who you are. Keep being introspective, learning about yourself and your faith, and forge your own path. Nobody else can do that for you. And I'm sorry your mom is having this reaction to you. It's an ill-informed, possibly well-meaning reaction - but it's not right.
I personally left the church behind, however, I can tell you that biblically, your mother is wrong.

The current translations that vaguely condemn homosexuality are mistranslations. Many of the figures in the Bible were very queer in their original telling before things got left on the cutting room floor. (Lookin at you, David) There's so much more to the story, and modern Christian texts do a lot to cover that up and purposefully misunderstand. 

The first person to teach me about nonbinary identity was actually my father. He was an Evangelical pastor, and got into reading the books that had been tossed out of the Bible. He told me he read about how God was a combination of masculine and feminine beyond human understanding that resulted in a nonbinary identity we addressed as He. Aka: my conservative as hell dad was telling me about he/they pronouns before I even knew about wtf being trans even meant. He, of course, continued to be a transphobic jerk because that's my dad's thing, but he literally got that idea from Biblical texts that the Catholics thought were too spicy, so I think God understands just fine.
Find some affirming spaces for your faith, if not in person then at least online. There are lots of people asking these questions in all the major religions, people who want to take their beliefs seriously while setting condemnations of 'gay stuff' in their historical context. For the record, this kind of targeted use of dreams etc, while well meaning, can also be seen as manipulation and spiritual abuse.

If you let me know where you are and what your faith is I can look out some legit resources for you - and feel free to dm if you'd like
please cite the bible passage that says gender nonconformity is a sin
Here is my take on the issue of sin: 

If God has an issue with me, I'll settle it with a shotgun.
Are you and your mom christians? Tell her that it's considered a sin to betray trust of a partner - and that what she's been taught sounds like 'homosexuality is bad' only because it applies to a cishet people in a heterosexual marriage who already have a partner - the vast majority of people. Not to bisexual or gay people, or polycules who all consent to poly relationships. Love, sincere love for a person, not out of infidelity, cannot be a sin. Otherwise Jesus himself would be a sin, and that contradicts the very core of christianity. Tell her that if she a) doesn't believe and trust you, her own child and b) continues to threaten love with her misguided beliefs then she's willingly serves forces directly opposed to love, altruism and Jesus - selfishness, hate.


Since she's not an 8 bhumi bodhisattva - and if she were she would have never said those things to you -  she cannot see anything but karmic traces and Mara tricks - so don't worry much about her dreams. It's just how worried she is about you, although this worry is born out of delusion.


 Please update us on how it goes!
There are lots of Christians, laypeople, ministers, pastors, who do not agree that God would both make gay and trans people and consider us a sin.

I personally left the church, I couldn’t handle it after questioning so much of who I was but I truly miss my spirituality and now I am surrounded by churches who welcome people just like me.

If it is a sin, then by the same beliefs, all humans are sinners and it is faith in the power of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice that Christians are redeemed. Not through their own merits, but through their belief. Lots of different ways that these beliefs end up being discussed and lots of different denominations with different preachings about exactly how you get into heaven. But I really cannot imagine a god worth following whose messengers say they love everyone on Earth, yet this whole population is set up to never be able to do the things that will give them fulfillment and peace or they face damnation. If someone came to you with a new religion like that, would it be compelling? Would it seem like a positive thing?

It would be nonsense. Just like racism and sexism in Christianity is nonsense, so is homophobia and transphobia. Jesus spoke of seeking the outcasts and welcoming them in, not forcing them to give up their humanity and suffer. Find Christian theologians who cherish you and love you half as much as your God does. Don’t surround yourself with hate.
she's fucking crazy.

as long as what you do isn't objectively immoral, being yourself should never be considered a sin.
My heart breaks that you had to hear those things from your mother. Being bisexual and non binary is not a sin, love. There are people who believe it is, because they are very buried in religion and tradition. But just because you love those people, like your mom, does not mean you have to believe the same things. She might be trying to help you in her own way, but the things she's saying are damaging. Her dreams are based on her religion, and her fears.

She can believe what she likes, but who you are is not up to her. It's up to you. 

Follow your heart. Be yourself. Don't let others make you afraid of who you are, because that is your greatest power. 

Please don't spend years of your life pretending to be something you aren't to make someone else happy. I speak from experience, it's not a happy existence. 

It's hard to stand up for yourself, to be yourself in the face of disapproval or worse. But I promise you, it's worth it. Be you, and don't let anyone take that away.
It’s not a sin.  You are who you are and there is nothing wrong with that ❤️
If it was, in fact, actually a sin, that would have a few distinct implications:

The first is that your mother somehow has had cosmic knowledge instilled in her to divine the ancient question of ""is God, Heaven, Hell, Angels, and/or Demons, real?""

Then it would imply that the millennia of religions before and after the birth of Christianity,or Catholicism, which both are relatively new historically speaking, are 100% false.

Then it would imply that your mother was capable of understanding the thoughts and feelings of God, God's specific attitude towards your behavior, and how God picks who goes to hell and who goes to heaven.

There are more but I'll conclude this segment by saying your mother implies God is not perfect, omnipotent, or all loving, by making a mistake with creating you and being willing to punish you for something you can't change. 

Essentially as a Christian, it's your mother's job, as told in the words of Jesus, to love and support you through ""sin"" without making you feel afraid or shameful. If she can't do that she fails you a mother, and fails God as a believer.

She is also using hell as a threat to make your fear for your immortal soul mean more than your choice of who to love. Jesus chose who he loved, and was punished for it anyway. 

Choose to be like Jesus, without fear of consequence for your love.

Tl:dr mom's beliefs are valid but they are beliefs and should not be used as a fear tactic with her kids, ever.
Short answer: nope not a sin, and the concept of sins is highly illogical to me anyway (who cares if i have sex?? Or eat and sleep a lot??)

Long answer: I'm so sorry you're going through this with your mom. It is totally inappropriate and manipulative for her to tell you about this dream. All she talks about seems to be god and sin, so I'm not surprised she had that dream.

Soon after I first realized I was gay, I had my first sleep paralysis dream where the devil was standing next to my bed. It was terrifying, and I spent too long with the deeply held fear I was going to hell. It took me a long time to unlearn that, here's what I know to be true:

1)I'm not hurting anyone. My struggles as a queer trans person have made me kinder, stronger, more empathetic, more of an activist. Those are very, very good things

2)If there is a god, they will see that what I am, who I am, is better for it. My purpose is to help humanity, animals, and world in general. If there is a god who would condemn me for it, they can fuck right off and I'll reform hell on my way back up.
The word homosexual did not appear in the Bible until 1946 it was a bad faith translation of a word that actually means pedophile. And the line that read man shall not lie with man was retranslated from man shall not lie with boy. These were translated in this way to fit the agenda of the translators at the time to justify their own homophobia. Many Christians today do not ascribe to this translation of the Bible. Do not let anyone, even your mom, scare you with hell because of the bigoted beliefs of a big group of white men in the 1940s. I don’t personally believe in hell but I can’t imagine someone being sent there for loving who they love and the Bible does not support this idea either. You are amazing as you are. 

I am also a non-binary bisexual homoromantic. I have been living out and proud for 5 years and they have been the happiest of my life. Don’t let anyone keep you from a happy life <3
Hi pal,
Dreams are illustrative of what's going on in the dreamers mind. Your mom having a dream like this just means that's what's going on in her head, it's not reflective of any reality. 

Assuming you come from a Christian background, I'd assure you Jesus never mentioned homosexuality. 

Check out this video from God is Grey, she's a Christian YouTuber who affirms LGBTQ people and explains how some things in the Bible can be misinterpreted or lost in translation over the years: https://youtu.be/SGcyqFKBH5M
I'm not an expert in religions but I've observed over time that religious works and beliefs are often twisted and weaponized after their original creation to be used against people that are 'different'. From what I've learned about a few religions is God's all encompassing love for all He's created, and that that love should be embraced and practiced by His subjects. Unfortunately I think your mom is just scared, she doesn't understand, she may have grown up being taught being different in this way is bad. You're not hurting anyone, you're being true to yourself, qualities that sound like something any well meaning God would encourage, u know? 

I apologize if any of this is out of line! I indeed take criticism. I wish you the best with this, be gentle and kind to yourself
This is strictly through a Christian lens. There are so many of philosophies that aren't homophobic for no reason. If you're worried about it from the perspective of your own faith, the christian bible doesn't even take issue with homosexuality. It takes issue with pedophilia, which was purposely mistranslated to homosexuality. That's a whole other thing.

So the fear is based in religious ignorance on top of regular ignorance.

The only 'Sin' I see here is parents pressuring their child into deepening self-hatred just so you can fit into the box they picture you in. Good parents don't do that. You are a whole person outside of them and they do not own you or you feelings.

You destiny is your own, not theirs. Stay free, stay happy, stay true.
If God exists, and loves you, and made you, then how you feel comfortable expressing your identity, and who you're attracted to shouldn't be an issue. If you believe God doesn't make mistakes then you're made the way you should be and shame has no place there. Either way, shame is not a useful tool for growth and I hope your mother opens her views up a little. 💕
There’s a theologian named Walter Wink who wrote an essay on homosexuality and the Bible, that you can find [here](https://reconcilingworks.org/images/stories/downloads/resources/003_Homosexuality_and_the_Bible-Wink.pdf). 

Using specific biblical examples, and combining a multitude of perspectives, he basically makes the point that *“there is no biblical sex ethic.”*

I have found this to be an excellent resource when I have to, yknow, justify my humanity and the humanity of others to rabid Christian folk. 

Mind you, it was written in 1979, so its tone feels outdated at times, but I think it’s honestly one of the better Christian-based counterpoints to anti-queerness I’ve ever come across.  
  
Hope this helps!

Edit: typos
God creates everything, so He wouldn't have made you bisexual, nonbinary, or homoromantic if you were going to be sent to Hell for those things. I'm admittedly not Christian, but from what I understand He wants you to be happy and help others be happy. I don't think you'll be sent to Hell for being the person you are
Your mom should look into the origins of verses that say homosexuality is a sin. Most were added and changed that way fairly recently compared to the age of the Bible.
Long answer short, might get downvoted for bluntness, but dreams don’t actually mean anything and god isn’t real. If it is, it’s a very cruel god that lets innocent children suffer every day, while letting evil people prosper. And that’s not a god you should want to worship or listen to.
Not sure if this is helpful but it might be useful if we break this down into 3 core assumptions. First that being queer is not a choice, you are born that way (which i believe) second that being gay is in fact a sin, and third that the 3 divine attributes that many christians assign to God  are true (ie that God is all good, all powerful, and all knowing). If all of these assumptions are true then we've reached a concerning dilemma. If god is all knowing, then he knew you were going to be queer before he created you and did so anyways, knowing that for you to live happily you would have to condemn yourself to hell. If he was all good why would he knowingly create a person that he knew could not be happy without going to hell. More over why would a good god make being queer a sin to begin with and where does this moral judgement come from? Are actions moral because god says that they are Moral? Or does god say that actions are moral because they are moral? (this might sound like the same thing but its not, for more on this you can look up the Euthyphro Dillema). Also if God is all powerful, and god does not want human beings to be queer, then why is anyone created queer? He would have the power to make it so that no one was born queer, and yet it is evident that queer people exist. One might answer that we are given free will and thus can choose to be queer, but that goes against our first assumption that being queer isnt a choice. For the sake of argument lets say it is a choice. Even then, if god is all knowing, he already knew you were going to be queer or else he is not all knowing. And if there is an all knowing entity that knows all your actions before you take them, can you really be said to have free will? I've probably made this question a lot more complicated for you, but thats the point. Morality and ethics are much more complicated then just what the bible dictates. You must carefully think about what is right and wrong for yourself, what is sin and what is not. Your mother does not have all the answers, your pastor doesnt either. 

TLDR; Morality is much more complicated then whats dictated to you by the bible. It is up to you to contemplate your own morality.
hello love, i’ve been in your shoes. here’s what i know. god created us each in his image with purpose, he knew what we were going to be like before we were even in our mothers womb (Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139:13). that means he knew you would be non-binary, that you would love people other than men. i do not believe the god of love would create someone in a way that would immediately condemn them to hell, he wants what is best for us, and i don’t think that would mean living your whole life lying to yourself and repressing your truth. but i know that is something you would have to think through and believe yourself before it would mean anything more than some bs from a stranger on the internet. 

another thing: what is the sin here? loving? i found this article online that i think would be very helpful to you, especially the part where it talks about how each mention of same sex attraction in the bible was condemning another vice (like sexual violence or exploitation) https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-homosexuality 

i hope this helps you some my friend. you are beautiful and wonderful and your journey towards living truthfully is worthwhile. <3
no god would send someone to hell for living happily.
One. Anyone how tells you being gay is a sin doesn't know thier Bible at fucking all. The one passage they use is about pedophilia not homosexuality. It's about not sleeping with a young boy. The man shall not lie with man interpretation is for 1953. Period. It's just not true. 

Two if it is a sin fuck God. He is the monster then

Three J boy died for your sins and he was all about not caring what other people do and just accepting them

Three point five J boy only ever got mad at tax collectors, and only when they stole money or didn't use it for social programs.

Moral of the story J boy and G money are queer accepting socialist and anyone who denies that need Jesus in thier life and to read a Bible 

You are valid enjoy yiu life knowing J boy loves you. Unless you a tax collector stealing. Then fear him cause he's coming for you with the belt

I was struggling with this; and I still don't have it all figured out, but hearing this sermon was the first time since coming out that I really felt God speak to me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_VFXQXh2Xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_VFXQXh2Xo)
When I was first coming to terms with my sexuality and gender identity, I struggled the most with how my religious beliefs affected my self-perception, like you. For me, what really helped was learning more about my religion and questioning those Unquestionable Truths I was raised to believe. You said she explained why it’s a sin, and she likely gave you a lot of evidence to back her claims. She’s trying to make you see her point of view from the knowledge she has, whether or not it’s true. Try finding your own evidence and believing your own truth. Try finding websites and videos online that have done a deep-dive into subject matters like this. Maybe even dig into your religion’s sacred texts (if applicable) and see what you can come up with. 

It’s important to not fall into a rabbit hole and to have support as you go through it though. Do you have any friends or support groups that you can discuss with? It really helps talking it out and processing it with other people. I was fortunate enough to take a class in college where we studied the Bible. It was an incredible class because it had nothing to do with religion. It was purely an analytical class aiming to understand the Bible objectively, as a book of history and humanity rather than faith. It can be really helpful and affirming seeing things from a different perspective and understanding something from knowledge you yourself have gained rather than from what someone had presumably unquestioningly grown up believing in.
i'm not christian myself but i believe that god, whether the christian idea of god or any other, doesn't hate people for things like being gay or being genderqueer. what god would hate someone for is probably stuff like intentionally hurting others, treating people like crap for no reason, just generally being a bad person and damaging others (which you are not doing by being queer) so don't worry. i am certain you have nothing to fear if you are true to yourself.
Fish Out Of Water is a great resource

I don’t consider myself Christian, but I was raised as one and still make efforts to learn more about the Bible. 

OP, I don’t believe that being gay is a sin, based on my own research of the Bible and experiences.

Even if God does hate people being gay, remember that He also hates fraud.

He would not want you to pretend to be something you’re not. He created you the way you are and loves you the way you are, whatever his reasons.

I struggle to believe that God can hate a healthy, loving relationship. As long as it doesn’t distract from the individual’s relationship with Him—I mean, think about the writings of Paul, who advises that you enter a relationship only if not being in one would make it more difficult for you to focus on God.

I don’t believe being gay is an affront to God. I believe most of that has come from mistranslations and hundreds of years of prejudice. But either way, it sounds like remaining alone and celibate  or in the closet your whole life would just build resentment against God and distract you from Him.
Also, from a biblical and academic standpoint, your mother should not have told you that being gay is a sin. There is no evidence in the bible of this, as most of the lines people point to about this subject refer to ""men laying with men as they would a woman"" but the translations are dubious at best and the original verbiage would better translate to like ""don't lay with CHILDREN as you would your wife"" or, in some interpretations, ""don't treat a man the way you would a woman"" i.e. as inferior. The same way that the translation of the ""virgin"" Mary just refers to her being quite young, rather than an actual virgin. 

There is simply not any hard evidence of homosexuality being a sin in the bible, let alone an unforgivable sin.
You are who you are. That's the way God made you. If he didn't want you to be gay or Homoromantic, he wouldn't have made you this way. Killing people is a Sin. Loving who you wanna love isn't. You won't go to hell. Be true to yourself, and be proud.
A few things!

-why would god care what you do with your body? It's not a sin to eat yummy food, play fun games, listen to good music, wear comfy clothes, or anything else, so why would it be a sin to have good sex? If there is a god, I'm confident that what's sinful is *hurting people*, and I don't think they care how you do your business otherwise

-if the whole hell thing is probably not real. It doesn't show up *anywhere* in the bible, it's not mentioned even once. It was invented in the centuries after jesus, imo to better control people by having something to threaten them with.

-if there is eternal life, and you go to the same place all the other queers do after you die, that kinda sounds like a party? I'd rather be in hell with all my friends and lovers than in heaven with a bunch of stuffy straights

-your mom's dream doesn't mean anything at all. Dreams are just dreams.

-talking about what's in the bible, it doesn't condemn homosexuality even once! The passage that is commonly claimed to condemn it is actually about pedophilia, not homosexuality

-if you're still troubled, and you believe in god, why not ask them? Surely they wouldn't tell your mom something about you, but refuse to tell you the same thing?

-if personally think the whole legalistic, rule-obsessed tradition of sorting things into sins and non-sins is complete bunk, but if it's all true, then can't you just ask for forgiveness before you die?
Im really sorry that you’ve been struggling with this. As a christain bisexual enby, the best succinct advice i can give you is that if it is a sin, it is not the only time you’ve sinned. We sin countless times every day, even if we dont always see it. The Christian journey is to strive to become more like Christ, not to purify ourselves from sin

A few relevant verses:
Ephesians 2:8-9
for it is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this is not from yourselves but is a gift from God - not by works so that no one can boast

Romans 3:10
As it is written: there is no one righteous, not even one

I could elaborate more if you’re interested, but the long and short of this argument is that if it is a sin, its certainly not the only one, and you are not unique. Theres no “special” sin that cannot be forgiven in christianity. (with a possible exception not relevant here) 

As long as you are making a genuine attempt to persue God with your whole self, your mother doesn’t have anything to worry about, you arent any more sinful than she is. The problem is that christianity recently is less of a religious movement and more of a means to control and enforce cultural norms. Dont let anyone - ANYONE tell you that you are less for who you are, or who you were created to be.

Acts 10:15
The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”

And

Romans 5:1-11 (copied from: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205&version=NIV&interface=amp)

 Therefore, since we have been justified(A) through faith,(B) we[a] have peace(C) with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,(D) 2 through whom we have gained access(E) by faith into this grace in which we now stand.(F) And we[b] boast in the hope(G) of the glory of God. 3 Not only so, but we[c] also glory in our sufferings,(H) because we know that suffering produces perseverance;(I) 4 perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 And hope(J) does not put us to shame, because God’s love(K) has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit,(L) who has been given to us.

6 You see, at just the right time,(M) when we were still powerless,(N) Christ died for the ungodly.(O) 7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.(P)

9 Since we have now been justified(Q) by his blood,(R) how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath(S) through him! 10 For if, while we were God’s enemies,(T) we were reconciled(U) to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!(V) 11 Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
There are LGBTQ+ people in the bible. The wedding vows of today were first spoken by lesbians. Joseph is believed by some to have been a trans woman. There's evidence that Jesus himself was both bi and polyamorous. There are several other examples throughout the entirety of the bible as well, including figures like King David and Moses.

Christians often do not read their own bible, or do not understand it, and will twist the verses to reflect what they *want* to believe, and use scripture to harm others.

That is what your mother is doing. She is a bigot, end of. Pursue your own truth, not her proclaimed (false) one. Do not let yourself be a victim of her prejudice.

EDIT: I forgot to add that there's also evidence that Jesus was also nonbinary.

EDIT 2: I learned about all of this in the book ""The Gay Gospels"" by Keith Sharp. The author does a way better job than I ever could of exploring these topics and using the scripture to support what he says. I found it at my local library and gave it a read, so maybe you can find it at a library as well. Even if you have to buy it, it's worth the read.
God loves you no matter what. You were made to be yourself and live your life to the fullest. You were made this way.


Psalms 139:13-14 


""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. your eyes saw my unformed body.""
What kind of God would make angels who are powerless against devils? 

It’s so silly to me, the idea that a being of pure divine will and light would be crying powerless over a devil’s deeds and not, like, a righteous warrior ready to do battle for your soul. 

What would be the point of free will anyway if devils had more power over us than angels? 

I don’t know if Hell exists or not. 

But I know that if there was a Christian God then He would be a God of pure love and forgiveness. The whole entire Christ story is about love and forgiveness, not damnation or fear.

Who does Jesus hang with in the Bible? Not the priests (pharisees) and not the pious. He hung out with whores and outcasts.

It might be counter intuitive, but IMO it’s okay to lie to your Mom and stay in the closet until you can live on your own. Frankly, your sexuality and whether you’re sinning or not is between you and your God—it’s none of your Mom’s business.
Dreams are dictated by our subconscious, so they’re just a manifestation of your mother’s beliefs, not prophecy or anything. 

I’ve always found it interesting about Christianity there are things that are undeniably universally accepted: Killing is bad. God is real, and so is Jesus. You should love God and love your neighbor (whether people actually do is less universal, but they all say it…). So on and so forth. Then you get into more specifics, and there’s a lot of disagreement - is being gay a sin? What is meant in the New Testament when it says Jesus fulfilled the law of the Old so we don’t have to focus on it? What is the level of humanity’s depravity? By what means is salvation delivered to a person? 

Personally, I’m a Christian but I don’t like what a lot of people who call themselves Christians stand for. Our core belief is love, and the amount of hate spewed at the LGBTQ+ community is mind boggling to me.

I can’t tell you what is and isn’t a sin as I don’t know the mind of God. Like you said, it doesn’t really matter how many people here tell you it’s not a sin. I think the only evidence you can go by is when you truly feel you are living the value of love. For me, denying my queerness and trying to conform to others’ picture of Christianity kinda made me a hateful person, ngl.
Look, clearly being gay isn’t choice. If it were, you would choose to be straight cis and not worry if it is a sin, right? God made you perfectly. God made you the way you needed to be made. 

Also being gay isn’t a sin and there was no mention of homosexuality in the Bible until the 1940s (in the US and many manufacturers are based in the US so this spread). And most of the passages that are now read to be about homosexuality are actually about pedophilia in older translations.
In the torah, the original texts of bereishit (genesis) describes the creation of adam as “G‑d created man in his image, in the image of G‑d He created him, male and female He created them” that being, adam, the first creation of HaShem was both male and female, one being with both traits, being more or less a non-binary entity. It wasn’t until G-d split adam that chava (eve) existed as a physically separate being. There are also several different instances in the Torah of multiple genders being identified ( androgynos, tumtum, saris, aylonit). while this is the Jewish interpretation and not Christian, i figure since they have the same G-d and a similar foundation it might help.

On a personal note, Im also non-binary and something i’ve pondered and discussed with clergy is that because every person has purpose given by G-d, perhaps the purpose of non-binary/transgender/gender nonconforming folks is to open the eyes and minds of people to make a more accepting and loving world. I hope this helps :)
It's something you can't control. If it's really a sin, then it doesn't matter. All you can do is live your life. I'm sorry that your mother has harmful ideas engraved in her mind. You deserve to be happy!
If god is universal love, and god is telling you you can’t love someone of the same sex, then you have a contradiction. i’m agnostic now, raised Catholic. But what helped me release my religious guilt was that if god is love, god would not want you to limit your love. You can’t love with the fullness of your heart, if you have to turn a piece of it off. 

I’d also go further into how a god that requires worship is rather vain, and that these rules were made by humans, not god.
I am definitely not minimizing your fears or concerns at all. But if that we’re me, I’d be more miserable being something I’m not while being alive then what’s going to happen to my soul when I die. I’ve been queer/non binary openly for 17 years. I came out young. According to most religion I’ve committed several sins. But honestly if God, whoever that is, didn’t love me or want me, I wouldn’t be here. Everything has a purpose. I’m happy and authentic. Whatever comes for me next when I die will be my problem then but for now? I’m not hiding.

Also accepting that not everyone is going to be okay with it is difficult, especially family. I’ve had to be alone on several occasions in my life due to lack of family support. It’s either going to take your mom time and an adjustment period or she may not come around. Regardless, you have to do what is best and safe for you, but remember that your happiness and contentment is important.
I have a lot of the same conflictions, but I encouraged you to do A LOT of research on the topic before you make any decisions. Don't just take what your mom or anyone else says for verbatim (including me).

First of all, there are a lot of studies done on this topic and explanations that make sense. It's not just as simple as ""the bible says homosexuality is wrong so it's a sin."" There's conflicts with the translations from Hebrew and Greek and how the text has been altered over a series of those translations. 

There's also reasonings that have to do with the historical setting the people lived with culturally when they wrote it. Back then women were opressed, the bible said it was okay to have slaves, and to even think about a fight for the rights homosexuals seemed impossible. However, the evidence is clear that the bible tries to push the boundaries of  what their society thought and/or did. While the bible seems extremely sexist at times now, it was extremely revolutionary then. They were steps in the right direction for the church to follow through with down the road and give women more rights later on. The same can be applied to homosexuality.

There are also a lot of things that the bible says that we don't do: the sabbath, stoning cheaters/ non-married women that have been caught having sex, not wearing clothing woven of two kinds of material, not touching people on their period (When a woman has a discharge, if her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean. Leviticus 15: 19-20), and then it says this too- Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves. Numbers 31:17-18. 

However people LOVE to concentrate on the fact that it says homosexuality is a sin when they ignore all the rest of what I wrote above.

I am a Christian, but I don't think loving who you love is a sin and that isn't me just rejecting what's in the bible because of what I personally think, it's a grounded belief based on research.
Bro I'm just going to say this bcuz it might be true. The fact that your mom had a dream like  that is something not to take l lightly, all these ppl here will of course tell you she is a bigot but think about it first isn't it not Nebuchadnezzar that had a dream from God about something true didn't   God tell Pharoah about the farming surely God must have showed your mom something that really going on around you if you're not convinced let me tell you a dream I had , my mom had cancer I asked God what will happen to her and in my dream my Mom died ppl told me that it was a lie, end of the story she did die. If you want to know the truth then ask God and he will tell you
This 100%. I'm a psych major; dreams have zero meaning except they might have to do with topics the dreamer is stressed about.

- 

**Edit** --- I've oversimplified the situation, please read the comments of others, which better address OP's issue 👇
It's not even all the time a stress thing. Most of the time dreams are just things that you have in your subconscious, so if she consciously or subconsciously thinks that on any level that's why It would appear in her dreams. Yes she is more likely to dream about it if under stress, but even so a large part of the time stress dreams dont manifest themselves nearly as clearly as, the devil was talking to you bcs you were being gay and angels were crying. But still most likely doesn't actually mean anything, its just because she already has it in her head that that's how it goes most likely. (I'm sorry I mostly skimmed after I saw religious mother using her dreams and religion to scare her child who is brave enough to be themself)
Without knowing much more about you, I must say - you seem very cool ☺

By farming I meant farmine
To be fair though we can't really apply this religion. Sure we have no basis in psychology to say dreams have any meaning, but psychology doesn't disprove the existence of God. 

If somebody has faith that God gave them a dream for a reason there isn't any logical way to argue against that.

I'm an atheist but if someone honestly believes in a religion you aren't going to logic them out of it. 

So imo yeah dreams have no meaning whatsoever but if OP and OPs mom honestly believe that it does you need to meet them where they are at and try and work from their understanding. If you want to be a therapist one day ""meeting the client where they are at"" will become a mantra.
In my experience I have more dreams about whatever I was interested in like a week before than what stresses me out. Show taking place in an apocalypse? Roadtrip across the world while wacky creatures try to catch me. Controlling weird ice stuff after ice-y DLC on Destiny 2? done. Have a mute friend after watching a show with a badass mute character? been there. My bad dreams/nightmares are few and far between, most of my dreams are pretty fun.
good bot
You make an excellent point 👍 I was being simplistic and cynical about something as complex as religion. Thanks for calling me out
Yeah, a dream or “vision” like the one OP’s mom had would be extremely frightening if you felt it was from God.
I don't believe that but I think my mom does but the thing is that a while ago i don't know what was the context she told me that dreams have no meaning but now she tells me that this is a sign or something

No worries! You're still just getting your degree, you've still got a lot of learning and growing you will do :) less a calout and more a hey future colleague here's some guidance
So I'm honestly not surprised to hear your mom's opinion on dreams changed. When somebody desperately wants something the brain is good at compartmentalizing and holding contradictory thoughts at the same time without knowing it.


The two best things I could advise would be one, trying to just have conversations with her and educate her on this stuff. However I imagine you try this and it sounds like your mom is pretty dug in right now and this may not work.

What I recommend significantly more is to try to get the two of you into family based therapy. I've seen this situation a few times, with a few different psychiatrists on the treatment team, and every time the recommendation is family based therapy.

Having a neutral third party there to see your dynamics and conversations, and point out miscommunications, misunderstandings, and poor methods of communication, is more likely to get your mom to listen. This is about you so your opinion may not hold much weight to her, but she may be more likely to respect the therapist's opinion.

Good luck op I hope you two are able to bridge this gap
Actually tbh, I finished my bachelor's in psych six years ago, and now I'm a restaurant manager lol. I don't plan to use my degree; I could never be a therapist, too intense for me.  Thought about social work, but am scared of it for the same reasons; don't think I could handle seeing so much trauma and grief every day. Are you a social worker? How do you handle the stress?

Thanks very much for the gentle advice though - if I were still a student, this would be very helpful to hear 👍
Yeah I'll try to talk to her but idk why I physically can't and when I came out to her I wrote her a letter because I just couldn't get the words out of my mouth and my mom tells me that she wants me to be more open with her and that I've insolated myself but its hard for me to open up to people because I have some trust issues and I kept these things inside me for a while and we had a talk after I came out but I just couldn't speak and a thing that annoys me its that when I bring up an argument she tells me not to believe everything on the internet but most of her arguments were from the internet
I am a social worker and honestly just have a high tolerance for other people's trauma which is important since I actually work inpatient with kids and teens, so child abuse in every form is not uncommon. Also part of it is I'm actually a binary trans woman with severe dysphoria and have gone through some terrible shit with people because of it which motivates me to help others. Make the world brighter than the one I was born into.
I suggest family therapy even more now. It's designed to address exactly those problems
that is beautiful. Thank you for the work you do, I couldn't, but it's so important"	rhka51	NonBinary	69	0.94	2021-12-16 06:08:56
Should the responsibility be on us when correcting pronouns?	I use any pronouns but whenever people i ask i say i prefer they/them. My pronouns online are also set to they/them. But when people refer to me as she/her, especially people who know I prefer they/them, it makes me so sad, but i dont feel strong enough to correct people and i always hope my friends help me correct others. Moreover, i have a rather feminine name so people always just refer to me as she/her. But i once heard someone say or a comment i saw online that as an enby we have the responsibility to correct people who misgender us. But i dont know, i dont feel comfortable enough. What do yall think?	"If you want to correct someone and feel comfortable doing so, do. If you don't, then don't. There's no moral obligation that you *have* to correct people on behalf of the entire non-binary community. If you're friends with someone who isn't making good pronoun choices for you, the onus is on you to tell them what your correct pronouns are, and from there it's *their* responsibility to be respectful. But people are human, and helping each other is part of what friendship is about. So maybe you can think of it as doing them a favor, helping them be more respectful.
i think the way it should work is that people use they/them (neutral) pronouns by default, for *everyone*, until they know a person’s gender (which shouldn’t be assumed since expression =/= identity)

that said, since the world is not like that realistically, i do think the easiest way for us right now is to correct people *if we feel like it*. this doesn’t mean you have to tho
It's not our responsibility at all. You don't have to correct people if you don't want to, and I would argue your friends and other cis people who know your pronouns have the responsibility to step up and correct people. Having said that, if you want someone to stop misgendering you, often the most effective route is to correct them yourself as well.
Thanks for posting this :)) was feeling kinda overwhelmed about my NB experience and seeing that you have a similar way of articulating your pronoun usage is so validating for me :)) 

You are so valid in your experience and I too have a strong preference for they/them pronouns , but I think that I can see myself using other pronouns in some circumstances (I like calling it ""they+"" pronouns) I moreso think that while I'm ok letting people refer to me by other pronouns, ""they"" feels best. You are absolutely valid in feeling hurt that people who know that you like ""they"" are not calling you by that. If you feel comfortable, I would let these people know how you feel and you by no means have any obligation to correct them in the moment.
I've found that the less I correct people, the more they realize and correct themselves. I also find it's a great social test to find who is cool and who is not.
A fun trick I’ve picked up is making sure I always ask everyone their preferred gender pronouns, this almost always prompts/reminds them to ask me mine. I happen to be totally fine with the pronouns that match my agab but esp when I’m talking with someone who presents as cis I feel it’s a good reminder to myself and to them to never assume- which is our end goal here anyways, right?
You don't have to, but you can't expect people to know/get better without correction. Not that you *shouldn't* be able to, but rather that it just won't happen.
Dealing with similar feelings over here! I completely understand the reluctance to correct. At the same time it’s also alright to allow yourself to not correct people if you don’t feel like it. By being you you’re already doing enough.
I also have a feminine name, and often get misgendered as she even though I wear a badge that says they/them on it. My sister corrects people for me and my friends correct each other. One friend over corrected and misgendered me as male, which I had a good laugh with him about.

My trans friend and I have found people respond better from correction from others than by the offended party  so we correct for each other
I feel similarly- I get really nervous correcting people. I can correct people, but not face to face. I’ll text them or email them or something. I feel bad that I can’t do that for myself, when it’s something I could do for other people- and if I could do it for myself it would help people get used to using different pronouns. But ultimately I have to make sure I balance what I think is most just with making sure I have the energy to keep up the positive things I am doing. And sometimes the positive thing I’m doing is just being a trans person existing and doing my best to live a happy life.
It’s always going to depend on you because you’re the one it matters to most. Good friends will speak up of course. 

Whether I do or not depends on the person. If it’s just a simple slip up from someone used to referring to you the same way for years, eh, everybody does that (me included). If it’s a frequent problem, then yes, I will. 

With some dipshit at Walmart? I fight the battles that matter. If it matters, I do. If it’s not worth the effort, I don’t. My identity is far more than just a pronoun from a Maga hat wearing chucklefuck with socks and crocks and an ‘I’m with stupid’ shirt who is by himself. 

Ultimately it’s like exercising. The more you do it, the more comfortable it is.
it... doesn't really sound like you use any pronouns, it sounds like your pronouns are they/them. 

I'd say the only ""responsibility"" you have is towards yourself, not towards others. If you don't tell people they're making a mistake, they probably won't realize they're using the wrong words for you. But it's not like an outsider can get mad at you for not doing anything. And if someone is using the fact that you don't correct them on using your correct pronouns to misgender someone else, that's them being an asshole, it's not on you.
i totally agree it honestly just makes sense to use gender neutral pronouns by default. but yea, totally agree thanks!
yea… i think i just tell myself i “use any pronouns” so when teachers and/or more conservative people use she/her on me i psych myself thinking it’s okay, so i dont feel as bad??? i dont even know man…"	rzv8d9	NonBinary	66	0.98	2022-01-09 16:24:36
Enby Olympics? (How can Enby's take part in sport when so much of it is gender binary focused?)	"Hi all,

I very much feel sport should not be divided by binary categories, but currently it is, so what should an enby do if they were, for example, a very good gymnast. 

where can they compete? It seems unfair that they would miss out on being in a competition like the Olympics merely because to enter they'd have to be put into a binary category.

It makes me sad that with all this talk of trans athletes, they are ignoring the bigger problem of having sport divided in this artificial manner. (I'm very glad trans people are getting to partake in sport, don't get me wrong, I just don't feel there is currently a solution for enby people.)

What are people's thoughts on this?"	"I’d love to see a format where the olympics stops dividing athletes by gender and start using another marker like T-levels. 

But that’s just an idea I heard in passing that I n ow nothing about the practicality of 😅
Why not structure all sports more like fighting sports, and do them by weight class, or maybe a combination of weight and height? In that environment though, it would be best I think to let those in lower classes participate in higher classes if they so choose, since the disadvantage is there's.  


The fact that we don't do this for most sports today boggles my mind, as performance in many sports has far more to do with physical size than sex or even hormone levels.
In Germany, Mülheim it was just announced yesterday that soccer teams allow diverse folks and trans folks pre transition to choose the team they want to play on :)
I personally am a fan of a massive study on hormone levels and their effects on athletic performance. If it proves that t levels are the determining factor that divides athletic performance which we have traditionally attributed to male and female sports I personally would be a fan of splitting sports based on t level. If it proves that there is no physical attribute that definitively splits athletic performance, we should get rid of the divide altogether.
Rankings/categories based on characteristics/attributes/abilities and not what people think are in the pants alone. Adjust games to be equal based on weighting advantages and disadvantages between players.
Ok now lemme say a few words… I am an australian swimmer currently training to represent my country in the Olympics (probably in 2024 or 2028) and I’m also Non binary so i‘ve been training from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day for the past two years, And I am hoping to do well and be well known that way I can make a stand for both my country and the LGBTQIA+O So hopefully I’ll get in and do well and change the world! Oh and by the way if in future you watch the olympics and want to know which one is me my name is Milly Hutchinson.
Such as by weight in boxing, such as by level in martial arts. There already are examples all around you.
As degree of disability in Paralympics, we monitor our top athletes, why would it be that hard to find a better categorization?

As for in Olympics etc I don't mind athletes not being devided at all. Just by top athlete, and non top athlete. But I also wouldn't mind dividing into ""just for fun"" and ""serious"" eg
I have thought that maybe they could make the classes take into account elements that affect the sport. Eg height for most athletics, weight for martial arts. It will be tricky to determine some but ultimately things like archery shouldn't make a difference as it's skill based.

Anyone agree here?
[removed]
The core of the issue is that people want to have different levels of competitive skill. That is to say, They want to separate men and women in sport because they feel that the performance of men is inherently superior to that of women, so if they compete together, women would not be able to succeed. They're using men and women as the categories to *approximate* performance. That approximation has a cost, as the current social debate around trans athletes shows. Some people with vaginas have higher testosterone than some people with penises, without HRT or other factors. That's simply their natural state of being. But T values are again just an approximation of performance. Boxing has weight classes, another approximation. Martial arts often have belts that indicate proficiency, which is different from physical strength but still a measure of performance; you don't want white belts fighting black belts because there's no chance the white belt will win, and that's not competition.

So, before we can make any progress on the topic of where non-binary folks fit into this equation or whether we should dismantle the categories we currently use, it's important to understand why those categories exist and what the actual underlying goal was.

For things like middle school soccer teams, performance classes by gender don't make sense. The *skill* proficiency is going to far outweigh any biological factor. How hard you practice, *what* you practice, those are going to be the things that most factor into performance at that level. Sally can beat John in middle school soccer by practicing smarter and harder than John, even if John has a higher T value or other biological innate advantage. So on that point, I don't feel like gendered segregation matters in sports at this level at all. The only value I see in having two teams is that more kids get to play, and that's easy enough to accomplish by having two co-ed teams.

At the level of the Olympics, things aren't so clear. The very tip of the performance mountain is so sharp, so refined, that *any* advantage can be decisive. Train smart, train hard, eat specific foods in specific quantities, hydrate down to the ml, schedule bowel movements, visualize, sleep down to the minute. Natural variation on hormone levels for individual competitors can have a significant impact on their performance, so they may eg try to time menstrual cycles based on competitive dates.

So how *should* things work at that level? One idea is to simply focus on performance in its own right, and do away with categories entirely. Every human that wants to try running fast is pitted against every other human. No distinction about gender or sex or hormone levels or how many limbs someone has or anything else. There is no fastest woman, there's just a fastest *person.* And if the goal is to determine who is the fastest, this makes sense.

But it comes with drawbacks. At that level of competition, having a naturally higher testosterone level typically makes it easier to produce and maintain muscle mass, which provides a competitive advantage. Fewer women will be on the podium receiving medals if we use this criteria, which results in a decrease in representation. We know enough about sociology and psychology to understand that, when girls don't see women succeeding at things, they won't be as likely to try it themselves. Not having a woman win a medal for running will have a direct negative impact on running among girls. Is that moral?

Some would argue that perhaps we could have a separate category for trans and non-binary individuals. Take as many hormones as you want, identify as you please, anyone who identifies as non-cis would be placed in this category and they all compete against each other and not the cis folks. This would be great for representation. NB kids can watch the Olympics on TV and see a non-binary olympian and say ""that could be me!"" But the downside to this approach is the same downside that people of color faced in the 50s and 60s in the United States. Segregation, ""separate but equal"", is not ok. A trans woman shouldn't be prevented from participating with other women, because that's discrimination. And again, it has a significant, measurable negative impact.

So where does that leave non-binary people? Hell if I know. Having written all this, the only conclusion I can draw is that the situation is very complicated, and there are no easy solutions that will satisfy everyone, or even all non-binary people. Maybe the solution is to do away with competitive sport entirely, and let people play for joy instead.
Many of them already aren’t. Most “men’s” leagues aren’t actually men only. The NBA/NFL are open leagues and anyone can compete in them regardless of sex/gender.
That is the wrinkle, really.  No sane sport lets people take steroids for high level competition, and yet almost half the population naturally produces a set of chemicals that are very, *very* similar to steroids if given to the *other* half.  Maybe T-Level testing is the fairer and more accurate way to judge.  I don't think we are quite there yet given how recent good science on the subject is.  The various hormones have only been known to science for around a hundred years, and it's only been the last few decades that people have really started to dig into just how much of who we are depends on them.  But it sounds a lot more fair in the end.  After all, if the science says that a trans woman who has maintained androgen levels below a certain threshold for more than a certain period of time has no meaningful physical advantage over other women, then it satisfies the question of fairness.  As far as I'm concerned, that's the only question on the subject that matters.
I second this
Height isn’t a determining factor in ability at sport, neither is weight, hormone levels, etc. In reality there are so many biological factors that impact how good someone is at sport, and pretty much every elite level athlete will have some of these advantages. There is no true fair way to categorise athletes because every athlete’s body is different, and trying to make it fair would create too many groups.
thats good but don't they still have to choose between a ""mens"" team and a ""womens"" team? ideally we just have a people's team
why dont we start dividing on average altitude as well then? that has a huge effect on your red blood cell count and that in turn affects how much oxygen you can use which changes how effective your muscles are too. 

If we start focusing on these factors we will end up having 20,000 different teams
are you competing in both mens and womens catagories? i cant see how else an enby can compete without being misgendered.
(Oh and this is just an alt account)
""just for fun"", ""actually trying this time"", ""in it to win it"", ""lol im on drugs"". sorted.
I'm not a fan of ""sex"" as a way of dividing people up. its so arbitrary. its like dividing people by eye colour.
T-testing will probably never be a thing, there’s just too many things that can affect it/ways for people to cheat the tests. 

You can literally just fast for a couple days before a test and torpedo your test levels to get into a lower class. Even a shitty nights sleep can temporarily tank T levels. Shit fluctuates like crazy based on what you eat, your habits, and time of day. 

There’s also TRT which can be used to keep your test levels at a certain point and means you wouldn’t pop abnormally high/low on a test but would have a massive advantage over others because your T stays at a constant level 100% of the time while a normal persons fluctuates.
I'ma add on and third it :)
I agree. Does it suck for NB people yes. But really, I cannot think of a better way to separate group sports other than gender. As shitty as that is. Individual sports are fine but most sports like wrestling have always allowed Afab to compete with amab.
I believe we should either not decide, or decide by testosterone level, but it's a first step
Ideally we have a team no woman can ever competitively be a part of, unless it has a required number of each sex (e.g. mixed relay in skiing magically has each relay start the same number of women and men, wonder why that is).
I didn't say that though. There is a clear athletic difference between people based on a physical difference that has, in the past, been simplified to male and female. Combining these groups will result in people that have generally fallen in the female group to feel like they can never compete with people that have generally fallen in the male group, so whats the point in trying? It would be similar to a 4 year old competing with an 8 year old. If the 4 year old is going to lose ever time just because they're physically not on the same level as an 8 year old they will become disillusioned with sports and resent being put up against someone its unlikely they will ever beat. My point isnt that people in the lower t level group couldn't ever beat a person in the higher t level group, which is false. My point is that it would be significantly more difficult and people should be able to compete with people that have similar athletic capabilities, and I think a hormonal study could help discern where that line is.
Competing in womens (They forced me to cuz it’s the gender I’m born as and its one of the rules) But hopefully I’ll be good enough to make a difference in the world and change that rule :) That just means I gotta train harder! >:D
Sounds stupid, but from my experience in playing football some definetly would have liked not having to be too serious about the game, so why not?
I never knew that eye colour impacts athletic performance. You learn something new every day.
Those are fair points, and also why the subject ends up being so radically complicated.  Current testing criteria for all the various sorts of disallowed advantages is imprecise enough that it seems the sports world is always dealing with one scandal or another related to it.  On the other hand, it isn't likely to be fair to trans women to have them compete in the same class as men because their bodies may or may not naturally produce androgens when many of them go to extraordinary lengths to suppress that.  And on the other side of the coin, it *may* not be fair to women to allow trans women to compete with them for much the same reason.  The same is likely true for trans men.

Then there is that other alternative:  having trans individuals participate amongst themselves.  That's the *most fair*, and yet also the most hurtful to the trans people themselves.  It is saying a person is a man or a woman sometimes but not other times.  That's as bad for the athlete as the alternative of saying that it is okay to take any possible route to an advantage would be since it would mean that every high level athlete would be required to undertake *wildly* dangerous therapies in order to remain competitive.

So much of the public debate on the subject is focused on the wrong parts of the problem - those based on fear, on hate, and on ignorance.  Worries about locker rooms and imagined boogeymen isn't productive, but I sometimes wonder how much of the world's unfortunate tendency toward *that* is because the important question is one where there doesn't seem to be a good answer?
Plus we are just talking about elite level sports and athletes here. At an amateur level there is plenty of mixed-gender competition.
There are so many biological factors that can impact how good someone is at sport, testosterone is one of many.
I don't like this focus on testosterone level. there are female athletes with low T levels that outcompete male athletes with high T levels. its not all about T.
huh? what? plenty of women can compete with and beat plenty of men.
and what im saying is if you are going to consider t you should also consider other factors like red blood cell count. all these factors make a difference and T may not be (and probably isnt) the biggest one.

it seems ludicrous to me to get rid of a binary system only to invent a new one.
Please do. they suck. go rock the world :D
I meant in general.
True, but not deviding at all would not be fair too.
I agree, deviding by men and women ain't useful, but still there should be room for anyone, not only the biological luckiest.
Surely it does depend on the sport though? Darts, archery, bowls, golf etc I can't see genetic factors affecting, football is tricky, it involves skill as well as the physical effort, but in theory it shouldn't matter that much, if someone is good at football.

I would love to see an official 'mixed' tournament even if it was done as half of each national team together
But it does make a difference. Not saying its all about that, but by percentage it obviously does make a difference.

Saying this is a focus on this is just as wrong as saying we solely identify ourselfs by our sexuality or gender identity.
Correct. Not all males are athletically better than all females. But in any given league, if one team starts to put only men on the team and another has half women, the latter will lose. The best women's national teams lose to 15 year old boys in football. Serena Williams would be a complete nobody if we did not have women's sport. That's what you are arguing for.
That is literally why I suggested a study to determine the factors that affect athletic performance. If it makes more sense biologically to have a few groups then I am all for it. If you don't actually want to hear perspectives different from your own, don't ask what others think. I proposed a solution not based in the gender binary, but in science and what I see as a system that allows everyone to fairly compete. If you don't like my opinion, that's fine, but I don't know what other kind of comments you wanted.
I will! For the other genders!
Well we were talking about sports specifically. But more generally, I also didn't know that eye colour had as much impact socially, culturally, medically as sex. So yea, still learned something new. 

Btw if you aren't a fan of this, do you think it shouldn't happen, that people who are fans of it shouldn't get it?
Pretty much every elite level athlete has biological advantages, hence why they reach such a high level. Amateur sports do exist and many amateur sports have mixed gender groups, it’s only really the elite levels where gendered divisions exist. At the end of the day, every athlete’s body is different and there is no truly fair way to categorise them.
To be fair, women's sport is incredibly underfunded compared to men's sport. if women had the funding men have, I think they'd do a LOT better.
if you want a study IN GENERAL then I support it. I just dont support one focused on only T.
Personally, no, but I have a lot of unpopular opinions so I'm used to people doing things I don't like. I've been accused of being both a feminist and an MRA, while i don't identify with either camp. (Gendered/sexed groups seeking 'equality' are missing the point.) 

I'm honestly pretty fed up with this world.
By that logic having women's sport in the first place is redundant. Thanks for erasing women from elite sports.
But there are many much more fair than male and female.
Yea, they'd probably do better. They still wouldn't catch up to men in any way though. So it is not really relevant and doesn't address anything I said.
The first sentence of my reply said that I was a fan of a study. If your issue is that I said hormone (not t) instead of all physical attributes then I guess that makes sense. But you need to start somewhere. One study can't cover everything.
No, it shouldn't happen, or no, I don't think it shouldn't happen (I.e. it should)?
What sports do you do OP? There are some, like horse riding, surfing and speed climbing that are a lot less sex-segregated, and social teams at low levels tend to not care at all for field sports/multi sports. Unfortunately, the vast majority of us with uteruses who went through unregulated puberty (by which I mean, no hormone blockers etc) will have less muscle, more fat, wider hip insertions (good for some things, not so good for others) and a few other differences than those with testes who went through unregulated puberty. That leads to substantial demographic differences, that can be split approximately as a binary. As someone who played on an ""all-girls"" team in a mixed league for field hockey all through high school, we had to be significantly more skilled than ""all-boys"" teams in order to make up for their increased speed, and secure wins. Interestingly, if we look at elite ""women"" sprinters, there is much more variety in build than in elite ""men"", suggesting that there are slightly different factors contributing to the spread of performance, but ""women"" are still slower over short (non-ultra marathon) distances.
I’m interested in your viewpoint on gendered/sexed groups seeking equality, care to elaborate on your pov?
Just.. no?? Women are not bad at sports, women can reach elite levels in sports, and having a female body is not a bad thing. I am saying this as an AFAB who participates in (amateur level, non-competitive) sports myself. I have not said, or intended to imply, that women should not play sports. I am unsure as to why you think that my comment erases women in sports, all I can say was that this was not my intention.
Such as?
I'm sorry, I didn't intend this to become as aggressive as it has done. I hope you can understand this is something I feel very strongly about and I guess I got overly defensive. 

I understand what you were trying to say now.
I don't like the idea of it happening but I'm not going to try to stop it.
I don't do sport. I hated doing it at school and my opinion hasn't changed since.

I would prefer if sport was less serious and more people could take part.

Again though my opinion really doesn't matter
Often we get situations where an ""equality"" program is put into place that ends up harming the formerly advantaged group to the point where THEY become the disadvantaged one. A good example is university admissions. in the 60s, white men were the majority of students at british universities. thanks to ""equality"" programmes, white working class men are now the single most underrepresented group at universities. 

So we're STILL not equal, we just changed the disadvantaged group to a more ""socially acceptable"" one. 

It would have been better not to worry about sex/gender ratios in the first place and just worry about whether individuals are getting the outcomes they deserve based on academic achievement and so forth. 

I'm likely to be attacked just for bringing this up, because that's how socially unacceptable it is to discuss such things.
I didn't say women are bad at sports. I alluded to the fact that the distribution in athletic ability between the two sexes, while overlapping, is very much in favour of males. 

I think it erases women's sports because you think there is no true fair way to categorise athletes. Yes, there is, having sex classes enables women to have a fair shot. Without them, e.g. Serena would be a nobody.
It's okay, I know things like this bring up a lot of strong feelings.
Odd, but fair enough.
I completely agree, I think more people need to take part on all levels, so that it's accessible and fun, and not such a performance thing.  

Unfortunately, that means we kind of have to make the first move, get over our fears and start doing it 😅 and mixed league sports are a low pressure way to do that, and it tends to mean the sex binary doesn't come into it soooo much.
If you want a less serious sport join an intramural sports club. Most of them are mixed gender and are done for fun
Then I think you have misunderstood my original comment, perhaps I did not explain it well enough. What I had meant was gender divisions in sports only really exist at elite levels. At amateur levels (where most sport exists), genders are often mixed as there becomes less of a difference between ability which is determined by sex, as amateur athletes don't often have significant biological advantages. And thus, non-binary people would usually be able to participate at an amateur level, its only the small percentage who would reach an elite level that would face difficulty in terms of the male/female categories. There's no fair way to categorise sports, but the gender categories at elite-levels are more fair than suggestions like height or hormonal levels.
>there becomes less of a difference between ability which is determined by sex, as amateur athletes don't often have significant biological advantages

This is not true. It just means that the 70th percentile woman competes against 50th percentile man (or something like that) and what it leads to is far more amateur men doing sport than women. E.g. on Strava (i.e. amateur) I am a nobody in the male ranking, but my times are good enough to be top 3 to top 5 on many climbs in the female ranking.  In fact, I have better times on some segments than professional women (though of course likely also due to me going 100% and them doing the segment as part of a longer ride) and only marginally slower than former world champ Emma Pooley in some of them. In elite sports you suddenly notice it because at the top end the males just pull away from the females. But as you go down the male ability distribution, at some point the best female is equally good. And as you keep going down more and more females are equally good and better. 

I completely agree with your last sentence.
Then I think we simply have different experiences of amateur sport. I don’t compete but do swim in a mixed gender pool and find that there is no gender dominance for who is fastest. I’ve found myself faster than some men who train more than I do, or are doing a faster stroke than I am. My own experience of mixed gender amateur sport has not seen male dominance, but everyone will have a different experience."	obmzat	NonBinary	62	0.97	2021-07-01 14:28:01
Anyone else get sad about being misgendered in the direction that once made you ecstatic?		"It's been a steady six months of being gendered as male by strangers for me. The punched-in-your-stomach feeling I used to have when I got ID'd as female has now switched over to when I get ID'd as male, though not as heavy. I used to always have to fight a smirk whenever someone gendered me as male in public before but now it makes me shiver.

Although it's hard for me to see me as anything but genderqueer and non-binary, I am aware of how I look to the average person and it makes me a bit sad, since I feel like such a satisfying combination of both. Been considering calming down at the gym and lowering my dose of testosterone to maybe get back to something more androgynous.

Sad feels. That's all. :'[
Happy Leo season, babies!

i hope you find a way that makes you feel comfortable and happy enough in your own skin! i hope you dont mind me saying this, but i think that you're super attractive!
It's totally ok to feel whatever feelings you have and it's ok for your feelings to change, over time or even day to day. No advice here, just want to validate you and say you're great no matter what. Getting misgendered, regardless of how you present, sucks and it's on those people and not you.
Why is part of your skin green/yellow here?
I'm not there yet, but.... I can see this happening if I physically transition ""too far."" After the novelty of being recognized as not female wears off, I am reminded that I'm still not being recognized for my actual gender.
I feel you - it's not an issue for me yet since I started testosterone 2 days ago, but I don't think I'm going to like being read as male full time much more than I like being read as female full time. I'm probably going to keep myself at normal male T levels in the long term, bc sports are important to me and I want to be able to compete, but there's definitely a sense of loss there. The gender binary just sucks :/
Was doing some photos for a friend's queer project that required me being painted gold, ahah.
It looks gold/metallic. I'm guessing some kind of safe-for-skin spray paint for cosplay/a costume/just for the heck of it
Same here too. 4 months on T so far and I’m really happy about it. I like being read as a guy in public, but I’m not one, so I will probably dislike it if it happens 24/7. But I am looking forward to wearing makeup/fem-leaning outfits and not being seen instantly as a woman... though I wonder if I’ll face more issues/discrimination if strangers then read me as transfem instead of transmasc
Yeah same, also looking forward to dressing my more masc body in a more femme way than I present now, also wondering if it might be more difficult to be read as transfemme. 

It'll be a while before I have to worry about it though, so far I've been called ""monsieur"" once ever."	91r7w4	NonBinary	64	0.99	2018-07-25 12:03:19
A little weekend getaway outfit. I kinda really liked it. Sadly not androgynous passing but oh well....		"Not bad. You could experiment with a swept back pixie/slicked back undercut. I think those are trendy androgynous hairstyles.
Those pants are gorgeous. Hair is cute too 😊
I've really wanted to, and honestly my hair normally is a bit shorter on the sides then it is at the moment. However the problem comes from my family who dont really like me cutting my hair.
I guess you could always do something like a top knot (with or without shaved sides) since it'll still be long enough to tie upwards."	fg7raq	NonBinary	64	0.99	2020-03-10 03:45:51
I just had a talk with my dad...	"So my dad sent me a text this morning asking me to come over to my partner and I's house to discuss some things  it was nothing or shattering but things that he wanted to discuss. And unfortunately the discussion was actually centered around me and my presentation.

He had mentioned that when I came out about two and a half years ago that his vision of what I wrote doesn't really match my current presentation and to be fair is 100% correct. I had absolutely no idea that I would be presenting in a hyperfeminine way to level I am right now two and a half years ago.

He mentioned that when he's been in public he is heard people say very threatening things towards people that are presenting similar to me and specifically also around trans women and that causes him quite a bit of concern. Acknowledge the fact that I know that I'm carrying a higher inherent risk presenting the way I do but I understand and accept those risks because I want to be happy with who I am and how I present.

He also noted that he's been struggling with some of the changes over the last year but he went out of his way to mention this is a problem he has to deal with it's not my problem to deal with or to be concerned about. And I was really happy to hear him acknowledge the fact that this is a problem that he has to overcome and it is working to try to do so.

He did mention that if my partner and I were having our celebration next month he may not be able to bring himself to attend but given that it's a year from next month he thinks he can work on himself to bring him to the point where he feels comfortable attending. I think it comes down to seeing his son and makeup and a white evening gown is a little much for him to take in. 

All in all I'm a little sad because I think I got a false sense of understanding of his feelings but at the same time I'm really happy that he approached me and laid everything out on a table in a very mature and understanding way. And I understand it's very difficult when you have a loved one especially a kid that you envisioned a certain way for 30 years to have such a drastic change in presentation it is a little difficult to really get behind and understand especially when you come from an older generation."	"I'm sorry.
I hope your dad will come around and end up accepting you.

I have a feeling that he will and I hope he does.
This is a good and communicative father. He definitely loves you and is working through things that he had implanted into him. I know it feels a little sad, but also please remember he is trying to rewrite his brain. For some people that is very hard. But being HONEST and AUTHENTIC about his struggles, not blaming you, and treating you with care and respect is WAY better than a lot of us get.

It seems he has his issues, but he wanted to explain and be honest without being accusatory. I would def give him time and I understand the feelings you have, but it seems like your Dad has a great heart.
A lot of parents i think will keep their real feelings to themselves. Its something frustrating ive tried to get out of my own, bc that honest conversation is sometimes needed for people like them for them to be better able to grow as better people and open their minds, even if its gradual.     
The fact that he himself was willing to start this conversation and be honest with his feelings and can own up to them as his responsibility shows that he has more potential to eventually become a great ally than most people. Of course, itll be up to him to put in the effort of self education but if he can openly communicate his feelings like that, ive got high hopes for him.
One of the things that gets missed in a lot of these kinds of topics is that sometimes people take time to adjust. Your dad is very open and honest and transparent about his own struggles. I like that. He’s a good father, sounds like. 

As long as someone is trying that’s what counts. Just like it takes us time to figure out what our gender or sexuality means, it can take time for our loved ones (assuming they don’t suck) to adjust as well. 

As long as the love/acceptance is unconditional, I think giving those people the space to do so is only fair in return. Just so long as acceptance IS unconditional. If it’s not…. That’s a problem. 

Props to your dad for being an honest dude that can own his faults and his struggles. If he can do that now, I bet you $100 in a decade he’ll be your number one advocate. 

When I was dating my (now) spouse it took her some adjustment when I came out as non binary. She’s now my absolute biggest supporter, and I rarely have t say anything because god help anyone who disrespects me if she’s around. But it took her a bit to get comfortable with the change.
I feel this. I’ve had similar discussions with my mother.
It sounds like you both managed to hold a very difficult conversation productively. My family tends to hold our feelings inside, which I don’t think is at all healthy. I hope that you continue to make progress towards a place where you can find that good understanding again, and that you stay both safe and happy.
I don't think he doesn't accept me. It's just a little hard for him to grasp and mentally understand it if that makes sense.
My spouse has always supported me and she's also Nonbinary. Although she's awful with pronouns still 😂😂😂. All in all, I'm happy he had the conversation, he has a lot to grow on, some of his views especially POC are iffy still but at least he's not a Trump Republican.
If it’s of any consolation, I’m not sure there’s much to get or understand. Why do some people like blue and other people like red? There’s not really a reason or rationale to it. You presumably live in a mostly free society: if we celebrate our liberties while challenging the utilization of said liberties, it’s not exactly freedom is it? I can relate to a lot of your story, and it’s really admirable that you seem to work on maintaining that relationship even if they don’t understand. However some people like cars, some people are passionate about art, it’s impossible to explain why you love what you love or what makes you happy, but if you’re not hurting anyone, what’s the real issue?

Recently I had a conversation with my conservative coworker about modesty. He was essentially making the argument if you dress a certain way you’re asking for attention. I think the point he was trying to make is some men can be predatory on women who dress without modesty, but my point was just because that people can act in a predatory way, doesn’t mean we have to live in that world. I.e. if I had a kid who wanted to dress slutty ( I like dressing slutty lol) I’d want them to know the risks but I also wouldn’t want them to be afraid to express themselves.

I hope this helps, you’re doing great!!!"	xl53xz	NonBinary	60	0.97	2022-09-22 15:51:18
I've been sad today that I can't openly celebrate IRL, but shout-out to Animal Crossing for helping me explore my identity the past few months!		"oh these are so cute!! I’m with you on “using animal crossing to explore self-expression”, haha

"saying I don't ""appear nonbinary"" is extremely invalidating ((VENTING))"	"saying my face looks feminine even after I show you how much concealer goes into an ""acceptable"" face shape. how I feel that make up is necessary just to go to work... I started wearing it at such a young age because I knew I was different, and even if you think you're further from the binary or rather left, doesn't mean you understand the expectations placed on someone afab's identity. it doesn't mean you can't misstep.

sad thing is when you know it's attached to their own subconscious or overt attraction (I'm ace spec as well so uh,, triple no). cishet men want or need you to be this pretty girl >to validate THEMSELVES?< when you only feel like one occasionally, if at all. joke or laugh it off and I'll know to steer clear.

tried describing my personal dysphoria to one (mostly in the face coz I'm not exactly curvy) and hoping it makes something click. I always leave the hints...pronouns are in every bio. I love myself most when I balance androgyny but dealing with others who see a quality that I can't recognize in my own fucking face is an absolute nightmare.

---an afab enby with mostly male friends---"	"""Non-binary people shouldn't dress like x""

Shouldn't ? Like it's the moral thing to do? Like there's an extensive argument for it with fax and lojik? Like there's clothing that doesn't have a history of gender? 

Enbies should look like how they want to. Period. N

My mini supplemental rant over.
Please show me the way to the non-gendered section, please...
Those men are so fragile that they need to try and change your identity just to feel comfortable in their own sexuality.
I started trying to talk to my mom about gender-fluidity and being nonbinary, and her response was to grandstand on what an Enby should look like and tell me that I'm normal ""because it's not like you want to cut your tits off or something"". 

&#x200B;

I'm still taking deep breaths and working on an ""ELI5"" way to make her understand. I know she means well... I hope.
!!! I like dressing androgynously like I said,, or combining gendered clothing (for this day and age ha),, but it's after years of forcing femininity. pLUS right now I see it as the natural expression of my mind?? But I am actively trying to get to the headspace where deciding to wear jewelry or a dress on any particular day (( or my having really long hair / enjoying heavy make up )) doesn't mean I'm not who I identify as. COZ MEN AND MORE """"MASC-APPEARING"""" HUMANS **SHOULD** BE ABLE TO WEAR WHATEVER TF THEY WANT TO AS WELL
oh my goddddd I'm sorry you have to deal with that mess, but it is awesome that you're speaking up about it. lucky for me, my parents are pretty alternative / gender-neutral themselves so they at least understand why I value it so highly. it's fucking amazing (sarcasm) how most older generations have a hard time keeping up with ""new"" concepts, though. even if they're generally accepting in their own way, they're habitually going to say shit that's inappropriate, whether out of humor or curiosity or, coping??? insensitivity? and yeah, you either have to gently fix their argument or not dignify it with a response...>_> at least that's what I do

I fully realize how lucky I am to be this content with my body as a whole (now), despite being conflictingly ""passable."" I appreciate my specific balance of ""girlish"" and ""boyish"" parts, the in between / neither / both. BUT IT IS SUCH A FUCKING GAME OF CARDS. we have nearly zero control over anything, especially our faces. and if they WERE different, and if we DID want to change those things, our inner selves would still be the same. so? really no need to obsess and offend over body parts. people should only care that we're physically, mentally and emotionally healthy. xx
Didn't you know? We lace our thread with testosterone so this is a boys only shirt. No argument, we dipped the whole thing in a big vat of testosterone and monster trucks and anti-tears it's only for boys.

People are stupid 😤😤
Sorry that people around you are stupid ☹️
lmao you're making my day though, thank you. I am too :( big changes acomin'
Glad to have made your day 😊🥰

Another thing to remember is that we live in a generation that doesn't understand how to be wrong. We put so much effort into being right, that we find we don't have an instruction book for what to do when we are wrong. Our brain's response isn't ""Oh, maybe I am in the wrong here, I should listen."", it's more ""Wait I gotta defend my answer because being wrong is bad."" 

So when you try to address that you don't like something with your cis friends it seems to never go well, god damn it ding dong your opinion is wrong now listen to me

Edit:😤😤😤😤
FUCK dude that is relevant to me in this exact moment. are you watching me? are you god????? 😩 🧐

to my one friend I said : btw you reacting as you did was very inappropriate; what you say matters to me and I need to know someone [close to me] is capable of understanding this.
he said : why does my opinion matter? it's true you just look like a GIRL.

I give u p  with cis men, guys. we just want to be seen + heard + understood without all the biased, hetero/cisnormative bullsheeit

only serious faces give me a masc vibe sadly.		"You look amazing in these photos, and I bet your smile does as well <3 I love your piercings!
(Toxic masculinity joke incoming) Men aren't supposed to have emotions or expressions, serious face only 100% of the time, even smiling is feminine.


*sigh* I still have a lot of baggage to work through.
UGH, thank you so much. i appreciate your being. and i’m not done with facial piercings. i used to have more. but i’m waiting till i’m more comfortable to get new ~~old~~ piercings.
hey i totally understand that. and while you may feel that way, it’s something you’re aware of. i’ve seen so many posts that find even BASIC self care, being deemed as feminine. which shouldn’t be so. PM me if you ever want to talk further about it though.
Yaassss do it!!! And of course! Your whole vibe is very awesome and fierce and fantastic, and hope you'll post more pics when you get more piercings! :D"	iz6e1i	NonBinary	54	0.98	2020-09-24 21:35:44
I passed yesterday. Somehow.	"I try to make myself as androgynous as possible. In my gait, in clothing, in my face, in my voice, mannerisms, everything. Before it's mentioned about it being unhealthy, I don't take it to an extreme degree. I do it when I can, and if I can't, I can't. 
But, after getting a new haircut and changing the way I hold my resting face, I've been pleasing myself with my androgyny. Of course, anyone who has been around me would know that, outwardly, I'm ""female"". (I'm not out yet sadly. I'm safe where I am but I'm still scared)
Now onto yesterday. I got on a bus to come home as I normally do, and every so often there's a young girl on there too. She stares at me sometimes, no big deal, she probably stares at everyone because she's a young girl. 
However, yesterday, she staring was a little more extreme. Little weird, but I still thought nothing of it. Until she finally walked up to me and asked this question:
""Are you a boy or a girl? I can't tell.""
I was so happy after she said that, I just started laughing. I probably seemed weird or rude, but I don't care. I passed! I passed as an enby, I never thought the day would come."	"Cool!
Congratulations💋
Yay!
Happens to me sometimes, I am happy for you!
I love it! Good energy for the rest of the year, there.

I'm giving up on being non-binary. [TW]	"I'm sorry in advance for this long, gloomy rant. Please don't feel obligated to read it all, I just needed to say this somewhere.

I realized I was non-binary around 6 months ago. I'm AFAB and married to a cishet man. I love him deeply and, due to disability, I am more or less 100% financially dependent on him.

I started experimenting with my gender expression earlier this year and felt on top of the moon. I bought more traditionally masculine clothing, cut my hair short, and stopped trying my best to ""pass"" as a woman. I had never felt so comfortable in my skin. I had just recently overcome a really bad anorexia relapse, but I found that when I presented myself more in line with my gender, I didn't hate my body so much. I even had a top surgery consult and was excitedly awaiting insurance approval.

I guess it's important to mention I grew up in an abusive and neglectful household. I was also a really weird kid, and I learned pretty quickly that if I wanted friends I had to dress, speak, and behave the way other people wanted me to. My dad was the closest thing I had to real loving support, but if I did anything that he didn't approve of he would turn ice cold- or worse, he'd take it so personally that he would cry or yell at me for breaking his heart.

So I learned how to play the role I had been given, and while I wasn't a happy person deep down, I had love in my life. I got married to my best friend and life started looking up a little.

But when I started getting therapy for my PTSD, things changed. I started to realize how little I knew the real me, so I set out to get to know them. That led to me discovering this new gender identity, and I socially transitioned not too long after. I chose a new name, requested they/them pronouns, and tried to live as my authentic self.

But it was so hard. I was the only trans/NB person I knew in real life, and it got lonely. Every time I had to tell someone my name, or my pronouns, or even just exist in the same space as people who knew me as a girl, I was making everyone so uncomfortable. My husband's family started checking in on him to make sure he was doing ok. Not me, no one checked in on me.

Sex pretty much vanished from my life. My husband swore up and down that he still loved me and was still attracted to me, but the 1-2 times a month I tried to initiate something, he turned me down. I began feeling like I was just living with a roommate. But when we went to couple's counseling, it was all about what I had to change, what I had to do better to make him happy.

Then, I was diagnosed with Asperger's. All of a sudden a lot of things in my life made a lot more sense. But a realization came with it: connecting with people is never going to get any easier. I'm at a disadvantage in social relationships already, and the more I try to assert myself in an identity that other people don't feel comfortable around, the less of a chance I have at normal relationships. And God was I lonely. It got to the point that I was sitting home alone one day, staring at a bottle of pills I'd saved up and a short note I'd written for my husband to find, and it sank in just how miserable I was.

So I started dressing more femme. I grew my hair out a bit and styled it differently, wore more makeup, stopped binding, started flaunting these stupid curves on my body again. I told my husband I'm changing my pronouns to she/they, so he can use she/her with other people and I won't mind. I stopped asking people to call me by my new name, and I went back to masking my more obviously autistic behaviors. I stopped doing what I wanted to do and spent more of my days thinking about other people, and how to make them happy.

Now, my husband initiates sex. He tells me how beautiful I am. I don't bug him with uncomfortable topics anymore, so we stopped arguing. If I do express an emotion, he's nice to me about it and comforts me. I'm back to doing all the dishes and laundry and cooking, so he has more time to relax and he's less irritable and anxious. Our relationship is improving rapidly.

I'm so unbelievably jealous of all the beautiful people here who get to live as their true selves. I know it's not easy on anyone to be different, so I can't begin to explain how much I admire those with the strength and resilience to stand firm in their identities. Maybe some day the winds will change and I will have the courage to try again. But for now I have to blend in to survive. I'm not strong enough to get by on my own, and nobody wants the ""real"" me.

If you got this far, thanks for hearing me out. I'm tired, and I'm sad. I wish things could be different. But I'm so proud of every one of you here who makes the choice to live your truth. Keep going, keep fighting, keep being happy. You are seen, you are valid, and you are so loved. 💜"	"I see you. You are valid. No matter how you present you will be whatever gender you know you are. I hope the winds do change to be in your favor. You deserve all the love and support from those around you.
Try to get some financial independence by saving/working part-time/freelancing. It must be difficult to live two double-lives as an aspie (masking) AND repressing your true gender expression. The people in your life don't seem supportive which is concerning. Try to meet new people outside of your circle. You need a good support network. I hope things turn out well for you
Well, this almost made me cry. I'm struggling right now as well, whether to live as my true self or repress it for the convenience of others. I don't know what else I could say except for little words of comfort, I hope you'll find happiness even when times are tough. You're not alone 💕
Sometimes, it can be safer to stay in the closet. It sucks, but you know yourself and your situation best. I’m sorry all of this is happening to you, I can’t imagine the toll it must take. I just want you to remember that you are valid and appreciated for who you are, and the way you present does not change who you are inside. You are amazing, and important, and valuable, and I hope one day you’ll have the opportunity to live as your true self once again. Until then, I wish you all the best. We see you, and we support you. You are valid and important, and you will always have a place in this community, even if you have to present in a way that doesn’t feel true to your authentic self. Best of luck 💜
I can relate to this :( but I refuse to give up on being my true self. It's put me in a super vulnerable situation but I love me, and I will fight for me forever. There's nothing wrong with making the decision of what to sacrifice and what not to, I'm certain you can make a good life whatever you choose. Keep going, keep loving, keep living.
I read this entire thing word for word and I see you! Look, everyone deals with the you that is you and the you everyone wants you to be. It’s okay to struggle between the two and try different things. Ultimately YOU cannot escape YOU and you have to love you and except you in order to live with you. You are worth loving and you deserve love, so keep trying to build the muscle in your mind that doesn’t struggle to say “I’m fucking awesome and everyone on this planet doesn’t know shit about fuck”, and other things like that.That is the only important thing. Communication with your intimate circle is important but sometimes communication is difficult. You seem like a fantastic writer, so keeping a journal and documenting your life journey could be very therapeutic. Sometimes my wife shares with me a thing she wrote in her journal because she could write it better than she could say it. Be you no matter what and if you can’t find people you can be you around, make room for yourself because that means there aren’t enough people like you around. Lastly, but most important: I’ve struggled with suicide and depression and it can feel like you’re in a hole that’s hard to get out of. If you need help, ask for help or give the Suicide hotline a try if everyone else sucks 1-800-273-8255 . Good luck on your journey!
Your post had me tearing up. You are not alone. Not in this tiny corner of the internet and not in the universe either. 

There have been so many of our ancestors whose lives depended on their ability to code switch, to pass, to protect themselves against worse violence. There are so many of our ancestors whose family of origin threatened their selfhood, whether through emotional abuse or belief systems. They probably didn't know that they were surviving, maybe anonymously, silently, in pain, because a few of us make it. A few of us access inner & outer resources. Or were randomly born into a compassionate family. Or into a city at a certain time (Harlem Renaissance, Weimar Berlin). 

It's not your fault. The ""things get better"" messaging isn't always healthy. I understand why you're ascribing ""resilience"" and ""strength"" to folks who are in a position to be out. But *you're* resilient. You are strong. I hope you can believe that.
You have my deepest sympathies for how it turned out, getting that taste of self-expression and then having to stuff back into the closet isn't a great feel :(

I do hope you get to come back out eventually. I know how rough it is to get the sandwich of autism and being non-binary.
💕  This community loves you, supports you, and wants you to be well. No matter what that looks like. 💕
Wow -I’m also afab non-binary she/they Aspergers and I recently came out to my cis-male heterosexual partner of 10+ years. I have the same thoughts of it being easier to not change. But at this point I love myself enough not to compromise on who I am anymore. I’m happy mostly and relieved,  and my partner seemed happy for me but then began the “but what does this make me?” I know it’s going to sink in more and more for him and I will probably feel intense pressure to return to the closet. 

All I can say is I hope you find a time and place to be yourself some day and going back into the closet so you speak, does not mean you are not non-binary. You still are. Hang in there!
I feel you. I came out as non binary and honestly, most people either ignore it, treat it as some sort of joke while claiming to support me or actively act hostile with micro aggressions. I sort of regret coming out as it’s another stressor on my life.
I can’t imagine how fucked things must feel right now.  I hope you’re okay, and I hope one day you get to be your truest self! And until then, I hope you find small comforts to lift your spirits. You’re in a tough spot, you did your best, give yourself some credit!
I'm not of much help but I hope you find out who you are! You are valid and I hope things turn for the better <3
I am so sorry you've had this experience. That has to be really hard. I can't tell you what to do or give you any good advice, but I can tell you to keep going. Maybe not anytime soon, but someday, you're going to be happy and safe in your skin. And you're going to be around people who love you for you. For now, all you can do is all you can do. And that is more than enough. Hang in there. Easier said than done, I know, but you're worth it.
Survival is the first step! I hope you can move towards healthier relationships / better support systems so you are able to live life on your own terms, but you will never get to that future unless you can live through the present.

Everyone deserves love, support, independence and companionship. The crazy part of me is like, drop everything and leave. Get a good fund me to move somewhere else and start fresh. Make cooler friends and do shit you love as the person you are. But i know that's not always possible and I only mention it to illustrate that there are always other options than ending your story. Depression makes it feel like there is no way out of whatever is going on, but there is. Keep surviving and don't be afraid to do something kinda crazy if it will make you happy.

PS. Keep getting to know yourself! There are other ways to be happy besides gender expression. When you have lived your whole life for others, it's so hard to know what makes you happy. What are your passions, dreams, hobbies? What makes you smile? Cultivate those things and the relationships that support you participating in them. Consider joining commutities centered around pastimes you enjoy, maybe a bookclub or online group. No one should feel alone. 

These last few years especially have seen huge growth in online communities so I'm sure there is a group or two out there that you will fit in great with. Local and online support groups can also be very valuable support systems. Your therapist can probably recommend a few local ones if that's something you are interested in.

I know this is really long, but I really ruffles my feathers when ppl aren't in charge of their lives the way they want to be.

Whatever you decide, we see you and love you!!! Feel free to DM me as well if you want to talk about literally anything. Best :)



PSS this isn't super helpful at all but now i want to vent a little: if making your life partner do their share of chores results in irritability and otherwise taking it out on you, they need to grow up or get therapy or both. So not fair. This really isn't the point of you post at all but grr it irks me. Gender expression/identity doesn't have shit to do with equally splitting of household basics. So many cishet dudes see their spouses as caregivers more than equal partners and it drives me up the wall.
There are no real words that describe my empathy for you in reading this. I'm just crying my eyes out. You are valid in any choice you make for yourself. So so many of us have had to make similar choices in our lives. I really hope you find peace and joy in your life, however you choose to live it. So much love coming your way. ❤❤❤
I'm AMAB, always seem myself as more like my mum (non binary trans masc) than my dad (in closet non binary trans femme), 

finally age 37.5 in Dec 2019 I came out since I felt there's space in the middle,

 female looking, and a mashup of boy and girl presenting and expressing (am able to naturally drive, run as well as walk in stilletos, don't know where the ability came from), 

I was born at 26 weeks in the second trimester in 1982, had balanced hormones, they got put out of balance by medical (diuretic) use of aldactone aka spironolactone for the first three years of life, what happened after that is I developed menopausal symptoms from age 9 when testosterone overtook estrogen after an asthma attack age 6, the aldactone was stopped age 3, 

Have had an interesting life so far and will be keeping on going, wasn't meant to make it from the get go but f**k it, I'm a fighter, as for yourself, keep going and be you for you, fuck anyone else, it's your life and your choice, sadly for me my daughter has been kept from me but hope that'll sort itself out in family court or even criminal court since there have been some major issues found over the past 5 years of proceedings

I got sad last night and thought dressing like an emo enby would help lift my mood up and it kinda did but here's the outfit		how did you get a photo of me	ei3rzf	NonBinary	52	0.97	2019-12-31 14:51:05
I'm sad at my partner's reaction that I might be genderfluid	"I've been out as nonbinary for over a year now. Recently I started identifying as transmasc, and using he/they pronouns. But after a few weeks, I started feeling femme again, so I told my partner that I might be genderfluid. He's been having a hard time with me being transmasc, and got really excited that ""girl Riley"" wasn't gone. He said that he could be fine with ""boy Riley"" if it meant that he wasn't losing the person he fell in love with. . .

I know it should make me happy that he's finding acceptance in my identity, because I love him. But it makes me feel depressed. . . Because it means if I am either wrong about being genderfluid, or if I had been right about being transmasc, then he still wouldn't be able to accept me as I am. And it makes me wonder why I'm still doing this. If I am genderfluid, then there seem to be long periods between shifts. Sometimes days or weeks, maybe even months. And if he doesn't like ""boy Riley"" and is just waiting for ""girl Riley"" to come back, does that mean our relationship will fall apart every time I feel masc? I don't know how often I'll be femme, but I don't think it's going to be very often. I went an entire year switching between masc and neutral, and have only felt femme for a couple of days now.

I know I'm in a relationship with a straight man. And I know it's not his fault he's not attracted to masc people. But for weeks he's been saying that he thought he could come to accept me as masc. And at the first sign of ""girl Riley"" coming back, he jumped for joy. And that hurts. . ."	"All I can offer is this: don't set yourself on fire trying keep other people warm. Be you, whoever that is. 

Sending love ❤️
I think it’s too soon to tell what will happen to your relationship. My wife isn’t attracted to my more feminine appearance but it wasn’t a deal breaker. We’ve got to experience some good things we wouldn’t have if I hadn’t come out. She still supports me even if she prefers a more masculine presentation from me.

Maybe together you can find some reasons he can appreciate you being masc, and neutral. It can take a while to get used to changes.

If either of you are feeling unfulfilled in the relationship though it’s ok to break it off. Neither of you should have to be in an unhappy place.
Wow this is almost word for word what I said to my spouse when they first said they were genderfluid. It started the same way, they thought they were trans, then one day (months later) they switched genders. And my response was basically the same. Being excited that I hadn't 'lost' my wife.

The good news is, I adjusted to it. I look forward to seeing my spouse, whether they are a man, woman, or neither. I actually enjoy it when they switch, especially knowing that my acceptance makes them happy. 
Granted, I am pansexual, and have known that since we started dating. So maybe for me it was inevitable. But regardless, don't count him out just yet. Some people just need time. 

Obviously don't put yourself in a miserable situation just for the off chance he gets used to it. Do what's best for you in the end. I just wanted to give you a point of view from someone who once had that exact (admittedly harmful) reaction. 

I'm sorry his reaction hurt so much. Your feelings are valid. I hope things get better ❤️
You are discovering yourself and it’s completely okay. Someone using very questionable and seemingly manipulative narrative of losing someone they love because they’re growing is not acceptable and I would question if that is actually love.
Love is complicated. It doesn't have to have sexual attraction, though it helps. You need to talk and be honest about your feelings -- all of them, negative included. And find a comfortable place where you'll both be happy. If your partner won't or can't agree on a way that makes BOTH if you happy, it may be worth seeking outside help or taking a little break.
he isn't losing the person he fell in love with, you're changing. if his hangup is about your presentation/expression/body, that's a separate issue from *who you are* and should not be lumped together imo. if he's stuck being in love with the old you... the you that wasn't able to be yourself... then what part of you did he actually fall in love with?
I hope that you’re able to work this out in a way that feels good to you both, but I’ll also say this: You deserve to have someone who celebrates you and all that you are, not just parts of you.
You're doing the right thing by engaging in that dialogue with yourself about yourself, and figuring out how to act on those feelings. This is a process of discovery and it's really special that you're committing to experiencing it. If he's not able to engage in that process with you, that says more about him and where he's at than what is possible or meaningful for you. If he can't deal with what you're presenting then he's not allowing himself to see you, and it honestly sounds like his real struggle is letting go of an idea of you he's holding onto, that 'girl Riley' being back means he doesn't have to confront those emotions -- that's not your responsibility to bear. He's going to have to do the work and he's going to have to reconcile the person he wants against the person he's with, and it's not going to be good for either of you to avoid that conversation. I hope the best for you both."	110tin1	NonBinary	54	0.98	2023-02-12 23:28:56
I want to support my little sibling!	"Hi everyone. So my 11yo sibling recently came out to me as gender fluid using all pronouns! I was so happy that he has figured himself out and is exploring his gender as I was not able to at that age. 

A year ago I (21 nb) came out to our family as nonbinary and have been using a different name. Everyone is respectful and uses my name and pronouns (they/them). I have now moved to the other side of the country for university so I’m not living at him with my mum sibling, brother (9), and stepfather. 

However, now that my little sibling came out my mum is not so supportive. My sibling told our mum and my mum basically just said “that’s confusing” and “make sure your father doesn’t find out”. Hearing this happened really made me sad. My little sibling just wants to use different pronouns (which their friends at school are respectful of), go by a more neutral name, and get their hair cut short, which is EXACTLY what I did. None of what she is asking for is permanent what so ever. They aren’t asking for a legal name change, and I Jaír always grows back. In fact he wants it the same length as our little brother and I. My mum said in terms of the hair that’s a big change and my siblings changes their mind every 2 months about things. I personally thing that would be a good natural consequence for them to learn anyway. If they get their hair short and don’t like it, next time they’ll take more time to make a decision, but the hair will always grow back. I’m so upset that I would get more respect and acceptance than my sibling. Part of the reason I came out was so that if either of my siblings were to it wouldn’t be so difficult for them. But it’s not like that. I guess my stepdad loves her (and tolerates me), so that’s why he wouldn’t care so much about me being trans, but his own child is a whole different story. This seems backwards to me though; if you love your own child more wouldn’t you want them to be happier? The other thing parents are afraid of is people judging their child, but my siblings friends and classmates are already respecting, and I have come out to most of the people my sibling would come out to and they have been fine with it. So I don’t get the hang up. 

I guess fine if my stepdad is gonna be that way hide it from him, but why can’t my mum just use they/he/she pronouns for my sibling when their dad isn’t around? Why aren’t they allowed to try out a gender neutral name just with my mum? And if that’s too much (idk why), why can’t my family just use a more neutral nickname/shortened version of my sibling birth name?

Sorry this was long, I’m just very confused and upset :( 

TL;DR 
my 11yo sibling came out as gender fluid a year after i came out as enby at 20. Our family is respectful of my non permanent changes (name/pronouns/haircut), but wont be respectful to my little sibling. :( wjat can i do?"	"Damn, that's rough, I'm afraid I can't help much, but what I can say, is that you sound like a fucking amazing bigger sibling, and I would've loved to have someone like that when I was having my family issues. In short, keep up with the good work and always support your little sibling.
“They’re a child; they don’t know what they want” is likely their mentality 

Counter that with “many children denied support of their gender end their own life — that seems certain enough to me.”
I feel like a part of the problem is that your mother doesn't understand your sibling's identity. Maybe try sending her educational videos or something. But in the end there's probably not much you can do besides being an amazing and supportive older sibling, which by the sound of it you absolutely are:)
I was the younger sibling not too long ago. Just your support goes a long way. You probably won’t be able to change your parents (but hey who knows) but being there for them and doing your best to provide what your parents aren’t can be literally lifesaving.
Maybe talk to your family. Say that you don’t understand why you were allowed to make those changes but your sibling can’t. Especially when it’s almost for the exact same reason. Your an adult so they might be more willing to listen to what you have to say. You might also be able to explain to your family what it means to be gender fluid and explain to them how it feels to be gender fluid. It might help them gain a better understanding and see it from a different perspective.
Thank you friend! I’m doing my best to support him from afar:)
Yeah I was thinking of maybe explaining again to my mum that I felt my gender was different at that age, I just didn’t have the vocabulary that my sibling does now. Thanks for the suggestion ❤️‍🩹
Thank you! I’m definitely trying to show them all my love and support from afar!
I’m sorry you went through this too ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 sending you love and positive vibes. I’ll do my best to support my little sibling and show them all the love and acceptance they need.
Thank you so much for the suggestion! I’ll definitely be talking to my mum about it soon. She and I are so close so I’m so confused why she would treat my sibling differently than me. ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
You're welcome, hope to live in a world where we don't need to fight in the future, but until there, gather your sword and shield and let's go!
Yes!! That’s a much softer approach than the one I would take in your place — keep being kind and wonderful!
Thank you :) don’t underestimate the power you have to make a difference in your sibling’s life. Don’t forget to take care of yourself, too :)
Yeah I’m glad that helped. And I am really sorry your going through that, that must feel terrible. I send your sibling my best regards and I hope they are doing okay! They are loved and have so many other people who accept them. Im just sorry that the people closest to them weren’t willing to do that❤️❤️❤️
That means so much thank you! It warms my heart knowing that you love and understand them. I’ll be sure to pass the message along ❤️❤️😘😘😘😘
Thank you, I have a certain point of sympathy as a younger envy myself❤️❤️❤️"	tzdcxx	NonBinary	58	1.0	2022-04-08 21:06:09
People seem to dislike it when I'm dressing masc and it makes me sad	"I've been experimenting with more masc leaning looks lately, I usually dress very femme outside of work, but I've noticed my posts on instagram when I'm wearing more masc leaning outfits don't get as much likes and it makes me sad. 
Like I know it doesn't actually matter but it makes me even more convinced that people won't be accepting if I'd ever come out as nonbinairy :( 
And I know this isn't a rational thought but it still makes me sad and I feel like I have no one to talk to about this."	"My first thought is that not liking isn't the same as *dis*liking; I think that's an important thing to remember for anybody who uses social media.

I don't know exactly what kinds of looks you've been trying or who follows you on Instagram, and this is my view as an AMAB person who grew up hating it, but I would expect masculine looks to get fewer likes on Instagram, except when they're *extremely* well-done or unexpected.  I think of masculinity generally as being about conforming, blending in, being neutral, being boring, being invisible.

ETA: I think that it makes sense to feel what you're feeling, and I'm sorry if people didn't appreciate what you were going for with your masc-leaning outfits.
I'm sorry things are going poorly.  I know it can be disheartening.  I've had similar reactions when I start leaning towards what I feel is like a gender neutral style for myself.  


If it means anything I really like your style!
Instagram isn't a good metric, and honestly I don't know if u can say this loud enough, if you are happy with how you look and they aren't F U C K. T H E M. They aren't the ones you have to live with and they aren't the ones that get to decide what makes you happy. You are. Dress how the fuck you want to ❤️
 Sometimes people have gotten to know you in a certain way and when you change looks they are simply unsure- so they don't say anything. Keep posting your looks and say a few words- 'boy mode today- feeling strong"" ; ""cute new  dress!"" or whatever, and soon enough people will know what to expect and it will be more in the natural flow to respond.
Social media likes are one of the most fickle and random ways of determining how much people actually like you. Many of the people who might “like” a post may never even see it because of how all the social networks manipulate people’s feeds. 

And on Instagram in particular, an attractive femme look will *always* get more likes than an equally attractive masc look. I guess some guys think that if they like another dude’s look, that makes them “gay”. Don’t take it personally. 

Tbh, it’s a good general rule of thumb to not take *anything* that happens on social media personally, because 95% of it is either people being nasty simply because they can, or just complete BS. Who you are and what you’re worth are never going to be accurately determined or represented by social media."	j55d5v	NonBinary	52	0.98	2020-10-04 19:55:18

"No. Nobody is ""transing"" the tomboys."	"The current popular argument amongst anti-trans bigots and assorted TERFS uses the ""heartfelt"" stories of adult women who grew up as tomboys to fear monger about the possibility of girls being ""funneled"" into lives as trans men. This is something that has never happened. It's also totally contrary to the entire ethos of being supportive and accepting of trans people and everyone.

So, this essay might seem unneeded. The idea I'm debunking is obviously flawed. However, I do think this idea of ""*how would my childhood be different growing up with trans acceptance*?"" can open some scary doors for some people (and some wonderful doors for others) for a certain type of person it could be a very effective argument. I wrote this to dissect in detail how and why it fails.

Let's just say, this is a question I've asked myself. But, I concluded that such acceptance and education about the variable nature of gender would have \*helped\* me. I'm sad that I didn't have access to it-- even though I don't think my life would be radically different, I could have avoided some emotional suffering and confusion. I want that for everyone. Trans positive, informed childhood isn't just beneficial to trans kids. It suggests a better relationship to gender for us all.

\-----

I don't want to link to it, but a TERF group has a video up where a woman talks about how she thinks growing up today she'd ""end up"" being a trans man.  You see, she was a tomboy, what if people mistook that for her being trans? (she worries)

Let's walk through it.

Imagine a ""tomboy"" a young girl with no interest in anything ""for girls"" she dresses like a boy, does boy stuff. And, because sexism exists, she isn't looking forward to being treated like a girl or a woman for all her life. ""I don't want to be a girl!"" she even says.

Let's even imagine that all this makes her parents wonder if she might be trans. What would they do at this point? Probably ask ""are you uncomfortable being called 'she/her'? Do you not want to have your girly name anymore? What’s going on?” This changing names, pronouns and how you participate is called ""social transitioning.”

For trans kids and trans tweens its really all they are asking for. Just use different pronouns, recognize the change, let them try it out.  So, let's say this girl says ""yeah, I want to be Billy not Jane."" since she thinks this will address her feelings. (This is assuming her parents aren’t able to get to the bottom of her real feelings for some reason. Let's make this the 'worst case' scenario of being mistaken for being trans.)

Is she now locked in to being a boy forever? 

Will she be dragged to a hospital?

Obviously not. 

So, she tries out the social transitioning.  The name change might not feel off but I'd imagine for a tomboy who's fundamentally mad that girls aren't treated as well as boys ... being called ""he"" will probably feel... off. 

And this is where, for many reasons some, change their mind. And that's totally fine. The whole damn point is to free people from the constraints of gender rules not to just move people from one restrictive box to another.

But, let's imagine our tomboy *hides* how she feels about the pronouns feeling off. So they move on to talking to a psychologist and doctor as she's getting older.  What happens now? There is a lot of talking and opening up to be done.

# ""I hate being a girl. The world isn't fair to girls. I wish people would take me seriously even though I'm a girl. I'm a tomboy. If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I'll do it.""

This isn't what being a trans man sounds like. This is what hating sexism while being a tomboy sounds like. 

""Do you want to have a man's body?""

""Do you want facial hair?""

""Do you want a deep voice?""

The effects of hormones are well documented and explained to anyone who might take them. People take hormones because they want those well documented effects. ""tomboys"" don't \*really\* want to be boys. Many trans people don't even take hormones. And it's not like any little girl who likes to play in the mud is going to be fast tracked into hormones. The choice is up to the person taking the hormones.

I think some people imagine that parents could just misread signs of questioning about gender and decide to BAM *put* their kid on hormones the way that kids are sometimes put on ADHD medicines. This isn't how it works. We are talking about people aged 17, 18, 19 and up making these decisions-- after YEARS of social transition and talking about what they really feel.

If anything the whole process might be over cautious. I've heard many trans people complain that others think ""it's only a phase"" which can be really patronizing. 

There is a ton of pressure at every step to *not* go forward. This isn't something that can be accidental.

Of course, this whole discussion omits non binary people.  Part of what makes a ""horror"" story like this possible is the idea that gender has to be binary. You need to be ALL GIRL or ALL BOY. Even though that's obviously not how people really are. I think that some of us who relate to this idea of growing up as a tomboy. And ""hating being a girl"" would benefit from simply knowing that people can be non-binary. Even if in the end you don't decide that's who *you* are just knowing that people exist on a spectrum through gender is a liberating idea.

How much better off so many of us would be if we could grow up with such an understanding! If we could ditch this idea that there is only one right way to be a woman and one right way to be a man?

Not only is this better for trans kids it's better for all of us."	"thank you for the description; it's really nice to see it written out in a way that makes it abundantly clear that this slope isn't slippery at all
“If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I’ll do it”

No cap this is what largely broke my egg. I’m transmasc nb and incredibly happy. Not a tomboy. I’m not on T and I don’t plan to go on. The dysphoria I feel is 90% social - people treating me like a woman or a girl. Going easy on me when we play sports. Holding the door for me, calling me ma’am. Asking me to participate in the societal game in ways that I don’t want to or can’t fully because I’m not. A woman.

I’m not saying I dont like your essay. Tomboys and Trans Males need to be treated better in childhood and deserve to have their needs met. I want to share my experience because, regrettably, TERF’s arguments require so much nuance and effort to tear down. All the best. 🤍💛💜🖤

Small side rant: I also want to share bc it feel like so much dysphoria talk is centered on physical body traits and mine is so centered on others perception of me. It makes me feel pretty pushed out of the conversation; like I can’t relate to other trans people so well.
Thank you so much for this post!
I wasn’t really a tomboy. I didn’t dress like one or really act like one. The only thing that was necessarily “tomboy” about me was I liked bugs and looking for bugs and stuff. That’s it and now I’m a nonbinary guy. You don’t have to be a tomboy to want to be a guy. Girls can dress however they want and act however they want. They can be tomboys but that doesn’t mean they’re boys or men. And it doesn’t mean they want to transition. I agree op!
Coming from the trans fem pov I want to be a tomboy. I’ve always had envy for tomboys. I am definitely not a man
What I always find bizarre is how easily they think cis kids’ identities are utterly obliterated and overwritten by people being accepting and supportive of trans kids. I grew up at a time when just being gay was seen as sick and dangerous, and being trans was a best a hilarious joke, but I’m still trans, but we’re meant to believe that cis identities are so fragile that merely saying it’s ok to be trans is enough to change who they are? Like how the hell do they think people work?
I didn't want to put it in the essay but I think some portion of the people freaking out over this might be happier if they had a real nb path to take.   


But I do think there is a difference between thinking “If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I’ll do it” AND ""I don't want to be treated badly because **I am a girl**."" and just thinking “If I have to be a guy to get treated right FINE I’ll do it” AND ""I don't want to be treated badly as girls often are.""  


Fundamentally tomboys are girls, and are more invested in still having that respected even as they totally fail to meet any of the expectation for behavior.   


Though these things can be blurry on the edges.  I honestly can't say if I knew more about what nb was when I was younger if that's where I might have gone. I think probably not. But it's not like gender is always some essential immutable quality. I think this scares people. There is this subtext with LGBTQ identities of ""we can't help it, so being a jerk to us is wrong."" This is an easier idea to defend when bigots attack.  


But it's still wrong to be a jerk if a person \*can\* ""help it.""

got rid of another hurtful non accepting transphobic person in my life	"God, this hurts.

I brought up the topic of transgender and non binary to a friend of mine, long time friend, and then decided to come out to him.

Worst mistake of my life. Or one of the worst, anyway.

Basically he told me I was mentally fucked up for wanting a gender neutral body (this isn't what I'd really want but closest I could get), and that I was basically rejecting my assigned gender at birth and why did I expect him to give a shit anyway? I am free to think whatever bullshit I want to think about myself, but why should he care?

Oh, I don't know, maybe because caring about each other is the basis of friendship? Maybe because all I have asked for is understanding and support? Maybe because my coming out doesn't change who I am inside and doesn't change who I am to him? Oh wait, apparently it does.

I'm so fucking sick of those people. Turning themselves into the poor victim of us insane transgender non binary crazies trying to force them to care about shit.

I'm not even sad, I'm hurt, certainly, but it will get better now that I got rid  of him in my life entirely. Blocked him all over the place, messenger, whatsapp, you name it, he's gone. But I'm actually shaking from rage as I type this.

What right do they have in deciding what and what doesn't matter? What right do they have in deciding what shouldn't or shouldn't be a big deal in our lives? Why should I respect them more than myself by keeping my mouth shut and not bothering them with how I think of myself?

Jesus fucking christ I'm so, so angry right now. I think if I was a volcano, I'd be just about ready to explode, just missing one or two things to be set off and trigger the worst volcanic eruption since Pompeii."	"They're just annoyed that we're trying to change things, being more true to ourselves, changing the conversations and making people think about their own gender. WHAT A FUCKING PRIVILEGE IT IS TO NEVER THINK ABOUT YOUR ASSIGNED GENDER AT BIRTH. But to feel the discomfort and disgust towards yourself?? No one deserves that. 

I'm so glad you're living your authentic life. So glad you cut him out and care more about yourself than his shitty ego.
I know right? I wish I wasn't this way."	zy1vnb	NonBinary	51	0.99	2022-12-29 10:12:19
Do you know any confident nonbinary songs?	"I don't want the sad ""no one understands and accepts me"" nonbinary songs. I want nonbinary music that confidently kicks ass. Many parts of the LGBTQ+ community have both the proud and uplifting music and also the sad and unaccepted music, but almost all trans related songs are very sad. Which is understandable - there's a lot of transphobia. But I feel like there are also a very little amount of confident ones. Weren't we supposed to be proud of who we are? The only song that I can think of right now is They/Them/Theirs by Worriers. Do any of you know other nonbinary songs that make you want to rebel against gender and beat up transphobes?"	"They/them/theirs by Worriers (edit: woops it’s the one you know lol)

Flamboyant by Dorian Electra
I’d suggest Magnetic Fields as a band that through Stephin Merritt’s wry lyricism, have so frequently been good at blurring gender boundaries. Calling much of their music “confident” is a stretch! however, it’s not necessarily self-pitying.

A particularly smart line, albeit on one of their more unhappy if witty songs, is “Now that you’ve made me want to die / You tell me that you’re unboyfriendable” (All My Little Words), where “unboyfriendable” could be either referring to the narrator’s love interest not being available as a boyfriend, not being available to a boy narrator, or simply not being into boys. Even in the early ‘90s they had songs like Candy, where, sung by a female vocalist you have “Candy, I can't be the man they want me to be / Maybe it was only with you that I could be me” and the more wistful Old Orchard Beach: “You were a little girl with starry eyes / And now you’re a sad young man and no-one knows why”. But back to their relatively happy gender-ambiguous tracks! Andrew in Drag, Take Ecstasy With Me, When My Boy Walks Down the Street… there will be ones where you’ll pick up that ambiguity where I haven’t. They often relate to the sexual/gender ambiguity of the narrator’s attraction rather than that of the narrator theirself, but hearing those songs like they’re the most normal topics going made me a home in Merritt’s œuvre.

I’m not a fan but the Replacements had a lilting piano ditty on their biggest album called Androgynous, back in 1984. It’s a description of gender nonconformity and roles that shows complete openness from the narrator, which imo is seriously good work from a band of drunken young lads from that era. An apprentice at my workplace mentioned it a little while back and I was impressed that he knew of music like that being from a small, isolated town and that it was the sort of tune he’d come out and praise above all.

Failing that… Immaterial by SOPHIE.
I discovered this really cute song as a TikTok audio by gabzofficial, I really love it.

Boys and Girls by G Flip and Flious. G Flip is an enby artist from Melbourne and this was the first song they released after coming out publicly.
This probably doesn't count but I love King for a day by green day lmao
For nonbinary AFABs, ""I am not a woman, I'm a god"" and ""This Girl is a Gun"" by Halsey.
I really like Androgynous by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.
Born This Way by Lady Gaga is always a good one.

If There’s a Fire in your Heart by Grace Petrie
All great bands! Immaterial absolutely blows me away. I like so much by SOPHIE, but immaterial really gets me. ❤️
I was gonna say Androgynous by The Replacements, is it the same song?
I knew there had to be an Orion Experience song that belonged on here, I just couldn’t think of which one.
I know this is an old thread but Tomboy by G-idle dropped a month or so ago and the bridge at the end is. “I’m neither a woman or a man.” The music video is extremely good.
The pockets of air SOPHIE left for GNC people between the release of Bipp and losing her early this year have not gone unnoticed by me. Her music doesn’t seem to get much love beyond queers and production aficionados but I think as the world gets better at acknowledging people like her, her legacy will be recognised.
Yes! I guess mine was a cover.

"like, i KNOW there's no one way to be non-binary. i KNOW there's no one way to ""look"" non-binary. but i'm afab non-binary and dating a cis man and most people see me and just think ""girl."" i've been identifying as non-binary for 6 years now, but every once in a while i feel like i'm not ""performing"" it and get sad about getting misgendered so often. i don't even dress femme, my style is pretty neutral/slightly masc leaning, but i like wearing makeup.

idk. just feeling down i guess."	"I only realised I'm Nonbinary about 8 months ago and I sometimes still feel like it's all just a front and it's not really me so I understand. I don't get much body related dysphoria, my dysphoria is more social and it makes me wonder if I am nonbinary if I don't have much of a problem with my body in relation to my identity.

Seeing other enbys in the community and their style helps affirm me but I understand that might not help everyone. 

No matter what though, you are always valid!
I totally get you. I'm afab too and my presentation leans toward fem most of the time. Because I don't feel the need to change my name and pronouns, I'm not out to most people (not even my family haha) and I feel like I'm always being read as a woman. 

I don't like it. Most of the time, I wear sport bras and large clothing to hide my chest. At work, due to a recent weight gain, I wore skirts and tunics+leggings almost every day. Even tho I like those sometimes, I feel most comfortable in jeans and flannel. I can't really wear those at work because it's too casual.

I feel like an imposter because I'm not a ""typical non-binary person"", but looking trough this sub and other NB subs made me realise how different NB people can be, while still being NB. It helps me accept and embrace my fem self and reduces the imposter syndrome.
I came out as non binary a couple months ago and I still am trying to feel ok with it. I am AMAB and transitioned to female in my early 20’s but never had bottom surgery. Over the last year I’ve realized that I’m not really male or female I’m kind of a mix. I’m actually most comfortable when people can’t tell. I definitely prefer to have female pronouns used still but I’ve come to realize that I don’t really like to be considered either male or female. Sometimes I feel like an imposter as I came out as a trans woman nearly a decade ago"	gazpw7	NonBinary	48	1.0	2020-04-30 17:07:41
Any other NBs just closeted for sake of your energy?	"I am technically NB on the inside. AFAB and still use she/her pronouns because they don’t bother me (but I prefer Sir over Ma’am and Mr over Ms).

I just don’t bother telling or explaining to people because they don’t get it. Even my bi (ex?) fiancé doesn’t get it.

I would like to have the body my brain tells me I should have and not curves everywhere. But surgery just seems so risky for the mild dysphoria I get on occasion.

I’m just too lazy to bother with it TBH and for all intents and purposes I guess I’m a cis woman. I don’t behave like one or think like one (man do dudes think me talking more like “one of the guys” means I’m flirting. No I just like cussing and dirty jokes thanks).

I guess I’m just sad because to be seen as “not a woman” (Agender femme) I guess I need to do more? I’m tired. I’m just not a woman. That’s it.

Also it’s only my secondary sex characteristics that bother me and not my genitals or anything. Puberty was hella traumatic.

IDK. I guess I’m just old and too tired to change."	"Yes to all of this. I have short hair and wear “masculine” clothes because it’s more comfortable for me. But I have not told a single soul (besides my partner) that I am agender. I use “Ms.” at work and I’m 98% sure everyone thinks I’m a cis woman. It just seems like so much work to explain to people and then the anxiety of someone being a bigot. I’d rather just live my life and let other people live theirs.
Yesss, that's pretty much 60% of the reason why I haven't bothered coming out to anyone except a few people.  The other percent is due to transphobia bc my mom is a bitch and this area is shit for LGBTQ related stuff.  Lol
Yuuup. I live in a state that's pretty unsafe for trans people. I'm out to my close friends and some family, but I don't have the emotional energy to explain my gender to everyone I meet. Especially since that means making sure each person is safe to be out around.
My situation is that it feels exhausting getting people who aren't my close/queer friends to use they/them. It's hard enough of many to do he/him, which is a secondary preference. Going through the TSA, I have to speak in the context of my trans masculine identity but use binary terms to get them to understand what I am in terms of how they are going to search me. Friends more outside my common circle sometimes use feminine pronouns, which I never used during the course of knowing them. It's hard enough waking up to all the awful movements against the freedom, access, general existence, and investment in our community. I tend to disengage more from people who just don't best respect me naturally. It's honestly such a small effort needed to acknowledge someone properly.
So, I have the experience of coming out as a trans man. I’m not tho, not really. I’m transmasculine, but I’m nonbinary. I realized this a couple years into my transition, after I had already come out.  Coming out was like, super stressful the first (second actually, I came out as bi when I was younger) time and I did not want to have to do it again; especially when my family was already having a tough time getting my name and pronouns correct.

I’ve been nonbinary for a few years now, I have some nonbinary pride merch, and I’ve also come out to my brother and his girlfriend (it was super casual tho and was very “oh yea I’m nb..moving on”), but for the most part yea…I empathize.

Coming out is tough. It doesn’t help if it’s your first time doing so, or the “last time” as you reprocess your identity and grow. But ultimately coming out is your experience*! You don’t have to do it at all, but if you want to, you will when you’re ready! There is no pressure or time crunch; it’s your journey

(*sorry to everyone who’s been outted 😭)

🤡/🌫
Same here, always been NB. I might tell my adult son one day, but I don't mind what people think of me =. not interested in surgery as I like both male and female aspects (fluid)

I enjoy the fact I have to wear mens footwear because my feet are gnarly lol. and a lot of mens clothing fits better anyways. but i still look female

too old and tired too !
Although I try to maintain a gender ambiguous appearance, I haven’t aligned myself with a pronoun preference yet. That could change of course.
Yes.  But also because it’s so much energy to what?  Defend existence and personhood?  To someone who won’t actually probably change their mind anyway.

Fuck it.  Idk, it’s hard, I wish I had more enby/gnc community here.  But reality I guess.

You’re valid out or not tho.  In a hostile world, just do what you can to survive and conserve energy for what matters
My girlfriend uses my pronouns and respects my identity, and that is enough for me. Other people don't need to know and I don't care enough to waste energy on it. I couldn't imagine having a partner who couldn't love me for who I am, and because being nonbinary is part of who I am I wouldn't date anyone who can't respect that. Everybody else I don't care enough to bother with it.
I can completely relate to this. I’m very lucky compared to a lot of people, during my upbringing my mum always encouraged me to present how I want, and wear whatever I want to wear. She was never bothered about me wanting ‘boys clothes’ and even allowed me to experiment with boys underwear. She didn’t force dresses or skirts or anything overly feminine, which was a massive relief. I experimented with very short hair as well, but it felt too masculine. I’m very confident with presenting how I want and feel comfortable. Others would probably describe my presentation as ‘tomboyish’. I tend to wear fairly gender neutral men’s or women’s clothes, my hair is fairly gender neutral, I have piercings. I’m asexual, but I experience romantic attraction and to and would only date girls, so people generally just think I’m a bit masculine because I’m a lesbian. I don’t get any stick for living my life. I really don’t have the energy to explain my gender identity to everyone, and continuously correct people when they use she/her pronouns. However this does make me feel a bit disloyal to the nb community.
oof, yes. this. I'm only out to my closest and whomever is able to intuit enough to ask.  though i don't try to conceal it, i haven't told my family. Mainly to preserve my own energy, but also so i don't have to feel/frustrated or sad toward them.  For example, I changed my name ....*(fuuuuuh)* 11 years ago and my mom still gets it wrong half the time.  Perhaps I'm doing her a disservice by not allowing her more time to try and get my pronouns right, but tbh, I don't have the energy for that strain these days.  However, the flip side of this is missing out on the wonderful gender affirmation if/when you can get it.  I was in a very LGBTQIA friendly area with friends a while ago and so used to the service-voice address of ""ma'am"" was i, that i was totally thrown for a loop when i got a gender neutral ""my friend"" from the server.  I still get a little misty eyed thinking about it even though i didn't really think i cared that much before.  just something to think about <3
Yeah, same for me. My husband doesn't get it and I know he will leave me if I got top surgery. I could pay for it, I want it, I maybe will never get it because don't want to lose him. Have the feeling that nobody would get it, nobody would use my chosen name. But hearing 'she' and 'Mrs' hurts more every day.
Well ya know what drains you to the point that you feel old and tired and like you don’t have energy to do things that are important? Gender dysphoria and living an inauthentic life, sir!
I totally get the point you are making, and it’s not going to be an overnight fix if/when you start presenting and living your NB truth, but I can still tell you that it’s absolutely worth it & that it will pay in dividends and start giving you your energy back and making you feel more confident. 💜
Fucking PREACH

It's really tiring, because the ""current"" concept of gender is so universally accepted without thought, that properly explaining to someone why all these standards are made up requires an entire book reading.
I'm pretty feminine in appearance, but that's just because it's easier. My sister and online friends know that I use they/them pronouns. But at work, and with not close family, i don't care if they use my birth name and she/her pronouns. 

i'm too poor for surgery. i'll never be able to have top surgery, and i'm very tired of explaining they/them pronouns to my parents, who constantly still use she/her pronouns to me even though i've been out as enby since 19. i just really gotten to the point of not caring honestly. 

just exhausting. my sister is the only family that actually tries and is on my side, and im very thankful for that.
It’s tough because my experience as a feminine coded person matters too. It’s like a catch 22
I also don’t wanna deal with hormones or surgery. To me the downsides outweighs the benefits
I wish I was ace. I’m IG heterosexual if we got by reproductive parts. Mo boys = Mo problems.
I’m autistic as well. I think that’s the part that makes it hard to do other things on top of just getting through the day.

More non-binary people than I thought	"Its kind of old news probably, but I just stumbled across the [The Report of the
2015 U.S. Transgender Survey](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf), and I thought some of the statistics where very interesting and unexpected. Sorry if this has been discussed before.

Chapter 4 (page 47-67) contains the results of one of the largest transgender surveys conducted at the time in the US (27k+ respondents). The survey is very thorough. For the most part the respondents where split into 4 groups: trans woman, trans men, non-binary people and cross dressers. Here are some of the statistics:

>Gender identity: 35% Non-binary, 33% Transwoman, 29% Transmen, 3% Crossdressers

>Pronouns respondents ask people to use: 37% he/his, 37% she/her, 29% they/their, 20% do not ask people to use specific pronouns, 4% no pronouns (only name), 4% other pronouns than the ones listed, 2% ze/hir.

>Sexual orientation non-binary people: 34% queer, 21% pansexual, 17% asexual, 10% bisexual, 8% homosexual, 8% sexual orentation not listed, 2% heterosexual.

>Gender that people who do not know they are non-binary usually assume they are: 58% Non-trans woman, 19% Assumptions vary, 17% Non-trans man, 2% Trans man, 2% Others cannot tell their genders, 1% Trans woman, 1% Non-binary.

>53% Sometimes tell others they are non-binary, 44% usually let others assume they are man or woman, 3% always tell others they are non-binary.

>Main reasons for not telling people they are non-binary: 86% most people do not understand so they don't try to explain it, 82% it is easier not to say anything, 63% most people dismiss it as not being a real identity or a ""phase"", 43% they might face violence, 35% they are not ready to tell people they identify as non-binary, 35% the might lose their job or not able to get a job, 24% they might not get the medical care they need.

I was very surprised at how many people identified as non-binary, seeing how little representation there is here on Reddit (both r/ftm and r/mtf are over 3 times the size, and they also seem to be the majority on subs like /asktransgender). 

In a way I shouldn't really be surprised that 58% of non-binary people are seen as a woman vs 17% men, since its socially acceptable for woman to dress as man but not for man to dress as woman, so when most people see a trace of femininity, they'll automatically think woman. But I was really surprised only 5% thought they where trans and/or non-binary. Personally, this is also the reason I don't like to go outside looking more 'feminine' because I don't like how different people treat me when they think I'm a woman.

The amount of non-binary people that never disclose that they are non-binary and the reasons why weren't very surprising to me, seeing how socially unacceptable it still is, but still made me kind of sad.

Thoughts?"	"I was part of that survey and also one who said I'd never bring up that I was nonbinary. Still don't ever plan to, since I'm close enough to binary that I feel kind of like a fake enby anyway (probably some form of internalized transphobia? idk), and also since it's harder to explain. But yeah, none of the stats are particularly surprising to me other than there seeming to be more nonbinary people than each separate group of binary trans people. I also agree with the expressing femininity thing; since I'm close to binary anyway, I'm basically waiting until I completely pass as male until I let myself dabble in any kind of feminine expression simply because I hate being referred to in feminine terms. I hope one day we'll get to the point where people don't assume gender based on expression and appearances.
We are living in a time where the concept of ""gender"" is getting more vague and personal. I think it's interesting that more and more people are thinking about the way they relate to gender. It makes a lot of sense, imo, for transmasculine and transfeminine people to say they don't feel comfortable calling themselves a man/woman respectively, if I could quote ContraPoints (Natalie Wynn): ""Saying ""I am a woman"" still feels to me like an awful lot of ontological commitment.""
Oh wow, I was convinced that we were just a tiny sliver of the whole trans population. This is very interesting, thanks!
this is actually really affirming. I have a 'they pronoun button' on my bag and i always hope that someone will see it and be like, hey me too!  like when I wear my religious pendant.  Hasn't happened yet but I keep hoping. 
Very cool to see those statistics!

No gender-neutral language	"In my native language (German) basically nothing is gender-neutral. There is currently a massive societal debate going on and currently the agreement is to add an * or : which includes everyone on the spectrum.
Eg.: Student (en) is Schüler*in (de).

I work in academia and am currently trying to hand in an article at a scientific journal which explicitly states you have to use „and“ instead (so „Schülerinnen und Schüler“ „female and male students“). Which by being binary really is not inclusive language at all.

I had to correct my text accordingly and now I feel horrible and invalid (I identify as agender). Every * I erased felt like I was erasing myself. It’s like my own text doesn’t speak to me anymore and there’s nothing I can do because I have zero bargaining power. I haven’t come out at work yet and I‘m not ready either.
Anyone else has been in a similar situation and has any advice?
I guess this is just a sad rant but I needed somewhere to vent."	"Is ""Liebe Lernenden"",""Studierende"" an option? ""Studierende"" is widely used in Germany now, it kinda circumvents the whole debacle.

I guess putting enbies in explicitly like in ""Studenten, Studentinnen und nichtbinäre/diverse Studierende""
The German language sucks in this regard. Fellow German here. Can you write to the journal and call them out on their non-inclusivity? I think, the visibility is super bad in Germany and they might think, they're super progressive with their ""you need to use er und sie"". I work in scientific publishing and so many people are so not aware there's more than he and she. 😔 At least the : should be made an option. Also, don't lots of unis nowadays push for inclusive language? Students have to learn it and then the journal says ""no""? That's so bad 😞
My first language is French, everything is gendered too, i feel your pain
I'm german so I know xour feeling too well. :C
[removed]
If you would wanna see more uncessary complications of language learn some polish. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, numerals, everything is gendered
Yeah,  I only use „Studierende“ even in everyday talk but this is about middle/high school students. So there really only is „Schüler*innen“. „Lernende“ also doesn’t work in that context unfortunately.
I actually think I might write to them after a decision about my paper has been made. Before it’s just too risky. 
The journal is based on Switzerland actually. I don’t know where the debate is at down there.
Why? Neutral language is just so much more inclusive and if that argument doesn’t work for you: believe me, gender neutral language is also a lot easier when it comes to grammar.
Hm. Is ""Gymnasiasten"" gender neutral? Are there ""Gymnasiastinnen""?

""Besucher der Schule"" is gendered too.

Enby Actor - Director did dressing room assignments NOT by gender!	"I have had the pleasure of working with the same director two summers in a row and she has been one of the most accepting and loving people I have worked with in the professional theater industry. On day one this year she asked us to go around the circle and say our names, our roles, and our pronouns. She's a very woke white woman from Chicago and I just love her lol

Well dressing room woes is a big one for me. If we all go around the circle and give our pronouns then I'm not the odd one out, we're all participating... But if I'm the only trans actor in the production then obviously I'm the only one making this an issue. But ahead of time this director pulled me aside this year and said hey, what do you think we should do? I recommended the six characters that interact the most in one room (4m, 2w) and the four ensemble members in the other (me, 1w, 2m)... And that's what we've been doing... and it's been AMAZING. Everyone said they were comfortable, we're all of age, we're all professional, we can run lines and talk about our scenes and bond... And there's bathrooms attached to both rooms if we want privacy, no big deal at all.

I have been so spoiled by this experience, it's going to be sad to move on to my next projects where this won't be considered so sensitively. But I'm just really enjoying this small victory for now."	"this is really great and makes me so happy for you!!!!
[deleted]
This is absolutely rad. Also a stellar idea: I feel like bonding and being together based on role is much more sensible than being together based on assumed genitalia :P

I know it's bittersweet to know that future projects probably won't be as great, but definitely enjoy it while you can!! This is such an amazing thing to be able to experience and have everyone not be weird or dumb about <3

That sounds absolutely great, I'm happy for you 😊
I wish I did. I got lucky with this director, who just happens to be a wonderful person who is always educating and better herself. It was no influence of mine. Sadly even when I have been asked my pronouns or there is an ""other"" option on a form at an audition or casting call... 5 minutes later they'll say something like ""Men over here, women over there"" and it's like wow, thanks y'all. Glad you're all on the same page with this...
At first there were a few comments like ""Really? Wait I don't think she means permanently right?"" but that's just because several have worked at that theater before and are use to women being in the left room and men being in the right room. At one point another staff member was confused and asked why someone's stuff was in the wrong room. When we explained it wasn't she was like ""Okay that's weird."" I kind of bitterly chirped ""I think it's progressive"" and her response was ""Yes, but is everyone comfortable?"" and it was like YES DUDE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE'RE ALL ADULTS WE'RE OKAY THANKS.

If anything it'll be nice to know this can work out and maybe I can be more outspoken with offering it as a viable alternative in the future.
Hah yeah idk what a good workaround for that would be, I never have to deal with it cuz im a sound mixer lol 

I worked on one crew and afterwards the director posted on instagram something like ""our crew today had no men on it and guess what we wrapped an hour before schedule and had no major conflicts"" and i was like ahh thank u "	8vy5t5	NonBinary	42	0.94	2018-07-04 02:45:10

Not trans enough?	"I know, it's practically a cliche at this point, but I really do feel like my path is totally different from that of other NB folks I've met. I'm not changing my name (I like it). I'm not going on HRT. I'm not opting for any kind of surgery. I'm not even wearing a binder. I don't get dysphoria all the time, I get waves of it which kind of suck, but then I get past it and I actually feel a lot better. When I ask myself the question ""would I be happier as the other gender"" right now the answer is a solid, resounding NO.

I've explored the fact that maybe I'm just genderfluid and that maybe sometimes I identify with my birth gender more than I think, I'm just not particularly femme at all. That I'm just fluctuating between masc girl and femme man and I barely qualify, just the same way I'd never get a clinical diagnosis for my OCD because it's not wrecking my life. But I feel like that's such a complex thing to explain to anyone other than randos on the Internet who are familiar with NB/trans issues.

This whole thing has just been such a rollercoaster of emotions. It's not being helped by the fact one of my childhood friends is transitioning to NB medically and they have pretty much lost everything, including beloved family members who have flat out told them they won't be using their new name and that it's ""stupid"". I'm not as brave as they are to march into the fire for my ideals. I'm a coward. I've ID'd as bisexual since I was 16 and I've only ever ONCE come out to someone where it might have been a risk to my career. I have my work identity and my real identity and I use my work identity to live a life of privilege that would not exist if anyone found out who I really was.

I'm left thinking being out is not worth the sacrifice, and that makes me feel like a really shitty person and someone who's not only not trans but also a really shitty ally to those who are stuck in the sad, grim reality of ""transition or die"" and have NO CHOICE but to transition and lose everything or literally take their own lives.

I feel like such a scumbag, and I can't help but think maybe I'd be better off just leaving this community and not sucking up resources for people who really need them, when I can get by just fine with my happy marriage and my career and my home and being AFAB who dresses a bit masc (which is socially accepted everywhere).

Can I get your real thoughts? Like, PM them if you want to say something harsh, I just want to know if like, maybe I should leave?"	"Your experience is perfectly valid. Dysphoria coming in waves is pretty normal. You don't have to change your name, change your pronouns or transition medically to be valid. Binary trans people don't either but at least they have a accepted label to transition into, enbies don't.

If you're happy with your name, and pronouns and think transition is not worth it than don't transition. You're always free to change your mind later or to take whatever steps (small or large) to ease your dysphoria. You don't need to transition everywhere and go ""full time"" if that doesn't work for you, and not doing so doesn't change your gender, make you not trans or invalidate your dysphoria. You certainly don't need to feel the need to be the other binary gender because, well, enbies aren't binary and we have diverse experiences of gender. You don't need to leave the community. 

I hope your friend is doing okay. 
My personal belief is that one doesn't need to fully adhere to a particular label's so called ""requirements"" and can choose to do only what will make them more comfortable. Not one human being is represented perfectly by what is within a textbook or a study - the human experience is different for all people. 

Some people need to change more to feel comfortable, while others need only to make small adjustments to their lifestyle and their thoughts. It's smart to weigh the benefits and the risks, to experiment if needed, and it's acceptable to want to remain in the life one has established for themselves. 

I am certain that there are plenty of people who are in active denial about their gender variance, or who are not changing out of fear... And I am equally certain that there are people who don't feel the need to change much, if anything, but still identify as somewhere out of the typical binary points - and it's perfectly valid. 

Don't feel that you need to adhere to a set of rigid rules - the only rule to follow is to do what gives you your best life. 
It makes perfectly good sense that different people should experience differing degrees of dysphoria over differing aspects of their being, and that the dysphoria may or may not fluctuate significantly and may or may not manifest itself primarily in contexts specific to an individual's life experiences.

Things would be so much better if people in general were more aware of how varying individual experiences can be. There would then be a more nuanced and thorough understanding/acceptance of gender variance in general, as opposed to (e.g.) a theoretical acceptance/tolerance of one or two ""official"" forms of gender variance combined with obliviousness/uneasiness/scorn towards anything that doesn't fit the familiar mould.

It also makes perfectly good sense that the number of people experiencing less extreme, less consistent dysphoria would be more numerous than those consistently experiencing extreme dysphoria. It's just that, the more society in general is hostile towards or uneasy about gender variance, the more likely it is that the less extremely/consistently dysphoric ones will see the closet as the least bad option.

Even if you remain completely closeted in ""real"" life, continuing to share your experiences and thoughts online will still help to increase awareness of how variable gender variance can be, so that fewer people will try to suppress their feelings through fear of being thought a fool/imposter.

If your ""life of privilege"" was really so wonderful, you wouldn't spend so much time worrying about aspects of yourself that you don't feel able to express in that life.
I have a very selfish reason that I want you to stay, and that is that I want your situation to be valid. Heck, it is valid, but I identify with your fears (I'm transfeminine with questions and doubts pointing in either direction) so I hope you are welcome here.

Although my femininity is squishable if I choose to, if I closet it for too long I get dysphoric and I no longer feel like I'm myself. I recommend that you continue to give yourself an outlet, even if it's not your day-to-day presentation of yourself. Are there groups of people you could be openly yourself around?

Above all, you don't need to feel guilty for your gender or its presentation.
I'm AFAB non-binary femme, and I feel you.

But we have to remember that gender is a galaxy, and there is no one right way to be non-binary.  Your feelings are valid, and you are not ""sucking up resources,"" because we deserve the resources too.  Psychology and society needs to be aware that we exist and we are struggling, too.  We experience dysphoria and distress and we need help, too. You don't need to just ""suck it up,"" because you deserve to be happy and mentally healthy.  
Thank you for putting into words what I have been feeling.
I want our community to be all about being open and accepting of each other. We are all different, and it should be all about embracing that. It not like a mental illness that you can get a diagnosis for, being trans/enby is about feeling it. If it feels right then it probably is. 

I get that it's easy to feel invalid, heck I'm still feeling invalid and even though I'm starting to become more and more of a cliché. I'll probably start taking testosterone and make a mastektomi and I'm still feeling invalid. But we can't let other people define us, we have to define ourselves! 
Just because your situation isn't as dire doesn't mean your situation isn't legitimate. Don't let anyone gatekeep you out of this community by not being whatever enough. There's enough of that crap in the broader LGBT community.
One friend told me there isn't a right or wrong way of being non binary. I shift in moods when I want to wear make up. I shift in moods when I don't. I am happy with my body I am on bc be cause I don't want children and I want nothing to change my body apart from weight loss. My clothes style does change. People could think I am feminine or masculine but I don't get it. 

I don't get the ""Girl"" nights and ""guy"" nights.  I don't understand the battle of the sexs when I grew up.

I don't feel a gender term male or female I am a person. I use non binary as a description of lable. 
I'm in much the same position. Really, I don't have a problem with myself, I have a problem with the way society views me. I'm ace, so since sexuality isn't an issue maybe I'm not as sensitive about what parts I do or do not have. I just hate being treated differently because of how people perceive me, and that's going to happen no matter how I present...
even if you are genderfluid, you are trans/non-binary enough. i also don't experience physical dysphoria (but euphoria), just social dysphoria, and i know i'm trans enough. never let other people tell you what your identity is.
I didn't read through the other comments so sorry of this is redundant. 

You have to do what's best for you to be happy. If you're happy with how you interact with the world and with yourself, then that's great! 

I think I felt very similarly to you for a long time. I knew I was genderfluid but it didn't come up a lot in conversation and I didn't feel the need to change anything or let people know. I was out as bi, but even that didn't come up much outside of friends and partners. That didn't make me any less bi or less genderfluid, it just wasn't a big deal for me. 

I can't put my finger on what changed, but over the past year or so I've been wanting to pull open my closet and say ""look! Look at all this baggage that has been jumbled up over the years! It's a mess and I want to figure it out and it'd be great if you helped me!"" So I've started coming out and my disphoria has intensified and I've started making decisions....but that doesn't make me any more trans than I was before.

I know this is more anecdotal than advice, but you are valid, whatever you're feeling. Your choices are yours, and should be respected. You don't have to be out, especially if you're feeling unsafe or even unstable. But if you want to be part of a community, this community, we welcome you, especially if you're a little bit different from the rest of us. Diversity is a good thing, in every community. You. Are. Enough. 
Did you change how you identify with your gender?

I hope my friend is okay too. They're doing some self care today so I think they'll be ok. I try to support them but I can't see myself making the same choices they made. I think in some ways that's what makes me feel like an imposter, like, they gave everything away to become their true self and there's me, stuffing all my baggage back into the closet so nobody sees it's falling out.

It fills me with a sense of shame, and yet I can't convince myself I'm doing the wrong thing. I think if I was in the situation they were in, I would seriously consider ending my life. And that's not a place I want to go. I'm not strong enough to set myself on fire to rise from the ashes like a phoenix. I'd rather live with the dysphoria.

I feel like that makes me a really shitty, cowardly person, but it's the truth.
Same here
Possibly, I don't know. Like, I came into this confused and I'm still confused and figuring things out.

I really wish there were clear answers. I feel like it's impossible to forge a path without them. But I might have to.

I'm frustrated because if I can't even explain this consistently to the people here, what chance do I have to explain this to my spouse who's not familiar with all the terminology? Every time I try to talk to him about it I always feel like it comes out a mess and he doesn't understand and I'm not sure I even understand the words coming out of my mouth.

I'm just trying to take baby steps and not freak myself out. All I know is that I don't want to end up losing all the best things in my life. If that means at some point I have to put my gender exploration on the back burner, that may be a sacrifice I have to make.
You're not a cowardly person, and certainly not a shitty person just because you don't want to transition. Transition goes swimmingly for some us and totally tears one's life apart for others. The risks are there and I think we all understand the fear. Try not to feel ashamed, transitioning is not the only valid choice and anyway I don't think people transition before they're ready to (which depends a lot on society too). If you're never feel like you're ready to you're probably not going to(?). And if you do eventually choose to transition, the choices you make now are how you're figuring out how best to deal with things now, not how you feel then. 

I know people suggest gender therapists for those transitioning, but they aren't there just for that. If you're struggling with your feelings consider counseling. They are there to help you deal with feelings in a way that works for you.

Can we talk about the NB kid who wrote the letter to Nintendo? Kid is a rock star, but how did Nintendo not say Ditto, half the steel types, and all but two Legendary Pokémon defy the gender binary? It makes me sad that they just like... forgot. Or didn't want to be seen with us.		"So here is the child's dad's twitter about the letter his kid wrote and the response that Nintendo (eventually) wrote back: [https://twitter.com/PleaseBeGneiss/status/1405010708060807168](https://twitter.com/PleaseBeGneiss/status/1405010708060807168)  They took their time writing, so my guess is they really workshopped this and decided this was the ""safest"" answer for a company that operates in both countries where LGBTQ+ rights are supported and in countries where they aren't.  I get it.  But it makes me really said.  Especially when they've had non-binary Pokémon in the game since Gen 2.... or even Gen 1, though gender wasn't much of a thing then.

Also, we've had the choice between boy and girl trainers for 21 years now, ever since Pokémon Crystal.  Time for somebody to expand that! Niantic, you listening? I want to be able to put cute clothes on my trainer without having to have a chest in-game!

That dad was a rock star, though.  What awesome parenting, encouraging his kid to write to the company and self-advocate."	ov9v6y	NonBinary	40	0.95	2021-07-31 16:09:16

This was going to be the first year I didn’t dress up. I was so sad I couldn’t handle it and ended up throwing something together! Happy Spooky Day!!		"Fun fact: this is actually my bad attempt to dress like an NPC from a dnd campaign I’m running! (Haven’t gathered all the stuff for that yet though lol. Still need the silver wig and contacts, but the dress, horns, and jewelry are correct!) Basically they’re a mysterious magical woman named Ysildea that even the most adept wizards cannot understand, and no matter where the party goes, she always seems to be there when they start to consider garnering her dangerous assistance. 
To be honest, the party knows very little about her, and what little they do know is very likely more of her lies and trickery. They don’t know if that is her true name, face, voice, or body, and they never know her true intentions until it is far too late.
Woah, love it! That necklace looks amazing. Hope you had a good day of spooks :)

Anyone else gradually 'trickling out'?	"I've never wanted to make a big deal about my gender identity, and I've spent most of my life questioning it (especially before learning about nonbinary gender identities).

As of the past half year or so, I'm just now maybe 85% or so confident about the accuracy of the nonbinary / transfeminine agender labels in describing me.

And I've been sort of.. quietly and/or gradually coming out without ""coming out"" coming out, if that makes sense. I've been trickling out.

I've worn make-up on and off since I was about 14. (It's over 10 years later now.) It was initially about covering up acne, but it's also been about looking just ever so slightly more feminine.

Last year, I started wearing nail polish just as a subtle addition of femininity to my presentation. When people ask why I'm not sure what to say other than ""I like it?"" (And what I really want to do is berate them for questioning me for not aligning myself with traditional gender roles.. maybe I'll start doing that eventually who knows..)

There are a couple people in my life that I told I suffer from gender dysphoria, but without going into further detail.

A few people (close peer friends) know (that I'm nonbinary), but most only know what they see which looks like a kinda fruity mostly-straight guy.

I subtly correct friends who accidentally misgender me who know better. Like ""Who said anything about [insert gendered word/phrase here]? *sad face*"" and the like.

I do even subtler things when misgendered by someone who doesn't know (or emotionally affected by gendered language by someone who doesn't know)... 

Like.. when instructed ""guys on this side, girls on this side of the room"", starting to walk toward the girls section initially and making people giggle, and then going back to the guy's side kinda looking like ""oh, well fine, i guess so"" but it's all in such a way that people probably thought I was just joking around.

Or like.. just not responding, when the 'guys' in a room are addressed to respond or do something.

I'm near constantly pushing back against anti-male stereotypes, so I think this probably somewhat prevents people starting to think I'm MtF trans, and makes them think I identify as male and an MRA or something. MRAs think I'm feminist. Feminists think I'm MRA. I'm neither, kind of like my gender.

I've been increasingly talking about and posting links to trans/nonbinary related issues on social media (with a clearly pro stance on it).

I don't ask to go by gender neutral pronouns, but I make subtle alterations to my own language sometimes that hints at my gender identity. (E.G. Singing ""Never gonna give you up"" @ Karaoke and changing ""(you wouldn't get this from) any other guy"" to ""any of the guys"")

I recently changed my gender as displayed to my friends on my social media account to ""Non-Binary"", without announcing it or anything. Someone will only see it if they specifically browse to my ""About me"" section, but it's technically now there for all my friends to potentially see, no ambiguity (other than the sort of ambiguity that is nonbinary itself).

I mentioned offhand yesterday in a comment to a stranger on social media that I don't identify as a guy but will defend them.

I feel like the the trickling is speeding up exponentially. I'm getting more and more confident, and getting more and more fed up with the downsides of having people think I'm cisgender.


Can anyone relate to any of this? Thoughts?"	"I can 100% relate to you. As an AFAB person, even when I hadn't discovered the language surrounding being NB, I've always been non conforming. I'm similar to you in that I've come out to my close friends as Non Binary, and they all address me with gender neutral pronouns, but no one else knows. I changed my gender/pronouns on social media, but I've never actually made the full step to inform everyone in my life. A lot of it stems from fear of rejection and exclusion, or ridicule maybe. But I am, how you put it, trickling out. I have the closet door cracked open, but I'm not ready to swing it open totally. But you know what? That's ok! It's okay to do things your own way. Everyone is different and not coming out all at once or in a public manor doesn't make you untrue or invalid. It just means your going at your own place. 

My advice would be to move at your own pace. That's what I am trying to do with myself and it's working pretty well. If things are starting to pick up and you're becoming more comfortable, roll with that energy. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck on your journey, friend! 
Totally relatable. I'm amab and just started identifying as nonbinary 2 or 3 years ago, but I always was gender nonconforming. I've always had long hair, played with cars and barbies, etc.

While I always was pretty vocal about LGBTQ+ stuff, lately I started talking a lot more about the gender binary and why it is silly. Particularly when one of my friends met a genderfluid person a few months ago. Two of my friends were pretty transphobic, but everyone else was curious. And me and a pan friend explained how binary is for computers and we should call our genderfluid friend by whatever pronouns they prefer at the moment.

Now I'm a lot more confident about presenting however I want. Sometimes I present more masculine, sometimes more femme, sometimes I wear braids and combat boots. When people tell me I should be more manly I say ""I don't subscribe to your gender binary"". And when people ask me if I'm not annoyed when people think I'm a girl I just tell them that gender is a social construct anyway.

I'm not sure if I'll ever be brave enough to actually come out. Right now I'm working towards making it easier to come out. I know my friends from the math olympics are the queerest bunch and will support me through anything, and my friends from college are learning more every day.

So yeah, I'm trickling out the queer, and it's getting faster lately. Soon I'll reach Queer Singularity and blow the gender binary to smithereens.

Also braiding my hair feels so awesome, ten outta ten would do it again.
Yes, in a sense. Posted about this recently with some others in /r/genderqueer about doing this in the context of HRT:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/6qel9d/comment/dkxpn58
Yes!!! Trickling out is the best description, this makes so much sense. I relate to a lot of what you've said, I'm AMAB, but I've also got a history of being slightly more on the femme side then an average AMAB person. If I'm honest, I haven't entirely worked out where I fall in terms of labels, or how far i'll end up progressing with any form of formal transition (socially or otherwise) but i'm just following the rabbit hole and seeing where I end up if that makes sense? I know what you mean about the speeding up aspect as well...it's kind of like getting a taste for something (for me at least) and wanting more. I'm not 'officially' out to anyone, although i've spoken about it with my partner who's been really sweet about it. For me at least, being honest with myself and having a strict ""don't lie about this if anyone asks"" rule seems to have made me feel a lot better...its not quite coming out, but it's the equivalent of being ready to yell BOO if anyone happens to peak through the closet door! Good luck with everything! hope it keeps going well :) 
lol an update.

I just changed my (given) NAME on social media to a variant based on its first initial that sounds gender neutral, and changed my PRONOUNS to they/them, and made a post saying something along the lines of:

""This isn't a name I'm going by now. I'm just trying it out on social media for now (at least until the name-change cooldown timer resets) so that strangers in comment sections won't be able to make assumptions about me based on gender. It's kinda like an experiment.""

And it's not even that I don't literally mean everything I said, but I realized AFTERWARD when thinking to myself ""hey, actually, this is probably just part of the trickling out... you accidentally found an excuse to change your name and pronouns without it being you changing your name and pronouns.""

It's not a name I've decided on changing to. I might, I might not. I sort of like it. I literally decided on it for the purposes of avoiding being gendered online right when I decided to make the change itself. Which is a little weird, because I've been spending all sorts of hours agonizing over trying to think up new potential names to go by without much luck. 

That said, the variant I changed to doesn't work super well with my surname, so I would want to change my surname too if I end up going with this variant. 

(Seems to be one of my problems with names, I can think of plenty of good given names, I can think of maybe a few good surnames, but finding a combo that I like is difficult. Also making it harder is that I want it to have a similar-ish flow to and share many letters with my original name. It also needs to be at least as 'high quality' (in my opinion) a gender neutral name as my original name is a 'high quality' male name. I won't lie, it rolls off the tongue well and is memorable.. It's just the gender's wrong unfortunately. I realize I'm putting some pretty high standards on this, but I can be pretty good with words sometimes, and a name is almost kinda like a tattoo in a way.. like you wanna be sure on the design before doing it.. so it's important to me that it's as good as it can possibly be.)
I think this may be my eventual plan. There's only one person in my life that I've spoken to about my NB identity. I really didn't even come to accept my own identity until around 6 months ago. Thanks for putting your experience out there. It's always encouraging to hear from others 
Pal I've been turtling it for years, folks freak out at sudden changes so in addition to slowly conditioning em, it does help in letting colleagues/family/friends etc form what they think are their own decisions about ya. Eventually something will click- after my mum saw a documentary or something a while back and after I casually mentioned dysphoria (reacting/treating subjects about ones self and the general nonbinary aspect as mundane/erryday as possible is important too) she started asking and then said 'do you not feel like a man or a woman?'. From there, gentle explaining helped (coming out to one ready person at a time seemed to be the way forward for me). The best visual representation of this I can think of are those online puyo puyo tetris matches https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xAFDnT4rz0
Thanks for the inspiration everyone! I'm in the process of deciding wether or not to actually come out for real. If I decide to, I think the ""trickling out"" approach would suit me well. :-)
Thanks! And nice use of the closet metaphor too! =D
Thanks for replying!

> I'm not sure if I'll ever be brave enough to actually come out. Right now I'm working towards making it easier to come out.

That's a neat way of putting it.. It makes a lot of sense.

For me it's kinda like maybe I want to see if I can reduce the amount of all-at-once shock that might come from a sudden ""i'm nonbinary"" preceded by no visible signs...

Also, I get this impression from anti-NB strangers online that they think all enbies are just people looking for attention and it isn't real (also that it's tied to far left wing politics). So I guess maybe I figure if any of the people I know think that way, maybe if they are able to observe in someone they know, it being a sort of gradual coming-out process, they'll be able to see that it's not something I'm dying to announce to the world (and that I'm also not far left), and reconsider whether they think nonbinary is real (and have plenty of time to do it, and it not being an all-at-once sudden shocker).
You're welcome! =)
Really? People think nonbinary genders are a far left thing? That's new. I guess they'll blame the left for everything now.

But yes, people need to see that being enby is not a political statement. They should see we're real people, and coming out gradually is a good way of showing them that it's not just a fad.

Okay, now I'm worried that people will think I'm a leftist because I'm nonbinary. Or that I'm nonbinary because I'm a leftist. My gender has nothing to do with my dislike for capitalism. Hm. Oh, Karl, what should I do?
Don't worry. I'm leaning more towards laissez-faire capitalism than Marxism myself, so I don't think it has to have anything to do with gender. (And no need to get into that debate or anything here as far as I'm concerned, I'm cool with you liking Marx.) =)
I mean, I'm still not sure where I stand on the leftist spectrum, but whatever. I think there's no point in fighting people over something as widespread as capitalism, you know? I argue enough about my right to live as a trans person, no need to add all capitalists to the list of people that want me dead.

It's okay to disagree over some things, right? We still share the common goal of ending our oppression.
Yup. And for what it's worth, I live in a liberal area, grew up liberal, still consider myself a 'classical liberal'. I've just been exploring some libertarian to conservative concepts as well the past couple years, and I consider myself a bit of a moderate these days. I think politics can be really polarizing and separate people into different camps too much sometimes, so I really like it when people with opposing views can still get along and find common ground like this. <3

EDIT: Also, I'm no economics expert, so I don't really put too much weight in any economic opinions I might have anyway. That's probably part of why I phrased it as ""leaning more towards."""	6rn555	NonBinary	32	0.96	2017-08-04 20:09:34
sad boi hours	"Had some friends by this evening for dinner and board games, and when they arrived one of them (having recently learned that I was nonbinary) asked what name I'd like to go by. I was super excited, no one had ever asked me that before! So, feeling giddy, I told everyone that I've been experimenting with Ben, or BJ, and he/they pronouns.

Anyway, we hung out for a few hours and the entire night not a single person, not even my husband, used either my preferred name or pronouns. The whole night.... Every time someone referenced me they used my deadname. They called me she/her every time.

I'm just gutted. I was so excited thinking that I might get to try my name and hear my pronoun and have a good time, but now I'm just.... I guess sad.....

Anyway, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Can you guys send me something happy? I could use some cheering up.






Tl;dr: got deadnamed and misgendered all night by people who I thought would be better. Now it's sad boi hours."	"Ben, I'm so sorry this happened to you. Being misgendered is bad enough, but being misgendered by people who you think care. Its gonna get better, I promise. Sending virtual hugs!
Ugggghh I'm sorry BJ. That sounds super rough. I'm going through a similar thing. Heart goes out to you
hey ben! i’m super proud of you for taking the time to type this up and really explore and put a name to your emotions. you deserve to feel good. your name and pronouns are not a burden or a chore to use. take a deep breath and drink a nice cup of water. there’s so much trans love in the world and i just know you’ll find a peer group who showers u with all that trans love 🖤
I'm really sorry to hear that Ben :c

If it would help I'm sending you warm enby hugs <3
Hey BJ! Really sucks to hear about all that, being dead named and misgendered is honestly so degrading especially by people you think would be most willing to care.  I've run into it a bit and unfortunately it's something you might have to remind people for a while but those who care and respect you will learn and catch on, hopefully sooner rather than later.  
I would also like to mention just how difficult it can be to come out as nb or any non gender-conforming identity and I am so so proud and happy that you were able to share your pronouns and preferred name to begin with.  It can be the hardest step to be your authentic self with the world for what feels like the first time.  Remember to never feel shame for who you are, ik it can be easy to feel this way.  Reddit can be a little weird but you will always have places like this sub where you will have support and I hope that really soon your friends and husband will recognize you for who you are!
💛🤍💜🖤

Sometimes you gotta assert yourself and correct people a bit before they start to catch on. If these friends are not queerphobic and you know, like, and trust them then I'd speak to them privately and let them know that this stuff is important to you (often times cis people just don't get it and they do just need it spelled out for them)"	pgarck	NonBinary	34	0.95	2021-09-02 04:34:21
Parents have been deadnaming me all week while visiting town. Need to vent..	"Feel kinda bad about swooping in and ruining the positive vibes of this sub, but I just gotta get all the bad feelings out of me and somewhere else...


I came out as NB to my family 4 years ago, which is also when I asked them to call me by my chosen name. My siblings have always been pretty chill about the whole thing, parents were... a lot less chill. It was a huge effort to get them to start using the name I chose for myself, but even after 4 years they still don't seem to be used to it.

They live pretty far away so Christmas is the only time I see them in person. They came to town last week and since then they've been constantly deadnaming me. Sometimes they corrected themselves, but they didn't apologise after I told them that it hurts when they do that. They said it's still strange to them, that it's difficult.

I thought that after 4 years they would have gotten into the habit of calling me by my chosen name. My four siblings and my husband haven't deadnamed me since I first came out, so it makes me think that my parents might deadname me behind my back and only remember to address me differently when they see me in person. Which is a horrible thought.

They're leaving town tomorrow. I said my goodbyes to them this afternoon. I was expecting to feel sad about them leaving. Saying goodbye to my parents was always really difficult for me, but today it wasn't. It just felt like a relief. I probably won't see them in person for two years and I'm grateful for that. I'm not sad at all about them leaving again, I'm just sad that they might not ever really respect me."	"Damn this is disheartening. My sympathies. Asked my parents to call me my chosen name just a few months ago. It's painfully obvious that they only even attempt to do so when I'm in the room.
You could confront them gently. Ask them to practice using your name and ask them stop using your dead name even when you're not around.

Practicing helps a lot, especially when you've know a person a long time. If you ask them to practice make it personal and tell them it'll show that they care about you and respect and love you. 

Hope they come around and things get easier.
sorry comrade, this is so sad and i empathize with you, that is a long time to not get a name right. here for you.
Sending you hugs (if wanted). Your feelings are totally valid and you are a strong badass for getting through that awful experience. Treat yourself with compassion and patience in the upcoming days 💙 holidays are rough so thank you for creating a post about this. I was misgendered all week at different holiday events, and called ""ladies"" by my MIL in a group text--big yikes and lots of pain.

Just a thought but my therapist recently suggested that I print out articles explaining nonbinary, GNC, and pronouns so I can give info to MIL since she simply seems to refuse to use they/them. Perhaps this is something your parents would benefit from in the distant future?
**hugs** I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this, it must be awful for you."	egsg2x	NonBinary	34	0.91	2019-12-28 16:08:49

A sad rant :)	"I'm nonbinary genderfluid. I happy to be this way, I'm happy that I've found out who I am. 

My family thinks otherwise.

My mom, a TERF, is unable to process that I'm not a ""woman,"" At least now.

My friends make an effort to respect my pronouns. They actually try. My mom never will.

She'll say she loves me, I know she does, but why can't she love the other part of me too? The part that isn't a woman?

My location doesn't help either. Unfortunately, I live in Mississippi. You think you could come out and be  safe here, but time and time again I've realized people I trusted aren't as accepting as they seem.

My mom hates trans women. She grew up in the 80s, and had to go through lots of misogyny. I believe she thinks that trans women are just men who are trying to take her femininity and power from her. I hate that.

I wish I lived up North, where everyone could just love every part of me, even the nonbinary parts.

Where my pronouns weren't an issue, or their fucking problem."	"I'm nonbinary bigender. I'm currently going though imposter syndrome because my partner is having a hard time with my pronouns and calls me she(most of the time) and I don't feel like having to constantly remind people. I'm leaning towards my female side so it's making things worse. I couldn't even tell my mom anything because she thought I was a lesbian and shows major disgust for it. I'm not a lesbian,I'm bi but anyway  understand your struggles.
\*Tips glass
I'm sorry you're stuck in that situation. feel free to ignore everything after this. It's my personal thoughts and may not be helpful or be things you've already tried. <3

If your mom is willing to have civil discussions, I would maybe try to ask her things like ""what would you say makes someone a man or a woman?"" And then maybe you would have a chance to gently challenge some of her points. Or if she ever had a childhood nickname that she hated, that might be a point of entry to talk about how being misgendered/deadnamed makes you feel. She may never truly get it, but maybe if you can reframe it in a way she can latch onto she might start to figure it out.
I'm so sorry. I hope that someday people like us can live in a world where we won't get shamed for who we are. I wish you luck with your syndrome, I'm not very educated on imposter syndrome, but if it's something you can recover from, I hope you get through it soon. Thank you for understanding how I feel, your kindness means a lot. <3
<3
Thank you so much for your support, it means so much more than you know <3

I've asked her things similar to what you've suggested before. Unfortunately she sticks with the idea of ""gender is what's in your pants."" She's a very headstrong woman, and it's very difficult to get her to change her mind, or even argue as she tends to dominate the argument. I've told her numerous times using analogies on how I feel when she calls me ""she,"" but she just ignores my point. She constantly misgenders me, which sucks, but I've tried asking her before if she could just.. not. Of course, her response was always, ""You can't make me call you anything else, and if you try to force me to you're not respecting my beliefs."" I hate it, but I can't seem to change her perspective.
I'll do my best to explain as I'm not very good at it. Imposter syndrome is feeling like you're fake,lying to your self. Like is what I'm feeling real? You go through life one way and once you find your real self you will sometimes doubt it and think you're lying or faking it
Ah, I understand now. That sounds horrible to live with, is there any way to treat it?
Maybe talking to someone may help. Idk. It's something people like us go through sometimes. I found that out through other posts

Edit: I meant too say,I'm thinking talking to someone or a therapist could help. I can't afford one right now so I'm seeking solice through sub reddits like these
I'm no therapist, but I can share what helps me with imposter syndrome and maybe it can be a little help to you <3

I'm AMAB and have only been out (to a few friends) for a few months. I am still much more masc leaning and have gotten into the rut of imposter syndrome. ""If I'm still mostly masc, then maybe I'm just making this up"" and so on.

But what helps me is remembering that non binary isn't ""Option 3"" after male and female. It's options 3 to infinity, it's everything that _isn't_ male and female. So if you feel 99% your AGAB and 1% something else, you are totally valid to consider yourself non binary! That's just as valid as 50/50 male/female, 100% intergalactic space horror, or anything else. 🙂
I'm more masc leaning and will go out of my way to avoid  most things that make me super feminine. I just started wearing dresses and skirts like a couple years ago though(gothic) but on the other end I don't have to change name though I do have  a male name for myself. I still choose my birth name and I don't mind my body or the she/her at times so it makes me feel like I'm making it up or trying to fit in. That's a good way of looking at it and it'll be hard but I'll try to remind myself that nonbinary isn't just androgynous and it's ok to lean to your birth gender at times"	10lxcfb	NonBinary	33	0.95	2023-01-26 17:30:23
I feel like a joke.	"This is my first time posting here! I just found this subreddit and I'm happy I did, I feel like I need to get something off my chest or need some advice. I apologized deeply if this doesnt fit.

I'm a black autistic enby, and I feel like my identity is a joke. It makes me sad to see that there is very little representation of [black autistic enbies] or any non binary people. I feel I shouldnt be non binary any more, because of what society thinks of me. I feel like an utter joke and I dont know what do to. It's not fair I feel like this. I've been iding as nonbinary since 8th grade, I believe I have dysphoria and this before I found tumblr and it feels like everyone will just see me and say ""look at that dumb snowflake"". I recently cut my hair to try to make myself genderneutral and my mother got into an argument with me and assumed I did it because ""im grown"" when I did it for my gender identity. No one asks me first. Its degrading. I also have a friend who sexualizes me. He says he tries to look up ""cute black genderqueer"" porn. I dont understand that and I really dont want to. (I didnt even know there was a market) it just made me really angry and invalid. Its also not fair I have autism, because society think I'm just stupid, when I just dont understand people.

Trust me, I believe with all my heart I'm Non-Binary and Non-Binary people are real and valid. I just think the label is not for me or I feel like I'm not actually nonbinary. I dont know what to do keep myself happy with who I am. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?"	"Doubting yourself seems to be a big theme in being nonbinary. Probably because most of our current culture just erases it from the mainstream. I think the reason there's been so little representation, is because it's easier in some ways to stay in the closet or adopt a more acceptable (even if only marginally) label. 

I'm middle aged and everyone online assumes I'm a teenager on Tumblr, when I say I'm NB. They don't have any other reference points for it, but younger people just feel more acceptance to come out in online spaces, which is good. I stayed in the closet for decades, because I couldn't even figure out what my identity was, so I was just massively depressed, anxious and emotionally numb to everything. For every person that comes out, there's more variety of experience for other people to identify with. Race, age, sexuality, physical and neuro variety, religion, culture, whatever. Gender doesn't discriminate, but people do and a lot of that variety is hidden or erased.

You're totally valid and not an anomaly.
[deleted]
I see you in your wholeness. I celebrate you in your wholeness. Do what you need to do to be safe, but know that your wholeness is worth being held.
Hi! nb POC here! I absolutely feel you on the erasure and invalidation, but am here to reiterate that we exist. It helps me to remind myself that we predate colonial enforcement of the gender binary, and that we are whole and resilient despite the fracturing power of binary logic. PM me if you want a friend!
Hey friend,

You are valid and valuable, no matter what the skewed representation in media looks like. You are at an intersection of people who don't get proportional representation anyway (black; autistic; nonbinary,) so you get a huge force multiplier of media invisibility. It sucks and I'm sorry. It's getting better very slowly. 

I'm more concerned that you have a 'friend' trying to make your gender a sexual topic between you. That's.... not something a friend should do, particularly if you've already said you are uncomfortable with it. It sounds more like someone who is trying to use 'friendship' as a way to get into your pants, which is super toxic.  

If you haven't already, let your friend know you aren't into them (assuming that's true.) It's possible the porn thing was a clumsy way to see if you might want to be more than friends. If they are actually just a friend, it won't make a difference. If they are fetishizing you, they were never a friend and will likely get upset to try and guilt you into doing what they want. If they are crushing on you there's a lot of different ways it could go, but the friendship is probably not going to survive. There's a lot about your relationship with this person I don't know, so it's highly likely I'm missing important pieces of the puzzle. Do you have someone IRL (e.g. a counselor) you can check this with? 

Maybe check in with other friends if you can, make sure you have other social support. 
The twitter hashtag #nonbinaryisntwhite is trying to broaden the often white dominated imagery of our non-binary community. Our bodies and personalities in all their diversity, no single uniform look, fat and thin and young and old. I’ve noticed there are many black AFAB people on the twitter with feminine gender expressions that have she/they or they pronouns in their twitter bios, some identify as non-binary women or non-binary femmes as they’ve found non-binary to fit their sense of self.  

A great article on the campaign: [#NonBinaryIsntWhite Is a Social Media Reminder of the Gender Diversity Among People of Color](https://www.intomore.com/you/nonbinaryisntwhite-is-a-social-media-reminder-of-the-gender-diversity-among-people-of-color)

Learning about and conversing with non-white non-binary people’s experiences does help me as a white enby feel more valid in my non-binary identity, as not just a white people fad which it’s often portrayed as by society.
I didnt know there were middle aged enbies! I think because ""the people of tumblr""(tm) demographic gets to me. But I'm glad there are older enbies. I think my problem too is that there are barely POC enbies and I dont know any poc enbies. All my enby/trans friends are white. And I feel like the stupid outcast (or token black enby depending on who I hang out with)
Aww thanks! I'll give one a read!
I also thank you for the recommendations! I'm going to start with An Unkindness of Ghosts.
An Unkindness of  Ghosts looks amazing, thanks for these recommendations.
Thank you! 
Thank you! And I sent you a message!
Funny story about the guy, I met him during high school graduation. I dont *know* him and I never really saw him while at school only on the bus. It was just a weird... thing? We had a summer fling and stopped talking to him. I just recently started talking to him again. We were talking the subject was racism in porn. I said something and his reply was ""oh yea cute chubby black genderqueer porn is very niche. I try to subconsciously search for porn that looks like people I know."" I kinda took this offensively. For one I'm not chubby. And two why on earth would you admit this to me and why on earth would you look for that kind is things. I know he probably didnt mean it in a bad way but I was just very distraught from what I read. He hung out a few days ago. We walk into a book store and he said ""do you want to hear a joke?"" I said sure and he replies ""a black genderqueer and a white psychopath walk into a bookstore..."" I sat that there very confused and he never ""finished"" the joke. Hes a nice guy but the stuff that comes out of his mouth scares me... he has a girlfriend, but I think he has a slight attraction to me in all the wrong ways. (He stated he and his gf are in an open relationship and dont mind if they are seeing other people as long as they love each other)
I'm not on Twitter but I'll check out the hashtag! Thank you.
Yeah, I'm 39, married to a cis woman and have two kids. There are NB POC out there, but like I said, some people also have used other labels (genderqueer has been around longer, some always just identified as trans or queer) and didn't necessarily use ""nonbinary"" previously, but it's a more recognized term now. It also just depends what circles you run in.

I mean, when I talked to my mother (who's in her 60's) about it, I had to explain every concept multiple times. Her first response was just ""so are you gay now?"". Which she used to assume I was as a kid. I am pansexual, but I think she just didn't have the concepts to understand the mismatch between my body and identity.
Also middle aged over here! We're secretly everywhere. ;)

But maybe because I'm old, I always say (gender)queer or non-binary. I'm not hip with the abbreviations. 
I’m a middle aged enby! I transitioned over a decade ago and had a kid while openly non-binary in the last few years. 

I’ve met some great POC enby friends on a trans parenting Facebook group. Hopefully you’ll find some cool people who get you.
There are plenty of older non-binary people! Though some people may not have come out or been more vocal when they were younger because there was less awareness at the time. One of my heroes is the author Leslie Feinberg, who was born in 1949. I'm not sure if xie ever identified as non-binary explicitly, but xie used different pronouns over their course of hir life and identified as both trans and a butch lesbian. There's also author Kate Bornstein, who was born in 1948. She medically transitioned from male to female but identifies as neither.

We've always existed. :)
Their are enbies of all ages! Why wouldn't there be? They didn't just suddenly exist only a few years ago, although it sometimes feels that way. You are lucky you have at least some enby friends. I had none growing up. In the isolated tiny country town I grew up in the 80s I had no gay, queer, enby or anyone friends! Everyone was straight and white. Imagine for a minute how boring, horrible and repressive that would be! I had to use all my secret enby powers to survive that one!
Uh... Run. He's not being very subtle and he's not joking. He may be using a jokey tone, but he's testing your defenses. This man is looking to get his whims met and isn't thinking about anyone else's needs. He's going to hurt you and his girlfriend if this keeps up. If you have any friends in common, tell them what's happening just in case. Talk to his girlfriend, she may not be aware he's saying they are 'open' in that way. 

Part of the reason I'm concerned about this guy is that I always feel like a joke when I'm reduced to someone's fetish. It got way worse after the person involved raped me and everyone around us pretended it was a valid relationship. That's my baggage, and it may not be what's happening in your life, but I'm getting some vibes it's worth paying attention to.
I have a question for you guys, even though you are older, how do you guys feel about neoprounons? I like Xe/Xym and it's on my ""preferred pronoun"" list. If no one understands xe/xym I also use they/them.
This is great info! I knew there always been non binary people in the past! I'm tired of hearing ""being trans/non binary is only a newer thing!""
Because ""tumblr demographic"" and ""edge lords"" and barely anything good history reprentation. Its hard to find any history of non binary in the past and I wish there was a decent article that could put enby people in a good light instead of ""this 65 gender millennial bs"".
I'll keep my eye out. I also dont know him personally which is another problem. I have no idea who his girlfriend is. He hasnt told me which raises a few questions. 

I've also stated to him that I strongly id as Non-Binary. He keeps bringing up that I'm genderqueer. Which makes me feel that he either doesnt understand or wont accept that label or something else. I told my friends about his comment. They are disgusted by his comment. I feel he may not be educated on the topic. I also dont know if he has been with other black people. He hasnt stated what race is girlfriend is or the other people he has been with. He hasnt said anything racist. But I feel I may be the token out of his group of friends (and maybe lovers). He has mostly said things about my gender (""glad to know I can knock the pants off of males, females and now genderqueer people"") I usually feel auras but I feel nothing but awkwardness and weird vibes coming from him sometimes. 
I have a love/hate relationship with pronouns in general, but specifically, I hope your generation are the ones to finally figure out a way to get everyone on board with the gender neutral pronouns so that we can all benefit. 

And until then, I shrug them off for myself (I use 'she' because it's what people usually assume anyway) and do my best to remember other people's choices. And names. I'm terrible with names. :)
I prefer they/them. I don't have a problem with what anyone else uses, so long as they tell me.

I personally don't like the term ""enby"" for myself. I use abbreviations online for convenience, but in life I say ""nonbinary person"" or just trans/transgender/nonbinary trans, etc. I still view it as an umbrella term, more than a specific identity.
I think neopronouns are cool. I use they/them personally. How is Xe/Xym pronounced? 

I also use Mx. instead of Mr. or Ms. where I can, but I’m not really sure how to pronounce it, haha. 
> (""glad to know I can knock the pants off of males, females and now genderqueer people"")  

Wut? Ew. That makes it seem like you are a sex toy to him, not a person. Has he said anything that would make you think he cares what you think of him? Or that he wants to know what your needs are? (e.g. learning the difference between genderqueer and enbyfolks?) 

If his primary relationship really was open, he'd have introduced you to the girlfriend so you guys could chat and set up boundaries. You don't even know her name, and he's dodging telling you anything about her. He's looking to cheat. 

In your position, I'd make my boundaries real clear, get him some links to Trans 101 sites and tell him to get back to me when he has questions. I'd also be listening to my friends, because sometimes they can read a skeezy vibe I miss. Predators don't hide that stuff as well from people they aren't actively targeting. 
I remember one point I wanted to be Louis because I thought Lexis (my birth name) wasnt neutral enough. I came to a conclusion that Lexis is gender neutral after much research. Elexis, Alekous, Alex are masculine and Alexis, Lexus, and Alex are feminine so I just connected them and say ""Lexis is unisex"".
I see ""enby"" as a quicker or shorter way to say non binary and I sometimes used to replace boy/girl. (Cowenby... Karamatsu Enby... Birthday Enby...) I do use the proper term in conversation. 
I always heard it as ""zee"" and ""zim"". I'm not sure on the *true* correct pronunciation. 

Mx. is supposed to be pronounced like ""misc"". I wish I could use Mx.! I was at a job, and I was highly uncomfortable with ""Miss Lexis"" as my title. However I was working with children and I was afraid of many things and kept the title Miss.
I have no idea if he said anything that would think he cares. If not I dont think he has. I really need to talk him. I dont know why I didnt see any red flags! But I'll bring up all of this and try to tell my friends e eveything. Thanks.
I feel like my birth name is literally the only break I've had in coming out. It's already gender neutral and I've known several people of different genders who've had the same name or variations on spelling. Everything else about me outside personality is a steep uphill climb towards gender neutral.
Yeah, I get that. For me personally, I don't view being nonbinary as a specific gender identity for me, just an accurate description that I'm not male or female. It's one of the things that made it so hard to understand my own gender identity. I could see and understand the nuances of it in others, but felt zero connection to gender or the associated concepts. Same with my sexuality. I never felt offended by being called or assumed I was gay or straight. Neither ever seemed accurate, but I still have attractions and sexuality. I have things I like about gender presentations, but never felt any ego or deep connection to them. So if someone said I was an ""Enby"" as a gender, I feel no connection to it. If someone says nonbinary or agender, it just feels like an accurate description of not being any specific gender. 

Like I said though, no opposition to it in general or anyone else using it. I also don't like nicknames, so it's probably just something about my personality. 
Ive seen Mx. online as mux and mix too. If I have to say it I usually just say whichever comes to my mouth first really fast and then say, “it’s spelled M X, yep, spelled M X but if you don’t have that option in your system yet I’ll take...”

I like Mx. for forms and letters, but I don’t think I’d feel comfortable using it with a group of kids just yet, mostly because I don’t really like how any of the pronounciations sound. 
How bad do you want this guy in your life? Sometimes it's easy to ignore warnings when I'm caught up in getting to know someone, particularly if there's a romantic/sexy spark. If you are into him, either as a friend or a potential lover, let him know how you need to be respected. You aren't close enough to miss him if he won't meet your terms. 

If you aren't into him, there's no reason to put yourself through an awkward conversation. Set boundaries as and when things come up, drop him if you get tired of explaining. He's only dangerous if he starts to ramp up as you pull away, at which point it's a good idea if other people already know what's going on so you have people to watch your back. Telling your friends about him now is a safety net which you probably won't need, but is good to have.
I never viewed it as a gender, just something to say quicker and to replace ""boy/girl"" sometimes.

But I do understand what you're saying! 
I'm not really into him, as I dont know him and I just met him 2 years ago and we started talking again. I see him more as a fwb, because we had a summer fling 2 years ago.

I'm not into him romantically. But I can accept him sexually and platonically. He never had any (bad) sexual urges towards me or did anything I didnt want to do.
I'm just weird, I read way too far into word choices lol
Ok, I over reacted. Sorry about that. He still doesn't seem like a great person to be spending time on, but it sounds like you have it handled.
It's ok! Lol! We all have our preferences!
That's ok! I'm trying hard to handle this and you gave me great advice. So thanks!"	94lbk5	NonBinary	34	0.97	2018-08-04 18:33:27

Small successes	"I'll keep this brief. I work in a cishet male-dominated workplace, a small company, in the rust belt USA. I've heard all of sorts things ranging from your typical no-homo jokes to derogatory remarks about transgender people and the LGBTQIA+ community in general. This is pervasive around the main customer service department with most of the C-Suite/Team Leads either being not a part of the conversations or these conversations happening out of earshot or when they're in a meeting or out of the office.

Yesterday I had a sit down with the customer service director and brought up my discomfort. While I didn't feel like it was my time to come out, I did mention how sad it made me feel to hear disparagement and came at it from it being an unprofessional attitude. I asked if we could introduce diversity training and other forms of inclusivity around the office. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the CSD agreed and was upset to hear that these sorts of things had been going on. The CSD mentioned that diversity training is a great start and it's going to be pitched to the executive team ASAP. I was also told my honesty and concern was appreciated because they don't want that kind of toxicity to be harmful to the culture.

We'll see if anything comes of it, but it's small successes of being open and honest and not being scoffed at or sighed at helped me feel validated.

TL;DR Bigoted talk from cishets, oh my; opened up honestly and ended in a positive light"	"That's awesome!! It's a good strategy as well if one doesn't want to come out in the office for whatever reason, to cite ""unprofessional attitude"" as the reason for coming forward to address this subject.

I hope the training helps to improve the culture of your workplace.
thats so great!!!!
It's one thing that it hurts me personally, but with the kind of things I've heard folks say it is absolutely an unprofessional attitude. It's been a bit of a struggle being myself in a workplace where people are actively degrading others.
Thank you!! I want to stay hopeful it makes some sort of a difference. c:
im sure it will!!!! Its so great you spoke up!!!!"	ckrbyx	NonBinary	34	0.97	2019-08-01 17:19:17

My toddler started calling me ‘she’	"Looking for love, not advice. My 2.5 year old is a theybie and I go by they, but nevertheless, we got a ‘she’ in reference to me. I said ‘hey, we gotta talk - do you think I’m a boy or a girl?’ 

‘You’re a girl’

‘Nope, I’m not a boy or a girl’

It makes me sad that even having a GNC parent and being a theybie doesn’t stop the gender police from getting in kids little minds. Makes me sad to be misgendered by the little love of my life, even though it’s not their fault.

2 years on low dose T	"So I wanted to give people that may be considering going on a low dose of T an idea of where I'm at 2 years in. 

My dose: 15mg once a week subq. Current level: 6nmol/l
Taking finasteride: 2m

Head hair: has gotten noticeably thinner, it does however run in the family so not a shock. I have started finasteride for that and while there's no new growth I have less shedding. 

Facial hair: I get a bit of sad hair on my upper lip and chin, nothing more major though. I shave 2x per week. 

Voice: a lot deeper. I cannot reach a high range anymore. I can however still control my voice to pass as either gender. 

Muscle mass: big increase. I can lift about 3x what I could before with no extra training. My shoulders and arms have broadened. 

Chest: decrease in fullness but not much. 

Body hair: overall the same amount as pre T but does come in darker. 

Weight: hasn't moved. Same weight as pre T, but I'm sure more in muscle and not fat. 

Sweat: a lot more, smells worse too. 

Hunger: increased 

Fat pattern: my hips are a bit thinner and I have more of a gut, but not a big change from pre. 

Bottom growth: There? It's not a big shift, but there. 

Atrophy: was getting bad for a bit but smoothed out after around 6months. 

Cycle: stopped immediately after first shot. Had cramps still for the first year. 

Smell: it can get bad, got to wash more than before. 

Mood: vast improvement. I've had like one breakdown in the last two years. I'm far more chill about everything. Just let things roll off. 

I don't really pass all the time. But I'm not trying to. I plan for that to change after top surgery (in June), but I'm just more comfortable being me. 

Any questions feel free to ask."	"Thank you thank you thank you!!

Trans Identity????	I identify as nonbinary. This is a very recent revelation, within the last year. I am AMAB and I've repressed the feminine side of myself for so long. For the past week or so, I've been looking into HRT. I want boobs and curves and long hair. I see trans women and they are so beautiful but it goes beyond just aesthetic appreciation; I want to be them. I'm so confused and sad. Sorry for rambling, I just needed to put this out somewhere.	"Questioning is valid. Being unsure if you're NB, demi, binary femme, etc. is totally okay and your feelings may even change over time as your learn more about yourself and get more comfortable with your own identity. Do what feels most aligned with who you are right now. Focus on what you can control. If being femby is what feels right to you, then roll with it. If this changes down the road, you'll roll with that too. You are your own best advocate. Love yourself like you would any other trans and NB person. There's no wrong way to be you.
If it helps, I am TOTALLY in the same boat. I'm AMAB and didn't believe I could possibly be enby until this year, repressing it for the last 20 years. I don't want a full transition, but I do want boobs, curves, long hair, and a little less body hair if possible. I question myself every day. In my head, I still fall back on cis because it's so ingrained in me. But I'm nonbinary because it doesn't matter how I express it, anything is valid. I can be masculine, feminine, both, or neither. No matter how you present, allow the enby-ness to take some of that pressure off
totally OK, I'm amab trans, enby, on hrt, and I've had an orchi, breast augmentation and ffs. it's all good!
Being non-binary is being trans. I spent about five years living as a binary trans person before I realized I was starting to feel just as stuck in a tiny little box that didn’t fit me as I had in my AGAB and I realized I was actually non-binary trans. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to figure ourselves out and sometimes we don’t get it right the first time, or the second time, because we needed that time to grow and learn more about gender and more about ourselves.
Well this sounds familiar 😂 I feel this
Hey I’m in a similar boat as you! I’ve just recently started watching voice training videos, trying makeup and more feminine clothing, and deciding to grow my hair out. Let’s just keep following whatever feels right and see how it goes?
I don't know where you're at, but in some places HRT requires very bad waiting lists. If you're in such a place, you should get yourself on the list at the soonest possible occasion because you can change your mind later but you may be hurting really hard as time goes on without access to treatment :)
Last year I was literally where you are now. I considered myself nonbinary.

Last November I got on hormones. This month I've decided to abandon my nonbinary status and go full transwoman, and I love it. One of the best decisions I've ever made. I look and feel so much better. I have boobs and an ass and I am in love with myself for the first time in my life.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with questioning yourself! Do whatever makes you feel comfortable, and if your label or identity changes that's completely ok! Changing how you identify doesn't mean you were lying or wrong (only saying this because I've had that kind of guilt and I know others might with identity changes) it means you're changing to what's best for you! Your comfort with your identity is of utmost priority, and you're valid!!
I'm crying. Thank you so much for this response.
Anything you do that makes you feel better about yourself and your gender is a part of transition. When you feel like you’re done transitioning that’s a full transition no matter what steps you took or didn’t take. 

We shouldn’t talk about transition as if it’s a list of some kind that can be finished by ticking off all the boxes because that’s fucked up. I feel like that kind of language lends support to things like laws that require trans people to be sterilized to change the sex marker on our IDs, and that’s all manner of fucked up yo. 

Everyone’s transitions are different because we all need different things, and “fully transitioned” is different for different people.
Deal!!!
I believe in you, sib. It's all going to be alright. 💜
Thank you so much. I never thought about it that way and it really puts me at ease ❤️
Hugs!
Hugs! DM me if you want another enby friend ☺️"	ga9fan	NonBinary	29	0.91	2020-04-29 13:26:57
Coming out responses	"I’m in my 40s and have been coming out this week.  Slowly, over text, just to friends.  It’s been mostly positive I think, but while almost everyone is saying supportive things, it’s mostly filled with “I support you, but I’m not even going to pretend that I understand what these terms mean”.  “You have my love and support, but I’m old and need time to process all these new words in the world”

And then I barely hear from anybody again at all.

I’m not feeling lonely or sad.  Proud and strong would be better words, but I just want to thank younger queers for continually pushing the gender envelope.  I don’t know why older folks who grew up with David Bowie and Prince and Freddie Mercury have no clue what I’m talking about - but a lot of it is because we didn’t have the worlds or language to discuss it, and there was a lot of hate.  External and internal.

I love you all.  As I begin to come out more and more I’d be interested in hearing the positive and negative responses you’ve gotten - particularly professionally and from older people.

Finally.  Love your bodies - whichever ones you have or will have.  Explore them, cherish them, touch them.  You are all so beautiful.  I know we may all present and feel very differently from each other, but that’s the joy of being queer.  Seeing and feeling beauty where others don’t or can’t.

As someone in their early 50s who is still trying to figure things out, I can totally relate to this message. I have been so impressed by the way that young people are pushing the gender envelope. And, to be honest, I'm also a bit envious. But mostly impressed and grateful for these powerful examples of courage. 
Thank you.  I suppose it’s hard to get upset at people who think ignorance is a badge of honour, but just as hard not to!


On one hand the knowledge of a gender spectrum predates all of us - and therefore we can look to history for some lessons on the aspects of our humanity our ancestors discovered. 

On the other, this knowledge has been forgotten or discarded by modern society, so we have to look to the future and young people to help discover and unveil this side of humanity.

Being in the middle, it seems the former is useful for information, but the latter is useful for hope.   I suppose both are necessary for change.
[deleted]
Absolutely.  

In hundreds of cultures, for thousands of years; there have been more than 2 genders - but in colonized countries, like mine, everyone is taught 2 as a law from the moment they can hear - and never hear of anything different.  It’s hard to hate on them too much when they aren’t taught anything different ever."	a0c8f9	NonBinary	32	0.96	2018-11-25 20:49:39
I’m in the hospital and missing all the pride events. I want to cry.	"This would have been my first pride week since I started to come out as non binary. 

I was supposed to be in a drag show tonight and I worked really hard on my number. Was supposed to see Naomi Smalls tomorrow and it’s unlikely I’ll be out by then. 

Just feeling really sad and wanted to vent. Stupid homophobic kidneys. I’m so done with being in the hospital."	"I'm so sorry you're unable to do all those things! They do sound amazing. But I hope whatever is going on with your kidneys is healing. 

Also weird question...where do you live that Pride events are happening so late? I'm in Washington state and all that happened already in June.
At least you're getting help for your kidney thing, you're fortunate.
I'm sure things will happen to make up for this.
Come to Australia for Pride Month and second summer in November lol

But for real hope you feel better quickly and maybe you can at least have a little post-pride pride party with some friends and themed baked goods or something
Thanks, hoping so too! 

Vancouver, ours is always later for some reason.
Well next year I'll have to drive up so I can do Pride twice! Haha!"	ckm0hd	NonBinary	35	0.94	2019-08-01 09:22:10
Interesting conversation with my partner	"I told my partner about a post I saw on facebook celebrating two non binary actors having leading roles in big t.v. shows at the moment. He brought up that he finds it odd thay gender/sexuality/anything matters, and said that it shouldn't (even positively)
He said the most important thing should be how skilled the actor is. 

Whilst I agreed with him that skill should be the *most* important thing, I pushed back a little and explained how important it is for people like me to see fellow non binary people having success, whilst also being out. 

What he said next has me thinking though... He said that it's sad that well known people need to provide represantion in order to help some people feel comfortable and valid. He said that people should be able to feel comfortable and valid without that.

He understands and agrees that representation in *stories* is important. He was specifically talking about well known people. I thought about Kit Connor having to out himself, and I felt myself agreeing a little that, although it's nice to see myself in others, celebrities shouldn't have to have to feel the pressure to be representation.  

What are others thoughts?"	"Easy for someone to say when they've seen people like them all their life.  Think about how many children Nichelle Nichols inspired.  Kids need to see people like themselves are valid
It sounds like he values normalization, which I don't think is inherently bad. It comes down to whether you're on the same page as him and want to be normalized. And whether he's also reaching out to make sure you're valued and included in the way you want to be.

>it's sad that well known people need to provide represantion in order to help some people feel comfortable and valid. He said that people should be able to feel comfortable and valid without that.

I do think it's sad that we live in a world where nonbinary people are so isolated from each other we have to look to celebrities for representation, and have to point to famous people as evidence of our validity. But yea it's tone deaf to hear this from someone who likely takes their own representation or granted. Those who have these benefits seem to underestimate the value of it. They think they don't need stuff because they are personally strong and independent, and don't realize that their needs are actively being taken care of by others. No one is an island.
Yeah I don't think anyone should feel pressured or forced to come out for the sake of others, but I also think that it should be a more acceptable thing to do if they desire to make it public knowledge. Representation is still important, but it shouldn't have to come at the cost of someone's privacy or safety
Sure it's sad, and it sucks that things are this way, BUT THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE AND THEY CANT CHANGE OVERNIGHT, but they are slowly changing and seeing more representation is a good sign of that change...
Lived experience can bring more depth and nuance to a character that can be difficult to achieve through research alone. Music the movie by Sia is a great example of a terrible depiction of a character because of a lack of understanding of Autism. I am Autistic and I knew from the trailer it was going to be terrible. So lack of representation in front of and behind the screen can be harmful. As for gender diverse people in stories, I agree that people shouldn’t have to out themselves to get a role, but I also think it isn’t great if big role casting only goes to cis gendered and/or heterosexual people because the producers want big names to draw people in and there isn’t anyone to draw on, so they restrict themselves to people who are recognised, rather than people who could bring more expression to the character.
Of course nobody should be pressured to come out, and ultimately in a perfect world where there is no oppression whatsoever then sure, that kind of representation would matter less, it'd just be a random uninteresting piece of info about an actor, however in today's world where being an out enby makes you face oppression, where being an enby can be an incredibly lonely experience, it's actually not sad but a sign of progress and hope that this is happening
I think that, while it is important to feel comfortable and valid within yourself, if you live your life not knowing a single other person like yourself it can really suck. there’s someone who came as nonbinary recently, who I assume might be who you’re talking about, and it really makes me excited! to see people like me thriving is exactly what I need. to have any kind of gender diversion more in the public eye makes it known, and if it’s known I can be *seen* rather than described
If he’s not able to see why representation matters, ask him what he’d think if there were never any disabled actors on screen, or people of different ethnicities, or only one gender was ever allowed onscreen, or (hell) if one specific accent was all that was allowed. 

Obviously these are not all the same thing - but they are all aspects of humanity that are at a high risk of under-representation (or negative representation). 

I guess him if that’s what’s ideal. What people does he think SHOULD be allowed to get roles. And ask how children of different backgrounds are supposed to dream of success in acting (or any profession) if the only people they never saw anyone like them on screen. 

My hope in asking these questions is that you can help him think / grow, so he can be a better partner to you. Bare minimum, he should want to hear and appreciate how you feel seeing this representation. 

The other side of this is, if he sees why these other marginalized people deserve representation, why don’t Non-Binary people? Because that may (unfortunately) be a clue to some underlying (potentially transphobic) beliefs about NB people, that he’s not sharing because he doesn’t want to risk the relationship / being alone.
Yes, I've explained that to him before... Even though he uses his assigned pronouns at birth, he's very gender critical, and he personally would like to see gender just not be a thing in general in the future. I think this is where his comments come from. 
But yeah, I agree with you that having people to look up to is so important. But also that well-known people shouldn't have to out themselves to become representation before they're ready :)

EDIT: I didn't relaise what the term ""gender critical"" actually means something really awful. I mean that he is critical of the concept of putting people into gendered boxes (but he is supportive of people finding labels that help them), and he doesn't like stereotypes that often come with gender labels.
I agree. He does defend me a lot, I have unaccepting parents. At the same time, it actually feels nice to be ""normalised"" people like us have the right to feel ""normal"". To me, that's the goal for us as a human race in general- to help everyone feep like whatever or whoever they are, that they're normal. I do think thay representation matters for this too, but I can see where he's coming from! 

Mmmm, we've had the ""but you, as a striaght white male, have been represented in media since the beginning of time"" conversation before. He can kind if see it, but I think things like this are really difficult to see if it's impossible to put yourself in someone else's shoes. It's an ongoing conversation though, and I make sure to bring it up on purpose every so often in a peaceful helpful way :)
I'd be concerned dating anyone who self describes as 'gender critical' as a nonbinary person
He has never used the term ""gender critical"". What I mean by saying that is, he doesn't like that people are forced into gendered boxes, he wishes that there are no boxes at all. Not necessarily getting rid of labels that make people comfortable, but he wishes that the boxes didn't come with stereotypes attatched. He's got some manerisms and hobbies that go against the stereotypes assigned to males, so this is an issue close to his heart.

I have no qualms about being his partner, we've had our missunderstandings over the years, but we always come to agreement peacefully and it's an equal amount of times thay he agrees with my veiw, or that I agree with his veiw, or that we come to a new veiw somewhere in the middle :)"	10c46o9	NonBinary	31	1.0	2023-01-14 23:33:00

I'm confused and fucking sad, why do people hate us?	"**terfs**: enbies don't exist, trans people are delusional, the existence of trans women erases our womanhood waaaaaah

**conservatives & centrists:** enbies don't exist, trans people are delusional, transmed trans people MIGHT be valid

**transmeds**: trans people are binary and require life-threatening sex dysphoria to be trans, and they are only trans IF they fully transition

**enbies**: trans people exist, all identities are valid, gender identity means something different for everyone and it's fine to use contradictory gender terms

**me**: okay, so gender is hotly debated, it's something *up for debate even among enbies.*... so i guess life doesn't make sense huh?

&#x200B;

i just wanna be an enby and not have to FIGHT every day to feel valid, in my own eyes and the eyes of others 😭😭😭"	""" i just wanna be an enby and not have to FIGHT every day to feel valid, in my own eyes and the eyes of others ""  


Focus on feeling valid in your own heart. Other people will wake up eventually.  
I wish I could say the fighting will stop soon. It won't; but you will get stronger. Your most powerful weapon in the war for trans/enby equity is a deeply-rooted sense of self-love and gentleness. <3
My personal theory is that a lot of people hate us (and  binary trans folks) because they see it as something ""new"" and therefore illegitimate. (That's a lie of course, we've existed as long as genders have existed.)

I'm not sure how old you are, but I'm 30 and just watching the huge groundswell of support and visibility given to LGB people since I was a kid has been mind-blowing. I never imagined when I was 12 and the idea of gay marriage was seen as fringe and ridiculous by most people, so that we'd have full marriage equality in the US within my lifetime. The growing amount of visibility and support for trans and NB people has been moving really fast too (at least in the US) even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes. I think almost 20 states allow for X as a gender marker on state-issued IDs now when just 5 years ago I think only 1 or 2 states did, for example (and only then because of lawsuits I'm pretty sure, not legislation when most now are by legislation). 

So it is shitty now for us, I won't deny that, but the fact that more and more people even know we exist now (even if some of them do hate us for it) means that more people will eventually accept us for who we are. 

I want to end on a happier note, though. I work for a fairly large company that makes (among other things) online applictions for colleges in the US. We have a few hundred clients. Our official company standard now is to have a third, non-binary gender option for the gender question that's on all applications (unless the client school specifically tells us they don't want it, and very few have.) And this was after a lot of our clients were already asking us to put in a third gender option or a write in field for gender identity anyway. So at least in my experience things have been getting a lot better a lot faster than I would have ever expected.

Honestly same, being an enby is so hard, cause I'm in school right, and there are 3 people in my year who are trans (female to male (I go to an all girls school)) and one of my friends and I are enby (but my friend is really good friends with them so it doesn't really affect them so much) but they've heard I'm enby (I'm trying to get people to tell people) and I just feel like those trans boys are just always like \*pointed look\* 'who the hell do you think you are, you think your life is sooo hard as an enby, but you don't know all the dysphoria and the shit we have to go through daily being trans!!! hmmmm HMMMMMM'. And I'm just there like 'no it's not daily, it's hourly'. But it's just so fricken annoying and I'm kinda like asdfghjkllkjhgfdsasdfghjklsdfghjkjhfdfggjhsgdzjfawrundng (mental breakdown and a shit ton more stress and dysphoria). so yeah, I get what you mean!
Honestly, a lot of the answers you would get here will be biased and based in an echo-chamber. If you really want to know, you should post this question in a sub that doesn’t remove all the answers that you don’t want to hear
Self love is extremely difficult but I'm trying (we shouldn't have to TRY, but humanity is poisoned profoundly)

I want to hear all the answers. Pm me.
but you do have to try. almost everyone struggles with self love at some point, regardless of gender. the rest of humanity isn't responsible for you loving yourself. 

this shit is hard. we each have to care for ourselves so we can bring our best self to the group to share with others.
Hey fellow 31! Agreed this person makes so much sense! 

And it's cool to remember too, NBs in native American cultures, shamanic traditions and the like we're actually seen as incredibly important. We were viewed as being closer to ascending since we have a balance of male and female in our souls. 

Idk, on the bad days knowing and remembering that fact gives me a little bit of relief. Hopefully it does for you too. It's not all bad out there. Much love :)
My ID is going to say “x” and no dickheads on the internet are gonna be able to change it no matter what they think. :) 

I believe it.
theres always going to be people who dislike us for what we are, and deciding that they dont define or validate who we are is the most powerful thing we can do. ever since i decided that randos dont get to decide who i am, im more comfortable being myself. its something to work towards
Yeah I'm thinking of starting an LGBT group. I don't think they'll have to move schools as my schools not religious, it's public. I told my textiles teacher about being enby and she was fine with it so I don't think they'd have to move. But the thing with 1 of the trans boys is that you see, all the trans boys have been friends since like kindergarten (we're now in year 9) and when 1 of them came out as trans, then their friend moved to the school and it turned out he was trans and the thing is in their friendship group there are (I'm not being racist, I don't mean to offend anyone) 3 people in it that are white and then 4 that are from countries in Asia. And the 3 white people in that group happen to be trans so, with that one trans boy I'm kind of like *pointed look* *in a strange voice* 'peer pressure or are you just skhf,sdbf,vmhjjdgofhuasrring? hmmm, HMMM' if you get what I mean. And I also use the be REALLY close friends with the 3 of them like I knew them very well, we were 4 peas in a pod, we were completely inseperable, anyway, and the 2 I meantioned have always been like *nervously* 'he he, he he, imagine being a girl, he he', and the one I meantioned was always like '(very uneducated, extremelly transphobic comment)'. And I'd be on the side like 'oop', well I'm gonna get out of here (thats why I'm not friends with them any more), and like you know how trans people if they come out as a teenager have generally been questioning their gender for like ages and alikhgcrnkshrgn, yeah anyway (so that's also probably another reason why they're like *pointed look* at me all the time, ANYWAY, so yeah and like you know hmmmmm!

Sorry for the long rant, but I know it's not a competition, that's my point, that's kind of what they're doing like all the time! But I reckon I'm going to go up to them and call a truce and maybe ask to be friends again. IDK. anyway yes. And my school is basically entirely LGBT (not entirely though, there's one group of EXTREMELLY homophobic little ass holes who keep pestering us and just wont shut up and go away!) so if I did start an LGBT group then like the entire school would come and it's wuite a big school! But thanks anyway!

Starting T On my Birthday, Happy but Sad and Can't Stop Crying	"I'm starting testosterone and finasteride on my birthday this week. And I'm so happy, but I also I can't stop crying. Nobody knows, and I can't tell anyone. 

I just moved to a new city for grad school too and I'm so lonely. But I can't tell anyone back home  (aka my mom and my telehealth therapist) that I'm lonely because I want everything to be great here. This was my place to come and be free, but I feel like I'm still living such a lie and nobody knows me. And now I have this amazing thing happening and I'm all alone as it happens. I should be rejoicing, but all I want to do is sleep."	"im really really proud of you!!! <3
Congratulations. Sucks you have to keep your feelings hidden, hope things improve.
Thank you so much. It's just so hard, ya know?

Non-binary teacher looking for advice on how to help my trans students	" Hi! I (27 afab NB) work in a school as a tutor. My job is to help students (teens) and basically I am with them all day long. In my classroom there is a gender fluid person and a trans boy. It turns out that at school they will be giving a talk about gender violence and they will separate the students into two groups: on one side the men and on the other side the women.

When the principal announced this, I could see the bewildered faces of my two trans students and it made me very sad. I don't know how to approach the directors about this since I am in the closet myself, the only people who know my identity are my students (who are very loving and asked me my pronouns from day one) and my close friends. I would like to advocate for my students and try to help them but I also don't know what I could propose to the directors since everything is already scheduled and planned.

Any suggestions on what to say to the directors so they can better include my trans students?

Additional info: I am relatively new to this job and feel I should be cautious because I don't know how they might react."	"My gut reaction would be to first ask *why* they're being gender separated in the first place? It seems to me like something everyone should understand on the same terms. *Then* if you feel comfortable you could mention that it might be exclusionary. 

Because the answer might point to it being exclusionary or sexiest for a bunch of reasons. If that's the case you wouldn't be outing yourself at all in pointing that out.

ETA and then please tell us cause I'm super curious. I can't think of a good reason myself
This seems like a good teachable moment and an opportunity to show how enforcing a strict gender binary is itself a form of gender violence that erases the identities and experiences of very real people.
I too am curious as to why the separation. Gender violence can happen from or to any gender. Creating separation feels like it it would create more division and angst, but I don’t know the context or information being conveyed. 

You don’t have to out yourself to bring it up. It could be something they just hadn’t thought of. Depending on their point of view, someone they perceive as cis bringing it up could hold more weight too. Either way, you don’t have to identify as anything to bring up concerns, so if you are uncomfortable letting them know your situation then you don’t have to tell them. Just approach it from the standpoint of advocating for your students and wanting to make it a comfortable learning experience for everyone.

I would just start by asking some questions about the presentation and find out why they need to be separated in the first place. Then see where it needs to go from there.
I mean you can just go talk to the principal. It’s really not a big deal if they don’t know you’re nonbinary. You’re advocating for your students. What they’re doing is really ducking weird
You sound like a lovely person, it's wonderful that your students have someone to bat for them.

I would ask the directors why they should be separate the students at all, surely there are valuable lessons either gender can learn from each of the talks. It would also help the students feel more equal and less divided.

You can object on the grounds on sexism or boys not learning something about girls, nor girls learn something about boys that could be really helpful.
This part. I’d argue it’s incredibly important for boys to hear the shit girls are often told about avoiding violence (and for girls to hear what boys are being told about not committing violence). Realistically, both groups of people need both sets of skills—but also, assuming they’re being separated because of traditional ideas about gender, it might promote critical thinking to hear how different the advice is for boys vs. girls. Hearing one side, but not the other is less likely to expose the faults in reason these ideas rely upon.

There’s an episode in the most recent season of Sex Education on Netflix that deals with a different issue, but speaks to the hypocrisy of separating children based on gender or sex to talk about issues *related to* gender or sex.

Men don't cry (when they're looking at women's clothing)	"I think my egg is cracking a little more than usual.


I was at H&M with my girlfriend and a mutual friend, looking through the women's clothing for the friend. There were so many items I liked and I even tried on a shirt (a soft striped and floral print t-shirt), but sadly the sleeves looked weird to me so I decided against it.

I didn't place it right away, but after talking with friends (an awesome group of queer and gender diverse folks) I identified it as a kind of longing. I'm 26 and still living with family so presenting how I'd like to has been...difficult. I'd love to feel okay enough to paint my fingernails and not take it off before work, and present more visibly...not man.

I've never been particularly masculine to begin with, and, of course, perceived and presented masculinity don't have to mean someone isn't a man. However, in the past year I've asked close friends to not refer to me as a ""man."" Going further, I've adopted they/them as well as he/him, but am okay with being called a boy. After that though, I'm wondering how closely I'm aligned with masculinity or anything like that at all.

No questions or anything, I just needed to share this with a group that gets the feeling.

Love,
M"	"Can totally relate (in the opposite direction, but still). Thanks for sharing. 

I’m glad that you have supportive friends and that you’re cultivating clarity about gender feelings. You’re already well on your way to presenting as a more authentic version of you 💚
Feel the same way.  Especially with full makeup and nails, would love to wear that without having to hide it from my family. I’m 26 too. And every time I’m at a store I wish I could buy and wear woman’s clothing as freely as I wear men’s clothing 
God, this made me tear up a lil bit. It's been an interesting time, that's for sure, but I'm definitely getting some of that clarity. Or maybe just accepting the confusion 😛.
♥️♥️♥️ To you, friend! I'm not sure where I wanna end up on my gender presentation just yet, but I do wish I could explore and express myself a bit more freely. One day we'll both be free to do what the hell ever we want!
Haha, cheers to that.  I think I might not have made it through last summer if I hadn’t decided that absolute 100% certainty (and the ability to put it all into words) was an unfair standard to put in front of “I accept myself”

“Accept the confusion” is a phrase I’m going to keep in my pocket—thanks! 😊"	a2ix4e	NonBinary	30	1.0	2018-12-03 00:02:11
Grief and Transitioning	"I wrote this on my facebook and thought I should maybe post it here too.

&nbsp;

I have been avoiding binding not because of the heat but because of the sadness it brings. It's not increased dysphoria but grief and fear and confusion. I am non-binary. I do not have a clear cut path set for me. I have to tread a path that isn't really talked about and is thick with underbrush.

Putting on my binder reminds me how much I hate my body. How happier I would be if I could just go further with my transition. But my grief and attachment to my body makes me feel less. That I do not deserve to transition because I have formed an ok relationship with my body as it is. Looking in the mirror when I'm binding makes me feel like sobbing. I'm reminded of how happy I would be if I could face the fear.


But I AM scared. I have tried so hard to love my body. I just want to be better but I'm scared I will regret it. I am scared I'm faking it. The idea that your transition is magic is bullshit. There is a terrifying aspect to it all. To letting go of the body that you've had for your life up until now. I want to cling to my curves and softness because it's all I've known. Because I am neither here nor there and I don't know what that means for me. I am both stuck in uncertainty and certainty. This desire to chase what I know will help but not wanting to let go. The fear that not only will lovers no longer want to touch me but that I'll hate everything I'll become.


All I want is to be happy. I just want to make this body better. It'll never be perfect. But it could be better. I don't want to talk about this because I hate sharing real weakness. I have managed to get medication that makes my depression much quieter. But this feeling still hangs on my bones. I cope by forcing myself to accept my body. There's a deep hollow ache that I cradle in my rib cage.


There is so much pain in transitioning and I want this to be talked about. I know it's not just me. Please never feel less because of it. Know you are not alone and that I'm proud you're still alive and fighting. I love you."	"I SO relate to this!! Thank you so much for sharing. 
Thank you for posting this. I have a very curvy, fluffy, soft body, and I love that body on a lot of levels. But I also hate it on a lot of levels. I don't know if want to medically transition because, although it would help with the ambiguity and flexibility of the presentation I desire, I this *my body.* and I don't want a ""man's"" body anymore hannibwant a ""woman's"" body. It's hard and confusing and compounded my a metabolism that, due to inherent medical issues, makes it hard to maintain a weight and fitness level I'd like to have again. It's confusing. Thank you for making me feel a little less alone in this. 
Agreed 10000%. I debated complete removal type top-surgery for a long, long time. I have grown attached to my chest, for my more ""feminine"" days, but I also cannot stand it for my more ""masculine"" days.

Binding helps reduce, but the problem is still there. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I could do reduction surgery, of course, but then what will I do when I want to feel very ""feminine""? I don't feel like I'll ever find a true solution.

I'm really glad I'm not the only one.
This ... yes. Thank you. I really appreciate your candidness. 

This:
"" I just want to make this body better. It'll never be perfect. But it could be better. I don't want to talk about this because I hate sharing real weakness. ""

These are words you've pulled from my own heart. I hate being nonbinary because to be genuine and Seen i have to come out over and over and over again. I have to show complete strangers the most raw parts of myself and I hate it. I am too easily hurt. 

Thank you for sharing. 
This resonated with me a lot. Thanks for sharing!! I just push away thoughts of my body because I can't do anything about it, and I am mostly okay with it, and I am attatched to it. I would like to be less curvy and have tiny boobs, but that will never happen. I could get a breast reduction or remove them. But my hips will always be this wide. I would *literally* look like a human pear with arms and legs if I had a breast reduction, and I don't think looking like a pear would make me feel any better... I also feel like this when it comes to my names. I've been going by a neutral nickname for two years but I wondering if I should switch back because it scares me to leave my birth name behind, the name that my parents gave me and the name I have had for 25 years. 
Of course <:
<3 I'm glad it helped. I wish you the best with everything and I hope you can find a level of comfort despite everything.
I am going for a reduction. That's my goal as I want boobs but smaller. I am a genderless mess of a person. 


I'm really happy this helped you out. :)
I have very small breasts as is, and it's still frustrating on masculine  days AND frustrating on feminine days. But I'd much rather have my chest size than one larger, so if that seems like a good solution, go for it :) 
Of course! I have reached a level of apathy with my gender. I do not care what strangers think of me. There will hardly be times where I'm not misgendered. It is what it is. This world was not built for me but I can create my own space despite that. I wish you the best and I'm glad I can help by talking about my own experiences.
My heart goes out to you. I am glad I could help in some small way. I wish you all the best in your journey.
Right back at you, good luck and all that jazz :D"	6s1apj	NonBinary	28	0.95	2017-08-06 22:03:10

I (afab) told my amab partner I think I might be NB to some degree and he was amazing (long)	"So this is really long. sorry. I just needed to get it all out...

**TL;DR - my partner of 5 years said he felt pretty ambiguous about his own gender and gender in general, told me he would support me however he could. I had told him that I loved androgynous/masculine styles but had always been scared to look more androgynous for fear of threatening what little identity as a woman that I had (my only link to my gender identity was 'I have a female body and female features, I must be a girl')... but I felt maybe I could relax about this now. He immediately took me on a shopping trip and started picking out men's clothes for me. As we both look pretty obviously cis, we mildly bamboozled a changeroom attendant. It was awesome.**

When I began to talk, he asked if he could stop me for a second, and told me he loved me and supported me and would use whatever pronouns I needed. If surgery was going to be a thing, he would do his absolute best to support me but, as we had discussed in a random hypothetical discussion ages ago, the romantic aspect of the relationship would be up in the air til we got to know each other with the new gender again.

I was expecting the second, even though I don't really think I want or need surgery, but the first part was a relief to hear.

Part of my explanation to him was about why I had initially tried to tell him how I felt via one external category: mens' fashion. 

Despite really liking men's fashion and androgyny, I was scared to wear it because it threatened my identity as a woman. At the time I thought it was my sexual identity, and that if I went 'butch' it would mean that I would only like women. But when I stopped to think about it, I realised that that was actually really silly--the identity it was threatening was my gender. 

Dressing in shapeless clothing or men's clothing for comfort was one thing--it was utility only and I wore it whenever I didn't have to go out. Since I based my identity on my appearance, any serious attempt to conceal my gender and/or make me look deliberately androgynous or masculine in a really stylised way would mean I was taking gendered-clothing seriously on an appearance-based level. This would pose a huge, *huge* threat to my gender identity, as its one tenuous link to the rest of my identity would be cut out.

**
When he finally got it, he had the biggest eureka look on his face that I have ever seen on anyone, and told me he'd been in the same position a few years ago--when he was my age. But he resolved it not by finding a non-binary label but defining himself only by himself--eg ""I am [his name]"". He does this with everything so I had a bit of an 'oh duh, of course' moment. Classic him.

Anyway, he told me he loved me again and suggested that we get out of the house to have a bit of an emotional break.
 
We went to Target just for something to do, and he suggested we go have a look around. When I started by looking at the stuff closest to the door, which was the womens' section, he said, ""How about we go straight to the mens' section and get you a shirt?""

I was a little apprehensive out of habit, but still  wanted to do it. Halfway there, he got distracted and started talking about cargo pants, because ""You know I've always thought cargo pants would look good on you.""

Shirt forgotten, when we got to the mens section, he made this adorably huge fuss over choosing the right cut and colour. Here are some quotes from him:

""No, those aren't cargo pants, we want cargo pants.""

""I really wish this one was lighter, like that pair over there, but those aren't cargo pants unfortunately.""

""You told me you're trying to get away from wearing black, so how about another colour?""

""Yeah, I agree, I like the green better than the tan, too.""

""If we're going to do this menswear thing, it's going to be done right!""

This is what shopping with him is like every time, even in the womens' section (sadly, he's better at my clothes than I am). This time, I was especially glad he took the lead as I might have lost my nerve.  And he was just there, supporting me. In text he might sound a bit overbearing, but our relationship is such that as soon as I tell him I need some space or want to do my own thing, he backs off.

Once we were there, he couldn't wait to see what I'd look like. When I came out, he told me how great he thought they looked (they did look pretty great), and had all these different suggestions for how I could wear them and what to style them with.

There wasn't any particular special moment for me as I tried on the pants, cause, well, they were just pants. If and when I ever suit up fully maybe Ill feel like that.

I think we really bemused the changing room attendant, because we were to all appearances a hetero romantic couple... but the girl in the scenario was trying on guy's clothes and the guy had clearly chosen them for her and was offering pretty sophisticated opinions on fit and style. She was really polite and friendly and chatty, but you could practically see the wheels turning in her head as she tried to figure out what was going on.

To be honest, that whole experience in the changeroom, of just being myself and enjoying something 'odd' while being with my partner, who was uber supportive and just being himself too, was the highlight of the whole trip. Plus I do enjoy making other peoples' lives a little more surreal.

When we came out of the fitting room, he said ""Okay, so you know how they look on you--would you like them? Cause I'm happy to buy them for you.""

I hemmed and hawwed, because we're both broke as shit and I hadn't intended for the try-on session to be more than, well, trying things on. But he insisted he could afford it, and he is slightly less broke than me, so I gave in. And now I have really comfy, durable cargo pants and a boyfriend who loves me and has made it very clear that he still wants to bump uglies.

It does not even seem real. Like, we've been together for a long time but this is just plain unrealistic. Then again, he's unlike anyone else I've ever met.

If you actually read all this, wow and thank you. I kind of needed to just share this story somewhere even if nobody does read it. It still kind of makes me want to cry happy tears.

Awwww, thank you :) He is the awesomest out of the two of us, I think, but I do take credit for choosing him, and he seems to think I'm pretty all right.

I kind of suggested maybe he was nonbinary today, and he goes, ""Oh, I _know_ I am.""

Having a rough night...help?	"AFAB, genderfluid/nonbinary. 

I’m just feeling extremely dysphoric about my chest and thinking about how I don’t know if I’m ever gonna be able to afford top surgery or even get it at all because I can’t take T (and don’t even want to) and it looks like the only surgeons who take my insurance require hormones. It’s just baloney and it’s making me feel really sad and frustrated. I don’t know how to handle this dysphoria combined with the thought that it might be something I am stuck with forever.

I don’t know. I guess I just need some support? To know I’m not alone? I don’t feel comfortable talking to my family about this stuff, they try but they just don’t get it, and all my friends are busy...so I’m reaching out to you fantastic nonbinary folks. Idk. What do you do about chest dysphoria when you can’t bind and surgery may never be an option?"	"I feel you chest dysphoria is a fucking bitch. I have a binder but i really dont get to wear in public because my mom currently drives me and she finds it the most embarrassing thing so i really only get to wear it in my room. And it just fucking sucks, i hate my chest and it gives me so much dysphoria, it makes me feels so disgusting i just really hope that one day i will get top surgery because there's no way my parents would ever support that in any way. 

But for now we've just got to deal with it, and its really fucking hard, no doubt about that, but we've got to do it. Like most nights i sleep with a sports bra, i cant bind while sleeping, and the sports bra really isnt that comfortable, but ya know, it helps, even if some nights its just a small tiny bit, its still helps.
I wear sports bras or a loose binder I have, or I wear baggy clothes so ALL of me looks lumpy, not just my chest. I got in a car wreck a while ago and damaged the cartilage that attaches my ribs to my sternum, so I can’t bind for a while. I also can’t afford surgery, so y’know.
My first thought is tightish shirts under other shirts, but depending on chest circumference, that might not help enough. Sorry you're going through this. 

You came to the right place for support, though. I hope someone else has something better to add.
I feel you.  I'm AFAB and NB  and I've been having bad chest dysphoria all week. I've been binding every day but  it's just not enough lately.  I want to eventually get top surgery but I'm concerned about nuking my marriage if I do.

Stay strong though, things can change, you could get different insurance.  In the meantime, I have good luck if I use a tank top, tight tee shirt and looser long sleeve, it seems to minimize me to looking like I have pecs, even if I'm only wearing a sports bra. And I'm pretty big chested unfortunately.

Also if you can, try lifting weights focusing on your chest muscles, it has definitely helped me to get flatter.

Good luck.
Thanks for the support, everyone! Your kind words made me feel better enough to get some sleep. The dysphoria is wicked bad again today, but it’s so helpful to know that I’m not the only one struggling. I wish I could magically make everything okay for all of us, but y’all are right...things could change in the future, but for now we’ve gotta live our lives the way we are. I’m going to try not to let this get me down. I am still myself even if I don’t have my ideal body yet and I have fought hard to be me. So there’s something to be proud of."	867suf	NonBinary	28	1.0	2018-03-22 01:30:10
HELP! Accidentally came out to bf, sadness ensued	Was having a pretty shitty day, so when I called my bf he asked me what was wrong, or if I had anything on my mind. I had been questioning my gender for quite some time, but I had never told him in fear that he would break up with me (he grew up in a conservative family and while he does not condemn the lgbt community, he doesn’t exactly love them either- more like he doesn’t really care). But today, I was on the brink of tears because depression hit really hard and I broke down crying and told him that I thought I might be non binary. He then said that he doesn’t want to date someone like me, because he thought I was different when we started dating. I want him to be more understanding, know that I am not a different person because of it, and that I was still tolerant of she/her pronouns. But he told me he didn’t sign up for this and cried. He was so sad after I told him and said he didn’t see me the same way. I felt so bad for telling him, as he has finals in the next week, and regret everything. What should I do?	"I may come off as super mean right now but if your boyfriend immediately goes ""I DONT WANT TO DATE SOMEONE LIKE YOU THAT IS WEIRD."" Then there is a very high chance that he is not the right person for you.

It's one thing to say ""That is a lot and I need to think about what that means "" but it's a whole different ballpark to say ""I do not want you to be something like that"" which is extremely disrespecting.
He can go and f°©k right off. If he can't accept you and support you when you need him then get rid of that rotten cackle fart.
It's not your problem that he can't get over his stigma. I'm sorry for you because you're only trying to be yourself. It's not like you've fundamentally changed. 

I think you need to move on and leave him behind if he won't change his mind. It's tough but there's no sense in forcing someone to do something they don't like, especially with romance.

More and more I realize that it's best for transgender people to be 100% honest about their gender before things get serious.
This isn't your problem hen, if he's upset over how you identify then that's on him, exams or no

I'd be tempted to point out how you didn't sign up to date a man who cries, so either you need to reassess the situation based on societal norms, or else you could be a reasoning person and offer to help someone you care about *hint hint*

Hopefully putting forward that situation as the ridiculousness it is might help him realise how you are the same person you were before the convo and the only thing that's changed is his perception of labels has taken precedent over his enjoying the time you spend together!

In short, you're still the same you just he has put a different filter on how he sees you, and this filter is made of bullshit!
I (31/nb/femme presenting afab/pan) see you, sib. My fiance and I have been dating almost 2 years now, I started realizing I was NB about 6 months ago. He's cishet. It's been difficult, but we're working through it. A major red flag though if he just wants to full stop say he doesn't want to date you anymore bc of who you are. You are deserving of love and support.
You deserve someone who loves you for your real self.
Drop that whole-ass man.
You deserve better. Someone who will love you for the genuine you.
if he's het, he's het. i know it's devastating, but at least he's being honest about it right away instead of dragging it out. you deserve someone who'll love your whole enbyself. i send many air hugs 💚
fuck that!!!! fuck fuck fuck that holy shit i hate that for you i’m so so sorry)): you should absolutely not feel bad for telling him, it’s your right and your story and if he can’t accept it that is not on you
> whole ass-man

sites asking for gender and online friends	"its such a small thing but it always makes me so happy when sites allow you to say you are non-binary or write in something for ""other"" and not have to go with the ""prefer not to specify"" thing.

i like to make friends with people online partly bc i rarely ever leave home, and most of my close friends live too far for me to be able to visit. i always start by explaining them my gender, and while it takes some time with some of them, the majority of the time people are completely ok with it, i have even made some closer friends who always help me out and make things so much easier and more comfortable when people get confused by it. idk how id be if i didn't have internet to be able to connect with people like me, and people that accept me, im so happy to see posts from people here, I hope you are all taking good care of yourselves! its ok to be sad, and things really do get better ♡"	I usually put some random letters for my name and gender so then I get funky ads	g9ldbb	NonBinary	28	0.94	2020-04-28 11:15:49
Why are people so protective of the gender binary?	"When I first found out being nonbinary was a thing I thought, ""That's wonderful for them but, I could never do that... even though that's probably what I am."" A year later, I knew for a fact that that's who I was but I thought I could *never* come out. Because I am a millennial, not gen z, I'm the wrong age group for that. My friends and family wouldn't understand and I'm not confident enough to try to make them. 

I thought I'd just stay in the closet forever and I could be okay with that. Eventually once I started living alone, I got a binder and started dressing in ways that made me feel good about myself. Slowly, I started wearing more masc things in public. I came out to a few friends and asked them to use they/then for me but I still haven't told my boyfriend.

Since I came out to a few people, I feel better and worse at the same time. My boyfriend and my family are progressive but they are very focused on the binary. I'm so scared of what they'll think of me. But at the same time I want them to know who I am, who I've always been... I want them to see me. I don't want to be seen as a woman, I never have.

I want facial hair and body hair but have a ""feminine"" body and face. I'm so afraid of people hating me if I pursue what I want. I don't like getting attention from people, I'm not that kind of person. I just want to be me.

Why are people so protective of gender? Why does is make them so angry and scared?

I'm so sad that I'll never get to be the person I want to be. I'm afraid even if I do, I'll just be miserable in a different way.

I am looking into getting a therapist who understands gender issues but until then I'm just putting this out into the ether so it's not trapped inside me any more..."	"I'm so sorry you're having this experience, OP. For what it's worth, I'm also a nonbinary millennial (and trans masc, nonetheless), and sometimes indeed it feels like I'm getting to or past the point at which certain folks except people to ""get over"" the ""phase"" of being non binary. Still, even if my family doesn't know my true gender, my friends do, and they're all varying degrees of supportive, in most cases very much so.

I say all that to say this: I've thought about the issue of enbyphobia a lot, especially as it relates to transphobia. I hesitate to say either of us have it harder (I don't think that kind of trauma competing is helpful), but nonbinary folks do often have the added hurdle of needing to educate folks we come out to that our genders even exist in the first place. 

This is the answer I've come to: People are so protective of the gender binary because being wrong, and admitting to being wrong, is really fucking hard. Especially for some folks for whom the notions of gender essentialism and complementarianism are fundamental to their understanding of life, love, society, and god. There are really high stakes for being wrong—If they're wrong about how many genders there are, or what determines someone to be a certain gender, what else might they be wrong about? Possibly, everything. That's a scary thing to face. And I have no idea how we get them to do it, but in the meantime it's important that we remember that they are, indeed, wrong.
>Why are people so protective of gender? Why does is make them so angry and scared?

Dualistic grasping. Being openly non-binary directly threatens realness of such divisions and claims and forces people to re-examine them, and immature minds don't handle emptiness well. When constructs dissolve into emptiness what arises from it is not recognized, so in confusion it becomes anger, fear etc. Seeing that gender is made-up (so it can be whatever suits everyone's needs more instead of oppression!) threatens basis of patriarchy, because then the whole worldview is made up and collapses. But there is no building, so no collapse and no harm but only benefit for everyone. They just have a nightmare and don't know they are dreaming, so they get angry and scared and try to protect their building as if it's real, as if their life depends on it.
Dualistic/Black-and-white thinking is *easy*. In a complex world that very rarely has clear answers, framing everything into a binary frame of mind is comfortable to a great many folks, since it doesn't require them to think critically or be introspective. Lots of people are utterly horrified at the concept of questioning their assumptions and ""what they know."" *If others can question their gender, then maybe your gender can be questioned too. This is an uncomfortable prospect, as those of us who are NB know well.* When you're raised to think in a binary way, and the world you walk in reinforces that kind of thought, it's ***very*** difficult to get out of it. Not excusing people's shitty behavior, but it takes hard work on yourself to change, which is why few people put in the effort.



Some other easy B&W kind of thinking includes:

*""If you're not with us, you're against us,""* and *""Worship Jeebus or go to Hell,""* and *""Only the Sith deal in absolutes.""*
>I am looking into getting a therapist who understands gender issues but until then I'm just putting this out into the ether so it's not trapped inside me any more...

Are you in the bay area? I'm not sure if it matters these days with covid and remote therapy, but I had a lovely therapist that specializes in gender and helped me come to terms with being non-binary. Highly recommend, super sweet person that was the best therapist I've had, and I've had several.
Thanks for the thoughtful response. When I'm online, I like spending time in spaces that are friendly and supportive to enbys; sometimes I see posts/comments in others that are so enbyphobic that it really scares me and it's what drove me to make this post.

The last sentence in your comment is very poignant but, still comforting. Thanks again.
Oh wow, as someone who studies Buddhism, this makes a lot of sense to me! It's still sad to think about but, putting it in this perspective helps - thank you
>threatens basis of patriarchy

That's something I've been thinking a lot about lately, if another aspect is those who have been actively fighting against patriarchy also feel threatened. Just getting to where we are today has been the result of much very needed and worthwhile work, so I can see how if someone has devoted so much effort there it can feel threatening (even though I see it all as inter-related against the same oppressive systems). Like I know AFAB enbies who have been told it's just internalized misogyny by older feminists, for example. 

I'm AMAB, so thoroughly uncomfortable posing that line of questioning in general, but curious what your thoughts are.
I'm not in the bay area but I have been struggling to find a therapist who specializes in gender (and is also accepting new patients) in my state :( 

It does all seem to be remote anyway so, I'm open to any recommendations via pm!
>Just getting to where we are today has been the result of much very needed and worthwhile work,

Absolutely. We are here only because of countless beings who adopted altruistic mind, who put compassion to practice and saw how things can be changed for the better, even at the cost of their lives.

>another aspect is those who have been actively fighting against patriarchy also feel threatened

Well, we are just sentient beings, grasping at self, of course we feel threatened from time to time. It's okay.


Old feminists strived to liberate women, so seeing how gender and sex are made-up things might upset some. Ordinary people can hardly change their minds by themselves once they get used to life, because they believe in realness of appearences, concepts and perceptions they are accustomed to. Moreso when they are/were opressed for having some qualities, those qualities seem even more real. They might think that this means that their work was meaningless (it wasn't!), or that we abandon their work (we don't!), or (some) that we invalidate/erase their womanhood (we definetly don't!) and so on. Remember that they played a vital role in us having rights we enjoy today. That does not mean indulging their ignorance or not calling out trans/enbyphobia. Just don't get angry, don't send death threats, don't humiliate them or cause suffering. Be patient, compassionate and understanding to our elders."	sbnm8a	NonBinary	28	0.97	2022-01-24 14:37:04

A story about a confused boy and embarrassed mom that kilt/skirt	"so, years ago I used to wear something called a utility kilt. And they were to pagan festivals and outings and so forth. And I was part of the group that was throwing these events. A little boy and his mom came up to me and the boy looked confused. And asked his mother why is that man wearing a skirt.

His mother looked incredibly embarrassed, and I knelt down to his level and explain or said, yeah that’s pretty confusing isn’t it that a boy or a man would wear a skirt. And then I said but this is a special skirt that boys wear sometimes and it’s called a kilt. He just nodded with bigeyes.

From then on I often refer to it as a skirt. This is probably about 2005. I did not know that I was trans them at the time, and looking back I feel like it is sad that the little boy needed to be so confused about somebody that looks like a man was wearing a skirt.

Well I still look like a man, now I wear sarongs and women’s jeans and soft blouses and a burgundy beret and anything else that I freaking feel like.

I don’t know how to use Reddit well, if I have missed a tag or something please let me know"	"Thank you for sharing the story. I'm glad that you wear what you want and feel good about it❤
I've painted my toenails for over 20 years, way before I was out (yeah, I was never that gender-conforming to begin with...), and just a few years ago at a Midwest semi-rural grocery store, a little boy with his mom said ""Look, his toenails are painted"" (I was wearing sandals) and she said ""Lots of people paint their toenails"". I was happy that was her response, but obviously no idea if she told him in the next aisle that I was some kind of weirdo 😋  


I still wear kilts now, too, in addition to my skirts and dresses!
I only wear skirts on my feminine days but the problem is-

For the first time in my life I cried happy tears today in regards to my gender.	"All this time I was wrestling with what my gender is and honestly I still don't know. 

I had passive thoughts of being girl since I was 12, actively questioning for 2 years (of those 7 months full dose mtf hrt) and I still don't know and I just realized that's ok.

My dysphoria is SUPER picky. In social context of functioning in society, I hate gender dividing. I don't associate with males, neither with females (altough when it comes down to it, I tend to lean more on a female spectrum, and simply put ""bro"" culture is something, I absolutely loathe), I also dislike my genitalia, I never wished for a penis, but I also don't mind being flat chested and moderately muscled, just not something over the top. In romantic releationship I like to sweep person of their feet and to be more dominant one. I like to be the protector and I like to be physically bigger/or same size, just enough for them to craddle in for a warm hug, when they are having a bad day. In bed on the other hand, I prefer to be super cuddly, more affectionate and overall more submisive.

I just know that I'm not CIS, because not a cis person feels like I do, that's pretty clear. Though recently I figured out that not many transwomen feel like I do as well. I still do have kinda strong male side about me and I certainly don't dislike the person I was before, neither I feel sad for that person.

I'm such a mixed bag, I'm starting to think I'm genderfluid or demigender rather than a transwoman. 

Though having a ""cis"" option off the table is so relieving I can't understand, how is that even possible. All I did is that I switched off the background noise ""that I might just be some deluded man"".

In a future I might present as a man (albeit feminine one, while still being enby), as I don't know where the wind will take me, but at least I know what I'm not."	"I’m so glad that you’ve made space to discover yourself! Letting go of confusing, self-hating ideas that we’ve absorbed and internalized is a huge part of happiness—not just for trans people, but for everyone. Keep taking care of yourself and having patience for yourself, and you’ll be fine 💚
Congratulations! I really admire your living your life the way you were meant to be. The world would be a better place if more people did that.
Reading this gave me a lot of happiness. Sometimes we need a reminder to be kind to ourselves, and there's no one way to look or be trans, or nb, or anything on the spectrum!

I really like the way my wide pelvis looks, even if it doesn't fit with the masc perception I have of myself. I've always had a softness to my arms, so I've been trying like crazy to bulk up and lift. Although I enjoy appearing masc, or butch, or bro, I like to be picked up and cuddled and called cute :3. We of all people know what it feels like to blur gender appearance and expectation lines. It's beautiful and rewarding. I'm glad you are finding what is comfiest for you!
Resonate so much with this! Thanks for the detail, this was validating. Who we are as cuddlers is very much a part of who we are as genders! 
> I really like the way my wide pelvis looks

Another wide pelvis here! Altough I'm AMAB, I don't get why, but I have very wide pelvis, like as if I was afab.

>I've always had a softness to my arms, so I've been trying like crazy to bulk up and lift

Other way around for me :) I had somewhat muscly, but slimmer hands - I wanted to change it, so I started to exercise a lot and my hands started to be supper ripped. In fact my first intense period of dysphoria I remember was when my ex mentioned that ""your biceps is starting to rip sleeves of your shirt.

While dream of every masculine person, I started to freak out and asked myself several times what the hell am I' doing.

>We of all people know what it feels like to blur gender appearance and expectation lines. It's beautiful and rewarding. I'm glad you are finding what is comfiest for you!

Thank you!! Yes it's very rewarding and confusing at the same time. It's like I'm stuck in some weird limbo, where I can't even look for romantic partner, as I don't know who I'm. All I really hope for, is that one day to look at the mirror and know exactly who I'm. Then I would be happy.
You're welcome! I find my cuddling identity important. Most important probably :D"	9pw7bj	NonBinary	27	0.94	2018-10-20 17:57:54
I cut my hair when feeling sad.		"Can't be sad bout the haircut tho! I see you, angular sideburns and edges 💖 but why so glum?
Hey thanks (blush) I’ve worked a year with my admin who claimed his school is a trans friendly place when I got hired on and he has yet to use right pronouns for me.

I went to the comments of a video explaining non binary and boy was that a bad idea	"Im incredibly emotional rn and I just need to write this out. Needless to say, I’m not saying anything new, I just need to get this off my chest.

I’m going through questioning right now, and have been for a while. When I say questioning I mean trying desperately to convince myself that I’m cis because I’m incredibly afraid of the other outcome. 

Currently, I’m at the phase of watching video after video about people’s experiences discovering their gender and what exactly it means to be non binary. And here I am, getting more and more terrified as more and more boxes are getting ticked off, proving the reason behind my questioning. 

And then you scroll to the comments, and you see the what you were afraid of. Idk why I was surprised lol. There’s people trying to debate, people saying “I accept them but-“, and others just straight up saying they’re weird, insecure, confused, desperate for attention. And it was Every. Single. Comment.

But when I read those stupid comments it’s like I could hear them being read in my friends and family’s voices. And it didn’t look like a happy future. Maybe it would be better to just keep this lesser evil. It would certainly be easier.

I feel like if I accept this I’d just be trading one happiness for another. Idk. Im just scared and sad and probably in denial about a million things lol.

Thanks for reading my emotional word vomit"	"Youtube comments are an unmoderated cesspool that reminds us that Idiocracy was a warning, not a guide.
I’m sorry that you’re feeling these intense emotions. I related to your emotional word vomit though, so thank you for writing it out and sharing. 

I wish you steadiness and safety, stranger.
I’m sorry, I feel you it is extremely disheartening to see how rampant nb hate can be. Accepting yourself when questioning is a big rollercoaster and these people ofc don’t help. I recommend keep finding spaces with positive non binary and trans people and block out the transphobes as much as you can. There’s a lot of awesome aspects to self acceptance and finding community, but I get it can be really hard to feel anything but horrible when you’re stuck in the scared and extra vulnerable stage.
Life is paid for with your suffering. That’s sort of the only proof you have that you’re really living. I’d say if you’re at the age to do so, begin devising an escape route. You deserve to be who you are, but you are going to have to fight for it. That’s not a bad thing though, nothing worth having comes easy or freely."	q4f51c	NonBinary	26	0.95	2021-10-09 05:45:52

"""Progressive"" workplace/colleagues invited public declaration of pronouns but fail to use mine"	"Pretty much what it says in the title. I work in the kind of place that wants to make a show of how progressive it is - the entire sector I'm in is this way. 

I've been in the process of coming out, bit by bit, for some years now. Asked not to be referred to as ""woman/lady"" a while ago, which had no effect. Attempted to change my title to Mx, which wasn't recognised on the payroll because according to HR it doesn't exist - even though the payroll goes through the same county council as my tax and the council sorted it when I asked.

Person in charge of ""communications"" sent an email round about 6 months ago asking people to put preferred pronouns in our email sig. After some difficult deliberation I decided to bite the bullet and put they/them pronouns, and sent an email out politely informing people of my non binary identification and thanking them in advance for their effort, accepting that it might take time, that mistakes are expected, trying to be as non-confrontational about it as possible.

Since then about 4 of my colleagues have made any effort to actually use they/them. Everyone else has carried on using she/her. One person was extremely angry when I corrected her and implied I should find new colleagues if I wanted to be called something different. Told me she had ""other things to worry about"". Funnily enough, so do I - but my gender identity is still important to me. This is a colleague I previously got on with. It cut me to bits.

Since then I've been reluctant to say anything. But not correcting people means nothing changes. I tried wearing a badge with they/them on it as a visual prompt, even though that sort of thing's not my scene. No dice.

What does one do in this situation? I held back from coming out or genuinely accepting this aspect of myself for such a long time feeling like there was nothing to be gained from it. Now I feel like prematurely coming out in this way was the result of a bait-and-switch. Every time I get called she, it is jarring to me. One of the colleagues that has been getting it right has told me both my boss and HR have said it's ""too awkward/too much effort"" to use they/them. I don't know what else I can practically do. They want to be seen to be inclusive of trans people but when they actually encounter someone that needs what they seem to be offering, all of a sudden the facade falls away. Nothing but hot air. 

Sorry if this is overly self-piteous and not in the celebratory nature of the sub. I'm just sad and lost. I don't know many people like me. This, and of course the pandemic, have me feeling incredibly alone."	"Also now I'm imagining your coworker calling everyone he/him because it's *just too hard* to remember that anyone who's not a man works there, and how everyone who heard about it would absolutely EXPLODE over the sexism and discrimination and hostile environment and general cluelessness... yet here we are.
No, this is real. I'm sorry. I was just thinking about how my workplace does much the same thing to people. I'm not officially out because I know people will just mess it up with zero real repercussions, just like they do to my colleague no matter how many times I correct it. But we have gender neutral single-occupant bathrooms! (In addition to multi-stall binary ones...) Or like my non-binary kid's doctors, they all hypothetically know to use they/them and it's even in their medical chart, like not written free-hand but actually picked from a list of options someone coded into the software, but *ugh* do the providers struggle with it, and the other staff at the clinics almost all seem totally oblivious. I've submitted so many comments/complaints about it and gotten so many ""sincere apologies"" but if it is getting better, it's not happening fast enough.
I had a really similar experience when coming out and work for a company that thankfully does respect people's identities and they have changed what they can for me. But a lot of my coworkers treat me completely differently. None of the ones I work closely with, but someone quit our team in the middle of training and I heard through the grapevine that part of it was discomfort caused by me. That really fucking hurt. And they misgender me daily and I see my dead name when signing in every day, but they do make an effort. 

If it's in your power to look for a more inclusive company, that may be a better bet. Because thankfully I know I have an HR partner that will back me up if I did ever feel the need to take those concerns to them. The fact that you know that basic resource is gone to you is extremely isolating and worth remedying imo. 

Fr I'm sorry this happened. It really just sucks. I hope there's a better place out there for you!
Thank you for taking the time to share and write all this out. I wish I had some useful advice, but I don’t. These type of scenarios are a factor in why I haven’t pursued changing my name. I was AFAB but surgically transitioned to my version of non-binary (DI Mastectomy, hysterectomy, on T for 9months), cut my hair short etc... but I still get “thank you for your hard work, Ladies.” At this point I think I’m in the boat where I would only change my name/pronouns before starting a new job. I’ve been at my current job for 7+ years, and they don’t even pretend to be inclusive even though we do have a few openly non-hetero employees. On our new emergency contact form it said “gender identity” instead of “sex” but I think that was less about being inclusive and more about not saying “sex.” ::::eye roll::: I wasn’t even comfortable enough to put non-binary.
In these situations its easiest if the few people who respect you also confront people who mess up. Like it’s not helpful to say “Yeah the higher ups told me they refuse to respect you and I sat there and said nothing.” They’re called allies because being queer is a battle.
Yes! I have been tempted to start misgendering other people at random to make a point but I suspect all that will come from it is I'll get reprimanded for the passive aggression!

When people change their names because of marriage nobody gets their panties in a bunch if someone gets reminded of the change, when they get it wrong. Why should this be any different?
I guess it's a ""welcome to the party"" kind of experience, eh. Funny that you mentioned doctors, I requested my title change to Mx with the NHS. It did change but when I next had an appointment it read out Mx ""Surname"" rather than ""Firstname Surname"" as it always did before, which was a bit weird. Shortly after that I saw it had reverted back to Ms. Not sure what happened but someone must have flagged it for ""correction"", whether innocently or otherwise. Why offer these things if they can't actually carry it out. It's frustrating.
Oof. I'm so sorry about your experience with the colleague leaving. That must have been painful. In a way it's better given the bigot was weeded out, but still, ouch.

I've been looking for other jobs for a while now but nothing's stuck yet. My specialism is very closely aligned to where I work at present, and it's also very niche, which limits opportunities if I want to keep doing what I care about. Our HR situation is compounded by the fact that it's a small organisation with limited finances and the person responsible for HR has taken it on as secondary to being our accountant. She has only just started training in HR. It's better than the nothing we had before, and I know she's trying hard and working hard, but I don't think she's fully equipped for that aspect of the job yet. Such is life working for a small charity.
I hate the ""thank you for your hard work ladies"" thing, and not just because of the misgendering too. My boss uses variations on it all the time. He's been to ""leadership"" courses and I'm quite sure it's part of the script. It just comes off as an insincere platitude. If you care about the hard work I'm doing, invest some time into understanding what it is I actually do and thank me in specifics rather than general terms. Feh.

And yeah I get the sex is a naughty word thing too. I recently sat through a health and safety training session which kept referring to ""gender differences"" in the spine/pelvis relating to ergonomics, lifting etc. I'm a trained anatomist... Had to bite my lip throughout.
I have an update on this! The person who told me about what HR/my boss said, has been challenging them. I failed to make that clear in my original post, but I do have allies and I'm super grateful for them :) A second colleague offered to do the correcting for me if she catches people's in meetings, after I had a long heart to heart with her yesterday. I'm feeling a bit stronger today :)
My work is in medical simulation. I’m one of two people with a medical background. The remaining staff are artists for the most part. I feel your struggle!  (Not super related, but they were using female bony pelvis in male models that were simply skinned as male later, trying to articulate the inaccuracies is a daily headache for me).
That’s great! I’m so happy for you!!"	lcu2cz	NonBinary	27	0.97	2021-02-04 23:58:18
Just getting this off my chest	"Hi there, 28 they them pronouns here. 

My boss and I were discussing correcting coworkers about my pronouns and she said something that made me kind of uncomfortable. She said that maybe the reason why some people may have problems using my pronouns because they feel as though they're calling me an it. At the time I was kind of mortified so I just kind of nodded or something but I'm mad that I didn't say anything now. 

One of my friends at work whom I really love otherwise was having a hard time remembering in particular. I had a brief one on one conversation in which I explained I wasn't mad but please could she use my pronouns correctly. She apologized and agreed to try to remember. Then later on in the week we had this awkward conversation about my recent job switch to a less public facing position. I was explaining that part of the reason I took the job was because being misgendered over the phone all day was effecting my mental health. she was like..."" You know this is a problem you're going to have your whole life, right?"" And was talking about how I couldn't be hurt by things like that and how she wish she could learn more sensitivity from me and I could take on some of her toughness. 

My coworker is a POC and I know she meant all of this kindly and from a place of solidarity of people who share minority status. My boss was probably just trying to help by explaining a reason why people find using my pronouns difficult. intellectually I can acknowledge this. But it really gets tiring when people keep telling you that you aren't allowed to be upset about something that is genuinely distressing. 

They them pronouns aren't even that hard. I'm not trying to tell people they're bad only to be more mindful that our perceptions of someones gender expression don't always match their identity. I'm growing frustrated with people telling me to be patient when what I'm asking isn't the world...only a tiny effort. 

I feel stupid and embarrassed and sad. "	"That really sucks, but yeah, a lot of that is why I just tell ppl I'm pronoun indifferent, because even though it bothers me to be she'd all the time, it'd bother me more to be also be reminded each time that they aren't respecting who I am. If I don't tell them they can't disappoint me, right? *sighs through space-time*

That said I think it's awesome that you are confronting that, it shows a lot of strength that I hope to build up to one day. And I hope your co-worker and boss get with the program soon, and in the mean time take care of yourself
You shouldn't be made to feel stupid for expressing who you are.

I've started wearing a they/them pronoun pin ([this one](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/2602/products/EnamelPins__0002_TheyPronounPin_1024x1024.jpg?v=1480617905), from Autostraddle), which is small and looks unobtrusive and classy but is still visible enough to be a subtle reminder. So far it's doing a good job. 

Good luck with your coworkers! They/them is *definitely* not like ""it"" and should be quite easy to implement in an English language context. They'd use the same words if they didn't know a person's gender, right?
I am not your coworker, or your boss, but I want to apologize on behalf of people like myself who are fairly new to learning about the gender spectrum. (I've only recently been questioning my gender and learning more)  I have ADD and a terrible memory and I have trouble remembering people's names, so pronouns are (for me) another thing to struggle to remember.  I've been watching some non-binary youtubers recently and although I 100% want to be respectful about what language I use around people it still feels awkward for me sometimes.  I joined the transcord this morning and reading the rules terrified me, because I'm so scared that anything I say might be offensive to someone.

Anywho, the point is that I want to apologize again for people like myself who struggle with pronouns and proper language usage, not because we're being intentionally disrespectful, but sometimes it takes some getting used to.

I hope I came across clearly and not offensive in any way.  If I said something wrong, please let me know, and I will edit this.
I haven't made any steps concerning pronouns yet but I had a similar problem when I changed my name due to a history of abuse. Some people only remembered the new name when I started referring to them with a wrong name. :/
I came out to my friends a few weeks ago. I'm sharing a similar experience.

I go by they/them, however they're all getting used to using they/them. The other day a guy friend (Cis, white, possibly straight, however very understanding) And he got a tad bit upset that he didn't really have anything to call me (We have banters, and at times I'll call him ""boi"" and he'll respond ""girl"", except now I'm not a girl so lol)

And he means well but I suppose the change is very different? We use pronouns in a lot of our language. 

It hasn't really been the first time. I'll be called a she, or he, and people will go ""Oh shit I'm sorry""
Or they'll question why I go by They/Them. And it'd be easy for people to just take what I identify as for face value.

I don't want to tell you to be patient. Cause that basically sucks. But I can tell you that the first step is respect.

And from what I've read, they respect you, and your identity. But they're confused + insensitive, and your friend is kinda right, YOU know who you are no matter how you sound or look. Others might not. That doesn't give them an excuse to say what they say...but it does mean people aren't going to understand you from the get go.

You have every right to be upset, and if it causes a lot of issues for you, you have every right to tell everyone at your job about how you feel. Possibly explain your identity. You don't have to give personal information and all that shit, but it absolutely helps if people understand you enough to know why they need to adress you as they/them.

In activism you have to speak on why the way you're treated is important to you. People wont make a move, or understand, unless they see things from a different perspective.

Don't have to stand up and scream, but simply asking people to understand sometimes doesn't help them understand. Especially if they're willing to learn.

Be unapologetically you. And make sure people know what you are, and understand it. That's what stops the problem. 




What strikes me is their comments start out fine. ""I think people's misunderstanding of pronouns is making them invent weird reasons to not respect you."" Sounds fine. But what the boss SHOULD HAVE said next was, ""But don't worry -- I explained that it's totally not the case and reminded them that it gets easier the more they practice."" The boss laid the problem at your feet instead of being a boss. 

Same thing with your coworker. ""Wow. You must have to deal with that everywhere forever."" Yup. But follow up with, ""Now I see what a big difference it can make to have your coworkers, friends and family always use your correct pronouns and even correct others! I'll do my part."" But yeah, instead it sounds like, ""Your life sucks and you can't control it. Bye.""

I'm so sorry that so often advocating for ourselves actually opens us up to more traumatic discourse as people feel free to tell us their weird thoughts. You deserve better. 
I think you can always revisit the conversation with your boss. Tell her you wanted to circle back to the conversation about your pronouns now that you had a chance to think  about it further. 
My boyfriend (who is trans) tells me, always at the wrong times, that I'm gonna have to get thicker skin. It's frustrating. You're not wrong in your feelings about it. I hope things get better for you.
There are definitely days where I have to pick my battles and I don't have the energy to correct folks. Not saying people who are pronoun indifferent aren't valid because they are but for me the reason I came out was to be authentic as possible because not being that way was hurting me. They them is the only thing that feels right. Going full blast and damn the torpedos is not  for everyone though. It comes with it's grievances as you can see. Good luck to you in your transition, I send you courage and love that you can overcome any obstacles in your way. 

Thanks for the support. : )
Even just getting it right 25 percent of the time would make a world of difference to me because it means that people are attempting to remember/use my pronouns correctly. I get that it's scary but honestly, even catching yourself after you mispronoun and then using they/them is fine for me. 

Trans people aren't the pronouns police, I'm sure if you just try to catch your mistakes you'll do just fine."	a3jv76	NonBinary	27	0.97	2018-12-06 03:06:53
Finally got breast forms. Very hard to find dark skinned ones and sadly these dont match my skin tone but they make me so happy		"Tits are great!
-a they with tits too
Nice! Looking good!
I love my breast forms, too.

It's what finally made me realize that I'm actually trans, and actually want hrt.

The best part of my everyday routine is putting them on when I get home, and it's a real bummer taking them off before going to work.
Thanksss
It is a hassle getting them on and off though. I am still unsure if i want boobs for real though.
I use a mastectomy bra for that. 

Not sure if yours are standalone or a full plate.
Mine aren't standalone at all. They are a full plate
Ah, can see how that would be a bit more complicated, yes.
Sad that i can't really do much when it comes to clevage without it looking awkward but still a small price for feeling good with these
You probably could with some heavy duty theatre makeup and some practice.

You'd be surprised how much of a skin tone difference people won't notice if it's blended and gradual enough.
Good idea
Maybe get in touch with your local drag queens, those ladies know how to pull off the most incredible things!

(Not saying what you identify as is or isn't related to what they like to do, I'm just pretty damned impressed with their skil and think it will probably translate pretty welll.)
Also considered. Though i would personally love to look like a goth
Oh, they can do that too!

But I was more thinking about general skills, like how to match skin tones, how to blend silicone, and cleavages are their bread and butter!
Oh i will surely do that then. I will see what i can manage"	rnxt8x	NonBinary	25	0.97	2021-12-24 23:49:49
Hi so I've been questioning for ages, and I identified as NB for a while before going back to identifying as cis but recently all my discomfort with presenting as female has come back and I'm sad and confused and joined this community to feel a bit more validated		it is totally ok to be questioning! you were born this way and you may use any id that fits you. you look cute af btw	ff5ox8	NonBinary	25	0.95	2020-03-08 02:07:41
I hate being called a girl so much omg	"Today I didn't wear my binder cause my shoulder and chest were hurting for a few days and I hate it so much.
I wanna get these little bastards chopped off but I only just got this job so I can't really do surgery yet.

I've been mamed and she/her'd so much today I wanna cry.
I don't even look like a girl I'm so fucking passed.
I'd rather be called a man or just they'd instead.

I wanted to be okay with my chest but I am not. I want them chopped off right now omg.

I don't think I can ever fall in love because right now no one in my life understands or truly sympathizes with me.

I mean sometimes I honestly don't even think the effort to look masculine is worth it when even in the least feminine stuff I wear, I still get called a girl.

I might as well be wearing a frilly dress and makeup. I hate this stupid world. I hate the effort it takes and yet I am not seen as the person I wish I was by anyone.

I feel really sad and upset cause of that. Most people don't see me as a man or just neutrally. Only 1 person today called me a guy :("	"I looked at your picture and I absolutely fucking don't get those people that called you a girl. You look very masculine!

Of course I'm only a stranger on the internet, but sending you a virtual hug! I hope you can get your top surgery soon.
I’ve never been maamed but the word always made me vomit a little in my mouth even before I realized I was NB. The eagerness of the way some people say “sir/ma’am” really grosses me out personally. And the husband/wife drum beat too. Ugh!

Sorry this is happening you are in the thick of it!  You might not be able to see how it could get better but try to stick in there. There are people on this earth that will love you but you don’t know each other yet 💜
i feel the same way. you’re not alone. you know what makes me feel better? i’m enby too with long hair and even though i’ve been on t im real real fem. also my cis brothers have long hair and they get called a girl all the time. like constantly. it doesn’t bother them so much because they are like whatever that’s their problem, and i just kind of try to channel that energy. i know it sucks but you’ll get top surgery eventually. i’m saving up for mine too. think in a year or two when you have it you’ll feel better. i know it sucks. so sorry you got called the wrong pronouns. can you wear a pronoun pin if you’re safe to? 

also i just wanted to say you’re not alone with the whole falling in love thing. i’m single because it feels too stressful for me because i can’t seem to find someone who gets me and understands. but i know there are good people out there, maybe we just haven’t met them yet.
if you need a trans/enby friend to vent to feel free to message me anytime:)
Aww thank you! It means a lot hearing that. Thanks for the virtual hug :)
Yeah I can wear a pronoun pin. My area is pretty leftist and as is my state so I don't feel to unsafe doing that.
My boss/coworkers all call me he or most at least try so I at least get called what I like with them.

I like cutesy stuff, Sanrio, plushies, and makeup and I have such mixed feelings about it sometimes. Like if I enjoy or wear anything feminine I'm not trying hard enough to warrant being called anything that isn't she/her pronouns.

It's been on my mind since my bro said an enby coworker of his gets mad being called a girl even though she presents in a feminine way. I know he's misinformed and cis so he doesn't have the right to question that but it's still something I think about due to anxiety.

But uh yeah tbh I'm hoping to one day find love. I feel insecure about how people see me at times, but I also don't want to ever change or do anything to please anyone into loving me since I've dealt with that before and it ended up in a horrible relationship.

I'm learning to be more kind to myself but sometimes it does take time. (Even when I think I've achieved self love I always have room to grow)
Thanks I appreciate it :)
I like cute stuff too. I know it’s hard but it’s not worth giving up what you like. 

Gender doesn’t equal pronouns. it’s taken me so long to stick to that because obviously regular boring cis people don’t always get it. but If i go by he/him and wear eyeliner i’m not suddenly she/her. if i go by she/her and wear my cowboy hat and my jeans i’m not suddenly he/him. 


I grew up on a horse farm and out west in Arizona. I wore cowboy hats, old boots, jeans. Then, my family moved to New York city. I wore all black, jewelry, made sure to fit in with the crowd. I now love both things. I’m always right in the middle of everything and a lot of people don’t understand me but that’s okay and it’s their loss. People are always going to not understand us because we like what we like and do as we please. we only have one life might as well be ourselves. 

that’s dumb if someone got mad because the coworker doesn’t like being called she/her. have you seen Bella Ramsay from The Last of Us? They go by any pronouns or they/them and are pretty feminine. And they don’t like being called fem names. They demand respect on that as should that person. Yeah i’m aware that people are gonna misgender us especially fem presenting or androgynous people but doesn’t mean we have to like it or accept it. 

i get that, don’t change yourself for someone else. i 100% agree.
also like look at all the 70’s and 80’s rock bands. Soooo much fem stuff and clothes!!!! and most of them are he/him. It’s okay to like “fem” stuff also i think society just forces too many gender rolls on us cause like anyone can like squishmallows and pink and cute things.
Damn you're absolutely right. I think I've been really worried about how people see me and having to dress a certain way in order to be worthy of having my pronouns respected.
I'm glad I opened up about this cause it's been on my mind for a while but I don't know any trans people irl and my cis family gives very meh advice when it comes to that lol.
and i know it’s difficult i don’t blame you for having a hard time with it. i worry about it a lot too. you deserve respect and to have your pronouns respected !!  

also trans friends are really cool to have cause then you get that community and other opinions. I have a few trans/nonbinary friends but not a lot and being around the cissies all the time can be really depressing. and boring. 

same all my family is zero help with advice. (except for my mom she’s alright with the enby thing and she tries) 

is there a lgbt group near u? that may be a good way to make some lgbt friends if you want to!!"	113ghzg	NonBinary	27	1.0	2023-02-16 03:12:15
My little queer heart misses MTL, summertime, and wild hair. I'm bored, sad, and inclined to give myself a mullet... do we have any mullet aficionados with hairdressing advice and hype? ❤️👀		"yooo k's ratchet saloon speaking. I cut my mine and my friend's mullet and her hairdresser friend said it looked meeeeean

I prefer cutting hair when it's dry so I see wtf im doing. exploratory progress haha

I usually shave my sides to just above my hair (but go crazy if you feel like it) and then use thinning shears from the drug store (like 6euros) to trim the hair up to just above my browline to 2-4 cm, depending on how soon I feel like cutting again (same goes for shave). low maintenance is key, imo. for the rest I use thinning shears as well: with the back/tail you can basically just pick some strand with ur fingers (or when your hair is short a friend will do fine) and cut them multiple times, pulling the shears towards the ends as you go. 

with the top there's the possibility of doing a full shave, like the sides, or leave hair longer and by cutting with the shears kind of fuse it in with the back of the head. I usually go 5-7cm bc I love just tousling it or slicking it back when I'm busy. if your hair starts getting really long (and you like it that way) all hair may fuse into a practical knot at the back of the head, while still maintaining a somewhat mullet. this also works for growing it out, i guess. 

love, k
Update: I have a mullet and feel gr8
Thank you!! This is super practical & helpful advice :) I'm definitely going to grab myself a pair of thinning shears!

I don't know how to support someone who has just come out as non-binary and desperately needs it	"Writing this has made me feel like a bigoted idiot and I hope I haven't caused offence. I have always considered myself a very liberal person so it pains me to sound like I'm asking people to explain themselves but I'm hoping my issues aren't uncommon.   

Someone I have known my whole life came out as non-binary to only me and all I want is to provide support in any way I can. For now am going to reference as 'her' because she hasn't indicated otherwise yet - I don't think she knows. 

She told me a few weeks ago and at the time I didn't interrogate her because I thought I would be able to gain my own understanding online. In the past I have just accepted the term exists and not thought too deeply about it because it's none of my business. But weeks of extensive research on health sites later, I am actually feeling more confused. 

She is never reserved or private with me; so I don't know whether she wants to be asked questions or if it is inappropriate of me. Her tone and attitude have kind of suggested to me that she isn't ready to talk in depth about it but I am unsure if this is the case or if she is hurt due to my lack of questions. Telling her how much I love and support her is beginning to feel like empty words. Her family dynamic is so difficult and all I want is to be there in any way I can.

We are close because we were the extreme tomboys at an all girls school and have always had almost identical profiles in terms of our interests and disposition. In the 10 years since school, I have lived openly as bi and she is a lesbian who has never dated much. 

I think I am feeling confused because we are so similar. Is it that she identifies with masculinity but not in the same way a FTM does? I don't indentify with the gender norms but I also don't feel any attachment to the concept of gender in that I need to address it. I am not immune to the thought that this could also easily describe me so I am searching for the distinction.  Obviously I'm not going to bring this up with her because it's not about me.

Given the early stages of this, is it possible that she hasn't quite finished her journey yet and this one step in the process to transitioning to a man? I also can't ask her this because it sounds fucking ridiculous but the reality is that I don't know if people who end up with a binary transition all know exactly how they indentify from go or if there is sometimes a phase of experimenting or self-discovery prior. Like she doesn't know everything yet except that she does not exist within the scope of a cis-female?

Is it that she does actually indentify with the binary genders but which one is dependent on situation or the day?

So far I have just created space for her to direct chat any way she wants and have reinforced that I accept her in every form, am committed to offer any support and ready to bat for her if she needs it. But it doesn't feel like enough. 

I am her best friend and I want to be there for her in the way she actually needs and not the way I assume she needs. Because of who she is, I would have predicted that the realisation and sharing would make her really happy. So I can't tell if her negativity/sadness is because she is unsure about what this means to her, or if she knows exactly what it means and overwhelmed by what comes next.

I am at the stage now that I want to gently encourage her to talk about what it in whatever capacity she likes but I am worried about triggering her and being pushy. 

So I thought I'd throw a hail Mary here in case the details I have offered lend themselves to any insight I am missing. 

Reading this, I already hate myself so please be gentle."	">Someone I have known my whole life came out as non-binary to only me and all I want is to provide support in any way I can. For now am going to reference as 'her' because she hasn't indicated otherwise yet - I don't think she knows.

Ask her what pronouns she prefers. i can't speak for every enby but most of us appreciate it when people care.

The nebulous distinction between being enby and just not conforming to gender norms. what matters is that it's important to your friend.

>Given the early stages of this, is it possible that she hasn't quite finished her journey yet and this one step in the process to transitioning to a man?

There are definitely enbies who end up transitioning to the opposite gender. There are many who don't. Assume this does not apply to her.

>Is it that she does actually indentify with the binary genders but which one is dependent on situation or the day?

The word for this is genderfluid. Not all non-binary people are gender fluid.

>I am her best friend and I want to be there for her in the way she actually needs and not the way I assume she needs.

It's not just your reaction she has to deal with. She also has other friends and family who may be taking this differently (or she's not yet out to them and struggling with if/how) to do that.
Maybe invite her to hang out and do any of the many things you have in common? Ask her about her hobbies or for fashion advice, and then start talking about gender norms and how it affects the two of you. Then ask if using she/her pronouns with her is okay and let her know you’d gladly do anything to make her feel understood.

There isn't a unique right way to proceed, but generally speaking, just showing support and making clear you care is an excellent way to start.

Also, maybe telling your friend what you wrote here is just what you need.
Thank you for your feedback here. I should've been more clear about a couple of things:

I did ask her about pronouns when she told me initially but she pivoted away from the question. It's one of the reasons I'm unsure about asking questions. It will be one of the first things I will bring up when I initiate dialogue. 

I know for a fact that I'm the only person she has told to date. I didn't even consider that she is worried of my reaction; that's a terrible oversight. 

What I meant to say is that I'm not sure if her very out-of-character attitude towards the subject is completely from anxiety about telling people. If it is mostly related to ongoing turmoil about her identity, it feels cruel to bring attention to it.
So it's the paradox of wanting to be supportive to someone while respecting their boundaries. Not just a gender or even an LGBT thing- I think everyone goes through things like that.

Let her know you're here if she wants to talk, then suggest an activity together if she says no."	rle8xk	NonBinary	24	0.91	2021-12-21 13:03:18
so this happened...	"Today as I was leaving Home Depot a dog came up to me and I said, ""Hi, buddy!"" and petted it. The dog's owner, a child of maybe 8 or 9, said, ""That's not a buddy, she's a girl."" as they passed me. I just said, ""Girls can be buddies too."" But it really floored me that this young kid had already decided that ""buddy"" was a male gendered term and that I had therefore misgendered their dog. I know it is sometimes used that way, but buddy just means friend, and to me, all dogs are friends. And why the fuck can't any gender be a buddy? Language is weird and I'm sad that this kid is already thinking inside the same bullshit binary box. Anyway, thanks for letting me rant and I hope you're having an excellent night/day/whatever time it is where you are ❣️"	"As a non binary parent, I have never pushed binary gender rolls or traditional gender conformity on to my children. But my son and my oldest daughter both are very traditional in their perception of gender rolls. This is a conversation I could see you having with my son even though it is a constant conversation in our home that words like buddy or handsome or pretty don’t belong to a specific gender. So please don’t be quick to judge the parents on this, there are many influences on children where they can learn this way of thinking.
that's so annoying! and a lot of parents tend to push that kind of box onto their children, which is sad
odd...in Canada anyone can be ""buddy"" ...it is typically thought of as more masculine, like ""lad""
That is definitely true that kids are getting those messages from society in general, I did not mean to sound as if I was blaming the parents. It's just sad that kids are still getting those messages from society at large. I'm glad there are parents like you out there sending a different message!"	xxnn09	NonBinary	25	1.0	2022-10-07 02:47:47
What are people's thoughts on self hating jokes when not out?	Yesterday I came out to my manager under circumstances that I was annoyed by another coworker saying transphobic things. We had a little bit of an intervention and during this my coworker said their behavior was because they are trans but are not out in public and have hated themselves since they were younger because their father didn't approve and threatened them. I've been feeling conflicted because while I understand the feeling and have dealt with it in the past I still feel as though if you're not out and make transphobic jokes that are about yourself, you're going to hurt other people. I still feel angry about the jokes being made but there's this other feeling now that just feels sad and like maybe I shouldn't have said anything.	"Making other people's lives harder because you're still closeted isn't cool. I hate that they are in a situation where they don't have the comfort to be themselves. That doesn't give them a pass to perpetuate transphobic dialogue though
As RuPaul said, if you can't love yourself how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
It is a sad situation but it's still not cool to outsource their internal stuff like that. I'd say the exact same thing about someone with any other mental health thing going on where they wanted to deal with it in that manner. I had a legitimately depressed coworker who also made constant jokes about being depressed and yes it was sad, but it was also really inappropriate to dump that on all the rest of us day after day. And if hadn't been so obvious that he was talking about himself, it'd have been way worse.
Lateral cisheterosexism is still harmful. You did the right thing to stand up for yourself. If only this person cared about other peoples feelings as much as you do, perhaps they wouldnt be as quick to harm others with their words.
Self-hating jokes also just perpetuate their own self-hatred in addition to hurting everyone else. It's a coping mechanism but it's not a healthy one.
I think there's a difference between if they said it to shift blame for their actions or if they said it to share their perspective and seek common ground.

You're well within your rights to expect a transphobia-free workplace, even when that transphobia comes in the form of self-hating ""jokes."" They're also, in a way, within their rights to process their pain and trauma publicly in a way that feels right to them, without sharing details about themselves that they're not ready to. When someone is reaching out in the only way they know how, it seems cruel to shut them down. But the person they reach out to doesn't have to be you.

It sounds like a situation that's got to be solved on a personal basis rather than an ideological one. Ideologically, all public speech has consequences that each person must deal with, but I would value a harmonious workplace and community over being right.
No offence but if your reaction to being in the closet is to bully other people, you can take a long walk.
I'm sorry you experienced this. Honestly I think you're justified in feeling hurt by their behaviour and you don't need to feel sorry for them. People are responsible for how they treat others. A decent human being generally will not abuse other people even if they are unhappy about something in their life. You do not have to socialize with this person if they have been harmful to you. Sometimes you feel obligated to talk to someone out of pity. Don't pity them. Live your life and let them figure out their own problems. This example isn't quite the same scenario as a toxic coworker but might have some relevance. My friend had a partner with issues, and they were very abusive toward my friend. They stayed together because my friend felt bad for this person despite how awful they were. But they finally broke up and my friend's wellbeing improved significantly.
Honestly, it doesn’t matter if it’s okay to say or not. The person made you uncomfortable and that’s all that should matter
While i get where those people are coming from - its still shitty. 

To themselves, yes, (which is why they do it) but they do not get a pass bc they also still affect others with that kinda talk.
I guess to me, the thing is that it's not quite ""publicly"" because coworkers are such a captive audience. Yes everyone is a person and everyone needs support sometimes, but if this is how this person chooses to process things, there's no real room for the others to choose not to be the ones supporting them *besides* telling them to stop. Even just passively listening is a burden they didn't ask for. Remarks like that can wriggle into a person's brain and pollute their thoughts even if they're not trans themselves. I *know* that's a harsh thing to say about someone's pain, but maintaining a firm boundary on ""no hate speech at work"" seems like the only fair solution. It does not preclude finding some other way to help this person, it just defines acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.
>thing is that it's not quite ""publicly"" because coworkers are such a captive audience

I just used publicly to mean speech where others can hear you, but I kind of feel like all speech has a captive audience when you put it that way. I can't exactly choose not to understand english or not to process written word once I've seen it.

>if this is how this person chooses to process things

We don't know if this person is committing an active choice to process things this way. I don't think most people experience a sense of choice in reacting to pain and trauma, and [not everyone experiences the same degree of choice in their lives at all.](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/What%20is%20Locus%20of%20Control%20by%20James%20Neill.pdf) It would be great to redirect them to other options and empower them to choose a way of coping that's less disruptive to others, but that is generally not the responsibility or role of a coworker, and it can be quite invasive to express an opinion on the personal health and belief system of someone you only know casually, especially considering the person was not even publicly out and was approached to do so.

>there's no real room for the others to choose not to be the ones supporting them besides telling them to stop

I don't see a connection between not supporting someone and having to tell them to stop. You didn't tell me to stop saying this or delete my comment even though you disagree with me, and I'm not saying that to you either.

Productively voicing disagreement is one way to decline support. Though I don't think the situation is to this point, a person can quit the job, they can pursue reassignment to another position, location, schedule without contact with this person. In many jobs you can wear headphones or go about your day not interacting with a specific person. It's usually the job of management to ensure the best outcome for their team, but that's almost always for the good of the business and not the individuals involved. One might say that the health of the individuals involved falls to us, collectively.

>maintaining a firm boundary on ""no hate speech at work""

I agree that this is the only solution from a legal and business perspective. If I was the manager in this situation, that would be the clear course of action for me. But it may be difficult to create and/or enforce a specific policy against self-hating jokes without micromanaging, while maintaining a functioning environment where people are not afraid of their coworkers ""telling on"" them, without threatening the employment of the other person.

But I'm not the manager and the only point of contact to the people in this situation is OP, and I'm assuming since OP had to contact a manager, they do not have authority to control what speech takes place in the workplace. They can only control their personal actions.

>seems like the only fair solution

There are other interpretations of fair, like neither person being limited in what they're allowed to say about themselves. There are other values to consider besides ""fair,"" like ""accepting"" ""harmonious."" Those values aren't any better or worse than each other, they're just weighted differently by different people or cultures.

Going along with the theme of choice you've introduced... sometimes we may choose to stay open to others and hear what they have to say, even though it's uncomfortable or doesn't seem equal to us; like how I'm choosing to engage with this conversation, even though it also causes pain and presents a burden for me, because my opinions come from a culture and experience that is marginalized in the general Western society I live in.

>It does not preclude finding some other way to help this person, it just defines acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.

We don't know the exact nature of the jokes, we won't know the personal identity or journey of every person we meet, and we don't have the power to help every individual who uses self deprecating humor to cope with pain. I don't recommend any specific action for OP, because that's up to them on what they want to do and what they need in their life, including limiting exposure to any transphobic speech, but in general I do recommend an approach of [meeting others where they are.](https://wildsimplejoy.com/meet-them-where-they-are/)

I wouldn't use this kind of humor with others whom I do not know their opinion on it, because of the strength of the reaction seen here, but my partners and I regularly make jokes about the racism we experience.  I feel seen and validated when they acknowledge the judgments society makes about me and people like me. I feel accepted regardless of those oppressive judgments, which in real life will never stop, and I feel prepared to meet real discrimination. There's something freeing about knowing your pain, your violation, the violence that you see everywhere is not a dirty secret for only you to carry. It's hard growing up and knowing you can't mention major aspects of your life without people looking away or changing their tone. There's something loving and understanding I get from the comfort of exchanging a jab with a like-minded person, that I don't get from someone denouncing racism but afraid to discuss it.

It feels weird that there are people waiting in the wings who would judge me for making such a connection with a peer, or that we would judge the person in the post for seeking such a connection, even though it was misguided, in the wrong situation or to the wrong person.

TL;DR I think OP said it well, ""If you're not out and make transphobic jokes that are about yourself, you're going to hurt other people."" We feel a sense of anger and hurt when we're exposed to harmful ideas by others, but there's also sadness and pain for the circumstances that produced those hurtful words. What's important to me is the well-being and freedom of all parties, promoting mutual understanding of others' perspectives, and what an individual can do with those conflicted feelings, rather than the question of whether it's acceptable to make self-hating jokes and how that should be enforced.  The major inconsistency between your and my perspectives is collectivism vs individualism."	10n2sul	NonBinary	23	0.94	2023-01-28 01:47:49
If you want to cut your hair, do it	"Hey all,
I posted on here a bit on a throwaway, but y’all are so awesome I made a real account. Like a lot of folks, I posted on here about how I was nervous to buzz my hair.

To anyone who feels the same DO IT. I spend a long time being anxious over my hair. I knew I wanted it buzzed, but was concerned about how people in my life would react. I buzzed today, and feel a thousand percent better. Even if I might feel sad or anxious that someone doesn’t like it, I know it will be way better than disliking myself every time I look in the mirror.

Wear your hair however you love it! Of course with the caveat that you will be safe if you express yourself this way!

Stay beautiful friends."	"Welcome to the club!
see i'm not worried about how people would react, so much as i worry i wouldn't do a good job of it and would have to wear a hat at work and possibly explain to my boss why i'm toqued in such nice weather :P i definitely want to chop it off but i'm not sure i have the tools to do it right...

Anti-NonBinary YouTube videos make me sad 😞	"I stumbled across some anti-non-binary YouTube videos claiming that nonbinary does not exist. I try to watch things like this so that I can get an idea of why people are so against non-binary and transgender because their viewpoint is not something I really understand. 
The ignorance portrayed in these videos is just insane. The most common thing that is said is that people who are non-binary are narcissistic and are ‘too concerned with feelings.’ 
The worst part of this is that the people making these videos obviously have never spent time with someone who is trans or non-binary. 
It’s so disheartening to be reminded that people still refuse to admit that they don’t understand, and are unwilling to actually learn. 
The worst part is that most of these people making videos claim to be educated yet obviously don’t rely on primary sources, such as, i don’t know… an actual person identifying as non-binary!
😭I’m just so tired… 
I feel like everyone on this subreddit puts up with misgendering on a daily basis. 
I wish we had a louder voice and could clear up some of this ignorance."	"I feel this... all of this. For me, it's best to just avoid those videos and avoid contact with transphobic YouTubers. I don't wanna bother trying to educate those people when they show no interest in being open to learn. I don't wanna try sticking up for myself in the comments and just end up feeding the trolls who I know are patrolling the comment sections for someone to have a flame war with. (does anyone say ""flame wars"" anymore?) and I don't wanna get more upset by listening to any more of their transphobia.
The worse part is, these videos and other protests are often made by people who's life has been and will be influenced by NB and transgender people for a total of 0%
My advice is don't bother watching these. These people aren't going to have anything valid or interesting to say, and it's just going to upset you.

If you wouldn't take someone's advice, don't take their criticism, either."	t1n9xd	NonBinary	24	0.92	2022-02-26 03:51:23

Wisdom appreciated 💕 (20FTM?)	"So I went on T and came out as trans masc. I’ve never stopped loving dresses and cute femme clothes. Lately I’ve started presenting femme in private (around my bf and in my room). I really want to be able to be in public wearing a cute ass dress but my pronouns stay firmly at he/him. I just don’t think I’m fully a dude. I’m like a little guy but not a man? Absolutely not a girl. 

Very satisfied with all pros of testosterone. Recently slightly shaky with the idea of top surgery and a bit of sadness with the breast tissue damage from binding that has caused some major sagging :/ I won’t be worrying about surgery for a couple years though.

Anyway, basically, I just want to dress however the fuck I want (femme, masc, neither) but still be labeled he/him and not confuse my nieces and bf’s siblings by switching how I present constantly.

Now I cannot emotionally handle she/her or the tough questions from kids right now so I’ve decided if I am gender-fluid or non-binary, I will only express my femme side in private for now for my own mental health.

That’s really my story I suppose. Any sort of insight or wisdom or even just words of encouragement are super appreciated 💕 Luv u all hope you’re well

Edit: grammar mistakes"	"Gender isn't what you wear, or how you present,  You are whatever you identify as, and that may change many times in your life. Experiment, Have fun, Don't take it so seriously. It's like sexuality, It's a spectrum.    


On the topic of Fashion:

Wear whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want. You're 20! be cutting edge and daring and outrageous! it's the PERFECT time to do it.  But part of dressing in avant-garde or even counter-cultural fashion is having thick skin, That is just the reality of it.  I'll rock a beard and a sequin black dress, with my face beat for the gods, and I'll absolutely slay in it. but It is a performance, and I expect it will get a spectrum of responses, as all good art does.   


On the Topic of Gender

I've been out and playing with gender and gender presentation since I was a preteen, in my 30's now, and my biggest bit of advice is to find a way to hold strangers to absolutely no standard when it comes to your pronouns, gender, etc.  It sounds shitty, but It's saved me a hell of a lot of heartache.  It's just not worth your effort to pay attention or care how people who don't know you refer to you, they have no way of being right, even if they guess they have (at best) a 33.3% chance of MAYBE being right. Focus on the people who know you, and care for you. that's all that really matters at the end of the day.    


I try to think about it like this.  and old Ex of mine (CIS male) had long hair and was thin, He also had a full beard and superhero shoulders, He got misgendered DAILY from behind in a town of like 2000 people, at the grocery store he worked at (As well as every bar we ever went to).  So If it happened to him, Of course it's gonna happen to me when I am deliberately fucking with what has been perpetuated as the ""norm""  


  
In short,  Fuck everyone else, Do what you want,  Stop worrying about strangers, If you don't wanna answer questions from kids, Don't.
Nate Stevensen, who was the showrunner for the Netflix reboot of She-Ra, is transmasc, and often points to his strange *attachment* to some aspects of femininity such as in this [adorable comic](https://open.substack.com/pub/gingerhaze/p/victorias-secret?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).  He uses he/him pronouns and chose a masculine name because, as he puts it, ""[...this is how I want to interact with a world that demands we choose one of two.](https://www.imfineimfine.com/p/nate).""

All of which is to say that you can be a he/him if that is what works, and you can do this while wearing a dress and liking some (or a lot of) ""girly"" things.  Nonbinary doesn't automatically make you a they/them, it just means you don't find that you fit wholly into one side or the other is all.  I'm a transfem who prefers she/her and has a feminine name who, when dressed to the 9's, will absolutely wear a suit rather than a gown and who will always love a long trudge through wild spaces.
Whatever gender an individual indentifies with, they should dress however they want. Of course, it's good to understand that some people get confused and may question or assume wrong things. 

Best wishes, i hope you'll be able to dress however you'd like outside the private space at some point, it's great that you're listening to yourself.
It's okay to keep parts of yourself private for your own well-being. I'm in a spot right now where I'm most comfortable keeping my gender identity to myself in some contexts, because it's tender and fragile and I know I can't handle any questions. That's okay! Like you, I need some time to explore this for myself, without an audience.  
I stumbled across a concept recently that I really liked, which is the reframing of ""coming out"" to ""letting in.""  The idea is that your gender and sexuality is a special, private part of yourself that others are PRIVILEGED to be invited to share with you. There's this connotation with ""coming out"" that someone who is not ""out"" is hiding and ashamed, but that's not necessarily true. You are the one with power in this situation, who gets to ""let others in"" to this part of yourself that brings you joy and fulfillment. You do not owe anyone authenticity, and I admire you for protecting your peace. You can let others in when you are ready, and your identity doesn't have to be on display in order to be valid.
You are who you are and you are not alone.

Pronoun badges can really help clear up ambiguity when your presentation and identity seem at odds with one another to the outside world
Hey check out r/FtMFemininity
Hell yeah do it!!
Thank you so much. You’re so kind to type this!! I’m gonna throw this is my notes so I can make some changes to my thought patterns to care less about strangers’ opinions and more about the acceptance of my loved ones. I, again, super appreciate the comment. I do think this will help me with my transition/experimenting even later on if not now. I hope you have a great day 💜
I’m not OP but those comics made me feel so seen, thank you for sharing them. I really needed that. As a transmasc/ftm who is dabbling in and struggling with my femininity and what it all “means”, it is so so comforting to see other people who feel similarly.
Be good to yourself, Be good to the people who are good to you, and you'll be fine. we often wrap a lot of negative feelings up in our gender, feelings of rejection, and shame, and worrying if strangers will clock us/ notice something. But, It doesn't and shouldn't be this way. Celebrate this very incredible chance to get to define who you are, It's the ultimate freedom. Let your Gender be a celebration of the things you love about yourself, worry about putting a label on it later, or let people who need to label things do it for you, You'll always be you regardless of the validation of others."	10lufcb	NonBinary	24	0.97	2023-01-26 15:29:38
"""feminine man"" to non-binary!"	"A nice little story 😇:

As a kid, from when I was in middle school, I could see that my preferences weren't the same as those of any other boy's. But that didn't mean that I wished that I were a girl either. I used to be a 'model student' and a loner. 

I barely had a friend or two, so I didn't feel pressured to be like ""the others"" and embraced my emotions and accepted that I was a ""feminine man"" 🙂. I was teased, but I didn't give a crap. (I did feel sad 😔 , though). 

A year ago, a friend came out as non-binary, making me want to check out what that term meant. 

OH WHAT JOY I felt! 🎉🥰

The joy was knowing that there were so many others like me, each with their own unique expression, and that there are people who ACCEPT me, unlike my conservative neighborhood (not in US). 

I used to be a ""feminine man""; now I'm non-binary!❤️

Today I found out that Brazilian folklore has a shapeshifter	I was scrolling through folklore legends and found one about Acutipupu, an entity that can swap between a masc and femme appearance, it's just sad this legend isn't very known. But at least as a non-binary person of indigenous descent I feel extremely cool knowing there are more shapeshifter out there!	"O foda é que eu não sabia kkkkk

Trans Day Of Remembrance and feeling pretty terrible	"So as most of you probably know, today is the International Transgender Day of Remembrance, where we remember the trans people of all identities who have died at the hands of others or themselves over the past year.

A couple of the murders this year were near me, as were some of the suicides. 

I feel so sad and genuinely grieve for the people we've lost. It feels like my heart's been ripped out, every year. Every time I hear of another death. And it terrifies me. Any day, I could become one of next year's statistics. I've gone through a lot of harassment and rejection already as a result of being trans/nonbinary, including incidents where my physical safety was threatened or compromised. All it takes is for one person to get a little angrier than usual by my existence, and that's it. I'm scared to wear my binder, I NEVER use public bathrooms (did it before, *miSTAKE*), I sure asf don't talk to people or tell anyone.

This is just kind of a rant I guess, idk really. But yeah, TDoR today and it hits me hard. "	"I feel that. I’m sorry. Lots of love today. Here’s a great screamo song. [GLOSS- Trans Day of Revenge](https://open.spotify.com/user/kapplerm/playlist/73gKxHOBoIyGMUXGzSwHpf?si=oRfikHsMSdSI8QxEQegwIQ)

People disrespecting my identity in fights	"I am agender and prefer they/them pronouns, but he/him is also fine. I’m from Germany, so sadly I can’t really choose they/them as my prominent pronouns although I identify with them 100%.

Yesterday I had a rather rough discussion with a classmate on WhatsApp. I addressed myself with the male version (derjenige) and she straight up came back addressing me with the female version (die Einzige).
I don’t understand why people think it’s okay to just use the wrong pronouns for me. It happens especially when people are mad at me. They slip up with my dead name, my pronouns and all. It just feels like they still think of me as this other person and it feels like a secret weapon to use against me in a fight. They don’t even realize that they loose the entire argument by using that line.

But to be honest nobody in my life except for my partner really uses the right pronouns for me. They just avoid saying them to my face. I’m growing tired at knowing they all think of me as a girl still.
Y’all have some tips on how to deal with this?"	"No advice unfortunately but I know how you feel. Also German here. I also cringe when I‘m in male mode and I‘m still called by my female name and they call me 'she'. I don’t want to blame any people who you argue with but it seems to me that they either slip because they’re not fully accustomed to your new name and preferred pronouns so that they use it without thinking or they really want to hurt you and think they know how. If I were you I wouldn’t continue the fight the moment they begin to deadname your or use the wrong pronouns and tell them they can come back as soon as they are willing to respect your person.
These people are just making fools of themselves by using such low-hanging fruit in a fight. Really? Disrespecting someone's identity to prove you're the right one?? You're just proving how you're an asshole. Disregard those people. It is more important to them to win a fight and insult you then to come to an agreement, which is what arguing should be about.

I'm sorry this is happening to you tho. It stings to be constantly invalidated. It helps to find good people who respect you even if they don't like you.

At least this way around the person insulting you just proves they're an asshole. The first time a person very close to me used my new name, it was during an argument unrelated to me being non-binary. And that insult stung. It was directed and purposeful. And a bitch move"	z8kzgb	NonBinary	21	0.94	2022-11-30 07:30:35
I told my wife today....	"I couldn’t talk to her in person because I knew she would be upset. She has a vision for our life that doesn’t include me not fitting into a gender shaped box. I do the 9-5 office job with polo shirts and slacks but when I think of myself that’s not what I see. There’s some of that there in the mix but there’s so much else I never got the chance to live and experience and feel.

I told her I felt ugly and disgusting a lot of the time and that I sometimes felt like I wanted to cut my way out of this fleshy prison I was given. I want to physically express that I don’t fit in a check one or the other box with regards to my gender and that I felt like the boy I was forced to be and the girl I wished I had listened to a little more were constantly fighting it out inside of me instead of being aligned as I wanted them to be.

I’m still very sad because while she didn’t respond with anger or name calling or anything like that, she did respond with the cold shoulder and no reaction at all. She said “what can we do to fix this? Do you want to be a girl? More gender fluid? We can’t have you hurting yourself over this”. And just like that I became a problem to solve instead of a person looking for some expression of love, some reassurance that she still loved me, that our vows still mattered. 

Maybe she’ll come around and things will be better but I needed to share somewhere so the thoughts and feelings don’t just sit there burning a hole through me.

Hi, my name is El and I’m non-binary."	"I don't know your wife, obviously, but I can tell you that trying to work out ways to make each other happier is one of the ways that my husband and I express our love. 

Is it possible that she didn't bring up any issue with how this might affect your marriage because she doesn't think it will? Maybe she had no problem with it, and didn't realize you needed that reassurance because you already felt safe enough to talk about it. 
Update

Things are much better now. We’ve had some good conversations and she understands where I’m coming from. I think she was worried about the impact on our families and the kids we were planning to have. But we’ve gotten to a good place.

Thanks for your support!
Hi El, thanks for sharing and I'm glad you were able to take such a big step. Hopefully your wife will become more actively supportive and accepting, once she has time to process what you're going through and her own feelings about it. No matter what, you're worthy of support, acceptance and love.
Congratulations on coming out! Can you tell your wife that once she's taken the time she needs to process, you could really use some emotional support? Maybe offer to work through it with a trans-friendly couples therapist if you think that would be helpful?
Obviously I wasn't there for the reaction or tone, but your wife seems like she wants to be supportive.  If she hasn't been around the queer community much, maybe she doesn't realize the tone and words used could be heard as hurtful.  Just keep talking, and don't suppress yourself!!!!!
If you need support, a lot of us at the r/TransLater sub have similar stories
This was my thought too. Something I've always found to be expected in 'masculine' types is exactly that reaction. The problem solving rather than the reassuring and comforting which is supposed to be 'feminine'. Maybe your wife is a problem solver and the two of you being together is a small way in which you've been expressing your gender all along, by choosing her. When you're able, telling her how to fix it would start with reassurance from her might be a great step? "	9bfq3h	NonBinary	20	0.93	2018-08-30 02:28:48

Bullied TW: nonbinary phobia	"So last night I (23 NB AFAB) went to a highschool football game because I have a sibling in the band and wanted to watch their performance at halftime. I was standing below the bleachers alone waiting for someone and this highschooler comes up to me and starts talking to me and I was really confused but wasn't going to be rude and ignore him. He said hi and I said ummmm hello? And he just kept trying to get me to talk. And when he heard my obviously female sounding voice he turns to his group of friends who I hadn't even noticed were watching us and goes ""It's a girl guys"" and the just all started laughing. 

It was horrible. It felt like I got transported back to being a high school student and never fitting in.

I felt obviously embarrassed. Sad. Discouraged. Angry. All the bad things. 

But I will say that after reflecting on it, for way longer than I should of, I realized they couldn't tell. They were debating my gender and while that is like a super not ok thing to do to someone, they couldn't figure it out and that...well that was exciting. 

So obviously they are rude and disrespectful and made me feel like poop. And the use of the word ""it"" really was upsetting. In a weird way...it was also kind of validating to know that they couldn't decide if I was afab or amab😂"		qndq36	NonBinary	21	0.94	2021-11-05 15:35:43
"""You're not a dude, right?"" (and other femby rantings)"	"Disclosure: AFAB, sapphic queer, generally chapstick-femme presenting/passing

I love football. I've always loved football. I wear a Patriots shirt every Sunday during the season. Today, I'm at a new bar, shooting shit, drinking Bloody Marys and having a good time. The guy next to me and I hit it off and we continue chatting sporadically throughout the game. He's impressed by my knowledge of football, invites me to his place to ""watch the next game"" and I accept. We go to his neighbor's, watch ball there, head back to his place to get more intimate and after I flip him after having me pinned, he asks... ""Wait... you're not a dude, right?""

I froze. I got off of him. I was in a state of shock I've never been in before. I'm proudly out as bi, but my gender is more of my own subject at the moment. The wave of hatred as ""you're femme presenting but know about sports so  you must be trans"" hurt. The "" you're a \~lady\~ but are obvs masc enough to be a ""man"" which makes this ""\~gay\~"" hurts. Being semi-clocked was the most painful, hurtful thing I could have imagined. This was **not** flattering. This **WAS** transphobic.

**MY GENDER IS MY GENDER**. THERE ARE MOMENTS I LOVE IT AND MOMENTS I HATE IT. But you, *cishet of all cishets*, don't get to make me feel like this. You see my masc (the few among many) and disown me for it because your own masculinity is so fragile. My femme means nothing and my femme means EVERYTHING. I am raging. I am hurting. I am mad. I am sad.  I am so fucking rattled that I don't know which way is up. But that being said: Fuck you, transphobic piece of shit. I was living my best life. My football team won. My jersey has never fit me because of my physical build. I AM STILL QUEER. 

My passion for football is not my gender. My lack of makeup is not my gender. My orientation is not my gender. IF YOU'RE INTO ME, THEN BE INTO ME. If I'm too ""one of the guys"" for you, don't bring me home. If I'm not high-femme babe enough for you, don't bring me home. But if you can have a good time with me for 3 hours, chill for a minute more, then freak out when you've got *a bad bitch who knows what's up* about to ride you like ANYTHING... YOU'RE GONE. 

This has never happened to me before. I've never felt it. Dysphoria rears its head but mainly is kept in check (and has very fortunately never happened in a sexual encounter...prior to this.). I'm bi. I'm queer. And suddenly, I'm (more than my usual dose of ) unsettled by dating cishet men. Today was hard. Tonight will be hard. And I am so very lost.

&#x200B;

My queer siblings are people I will always go to bat for, but in this moment I find myself benched, winded, and on the DL. If you've got a spare moment of love, I will hold it tightly."	"Feeling your pain radiating right through the screen.  Just got back from hanging with other trans folk and it is so healing.  I’m not feeling very articulate at the moment so I won’t try to do anything other than say you aren’t alone and I’m glad you came here and sought out community because that is the way forward.  Sending all the warmth I can muster.  Hope you can feel it.
You are a badass. Sending love, because you are awesome, and deserve better.
It will be OK. That is a really horrible thing for him to say. *hugs*

I feel its hilarious conservatives presenting themselves as stupid, just to try and defy us	"You know, since Demi Lovato had their coming out I've seen many videos about them, be it through Sam Collins, Jammi Dodger, or through my own ""research"".

All of the Conservative platforms I've seen state the same strawman arguments, that not only miss the point, but are painting the Podcaster as dumb.

Like a few examples:

Demi Lovato former has identified as Pansexuell, now (they(putting they in brackets because the Podcasters don't use the right pronouns)) no longer identify as Pan, but changed it to nonbinary.
Ah yes, are you a man or a women? I'm heterosexual.
Coz sexuality and gender identity are the same thing.

Demi now identifies as nonbinary, which is stupid, because you can't be two people.
Fist of all. NONbinary. Even if it meant to identify as multiple people, it definetly wouldn't be two. Also that just is a strawman, its not what nonbinary is.

(They) identify as multiple people, so (they) are schizophrenic.
That's not schizophrenia though. What you mean is Did, but you wouldn't know that because obviously you have no clue what you are talking about.

Nobody cares about pronouns.
Hence why I made a whole video about it.

They want us to fundamentally change our language.
A quick Google search shows singular they (not only referring to unknown people, as Shakespeare referred to a mother as they) were around since the 1400th.

Now I read this to you, let's see if you can follow this.
(proceeds to read an article about Demi Lovato using the correct pronouns) That's just confusing. Did you follow? I couldn't follow, and I read it!
Now that's just sad you can't comprehend your own language, bud.

Now I don't care about Demi as a person. I don't listen to their music, I don't follow news about them, I kinda forgot their existence. But using the right pronouns in the few instances I do talk about them really isn't hard at all."	"[deleted]
I just think it defeats the point they would paint such a stupid picture of themself just to make their point.

I know, but it marks all of them as stupid. Here they are comparing Masks to the yellow Star (that comparison alone - even if you ignore the dramatic topic - doesn't work, as it was the Jews who had to wear the star.

I often feel like posting here, but hesitate	"I have been feeling incredibly down recently related to trans-stuff. People in this continuity are probably the only ones that actually would understand what I am going through, but every time I write a text to talk about it I stop mid-way and delete everything that I have written. I don't really know why I do this. Maybe I don't want to burden other people, or maybe I fear that no one would care about my problems anyway. Have you hesitated to post in this subreddit? Would you consider it bad to post sad stories here?

I’ve done this so many times.  But sometimes it turns out that you just needed to write out your frustrations and confusions.
I had written something different before but then I did exactly what you are talking about in this post. Lol
I can honestly say that i’ve felt a little hesitant while posting to a transmen sub than this one. I even got shit on the ftm forum but all it could ever be is someone else’s opinion. I cant allow words to hurt me. Not with society already unintentionally hurting me with this stereotypical sex traits already doing the most damage. Im def. not going to allow someone from a shared category stop me from posting and i dont believe you should either. It feels good to express one’s self even without a like or comment... 
Your reply made me feel better. Now I know that more people than just me do this.

Since you said that you had not come out yet I urge you to make a few posts to get some questions or thoughts you have answered. I did that myself and it helped me a lot :)

I didn’t think deadnaming would bother me so much but wow I’m exhausted	"I’m spending the weekend with one of my best friends and her kids. The kids are very young (1 and 3) and the oldest knows me as my deadname. Their mom is super supportive, uses and introduces me with my preferred name/pronouns, and has started to get the three year old to understand that I’m the same person with a different name in a really great way. 

But the kid is 3 and hasn’t made the connection so I’ve been deadnamed most of the days. I didn’t think it was gonna be as exhausting as it has been. It’s made me feel like I made a dumb decision…or that it’s gonna be too hard to get people to change what the call me. Sometimes makes me sad to hear my old name in a fun and good context and feel like I’m leaving something behind, even tho I’m still me? 

I’ve also been very tired bc children are exhausting so maybe it’s just exhaustion anxiety coming out….anyway Thanks for reading!"	"Oh deadnaming is hell for me
No, it's legitimately tough with kids that age! Even four-year-olds generally do substantially better. My child changed their name publicly after kindergarten and a couple of the kids they knew then still struggle at 6-7 years old, but that's without concerted parental effort: once a parent started really reinforcing it and insisting that the new name is correct, the 4+ group generally came around quickly.
Your feelings are totally valid. Kids are tough, because at that age a complex concept like gender isn't easy to comprehend, especially in a binary society that broadcasts a totally different message. And even though at three they're starting to have the ability to empathize, psychologically they're still unable to fully understand how their actions can result in hurt for others. 

I'm a solutions-oriented person, so ignore this if you want (**you are valid you are valid you are valid**) but if it were me in that situation, I would take more time for myself than you think you need to cope with the added stress & dysphoria. And maybe talking with the mom about it might help? She's #1 in the kiddos' universe, so hearing an explanation about it from her will hold more way weight with them
I have only told a couple people about my chosen name. I want to tell more but sometimes I feel silly about it. I have two nephews and I know it’ll probably be a big adjustment for them and I don’t know how to explain it to them.
thanks for this! It’s good to know it’ll get better :)
Thank you ❤️ I’ve been stepping out on the porch for bits at a time to smoke a bowl and be alone. It’s helpful that my friend is really chill and doesn’t expect me to do much with the kids. I love them haha but I’m not a parent for a reason 😂

Mom does a really good job when the kids aren’t around and even will remember to use the/them sometimes when they are around, which helps. I don’t spend a lot of time with them in person and when we text everyone uses the right name and everything. So I just try to remember that too. I just didn’t think it was gonna be this hard haha I still use my deadname legally but it’s a different feeling when I give it for official reasons vs talking to friends/social interactions.
You're already a better friend than me--I'd find some way to spend time alone with my friend that did not involve the kiddos, rather than interact with them 😂😂😂"	w0khme	NonBinary	22	0.96	2022-07-16 16:29:10
Mother is heartbroken about me going by a different name	"Hey all, my name is Avery, I'm 23, I am nonbinary transmasc, and go by they/them pronouns. About a month ago, I came out to my mother whom I'm very close to. She was very accepting and willing to listen and learn about my gender identity.  I was really excited to hear her call me Avery, because to me that would be very validating. Except she hasn't directly called me Avery since. She has found ways to skirt around it, calling me dear, kiddo, etc. Today she admitted to me that she knows she is doing this but not out of malice or spite, but rather that she is hurt that I don't want the name she gave me anymore. My birthname is short sweet and feminine and there is just no way to make it andro or masc. But to honour that name I chose my new name to have the same first and last letter as the name she gave me. She ran into the term ""deadname"" online and it broke her heart to think that some people refer to their past and not out selves as dead. I told her I do not view it that way. I respect my original name and who I was with that name so much. I ever use she/her when referring to myself in that time. I told her. ""I love and respect (birthname) very much. She made the most with what she had and didn't realize there was any other option. She was sad deep down and didn't know why, but she got me through some tough times and allowed me to be who I am today. I wouldn't be Avery without (birthname)""

How can I get my mom to use my chosen name. I remember seeing a tumblr post about names beings gifts? That might help her understand. I'm not dying or dead, I'm right here. I'm still her beautiful child, I'm just called Avery now!"	"Hi Avery! 
As a mother of a trans daughter, I do so totally get where your mom is coming from. 
Know that it has nothing to do with you. I am happy that she is accepting of your transition and that you are empathetic for her as well. Love will win. 
I remember when my daughter changed her name and yes, it did hurt . Dead name... I think I cried. (oh, I know I cried because I am crying now just remembering it) 
As a parent, you learn to live with a piece of your heart inside another human. But sometimes it is hard when that person has a mind of their own! 😂 
For me, I liken it to the process of Kintsugi. Every time she would open my mind with new ways of thinking it would feel like my brain was splitting. But I learned to fill those cracks with gold and honoring both what my vision was and what is. 
Give her time.... She will see that you are blossoming into the person you were meant to be and that is what makes our hearts sing."	b0nv1r	NonBinary	23	1.0	2019-03-13 16:19:02
You are all so beautiful.	"I’m envious of you that can take photos and post it here. You chubby people that look the coolest and you slim folks that look badass on everything you wear.

I wish I was in your shoes just for a few seconds so I could feel like living again.

I wish to go out without being ugly. I wish to have friends without being worried about my face. I wish I knew what love was, but my face and body wouldn’t let me.
I wish to wear whatever I want but I can’t get out from my household unless I’m married.

Enby people, you are so beautiful it makes me sad."	"Aw I'm so sorry to hear your situation is bad. Could I...draw a picture of you? How you wish to see yourself? Would that be helpful or make you more sad?
I don’t know what the exact circumstances you’re facing, but there’s always a way out. Marriage isn’t your only option. I believe in the magic of soul mates—and soul friends. They see the beauty inside, and it colors the way they see the outside. Your kindness and sincerity shines through this post/rant, and I truly believe you can be just as confident/badass/cool as you want. 🖤
Hey mate, please feel free to message anytime. Seriously, talking to people helps with self confidence a ton. I don’t know your life situation, but talking helps regardless of it.
Thanks for your help, but I do not wish to bother anyone. 

It would make me feel worse since there’s no way I can make myself look the way I want to.
My parents will only let me live by myself if I marry a Christian man, but I’m not a believer, I don’t like men, and I don’t wish to marry since I have been around toxic marriages from family members.

It’s a struggle since I was assigned female at birth, but I have constant dysphoria due to my clothes and body. I just wish to get out of here.

Being beautiful will only make my struggles less painful. That’s all I want. To be a little bit beautiful/handsome.
I’ve been there. My parents were ultra conservative Christians who believed I should pass from the supervision/authority of my dad directly to that of my husband. I attended a Christian college to make them happy and ensure I could get out of the house, and ended up blossoming there because it gave me the freedom to support myself and leave my parents. You don’t have to do what they want forever. Play their game just long enough to gain your independence, and then don’t look back ✌🏼
If you are in the US, you can move out once you are 18 and your parents can't do shit to stop you. In fact if they try you have the law on your side. 

Do they let you have a job? If so start saving up and GTFO.
That’s what I want to do!


If I had money for college.

Either way, maybe one day I will be free. I just hope I can enjoy my youth while it lasts.
I will get out once I finish my education.

It’s almost impossible to live from a normal wage paying job where I live.
I also have a chronic illness which makes it extra difficult to live alone and find a job.
I ended up getting emancipated and applying for financial aid, and since I was literally impoverished not including my parents finances, I was able to get hefty loans (and full PELL grant) to pay for college. I’m still paying off loans and will be for a long time, but it’s worth not being tied to my parents anymore. It took a lot of work (professionals who were aware of abuse from my religious parents helped with letters and such) but if that’s not an option, when you’re 26 or older, parents financials aren’t included when you apply for aid, so at the very least, you can do it then!"	e3otyp	NonBinary	21	0.94	2019-11-30 01:50:52
2 old 2b here	"I hit 32 and realized that even though I started my gender exploration and journey assuming I'd take the traditional trans masculine route.. I'm actually nonbinary. I've already legally changed my name and gender marker and I wouldn't want to change them again. There's not a gender marker for me where I live and if I have to present as a specific, binary gender to the public - like at work - I would rather that be as a man than a woman. I can survive a day of being misgendered as a man in a way that I can't as a woman.

But I'm having a lot of regrets and wish-I-hads today. Like wishing I had started exploring gender sooner. I wish I had been brave enough to mess around with gender when I was a teenager.

I feel like I'm too old to be exploring my gender presentation as a nonbinary person but not yet old enough to do it with a no fucks given attitude. And there's a little part of that where I don't think I ought to be allowed to call myself nonbinary because I have such a binary presentation in public.

Sometimes I feel like I'm faking it and doing it because all the cool kids are doing it. Never you mind that I'm married and getting on with this business of being a grown up.

TL;DR I know, in my mind quite logically, that being an enby of any kind has no age limits or restrictions but my heart doesn't know that or doesn't feel it and I'm sad about that. And I think I'm too old to experiment with gender presentation at this point.

Thanks for stopping by."	"[deleted]
I’m glad you’re here anyway. 💚
Hi, 30 year old enby here to say that you're never too old to live how you want to. You only get one life, and you're only one human in a giant sea of humanity, do whatever the fuck you want!

Imposter syndrome is a real feeling, but trust that logic, speak to your heart how you'd speak to someone on here asking you the same questions.
I came out at 39 and started HRT at 40, you're all good friend. Better late than never.
I'm 30, if you're too old I'm fucked. I hate that I missed being able to use my teens and 20s as an exploration time but, hey, can't change that so time to move on. Do I force myself to live as a cis man or do I explore and be my genderqueer self? I want to explore. I want to try and be happier with my life and I am tired of hiding the girl me away like she's some sort of freak. I know my presentation might be confusing to some but I'm a woman, however queer presenting I might be.
I'm 29 and glad to see I'm not the only one that's a bit older in this sub! I was pretty genderqueer in my mid-teens, only I didn't know that was a thing and I kind of lost the proto-queer community around me and started veering towards feminine presentation (I'm afab) because it was easy. 

Turns out it was just a phase. A 12-year phase. Tell that to your mom.

I did find out about the spectrum of non-binary identities at some point, but didn't think it applied to me. I've only started to figure myself out in the past year or two. Some parts are easier - general life experience and a fully developed frontal cortex definitely make for a smoother ride than having a gender crisis on top of other teenage stuff - but some are harder - there's a lot to unlearn. My experience and (ideal) presentation varies a lot - it's not that the ""feminine"" shit feels wrong altogether, it's just that that side is majorly overdeveloped in contrast to all the rest!

 Finding my way to the local drag scene and starting performing myself has been a big, loving, validating help. 

//accidentally posted too early.
50 year old NB here. Just started figuring the non-binary part a couple weeks ago. I wish I’d figured this out sooner, too. Sometimes I get angry and bitter over the life I could have lived. Bitterness, tho, will keep a person trapped in the past. But finding our true selves is not an act based on our past but rather a love letter we send to our future selves.

You are never too old to be true to yourself, to accept yourself and love yourself for who you truly are. People change over time and perhaps those others descriptions better fit you at the time. But this is how are are now and all of that past history is what made you into the awesome and beautiful person you are now, however you look and however you choose to identify.
I’m 34.
When I was a kid, a teenager, I was such a daredevil and I'd push as far as I could. I miss that. But I don't miss being worn down by the criticism and the constant push back, always feeling like I had to be on the defensive. It was a battle of attrition that I lost when I moved out on my own; I just wanted someone to like me. To be nice to me, even if it was fake. The grass was definitely not greener on the other side! >.>; But knowing that I'm not the only one who has gone through it helps. Maybe I'll get to live in a state that has a gender marker for me someday. :D

I.. really like our generation of adults. There's a lot of ""why not?"" and ""hey, I'm an adult, I can do what makes me happy and you can't stop me!"" We're not always great or perfect but it seems like so many our age are supportive of each other and others.

That's what I like about being married - my partner has been on board from the get-go and it's been amazing to have that kind of support. Everyone needs that kind of support in their lives; I want everyone to have that kind of support in their lives.

Thank you. \^-\^
Thank you. \^-\^
That's always been the most helpful advice for me - speaking to yourself as you would another - and I appreciate you reminding me of it.

What am I going to get out of living up to someone else's standard instead of my own? Instead of centering on my happiness and well-being? More regrets and not the validation that means the most, has the most power.

I did the best I could at the time and now I know (and knowing is half the battle!).

Thank you. \^\_\^ <3
Honestly? Yeah. I think ""better late than never"" is going to become my new life motto.

Thank you. \^-\^
I tried forcing it. I didn't want to have any doubts or give anyone the room to ask ""but did you *really* try?"" So I tried both ways, as binary as can be, and it turns out that what makes me the happiest is a full circle skirt for twirling in and the laziest beard ever. It seems silly to me that my skirts never made me feel pretty until after starting HRT but here I am.

Thank you! \^\_\^ <3
How many of us learned  about the non-binary spectrum and initially thought it didn't apply? There's probably a lot more than I realized. The non-binary people I see around online and offline both generally seem very confident and settled into who they are and I envy them that.

But the bit about the feminine being overdeveloped in comparison to the rest of you? It resonates. It reminds me of having asymmetrical development as someone who is neurodivergent. It's good to be reminded that we aren't required to develop as individuals in a perfectly balanced manner; it makes it easier to be kinder to myself.

If it's not too personal, may I ask how or what about drag has helped you? (You're welcome to follow up directly if you'd like to reply but don't want to do so in the thread.)

Thank you. \^-\^ <3
Why not today, yeah?

I've never wanted to have regrets. I've always said that that where I was in the past was where I needed to be if I was going to be me today. We're all doing the best we can with what we have and it's so much easier to remember that and apply it to others. It's so much easier to be more understanding of others.

But.. I can't do anything about yesterday. I have to trust me and the decisions I made because I had a reason to make those decisions. Tomorrow I can do something about today.

*Thank you*. <3
It's starting to look like age isn't the barrier I feared it to be.

Thank you. \^\_\^

I think even if you're unsure about your gender identity, online it's easy to ""try on"" things, so many people may come across as more confident and all-figured-out than they are. Which is not to say they are faking or putting it on. With people you know irl, when you're at the point that you're not sure, you might say ""I think I might be.... not entirely this.... maybe"" - online, especially in a community of strangers, it's easier to say ""I am this"" and see how that makes you feel. I think it's healthy. 

Now, as for your question about drag...
This turned out rather long and rambling, so buckle up.

[Just a heads up, I will go into random details of my life and my drag persona because it makes it easier to explain. I'm not speaking for anyone else's drag or how it relates to their gender experience. Mind I'm still pretty much a baby and not a seasoned performer!]

I don't know how familiar you are with drag, especially underground or ""queer"" drag. If you're thinking of RuPauls Drag Race, forget that now! (There have been a lot of good artists on the show, and I don't begrudge fans of the show, but RP himself is a transphobic, god-complexed ass. No offense. Well, a little offense.) In a nutshell: anyone can do drag and your drag can be anything. ""Female impersonation"" is just one strand of drag.

I didn't know this until not so long ago. I thought I straight up couldn't do drag because my body is read as female and I wasn't interested in being a drag king. (I did ""dress up as"" a drag queen once for a Vegas-themed student party tho.) Well, I kind of knew there *were* people ignoring that ""rule"", but I thought you had to be some kind of strong-willed, confident rebel to do that, a bit like I had thought about being non-binary years before. I thought the ""rule-breaking"" had to be your gimmick tho pull it off.

I also didn't go to local drag shows despite my curiosity because - I think - I thought I would feel like an outsider. (Honestly, sometimes I feel kind of dumb because this community was RIGHT THERE for years and I was too scared/depressed to find that out.) Anyway, once it had dawned on me this diversity existed, to my luck an established but very ug local drag house was organizing a course, and I applied, and during the course, last October, Cake Bush was born. Now most people just start doing drag on their own - afaik courses like this aren't even that common - but to be honest, I needed that help to get on the way.

As I said, when I was a teenager I might have identified as genderfluid/nb had I realized that was an option. I also grew up on the internet, so I spent a lot of time in my bedroom. I was in dance class and drama class, but didn't really connect with anyone there. I had one friend in school. Anyway, at that time (I swear I'm getting to the point) I'd do ""bedroom photoshoots"" a lot - dress up in bed sheets and absurd thrift finds, paint my face with my dead aunt's makeup kit, pose with random items because hey, for some reason random items are endlessly fascinating to a teenager on the fringe. This was way before Facebook, so anyone I knew online was definitely not from my school, town or other circumstantial social group. My online circles were pretty queer too, so being non-cis or non-straight was kind of the default. Not that I always even posted my pictures online or showed anyone - sometimes I felt there was a story in them that others wouldn't get. I existed in my head a lot. To illustrate: I recently found on my computer an unfinished, never published website from ca. 2005, a ""fan site"" for an imaginary rock band of which I was all four members, complete with pictures, member profiles, a detailed biography and two albums worth of bizarre song lyrics.

Anyway... drag has allowed me to rediscover the joy of *play*. I think as adults we tend to think unless we're doing something seriously enough, or for a good enough reason, there's no point in doing it. People say they want to write but never do because they're not ""good enough"" to write a novel. (Or indeed, that it's too late!)

Now that I'm writing this, it seems incredibly STUPID that there was a 8-10 year period where I *didn't* regularly play dress up in my bedroom, by then turned studio flat. (I was into photography and taking a lot of self portraits until around 2012 though.) 

In a lot of ways, I feel like I'm picking up where I left off. Like a part of me went into hibernation some time during high school. Like that part, hesitantly crawling out now, is still 16; like I'm made up of a 29-year-old part-time woman and a 16-year-old enby. Talk about taking care of your inner child.

I don't think it's a coincidence that the rise, fall and rise of this playing and free flow of imagination coincides with the phases of my poor gender identity.

Drag ties into gender in obvious ways, and some less obvious. On the most immediate level, it's an avatar through which I have more flexibility in presentation and experimentation. I've done one number dressed up like a schoolgirl, but otherwise I like to keep it ambivalent. (To me, Cake Bush is genderqueer in a non-earthling way. I also prefer fantasy-style makeup to realistic/glamour.) There's suspense of disbelief, just like in theatre or literature.

In a more subtle, indirect way, I think it's not playing with gender but playing at all that releases me. It's not ""what should I do"" or ""how should I present my gender"" but more of a ""this is cool... oh and this! Wow, where am I?"" (Idk if this makes any sense. I've never put this in so many words and I'm still figuring it out myself.) Often asking ""well, what is my gender identity then"" just leads [me] to considering given roles and representations of the nb, as if I should choose from a catalogue rather than ""living my truth"" as they say. So not asking that, but being in a state where no gender template is put to me or on me, woman, nb or otherwise, is where I'm finding myself. My gender is incidental. It's many. It changes. As someone who lived in the Default Gender Template for most of my adulthood (and I haven't even lived up to many other templates, being mentally ill, queer etc), I have to remind myself not to let that process die down while I'm not tending to it. I genuinely don't know how to be all of myself with other people and that extends to being what for all intents and purposes is a unique and multifaceted gender. Apart from friends from the drag scene, I've told maybe a handful of people that I'm nb, and another handful (I assume) has gathered as much from hints.

For me, drag doesn't just happen on the stage, on the face, on social media. I have stories in me about my character. I do post pictures on my Instagram when I practice my make-up in the middle of the night, but that's just the result. (sidenote: some ridiculous strain of performance anxiety is making me do my best mugs alone at night, and the absolute worst when I'm supposed to perform...) The process, which can take hours if my concentration can hold it together, is kind of meditative.

Not that performing isn't an important part of it. It's an art form I never thought I'd be good at - but then, I was also under the impression that drag is only for sassy cis gay men. I'm terrified to go on stage every time, but I remind myself that it's *my world*, which spectators are given the privilege to observe for 5 to 10 minutes, and that turns the tables. (My style of drag is somewhat theatrical; unlike many performers, I don't usually interact with the audience.) I don't owe them anything and I don't have to explain anything.

It's so hard to explain how freeing, affirming and empowering it is to just *do what you want*, whether on stage or on the floor of my kitchenette. It's so uncanny, sometimes I even forget what it feels like if I haven't done a show or practiced for a few months. I guess it's nice to be surprised. 

It opens up possibilities. And like an online presence that's at least partly separate from your irl life - you don't have to have everything pre-defined. Cake Bush doesn't have a family, a social worker or 200 university acquaintances. (There isn't a coherent, set backstory or anything, and most of the stuff I know about them I haven't specifically told anyone, but I bring in bits as I go along.)

Obviously, it wouldn't be possible (or at least it would be a lot harder, and we'll, I just wouldn't be doing it) if the underground drag community in my city wasn't so amazing, supportive and genderqueer(-friendly). I've performed at shows where everyone or almost everyone was trans or nb, and that wasn't because of a theme. Hosts ask for your pronouns, in and out of drag. Most clubs have safer space principles and the audience is reminded not to assume the genders of either performers or characters. And people are genuinely so friendly and supportive, even an introvert like me can deal.

(From what I've gathered, it's very different from the mainstream, cis-gay-man scene. Apparently people over there don't even know that drag creatures other than kings and queens exist, or that your gender doesn't dictate what your drag has to be like.)

I hope this answered your question, at least in part. Sorry for the length, clearly I need to talk about this more...

TL;DR: drag allows me to be whatever and that allows me to be myself.

being nb is hard	does anyone else feel so sick of being constantly misgendered and having to advocate for yourself? I’m mentally ill and on the autism spectrum and it’s so hard for me to correct others but otherwise it happens constantly. i’m just sad and feel like we’ll never get to a place where all people will be understanding and empathetic towards nonbinary people, let alone know what nonbinary is/means. i’m so tired and feel like there’s no point to anything if i’m gonna be misunderstood for my whole life. my only trans friend ended up randomly trying to unalive me and i’m so traumatized i don’t have friends anymore let alone trans friends. i just feel really alone.	"All love in your direction - so sorry to hear your experience. If I can say one thing as a also ND+nb is that we need community <3 that being said - there’s sooo many hurt people in our communities due to the shittyness of the world. I firmly believe that hurt people hurt people and the way to find the right people for you - is to hold people at an absurd high standard and at the sign of any fuckery - bye.
You’ll find your safe persons/place - trust me - but it’ll take work. I honestly test people and practice radical selfcare and honestly the better I get - the better people I attract. Practice selfcare now if possible or as soon as you feel a little better - you’re more than deserving and loved <3

Questioning whether I'm NB or similar, curious if anyone else has had similar feelings or can help?	"Hey friends. I've been doing a lot of thinking about gender identity lately and am still knee-deep wading through the murky waters of it all. (For context, I'm mid-20s and AMAB.) I don't think I'm ready to really adopt a label of ""nonbinary"" yet (and I don't know how actually much this – or labels at all, or pronouns, or *words* in general – actually serve to help me or do any work for me personally, though they can help make certain ideas… coalesce, or feel more real) but I do feel NB-ish. I say this as a lot lot lot of stories I hear from NB folks resonate with me in a lot of key ways, and when I hear or read about people who identify as NB, genderqueer, etc. talk about their ideas, concepts, and experiences with gender identity, I feel there's a lot in common, especially in this whole process of questioning and figuring these sorts of things out. So – while I could go ahead decide to call myself ""nonbinary"" right at this moment, sure – at the end of the day I don't think that would do enough to help me figure stuff out; I think this doesn't change anything, as it doesn't help me with my conception/relation to my own gender identity or what that actually *is*.

The whole ""not feeling nonbinary *enough*"" thing is extremely real for me, I think. I'm AMAB, and still think of myself as sort of ""weakly male"" (?) – I guess because at the least I've just been so used to that as the unquestioned norm for so long, despite never thinking of my ""maleness"" (in my own conception of it, pretty far from anything stereotypical though, which I've always been aware + pretty proud of) as really part of who I am as a person at all… Anyway, in regards to being AMAB, I'm finding it hard, as far as gender *presentation* goes, to actually *present* less male just because, for people designated or viewed as male, and because of society/history/culture, maleness – not some conception of ""neutral"" – is the default.

I don't want to perform stereotypical femininity by painting my nails or wearing dresses or earrings/jewelry or stuff like that (and I sadly can't grow out my hair either even if I wanted to try that out), I just want to… take away some of that masculinity. To quote the graphic novel _Gender Queer: a memoir_ by Maia Kobabe (which I only discovered after having essentially all these exact same thoughts myself months prior): ""I don't want *more* gendered traits, I want *less*."" But unfortunately I really don't think there's a way to do this because any gap or ""lack"" of gendered traits *is* the same as that default-maleness, for someone AMAB, or viewed to be as such + ""filled in"" with that.

It'd be great if I could look more androgynous (even though that in itself feels sort of ashamedly like ""playing the game you claim you don't want to be a part of"") but it seems mostly unachievable for me, so oh well. I do think people AFAB have a lot more flexibility to perform/express gender in a range of different ways (and that are more socially accepted too, although I know this doesn't really matter, but interesting to note) and I sometimes feel a bit jealous of that.

This all sort of connects to my main point or question which is that I'm wondering if anyone else, in some way, relates to the phrase ""I'm an [insert whatever here] who wants to be to be a girl who wants to be a boy,"" or finds that somehow productive in describing their feelings. Or flip those two genders, whatever. This is a little weird because I recognize it's dealing with some pretty binary views of gender, more than I usually think of it as (which is why I find some trans spaces, especially IRL, not… super relevant to my experiences, with MtF or FtM as common experiences that feel a lot… neater, or easier to describe + imagine, in some ways). However, there's some work this statement is doing in exploring identity and desire together, and wanting to (comfortably) be in this sort of in-between or maybe-not-quite-perfectly-achievable state…?

I'm also reminded of this quote from Jeanette Winterson's _Why be Happy When You Could be Normal?_: ""My sense of myself as being a girl who’s a boy who’s a boy who’s a girl. A doubleness at the heart of things."" Not exactly the same, but playing with this same sort of back-and-forth concept, I think. There's also a mention in one of the stories in _Nonbinary: Memoirs of Gender and Identity_ (yes, I've been doing a lot of reading, lol) where the author describes someone as ""a tomboy in a man's body"" which makes me feel maybe this isn't some too-weird, abnormal thought.

Sorry for the huge wall of text! Really did not mean to type this much, oops. Essentially any thoughts about **any** of this are super super appreciated. I don't even know *if* I feel stuck, or confused, or lost, or what – or if I'm sort of OK with that, in this hazy, liminal state – but I definitely want to make more sense of this all and talking with others or just reading about others' experiences helps a lot.

Thanks!"	"I feel very similar, except I'm AFAB. I don't really have any specific advice to give you, as I'm still figuring things out. I do like the flexibility that comes with embracing the label of non binary, but I also have things I don't really care to change, like my name and pronouns. Anyway, my point is you're definitely not alone feeling like this
I can't help much with figuring out your gender. Your experience sounds fairly different than mine. I did want to address some of what you said in the middle though:

>Anyway, in regards to being AMAB, I'm finding it hard, as far as gender *presentation* goes, to actually *present*  less male just because, for people designated or viewed as male, and  because of society/history/culture, maleness – not some conception of  ""neutral"" – is the default.  
>  
>I  don't want to perform stereotypical femininity by painting my nails or  wearing dresses or earrings/jewelry or stuff like that (and I sadly  can't grow out my hair either even if I wanted to try that out), I just  want to… take away some of that masculinity. To quote the graphic novel *Gender Queer: a memoir*  by Maia Kobabe (which I only discovered after having essentially all  these exact same thoughts myself months prior): ""I don't want *more* gendered traits, I want *less*."" But unfortunately I really don't think there's a way to do this because any gap or ""lack"" of gendered traits *is* the same as that default-maleness, for someone AMAB, or viewed to be as such + ""filled in"" with that.

Yeah, it's tough to try to look 'androgynous' for AMAB people, but I don't think it's because of male as default.

Clothing is particularly tough. Clothing seen as androgynous tends to be things that are acceptable for men and women to wear but, because of misogyny, those are practically all historically male gendered items. They're often designed to emphasize masc features. A body that still looks masculine wearing 'androgynous' clothing just ends up reading as cis male to most people, albeit maybe visibly queer.

I think the reality is to look more androgynous, you'll need *some* feminine features. It doesn't have to be painted nails and dresses, but something you're comfortable with. Something that will feel like *you* and not a performance. Almost any trait, or lack of a trait, is frustratingly gendered. It's hard to take away masculinity without moving toward femininity. Often taking away a masculine trait is effectively adding a feminine one, and vice versa.

>It'd be great if I could look more androgynous (even though that in itself feels sort of ashamedly like ""playing the game you claim you don't want to be a part of"") but it seems mostly unachievable for me, so oh well.

Why do you think looking more androgynous is unachievable for you? What masculine traits/presentation were you hoping to reduce?

>I do think people AFAB have a lot more flexibility to perform/express gender in a range of different ways (and that are more socially accepted too, although I know this doesn't really matter, but interesting to note) and I sometimes feel a bit jealous of that.

AFAB people have more flexibility to perform/express gender in a range of different ways and have it still be acceptable . . . as long as they are still being read as cis women. It might help them in the earlier stages to experiment with different looks without drawing negative attention, but from what I've seen it quickly becomes a hindrance as it becomes difficult to escape. They often end up having to present quite masc to get read as anything other than female, which ends up being very restricting.

Meanwhile AMAB people can present with a mix of masc and fem and people more easily assume they are not cis because cis men so rarely present that way, but being recognized that way comes with transphobia.

For nonbinary people, I think the gender you were assigned changes what problems you face but one isn't necessarily easier than another and varies more person-to-person than between assigned genders.

Of course, everything I've said applies mostly to people who haven't medically transitioned at all. Having a body with a mix of gendered physical features makes it much easier (or possible, even) to be seen as androgynous in a wider variety of clothing, but comes with other problems.
Sorry right now I don’t have much time but form what I read you’re a AMAB who acts more feminine than “stereotypical” man right? If so you can just call yourself a man and that’s it. Personality does not equal gender and if your personality is more feminine so be it, I’m very much like this too. I’m a man but I’m just overall more “girly”. I keep my nails kinda long, have softer movements and more feminine positions but I still think of myself and my body as male ones.
I’ll read the entirety once I have time and will add to the answer.
I really hope I don’t get bombed with downvotes for not being non-binary though, I don’t care about karma that much but it still hurts seeing the comment’s points go negative.
Edit: I had a quick break and read it all and I don’t really have anything to add besides that you’re really confused. I suggest thinking really about these things: do you feel good or bad about your body and appearance as a man? That’s it honestly the rest is just your personality and how you want to act as the gender you “choose”. As I said before remember that personality is different than gender.
""I'm a person who wants to be girly but not *too* girly and definitely doesn't want to be a girl or a boy."" Pretty close.

I would *love* to be able to present ""less"" male or just non-male. But after twenty years with a T-influenced endocrine system I accept that I can't have that unless I make particular choices with my presentation and my hormones. The nature of the binary is to categorize me binarily, and to gender all traits. 

Being nonbinary is nothing more than existing as a challenge to the ubiquitous categorization. I do not by virtue of existing have the power to pose that challenge successfully very often. So if I don't like reading male (and I f\*\*\*ing *hate* it) then I get to undercut my male-reading traits in juxtaposition with female-reading traits, knowing that the androgyny I seek is an unstable equilibrium (especially on HRT) and I'm very likely to overshoot and want to back-track at some point. But the privilege of enbyhood is that I get to be messy and change my mind as often as I like!
I don't have any amazing answers, but I did have a couple of thoughts about trying to present as less male. You said you're not interested in wearing dresses, but have you thought about just playing with the colors in your wardrobe? Maybe some softer, more ""feminine"" colors? Or maybe a floral print? 
And as for not being able to grow your hair out, maybe you could get a wig?
That's what attracts me a bit about it too – it seems flexible and non-specific and like there is more wiggle room, and I like the ability to subvert the sorts of expectations that come with that as well. I really identify with my name, and am fine with that, and am trying out they/them pronouns along with he/him but I feel people never really use these in my presence anyway so it doesn't hugely affect the way I feel, lol. Or maybe I just don't really know yet or it hasn't been long though. But, seeing those as strictly words or labels, just like ""nonbinary"" is, I do like the flexibility they/them affords as well... but I don't hate or dislike he/him either, and (at least right now) I'm very open to both. Wish I somehow could do more work experimenting with these in, like, non-artificially constructed ways.

Thanks so much for responding and sharing your experience too!
Thanks for responding! That's an interesting view. I think we tend to see male as the default just due to, like, the patriarchy in some ways – white, middle-class, cishet maleness *is* the default for so much of... everything.

To respond to some of your points and questions:

>A body that still looks masculine wearing 'androgynous' clothing just ends up reading as cis male to most people

This is what I was meaning as maleness as the default, versus someone who's AFAB who wears ""unisex"" clothing, or cuts their hair short, or stops wearing nail polish, and looks more masc as a result. But you can't ""take away"" things to remove maleness as someone who's AMAB since – especially with clothing – it's, like, unisex vs. female, and the ""middle ground"" *is* male too, or doubles as that. I hope that makes sense?

""Visibly queer"" is good too, just not sure how to present that exactly, lol.

>I think the reality is to look more androgynous, you'll need _some_ feminine features. It doesn't have to be painted nails and dresses, but something you're comfortable with. Something that will feel like _you_ and not a performance.

I agree! I just... don't know what that is.

> It's hard to take away masculinity without moving toward femininity. Often taking away a masculine trait is effectively adding a feminine one, and vice versa.

Yeah, I totally agree here too, and this is really frustrating. As you said, essentially any trait – or even the lack of one – is viewed as gendered so much of the time.

>Why do you think looking more androgynous is unachievable for you? What masculine traits/presentation were you hoping to reduce?

I'm very tall, have a solid jawline, and thinning hair. It just feels like 80% things here are set in stone, essentially, and it's not really worth fighting tooth and nail to ""change"" the remaining 20% to pass as sort-of more andro.

I've never ever had a beard and very much don't want one, so have thought about getting laser hair removal (probably not electrolysis because too much ouch) just for convenience. I've become increasingly uncomfortable with my Adam's apple in feeling and appearance but I don't think I can really change this either so again oh well. I don't know what other ""masculine traits"" there even *are* to reduce, or how to do that, so I guess that's part of what makes this hard.

And yeah, I've thought about hormones stuff and looked into it some but I think that's still a ways off if anything and I'd want to talk to some therapists and doctors first and get that perspective on it.
I mean, that is true, and I briefly mentioned that. I've never felt comfortable with the word ""man"" to describe myself, or getting called things like ""sir"" (although I understand the linguistic function with regard to formality in terms of address like this, which are unfortunately gendered in English) – but moreover I've never thought of gender as an important of who I was, or some key part of how I'd define or describe myself. I don't think I'm really ""girly"" but more just not-hyper-masculine – but anyone can perform gender in whatever ways *they* want and it is still a performance of *that gender*, without regard to what it'd be stereotypically classified as. Unlike you, I *don't* think of myself as male, although of course my body is biologically/genetically male – but that's not really *me*, just some arbitrary container housing and containing that real ""me."" There are some aspects that I'm uncomfortable with (adam's apple, sometimes my height, etc.) but I'm sort of... just OK with that, too, at least usually.

I disagree, honestly – I'm not ""really confused"" and hurting because of it or anything, I'm just really thinking hard about a lot of these things and trying to figure out how I conceptualize these things, and then how they relate to my identity and experience in the world too. I'm well aware personality is different from gender, but they're obviously related and both contribute to identity as a whole.
Wow, I super feel that too. Pretty much exactly agreed.

It's hard when your expression and presentation can't really match up at *all* with how you feel or identify – I'm in the same boat as you regarding that, and sort of begrudgingly accepting what's reasonably possible and what's not. I'm thinking about hormones, very very early on in this part of it all, but it's a little scary and seems so drastic, and I wouldn't want to develop breasts ever, etc. Plus all of what you mentioned too, to an extent. So just not really sure how to navigate that or what I can actually... do, or affect.
There are actually surgeries that can reduce your Adams apple, though of course whether surgery is the right course of action is entirely up to you!
I agree that “identity” is defined by both gender and personality. If you don’t like being called man but also don’t want to be called woman I think you can refer yourself as non-binary. Also, since you’re unsure, DO NOT transition. I don’t know if you ever intended to but unless you’re 100% sure just don’t. You would sterilize yourself, spend a lot of money and be in a body you don’t want to be. 
Anyway my tip would be, hear me out, try becoming a girl for some time. No hormones of course but try looking and behaving like a stereotypical woman. You said you don’t do stereotypical woman’s stuff like make up, etc. but it might be fun and also make you realize better who you are as a person. Just try, it doesn’t really cost anything. I think that to decide who you are you must have felt both sides and then “choose”.
I don't know that it's completely impossible for our presentation to match our identity. They say raloxifene can prevent osteoporosis and also minimize top growth. That might be an attractive option for many of us. Unfortunately that option isn't available to me right now. I have warmed up to the idea of an E-dominant system, but it took me years to get here. There's no rush (even though with thinning hair maybe there is a little bit of a rush). You do get to take your time deciding what feels right to you. And you get to change your mind.
I know I can refer to myself as NB if I want – gatekeeping of these terms isn't productive or helpful or anyone – but I don't know if I'm wholly comfortable with that yet either. I think I should try to figure out why that is, though, and where that not-perfect-comfortability comes from, which may help with that.

>since you’re unsure, DO NOT transition.

Yeah, medical stuff is way off the table for now. As I said to another comment here: ""I've thought about hormones stuff and looked into it some but I think that's still a ways off if anything and I'd want to talk to some therapists and doctors first and get that perspective on it.""

Regarding your phrasing, do note that for trans folk ""transition"" doesn't just mean medically transition, as people can socially transition (usually to the ""opposite"" binary gender, if this is what they feel/want) as well.

>try becoming a girl for some time [...] try looking and behaving like a stereotypical woman.

Honestly this sounds very unappealing, just as much as behaving and looking like a stereotypical man is. I don't like or want to see these things in myself or really in others (i.e. I'm not attracted to that) so, sorry, but this just sounds offputting.

>stereotypical woman’s stuff like make up, etc. [...] might be fun and also make you realize better who you are as a person

Not too keen on makeup or the time/energy required or what it looks like; it's too ""fake"" for me I guess. I've recently started shaving my legs and like it at least a bit, now debating on whether to try arms or not. I've tried painting my nails and I'm pretty indifferent about it and how it makes me feel, but I do sort of like the fact it's viewed as gender subversive. I'm not really into body ""modification"" like this in any way, though. I just want my *default* to be not so assumed-to-be-male.

>to decide who you are you must have felt both sides and then “choose”.

There are more than two ""sides."" I don't want to find where I am between ""both sides"" or on the spectrum. I want to get rid of the axes all together or forge new ones or just not subscribe to that binary at all."	e505r8	NonBinary	20	0.96	2019-12-02 14:57:09
Going Topless	I have a “female” chest and although small it still makes me self conscious but that was bred into me — if I’m at a queer beach or with people I feel safe with, going topless feels amazing and I like my chest as is. I feel sad that there’s restrictions even if not legally, socially, on being topless if you have breasts and I try to feel rebellious and not care but it hurts my soul feel restricted and unsafe in public. I don’t want surgery or binders. I want to be a human animal and be allowed to exist in my body without fear or pressure to alter myself just to do things anyone should get to do. I HATE shopping for bathing suits. I watch male rockstars on stage shirtless or dudes at the park and I feel so jealous I can’t deal with it. It isn’t really gender dysphoria… because I like my body, I just want other people to stop telling me what to do in it. Any advice on how to get through the hurt / frustration and find ways to be more comfortable doing what I want? I often go out in nature to be really free of it all but I maybe need to find more queer spaces. I don’t always feel comfortable in the feminist/lesbian crowds because I don’t want to be a woman so I just feel alone and trapped in a body that I wouldn’t mind being in if I actually felt like it was mine to do what I want with…	"Damn, this is relatable. No advice, I’m afraid, I’m just commiserating with you.
I just wanted to say I think I feel very similar. Most of the time I am comfortable with my chest and get euphoria from walking around shirtless at home. Only on occasion do I get actual mild discomfort I think. But it really annoys me how it's not socially acceptable generally, to go to the beach topless or just hang out topless on a hot day when other guys are, just because I have this different body which don't usually mind. 

Also, there's something to be said about when I look in the mirror, I see a person (sometimes slightly masc), not a woman/girl, despite knowing how my afab body is. It would be nice if other people saw me the way I see me, idk.
Thanks, it’s a quandary… born in the wrong time i guess. Wrong culture. Lol. 
I want to like “be the change” etc… but it aint easy to feel safe. I keep thinking if theres anywhere i could move thatd b more comfortable for me but everywhere has diff problems and i cant move rn. I always felt better when on stage doing drag type shit or music but i hate being seen as a chick doing rebellious chick stuff.. u kno? When it just feels so natural to me…"	104ylzk	NonBinary	21	0.94	2023-01-06 16:34:28
Is it normal to feel dysphoria only after starting questioning your gender?	"Hello there. I'm AFAB and I recently started questioning my gender. I talked about it with my two best friends and I decided to go by male and neutral pronouns (since in Italian there aren't neutral pronouns I have to use male ones in real life, and online I use * or x to ""hide"" the last letter of the word that usually tells the gender of it).
I also choose a new name: Mika, which is kinda neutral to me and it's also the name of a character I love.

I am really happy when they use my new name and pronouns and I get a sudden feeling of euphoria everytime. But this feeling goes away quickly because then I look at me and... I'm not a boy, I'm not even androginous... I'm a girl. And I start feeling sad, like, REALLY sad.
I don't even know if this is exactly what people call dysphoria... But still, I never had this feeling before, I'm always been comfortable with my femininity, so the fact that I'm getting all those new emotions so suddenly makes my head go ""fake! fake! you're faking it for attention!"" Even though I would never do something like that.

Is this normal? Or am I just... A fake?"	"Gender euphoria is just as valid as dysphoria in determining your gender. You don't have to experience dysphoria to be trans and dysphoria is different for everyone. What you are experiencing is still dysphoria though and think of it like this... How many cis people do you know wish they were a different gender? If going by a different name and pronouns makes you feel good, then you can't be ""faking it."" I struggle with imposter syndrome too though, so just know you're completely valid no matter what your brain tells you. 😊
For me I only started noticing my dysphoria after I started question my gender in my twenties. I had previously attributed the feelings with my social anxiety and depression. I didn’t feel like I hated my body because I looked female- I felt like I hated it because I looked like “out of shape”, and when people treated me like a woman it was just bc of social anxiety. When I started questioning my gender though and people started using they/them and I realized I’m not socially anxious when people honor my gender and I feel uncomfortable with my body because it has a very female fat distribution.

It is also really common near the beginning to feel like you are faking it or things like that. Non-binary and binary trans people all talk about things like that, especially as there is online personalities calling people “transtrenders” and the news and stuff saying things like “the trans agenda is convincing our girls to be boys” etc. for me a lot of this just got better over time. I did a gender workbook and watched a lot of educational videos on gender identity and then started seeing a therapist to talk about my gender. Even if you are questioning and you end up discovering you are cis, you would have gained a really solid understanding of yourself and as well as of the spectrum of gender identity and the experiences of those across it.

Idk hopefully that helps! Feel free to DM if you wanna talk about it 🤷
This really helps me a lot, thank you so much for commenting 🥺
Can I ask which gender workbook you used?
Thank you so much for commenting! :D Tbh I always liked my body, but maybe it's because ppl kept telling me how beautiful it was so I convinced myself (?). But now if I could change it I definitely would.
While it looks like you showed signs of dysphoria even before questioning, I think I never did... Or maybe I still don't realize it, idk. This is why it makes me feel like a fake, because I never had those feelings until now :/
No problem! I struggle a lot with these thoughts too so I'm glad it helped.
You and your gender identity: a guide to discovery by Dara HoffmanFox
It can be either one. And as the other commenter mentioned the conversation is really shifting away from being only about dysphoria but also euphoria being a big sign too. Which is really important and I always appreciate when people share their stories of their identity that aren’t centered around misery. ❤️That’s just not as much a part of my personal experience.

Edit: but I can’t recommend enough how helpful journaling and going through a gender workbook can be in untangling everything
Cool thanks! And I'm curious- what do think you got out of it? Who do you think it's best for?
It caused me to really examine how I related to my gender and had a lot of guided questions. A lot of the questions caused me to have major feels and when I started seeing a therapist it provided me with a good jumping off point. It also made me feel really validated about how I feel. Especially since I didn’t start questioning my gender until I was in my 20s. I didn’t identify with the idea of my body feeling wrong for me. I even had a year where I felt really great about my body when I was being really high fem and I got a lot of positive attention then. But when I was thinking about my gender it made it really difficult. A lot of the questions in the book are for binary trans people and i align more closely with agender so not all was applicable. but it does includes a solid things for non-binary people. I’m pretty sure Dara themself identifies as non-binary. 

I think it is solid for anyone who is questioning there gender identity honestly. It is a good guide for introspection. Ultimately people have to answer who they are for themselves but for me it felt so overwhelming and I didn’t know how to go about it and I was living in a really transphobic area and my therapist then didn’t feel comfortable talking about gender identity.
Interesting! Thanks for the explanation. I also identify with being agender.  One last question - you may not be able to answer this, but I sometimes struggle to read trans resources that are directed mostly at binary trans people, because I kind of feel insecure about my experience of transness being out of the norms, and also because some resources can be kind of gender essentialist/hypergendered and that generally gives me pretty bad dysphoria. (E.g. ""These are these 'inherently' male or female traits and behaviours that relate to you realizing you were trans"",  ""here are your incredibly gendered body parts and obviously you want to change them to the Other incredibly gendered body parts""). What can often be affirming to binary trans people can make me incredibly dysphoric about my body unfortunately, as I don't tend to like to see my body or behaviour as gendered at all. So I'm wondering if the book has that vibe? I've made the mistake of reading something that was supposed to be comforting or informative and having to struggle with a huge bout of dysphoria after. Not fun lol.
Yeah I would say I found some of it a little frustrating for that reason but it is really clear with the headings about what the section is and most questions are in sets. I feel like the language is also very inclusive of the breadth of human experience- saying “you may experience some all or none of these” and acknowledging that you might not have anything a particular domain. It also has a whole page on being non-binary. Which is better than other workbooks. I can send you some pictures of the pages if you want some examples so you know if you are interested or not- if so just DM me so I don’t forget."	ld1rlv	NonBinary	21	0.97	2021-02-05 07:05:37

Student council	So during tutor today we were told we needed to elect two students from our form for the student council, ‘one boy and one girl’. I was really hyped up about the student council just so I could say a bit about sorting sensory issues and gender inclusivity in our school (since it recently became an academy and we’re moving to a larger site so we’re expecting a lot more students) and it just made me really sad that despite being out to a lot of people at school, and there being another openly enby kid in my class , theyre still saying we need ‘one boy and one girl’. And when the teacher was writing down the names of people who wanted to join, she put it in boy/girl columns, and didnt even hesitate putting me in the female section Which idk what I expected but it made me really sad.	"That's really unfortunate and painfully ironic, I'm sorry. It's also fundamentally a terrible way to select representatives. Can you do a petition or something to eliminate the categories and let people just be elected on merit?

Body image issues improving after coming out to myself	"When I was 15, a boy I had a crush on remarked that it didn't matter to him if a girl was chubby as long as her boobs stuck out further than her belly. For the past 15 years since I've internalised that ""rule"" and have done everything I could to live up to that cute boy's standard of beauty. When the push up bras didn't do enough, and when my chronic digestive issues caused bloating, I would be left with shame and disgust towards this sad sack of flab I've been destined to live inside. I hid inside hoodies and one piece swimsuits when I really wanted was a belly button piercing and a bikini with board shorts. 

I came to the realization that I was nonbinary in December 2017, and started my transition with testosterone injections in May. I wanted to get as far away from womanhood as possible without becoming a man and inheriting all the rules and codes that go with that side of the gender spectrum. I want to just be me. Cute and sweet, but gross and strong as hell. Nails painted one day, building my own furniture the next. Buzzed hair, no makeup, wearing a binder...under a dress. Because fuck the rules. I've wasted likely half my life being a weird girl not knowing I was actually something else entirely.

Since I've started testosterone, my inner self is starting to become my outer self as well. My voice, my muscles, and my genitals are all becoming what I've wanted them to be. I'm also starting to notice a good amount of fat redistribution, with it leaving my boobs and butt and finding a new home on my stomach. And thanks to my healthy intake of alcohol, pickle flavored chips, and gummy peach rings, I've started to develop the beginnings of a nice beer belly. But despite it being what I've fought against since high school, I'm not upset about my tummy being bigger then my boobs. I'm actually pretty proud of it, and I can't figure out why. What I do know is that this is the first time in my life I've looked down there and not felt disgusted about the squishy blob I've found. I fully plan on wearing whatever the hell I want from now on, regardless of the proportions of the lumps on my torso. And hell, maybe I'll even go get that belly button ring.

Pronouns makes me anxious	I recently came out as non-binary, and I was surprised of how accepting all of my friends were. Still though, I am often worried that people use the wrong pronouns when talking about me and that some might still consider me male. It is understandable that it will take time for my friends to get used to my updated gender identity, but considering what others think still makes me sad. Does anyone of you relate to this negative thought spiral? If so, what have you done to fix or prevent it?	"[deleted]
Interesting to hear! Previously, before me coming out, I never really cared what pronouns people used. Though I was incredibly uncomfortable being male and to have people apply norms and stereotypes on me. I guess that is one of the reasons why I worry a lot about it now; I don't want to be seen as that.

I will probably take on more pronouns in the future, but right now I'll stick to ""They/them"" and ""hen"" (yes I am swedish to). It feels like they really suit me :)) "	7lxig5	NonBinary	18	0.93	2017-12-24 21:10:39

This made me a lot more sad than it should have..		"[deleted]
That looks like a single occupancy room which locks. 

wtf is the point of gendering this room even
Looks like paper put on by some ""gender critical"" assholes imo 🤔 I'd probably take it off, especially if it's a single stall
I know, I just saw it in a meme on r/traa and wanted to see what it was all about. And geez, it's sure something..
Idk man
I just went on that subreddit (gendercritical) DEAR GOD ITS TOXIC

Told my wife Update	So an update from a few days ago. I told my (32 masc enby, pan, poly) wife (37f, pan, poly) that I don't feel completely male, that I identify as an enby and she was very supportive, told me that we'd learn to grow into this realization together, but it would take her time to figure it out. It's been tough, every time I bring something up she shuts down, like her mood takes a total 180 from normal happy go lucky to quiet, sad, and closed off. I understand it must be a bit of a curve ball for someone who has been borderline hyper masculine  (pro wrestler, gym rat, gamer nerd, father of two) to express my inner feelings of needing to express my feminine side. I shaved my legs and when she noticed this happened, I bought nail polish that I want to try wearing soon, and she shut down again for the whole evening. Idk if I'm expecting too much from her, Idk if she's going to leave me because I'm slowly changing from the man she married into someone different, I'm scared, I can't lose her but I can't deny who I am, either, i feel more stuck than before I came out to her.	"I went through some similar experiences with my (cishet) wife when I came out. She was very vocally supportive, immediately asked me what pronouns I wanted her to use, has always checked in on my comfort level with things like what terms to use for me (went from husband to spouse, daddy to baba, etc.), when it's ok to correct people for misgendering me and that sort of thing. However, when I would take actual steps towards starting some sort of physical transition, she would get very emotional and then shut down, get distant, upset and we would have to have a big talk about it. We've been married for 16 years and our relationship has always been based on lots of open communication and checking in with each other on things emotionally, but it was difficult. She even went so far as to say that mentally/intellectually she wanted to be supported and accepted trans/nonbinary people, but felt herself reacting negatively emotionally and having some homophobic and transphobic gut reactions. Which was really tough on me, because I had been repressed and in the closet for like 25 years, I finally came out and then I had to immediately pump the breaks and mediate the experience for someone else's comfort level. So it was a lot of small steps, support, big meltdown and regression, talking it through, slowing down and waiting for things to cool down, then taking a small step. It got progressively easier and less dramatic and traumatic over the past almost 11 months now. Now I'm on HRT and my wife actually gives me genuine compliments on things that make me feel affirmed in my gender. It's not like everything is perfect, it's an ongoing process, but there was a lot of really exhausting hand holding, while I was going through a process of changes, where I needed support and ended up supporting someone else for having to go through the process of dealing with my changes. There is give and take though, she's certainly supported me emotionally through a lot of insecurity and vulnerability that I haven't been used to for a long time. I'm not even particularly fem in my presentation really, I aspire much more towards a soft butch presentation and changing the body underneath (which is sloooooowwwwww, for my taste), so my external changes were relatively tame, but I was hiding behind a bushy beard and baggy clothes for like 20 years. The changes were much more huge for my wife, in terms of context and concept, because I consider myself transneutral and so I've been ""demasculinizing"" more so than ""feminizing"", if that makes any sense. Either way, it's still a huge change and a lot of other things have changed with it or coincidentally around the same time.

&#x200B;

Hang in there, if she's generally on board, there might be an extended ""mourning period"" for her to emotions and internal sense of stability to catch up with the things she accepts intellectually and philosophically. If you need anyone to talk to, feel free to DM me anytime.

Being Nonbinary is tough	"I wanna cry sometimes. 

I'm a transmasc (18), and I don't think I'll ever feel satisfied without T. 
I wanna be perceived as boy sorta, but I'm not comfortable being seen as a man. I don't use he/him or she/her pronouns. Just they/them I suppose. I hate pronouns...

Though I don't wanna be seen as a man, I get so sad that T probably isn't the right option for me. I hesitate sm with it. I wanna be more masculine but I don't want facial hair n stuff. I'm so jealous of those who can go on T. I feel so dumb sometimes. I'm never gonna look the way I want. I'm also really short, (4'9) so I just feel even more shitty. 
I feel so alone sometimes. I don't feel transmasc enough. Which Idk is a dumb thought. I want top surgery so bad. But I may not be able to afford it.  


I'm so lost. What should I even do.."	"facial hair takes a while to develop on T, and you don't have to take T your entire life to have some of the masculinizing effects. it's not a magic solution that lets you pick and choose which effects you get, but there *are* options between no T at all and ""looking like a man"".

of course, none of this is necessary at all to be valid, but I don't want bad information to keep you from doing something you could potentially benefit from
I've found that I have to accept that this is largely a mental game. I will pretty much be misgendered forever.  I'll never be seen by anyone as who I am unless I tell them and they care to make an effort. That's so incredibly rare. So I force myself to not care about others and concentrate on accepting and finding ways to be myself. Over time I'll do what I can to adapt my appearance but being nonbinary is super tough... no doubt. Sometimes I wish I could just transition physically so I could come close to passing as something but that's not really what I want.. it's not me. This is a shitty answer I know. But I don't see an option but to just be who you are, be vocal and direct with people, and accept that there will always be those who don't get it.
Some effects of testosterone can be decreased with the help of DHT blockers! An article here:  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7356977/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7356977/)
most hospitals in the USA legally have to forgive your bills if you make under a certain amount of income because of Charity Care Policies (see [https://by-alnazar.tumblr.com/post/644124756925415424](https://by-alnazar.tumblr.com/post/644124756925415424)) and other countries likely have similar things + you should really google ""\[country/state/city\] (trans) \[financial/medical\] \[aid/assistance\]"" or similar to find other discounts and assistance (trans-specific or not)

dysphoria and other distress can be helped through mental health education and therapy that teaches constructive ways to cope with and view things - I strongly recommend looking for trans-specific online mental health resources and for LGBT support centers or trans-educated therapists in your area but you will also benefit from general resources like these:

* https://www.therapistaid.com (educational materials, excercises and worksheets for therapists to give their clients that you can use by yourself too)
* mental health apps like Sanvello and Wysa (they make things very accessible)
* https://www.verywellmind.com/about-explanatory-styles-3145110 (a really short read but very useful and illuminating)
* https://positivepsychology.com/mental-health-exercises-interventions (a big, detailed overview with explanations, pointers and links)
Agreed. I always recommend talking to an endo to see what your options are. There are a lot of different T formulations out there, plus other things besides T that may help. And there are a lot of different ways to take them, and different bodies react differently to their effects. It's a lot more complicated than ""become man or never try T at all."" I hope you find a way to be comfortable as yourself, OP! Whatever form that takes.
Came here to suggest this!
Oh my... I’ve been researching for ages and had pretty much written off going on T, this changes everything 😍
Right! I got excited when I learnt about these, since I'm definitely not interested in bottom or hair growth. I recommend searching through the subreddit for discussions about DHT blockers, but I have this one that sounds promising.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/ka2ipp/6ish\_months\_on\_nonbinary\_hrt\_t\_finasteride\_long/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/ka2ipp/6ish_months_on_nonbinary_hrt_t_finasteride_long/)
Thank you so much! Masculinity still feels a bit... complicated for me (working on a post about it) but knowing how much personalization is available is really helpful.
You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Take your time :\]"	njwt7o	NonBinary	20	0.95	2021-05-24 12:28:17
I hate how I can't cry	I'm a 16 yo AMAB genderfluid kid, pre everything for context. It's been almost two months since I first hatched and I've been getting a lot more sad episodes lately where something switches in my either caused by external or internal factors or just be random and I start feeling terrible and on the brink of tears. The worst part is that even if I'm in a place where I can cry, my body won't let me, so all I can feel is the pain of tears straining in my eyes and I can't release more than a few tears. It's aggravating and I absolutely hate it. It's just one of the minor but important to me problems of being an almost completely closeted trans kid.	"I have that problem.
I think it's because we grow up learning how to not cry. Always being shamed for crying. So we just put up this mental wall.
hey, if you need someone to talk to. i’m here for you. 16 and nb, might be helpful for you to talk to another teenager who can understand what you’re going through
I can't cry either it really sucks I'm not sure why but you're not alone
Maybe there is some kind of crying therapy
I had that problem too, when I was your age. Which is weird, because I was in a really bad depressive episode in my teens.

What I did was watching super sad movies. That kind of unlocked something, knowing that everyone cries at this and that if someone catches me, I could say ""Oh, the movie is just really sad"" instead of diving into the mountain of shit my emotional problems were.

Watch Hachiko. Maybe it helps. Maybe not. If it doesn't, it's still a good movie.
That happened to me a lot more as a kid. Now I have a best friend who I feel safe around, and who really listens ans reflects on what I say when I tell him about how I feel, and sometimes I can't stop crying now.

Idk what all the circumstance is, but it could be everything from not feeling safe to release to not having a proper balance of chemicals and hormones in your body. If you can start seeing a therapist or psychiatrist it might help, if this problem is really bothering you. Also finding people who can break through your walls and help you feel safe, like something is different and better than the thing you're sad about."	dsrlxe	NonBinary	21	1.0	2019-11-07 03:24:38
MY TOP SURGERY JOURNEY ❤‍🩹	"**Hello I'm Nico :)**

**They/Them**

**20yrs old**

**148lbs**

**5’4ft**

&#x200B;

**Surgeon:** Dr.Lawrence Draper

**Location:** Bronx, New York

**Payment:** Covered by Insurance

&#x200B;

I had Top Surgery (Double Incision w/ free nipple grafts) on August 30, 2021. It was the best day of my life. I’ve had a smooth recovery and *LOTS* of help from my mom. This is my personal experience.

&#x200B;

# SURGERY DAY👨🏻‍⚕️

I arrived at the hospital at around 8:30am with my mom. She got to sit with me in the waiting area until they took me away to get ready in a preparation area for patients. We hugged each other tight.

In the preparation area I was instructed to take \*all\* of my clothes off and put on a hospital gown, cap, and socks. I put all of my belongings in a bag (Except phone for now).

I was sitting down in one of those hospital beds that turn into chairs. There were rows of them with other patients and we were separated with curtains. I spent about 2hrs here. During these 2hrs I was texting my mom, answering questions from a nurse, my surgeon arrived and marked me up, met my anesthesiologist and I got the IV in, called my mom one last time because I was being taken to the operating room!

Best little walk of my life. Just me in my little hospital socks, carrying my IV bag in my hands, walking to the operating room with my anesthesiologist. No anxiety! Just happiness!

*I felt so safe.*

&#x200B;

**Operating Room:**  I hear a nurse excitedly say “Omg they’re here!” That felt so nice. I walk in and see a team of (estimate) 5 nurses just preparing everything and waiting for me. I was greeted with so much love. They started getting me ready! There was a T shaped operating bed waiting for me :) The nurse opened my gown from behind, and left it covering my front, and I laid there butt naked on this bed with my arms out like Jesus Christ. Man that room was cold! As I laid there I can remember they started sticking these heating pads on different parts of my body (thighs, shins, arms,etc.). I hate to admit it but I love being pampered and feeling taken care of and loved so you can imagine how much I enjoyed this day. I just stared at the ceiling while they were getting me ready; just chilling and listening to the music. Yup! a lot of surgeons listen to music while operating so I guess my doc’s playlist was all set up.

**General Anesthesia**: SO COOL! My anesthesiologist started doing his thing, one of the nurses told me “you’re about to go on a vacation okay?” out like a light. With the anesthesia there was no falling asleep slowly. Just OUT. I closed my eyes and opened them again and the operation was DONE!

**Waking up from Anesthesia**: I was under for around 3hrs. The first thing I remember was being picked up by multiple nurses by the sheet under me and transferred onto another bed. I felt like myself BUT dumb and very talkative. I was saying everything that was on my mind. I told all the nurses I loved them one by one and they had to say it back one by one, it made them laugh a lot. I heard one call me a sweetheart :) my voice was really raspy due to the tube they put down your throat during surgery.

**Recovery Room:** They rolled me out of the operating room and took me to the recovery room. There I met a new nurse. This was the only time I remember feeling any pain in my chest/incisions, she immediately put something in my IV and it went away fast. The entire time I was in the recovery room I was extremely sleepy due to everything. The nurse kept talking to me to keep me from falling asleep. She changed my gauze pads, taught me how to change my drains, and somehow I retained all of this information despite being high asf. I received a folder with instructions for everything anyway. She proceeded to put my clothes on; she pointed out how convenient it was that I brought a large button up shirt ;) in general I had loose clothing and easy to put on shoes.

**Discharge**: The wheelchair ride. That was cool too. I’m just having a blast this day. A staff member took me to finally see my mom! she gave me so many kisses! she wasn’t able to see me until this moment due to Covid restrictions. Anyway, we waited outside the hospital for our cab and went home :)

# RECOVERY ❤️‍🩹

&#x200B;

**WEEK 1:**

**Sleeping**: I slept at around a 40° angle with two pillows on my back, my mastectomy pillow under my arms, and a pillow under my knees—it takes pressure off your back so it’s a must!

**Drains**: Most challenging part of recovery. They were uncomfortable and at times painful.

**Itching:** After around 3 days, my skin started itching like crazy because of the tape on my incisions and my drains. It was frustrating.

**Showering:** Sponge bath from the waist down. I received help from my mom. She did everything to be honest I just stood there haha.

**REST!:** Resting is probably the most important part of recovery, rest bro. I watched New Girl on Netflix (10/10). Happy & funny. Do not watch sad shows/movies during recovery!

**Neck Pillow:** Biggest regret was not buying a neck pillow. Your neck is gonna hurt. It is a must!

**Mom**: I couldn’t have done it without her. She made me breakfast, lunch, and snacks. She gave me my pills. She helped me get up when I was sitting or lying down. She slept with me. She helped me change my drains. She helped me with everything.

**Post-Op Depression**: I had post-op depression at this time and didn’t know it. I had read about it but I strongly believed it wouldn’t happen to me. It can happen to you too, please prepare yourself for that possibility.

&#x200B;

**WEEK 2:**

**Post-Op Visit: (August 7)**

**Removing Drains:** No pain. No discomfort. No feeling at all. A nurse removed my drains and I didn’t feel a thing. However I did feel *RELIEF;* Drains out, itchy tape off!

**Seeing My Results:** My chest was still swollen which put my nipples in a distorted position. My scars and nipples looked gory. I was happy to no longer have breasts! BUT I couldn’t be happy about my results yet because of the reasons I mentioned above. Keep that in mind so you won’t get discouraged!

**Seeing my surgeon**: He was very happy when he saw me! My healing was going great! what looks gory or scary to us looks beautiful to our surgeons. He proceeded to put my dressings on my nipples and show me how to change them. I changed them every 2 days.

**First Shower:** GLORY. GLORY. GLORY. I love showering but this shower hit different. Water and soap. No scrubbing my chest of course, but I could let the water and soap run through it.

**Sleeping**: Since drains are out I could now sleep on my back! I kept sleeping with a pillow under my knees and my mastectomy pillow. It is just very comfy.

**Sleeping on my side**: I started sleeping on my side in the middle of week 2. I hugged a pillow to keep my chest (incisions) from wrinkling. My doctor didn’t tell me to do that but sometimes you have to listen to your gut, it gives good advice.

**Pets**: I have a pup and a cat. This is where the mastectomy pillow came in handy the most, it kept them from hurting me in case they randomly jumped on my chest.

**Realizing I had Post-op Depression:** It was an “oh-“ moment. It was also a “wow i wish my dumbass would’ve prepared for this and wouldn’t have disregarded the possibility of it happening to me” moment. Not knowing you have post-op depression is BAD because you will believe you are unhappy with your surgery. Once I knew I was going through it, it took a lot of weight off my shoulders. I knew I just had to be patient and not drown in it.

**Treating Post-Op Depression (+Anxiety):**

“What if I don’t like my results?”

“What if I don’t get better?”

“Why am I sad”

My brain turned against me. I hadn’t had anxiety this bad in a long time. What helped with post-surgery depression was distracting myself with other (easy & light) activities, staying hydrated, and reminding myself that this is temporary and my healing is a delicate process. The only way out is through. It WILL get better.

**The rest of this week**: I kept getting better both emotionally and physically. We kept changing my dressings. My healing was going so well and so fast. Receiving love & support from my mom and my friends helped immensely.

**Changing my dressings:** My mom changed my nipple dressings every two days as instructed. It was a scary process. Despite the fact that I knew nipple scabbing would happen I was still finding ways to be anxious lol. “What if this isn’t scabbing? my nipple is coming off?! why is it so pink? that looks like my human flesh! it isn’t my nipple! it came off!” Spoiler alert, it wasn’t; everything was good.

**Wearing shirts**: Swelling went down a lot. Seeing how flat I was…speechless. Happy.

**T-Rex Arms**: I didn’t deal with this, I felt no pain BUT I did not raise my arms higher than shoulder height.

&#x200B;

**WEEK 3:**

**Second Post-Op Visit:**

**Me**: I was in much better spirits. Swelling had gone down A LOT so my nipples were in better positions. Also a nurse had just told me that my nipples are doing great which boosted my excitement even more.

**Seeing my surgeon:** He was happy to see me and I was happy to see him :) He said I didn’t need the dressings anymore, just needed to apply Aquaphor on my nipples twice a day. He also said I could start scar-care when i’m 5 weeks post-op. Everything was great! I thanked him for everything. He scheduled an appointment 3 months from here which is December 22, 2021.

*(****Note****: I couldn't make it to this appointment so I rescheduled for February 8, 2022)*

But from this moment on, everything only got better.

# BIG FAST FORWARD :

*(I had this \[journal/report\] in my notes on my phone, I didn't have much to update this note on after my 1 month post-op so I let it sit there until it was ready to get posted here. After 1 month post-surgery it has been about living my new life while my scars heal)*

**27 WEEKS - February 8, 2022.**

**Last Post-Op Visit:** I was welcomed by a nurse as usual, she complimented my scars and how well I was taking care of my skin. This made me feel so good. Dr.Draper came in and we were happy to see each other again. He asked me questions about my satisfaction with the surgery and how it has impacted my dysphoria, I told him my chest dysphoria was gone! He took pictures of my results and said this was the last post-op visit until next year. I'm usually not an affectionate person with anyone besides my mom and emotions make me cringe a lot but I hugged Dr.Draper and thanked him for changing my life.

&#x200B;

**Other Info**:

**Scar Care**: My scar care consists of silicone tape on scars, then when the tape comes off (about 7 days, I always shower with them) I apply cocoa butter on my scars and massage them for around 10 minutes. I do this twice a day for a few days then put brand new silicone strips on my scars. Repeat.

**Satisfaction**: I am very happy with my results!

**Gender Identity:** All I know is that I am not binary, I don't fit in the category of boy **or** girl. I know Nonbinary is an umbrella term \[over agender, genderfluid, etc.\] but it gives me a headache to try to pick one so yeah, I'm just Nonbinary.

**Testosterone**: Never been on it. Thinking about it. I'm looking into what it is like to go on it for a few weeks/months in order to gain androgynous features.

&#x200B;

# BEST THINGS ABOUT HAVING TOP-SURGERY:

# 

* The increase in confidence & self love.
* Doing all the things I couldn’t do pre-op due to dysphoria.
* If I need to go out, I just pick a T shirt and put it on…easy as that. No binder, no preparation, just feel the shirt touch my chest and breathing comfortably.
* Wearing tank tops.
* Hot? simple solution, just take shirt off!
* Showering, turns out bathing a body you love is an entirely different experience.
* Wrapping my towel around my waist when exiting the shower.
* Being comfortable at the sight of my nude body.
* Sleeping topless or even better, sleeping in nothing but boxers.
* Laying on my stomach without breasts pressing on my chest.
* Wearing chains. The sight of my chains and necklaces when I'm shirtless or wearing a tank-top makes me feel SO attractive.
* Bubble baths! I used to wear a tank top to avoid looking at my breasts during bubble baths. Also the breasts don’t stick out of the water, my whole body is submerged now.
* Hugs. When I am hugging women our breasts no longer press against each other. When I am hugging men both our chests are flat.
* Cuddling with my pets.
* Running or going down/up the stairs without *them* bouncing.
* Feeling the wind on my torso..*.chefs kiss*.
* When sitting down, simply sitting up and sitting back! No more slouching to hide the chesticles.
* LIFE

*I didn’t rank this from best to whatever…everything in this list is equally amazing.*

# TODAY:

Today it is March 14, of 2022, I am 6 months post-op!  I didn't realize how much breasts and the dysphoria they gave me really impacted my personality and the way I'd carry myself until I didn't have them anymore. Therefore, the past few months have been about learning who I am and how I behave with a body that feels more mine than ever before.

Anyway, Top-Surgery is the best decision I've ever made. August 30, 2021 was the best day ever, I was born again. if I could relive this day I would, but I will settle for it being a golden memory I can replay in my head for the rest of my life. My surgeon and the amazing team in that operating room will forever have a special place in my heart; I may not know their names and my time awake with them was very brief but I will never forget the love I felt in that operating room. *Thank you!*

More Thank Yous: To the subs that were there for me during the hardest times, whether people gave me advice or simply listened to me, it helped immensely. Thank you to the people that paved the way for me. I hope I am helping those to come as well.

# Special Message To People Pre-Op:

&#x200B;

I know, I know, and I see you! I was where you are right now, searching every corner of the internet for posts like these...now I'm the one making them. At some point during the waiting, I genuinely thought the surgery was too good to be true, remember not to listen to that voice because it is good and it will be true. Carrying a body part you don't want has to be one of the greatest challenges ever. Good news is that all the effort you are putting into keeping yourself alive and healthy right now until **your day** comes is worth it and it will pay off! Our journey is one with literal blood, sweat, and tears. In the end, regardless of your pronouns, binary or outside the binary, *we see you* and the only validation you need is from *yourself*. Right now, stay active, exercise, rest, eat well, yoga, music, hobbies, do anything that brings you even a bit of joy and entertainment! I call it collecting happy chemicals!

&#x200B;

**IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT SOMETIMES BUT YOU GET STRONGER EVERYDAY YOU ARE HERE, GO ON SOLDIER!!!**

&#x200B;

***With love, Nico.***"	"Hey Congrats on your surgery journey!! I’m so glad you made a post like this sharing your top surgery with the world, it’s really encouraging and i found myself relating to so much of the problems you experienced with your chest and the dysphoria. I’m pre-op right now with a very limited support system (who knows if i’ll find someone to accompany me to surgery) and seeing how much support and love that you had is encouraging. When my time comes to yeet the teets i’ll document my journey and share it so that people like me (esp with my chest size whoo, lord) can have a reference and inspiration to keep going and achieve their dreams of body and gender freedom and euphoria. Keep being yourself and never settle for less than what you deserve! Thank you!

Spouse unsure he will ever see me as non-binary	"So I have been dating my spouse for almost 10 years and we have been married for maybe 4. I came out to my spouse as non-binary maybe a year plus ago now and I had thought everything was going fine. He has always been super supportive and accommodating but i was still really surprised at how well he was taking it. He used my correct pronouns when talking to other people really consistently and never took me up on my offer to talk about it.

But, this past weekend we had friends over and he messed up my pronouns a lot and it was okay, everyone makes mistakes, but I still talked to him later about it because it was unexpected.

Turns out he has a hard time using my pronouns when he is “talking quickly” because he has to consciously think to use the correct ones everytime (which hats off to him for putting that work it). He admitted to still basically seeing me as a woman and is unsure if he ever will be able to change that but is trying to. We talked about how I might want to get top surgery but I am unsure but I wouldn’t want him to not love me anymore because of it and he said that I shouldn’t worry about that because I have lots of other things to love (which was really nice and helpful) and that I shouldn’t have to worry about him in my decision for my own body (but I definitely don’t think I can commit to not taking his opinion into consideration because him leaving me would really negatively impact my happiness so I would prefer to avoid it).

He said he still doesn’t understand me being non-binary. He says he doesn’t feel attached to his agab so the “I don’t feel like a man or a woman” doesn’t really click as different for him. I said I think I feel happier presenting how I have been and identifying as I have been, which he accepted but I don’t think it helped him understand. He wants to understand and consumes a lot of lgbtq media but I don’t think he connects things to me. I watch a lot of non-binary youtubers and share vids with him too. But I think it is just something that will take more time for him.

Basically I just feel sad and insecure. And want support from someone who isnt my therapist.

TLDR: thought my spouse was 100% on board with me not being a woman but it turns out it’s more like 70%- he supports me and wants me to do what makes me happy and loves me but he still sees me as a woman."	" I went through a similar experience coming out to my partner of 5 years. He didn’t take it well at all (first response was “oh you’re jumping on that bandwagon”) and couldn’t understand how I present as femme still but prefer different pronouns. He still uses she/her and we don’t really talk about it anymore, as a result I’m scared to come out to anyone else and feel invalidated. 
He also is very supportive of his trans or queer friends and never slips up their pronouns, which kind of hurts more that I don’t get the same treatment or level of understanding. 

I guess I don’t have any real advice but I hope it helps to hear that you’re VALID no matter what and I know how much it hurts when your loved ones don’t take it seriously or understand. Your spouse sounds like he’s really trying and I hope he can come to fully understand and validate you so you can be comfortable with who you are  💕
My spouse is kinda the same way. I think what matters is that they both seem to be putting genuine effort into it! Just the other day I had to tell my spouse to just say “nonbinary” instead of “identified as nonbinary” because that kind of language made me feel like he was putting the onus on me and not acknowledging who I intrinsically am. He took the correction really well, but I know it will be a process. I have hope because I’m half Filipino and extremely white-passing and when we were first dating years ago he admitted that he didn’t really think of me as Filipino, but white, but now he knows that being Filipino is a huge part of my identity and he now sees me as being Filipino. I think it’s gonna be a similar  process for him to really see me as nonbinary. I guess all that to say keep the hope alive and take comfort in him really making a concentrated effort! It seems like he’s really open to conversation and it will happen, just in baby steps. You’ve got this!
Hi, 51yo afab nonbinary person here. My spouse (40 next week) is a trans man. He has been incredibly supportive, affirming, and wonderful about changes to language, about changes to my expression, about my consideration of medical transition.

*However* he is no longer sexually attracted to me. That's been a challenge for us, but we've navigated it pretty well.
Thank you for sharing and for you validation. I really appreciate it ❤️
Thank you! I really appreciate it!
It’s good to hear that you both have navigated that well! I hope we would be able to. It gives me hope that atleast it’s a thing people have navigated.
A friend of mine who had redefined her relationship with her husband after their sex life ended really helped me with it. It wasn't easy for us, but it's really good to know now how solid we are.

We are poly, and that certainly helps. But we had a very active and passionate sex life in the beginning and it took a lot of work on both our parts to find ways to consciously create the intimacy that sex made more or less automatic for us."	irjq30	NonBinary	20	1.0	2020-09-12 20:06:45
Folx who’ve done HRT: were you 100% sure about your decision at the time?	"Hey everyone!

For many years now, I’ve been struggling to try and figure out if I want to go on testosterone. I keep thinking and rethinking the choice in excruciating detail, but I just can’t seem to reach a place of total clarity regarding my decision. 

I met with a provider who told me that they wouldn’t prescribe testosterone to me unless I seemed 100000% sure of my decision. 

But… to me it seems like such a complex decision that I’m not sure if I could EVER be 100% certain. You know what I mean? 

I don’t hate my body right now. I often think I look pretty good or attractive. But… I also can’t say I’m completely at peace with myself or my body. My dysphoria sort of ebbs and flows, and I think that’s the hardest part for me. 

If I lived on an island all alone, I think maybe I wouldn’t bother to medically transition, because in my eyes, to myself, I am already enough of a man (term used loosely in a non-binary transmasc way haha). I personally don’t see anything wrong with my body or my voice a lot of the time. But the social dysphoria of being constantly misgendered is just getting to me. And I definitely notice dysphoria affecting me onstage as an actor, and can’t help but wonder how much more comfortable and confident I could be as an actor if I started hrt. 

Part of me just wants to honor the body I’ve lived with so far, and the life I have lived so far, being raised as AFAB. I guess this is probably gonna sound kind of weird, but I sort of fear that transitioning medically will be me discarding my younger self, or telling them that they weren’t good enough for me. 

Sorry this kind of turned into a vent. I’ve just been feeling kind of sad and struggling with this decision for such a long time, and it feels like I still can’t get to a place of complete clarity. I’ll talk this over again with my therapist in a couple days as well."	"I was really conflicted, microdosed estradiol for two years, still very conflicted. Wasn't sure until after I'd seen  more significant changes, but now I'm absolutely sure it was the right choice. 

I didn't hate my body either before transitioning. I just felt ambivalent about it. I didn't realize it's possible to love being in the body you're in until I'd been on HRT for some time. 

Cis people, especially gatekeepers, don't want to hear about social dysphoria. But that's always been my biggest frustration and reason for transitioning, and that's valid. 

In the end, you get to decide whether to medically transition or not, what that looks like, and what the significance of that decision means to you. But what you're feeling is very normal, and I remember feeling similar in a lot of ways. Everyone is different, but for me, I know now that starting my transition was the right choice.
I wasn’t 10000%. Similar to you, my dysphoria ebbs and flows. I always identified as feminine to myself. I only had female friends, female doctors etc. I started HRT to achieve more androgynous features. To make the outside match the inside. I don’t know if as an enby you will ever be absolutely certain. Trans people usually are because they identify with the opposite gender expression. Being enby involves keeping some of your existing body for the most part. Subsequently, I feel like HRT will always have a slight degree of doubt, at least for me.
I was 100% sure but that doesn’t mean you have to be. 

If this thing has been on your mind for so long & is such an item of intense meditation in your life, I think that’s enough of a “want” to explore the possibility of it being a “need.” 

The idea that you gotta be 100% sure before medically transitioning is cut from the same cloth as “you need dysphoria to be trans,” which is transmedicalism. I don’t buy it for a second. Imho if you decide on impulse one day that u wanna take hormones—no thought whatsoever—you should just do it. because how will you know unless you try it out & see how it makes you feel? 

It’s not like you’re gonna instantly transform into a whole different person on the first injection. changes take months. years. there’s plenty of time to contemplate as you go along. plus you can always stop. and if you change your mind? start back up again. 

gender is a fickle thing that should not be medicalized, imho. i believe in rugged self-determination. nobody can tell you who you are—not even a doctor. 

I don’t know if you live in a jurisdiction that has informed consent, but look into that. walk in, sign a bunch of papers & they give you the hormones no questions asked. at least that’s how it works in the US.  

so I’m gonna be the bad influence & suggest you to say “I am 10000% sure I want to take testosterone because I experience intense dysphoria without it.” It’s not 100% true, but also *fuck* gatekeeping doctors. if he still won’t give you the hormones, go to another doctor. And another. And another, until you find someone who will prescribe you. 

I cannot possibly describe the extent to which I hate transmedicalism & the cruel system that gatekeeps our medicine from us & gaslights us into thinking we don’t need it.
I can't speak to your situation, since my dysphoria is fairly consistent and often intense, but certainly there are parts of HRT (in my case, being AMAB, chest growth) which I wasn't entirely comfortable with until I actually started the process.
I didn't want hrt and was pretty ambivalent about most of the effects honestly. I only started it so I would get gendered female less and to grow descent facial hair. Tomorrow will make 16 months and I was just talking about how weird it is to not hate looking in the mirror
I started with the intent to be on T for a month initially and gauge how I felt about it before either continuing or not. After a month, I really enjoyed what was happening with my body. At this point, 7 months later, i’ve got quite a bit of facial hair, which is really euphoric for me. I love being able to shave and use a DE razor and have my little rituals. The only issue is I’m closeted with my older family members and i’m afraid them finding out would ruin our relationship. If I was by myself on an island I would 100% want to take T indefinitely. Also, a lot of the changes I thought i’d be uncomfortable with like bottom growth and body hair increases have honestly been some of the most euphoric changes i’ve experienced
Consider some of the changes that being on T will bring out in you and how hard these will be to ""undo"" if you don't like them. PMS was debilitating for me and not having to deal with that has been amazing. On a social level, I think me starting hrt has helped my family accept me and my agenderness better because I was taking action to make changes for myself. Not being binary, though, means that being gendered properly will always be a bit more of a struggle because most of society is set so people sort strangers as male or female. My deeper voice and facial hair lumps me solidly in with other men.

Also, try thinking of other ways to regard these changes. It's like a second puberty, which didn't negate your childhood. You will also be retaining a lot of the socialization from your formative years and you can use that help make the world a better place. I'm read as male most of the time and I am aware of the dangers that my more feminine friends have been brought up to fear because I was lectured on those, too. Thus, I'm more than willing to walk with them and be a safe, reliable person.

Another thought: Are you able to access counselors who are knowledgeable about transitioning and similar topics? They can also help you navigate this choice and maybe even decide on a dosage that works for you. You may never find that every cell in your body is in agreement that you want this. But only you can know if this is a step you want to take, or if you want to try another approach. If it helps, the counselor I'm seeing currently has suggested considering all the different approaches I'm taking to manage my anxiety and related issues as science experiments. If I don't have good results or I can't follow through, it's not a failure, but just more data to help narrow down what *will* work.

Good luck!
I'm currently not doing HRT, but I tried it for a few weeks in an attempt to speedrun gender questioning. I was hoping I'd really love or hate the neurological effects and that'd be my answer. It didn't work, I'm still confused, but you might have better luck. 

Remember that you're putting medications into your body because you want to, for your own reasons. If you want to take T for a few weeks and then decide whether or not to stop, you should get to do that. If you want to take a gamble, it's your right to take that risk, and anyone standing in your way is in the wrong.
I wasn’t, but once I started seeing the effects I’ve never been happier
I had to wait 26 years... I was...99999999.999999% certain. I may not have gotten great physical results beyond super soft skin... But it's still worth it.
I think you might have started a good internal dialogue, and you actually said that if you've lived on an island by yourself you wouldn't bother. On the other hand the social consequences are what drive the dysphoria. But then again who said it will go away even if you start HRT? And dysphoria aside, what would make you feel euphoric?

I recommend reaching to a gender affirming or at least a trans friendly therapist to help you on your journey of figuring it out. HRT can have all sorts of bodily changes you might not feel comfortable with as an enby. A professional could help you figure yourself out better and help you with your needs, with and without the lenses of society.

I personally don't know what's right for you. But I do know since HRT is a serious process, you should have good people to lean on while taking this journey.

Good luck❤️
Transmasc on T for a year here 
I am prolly Gunna get hate for this but I was not sure at all when I started, and I was very open about that to all my doctor's and therapists. My therapist is the one who convinced me to try, I had been wanting to go on t for a while but just wasn't sure, until my therapist said something along the lines of ""you can always try it! What's the worse that can happen?"" And for me, since ""the worst"" that could happen would be seeing the changes I wanted to see from testosterone, I decided to try it. My doctor alleviated more stress about it, informing me of all the changes that would reverse if I stopped t as well as the ones that would stay. She even suggested Lazer hair removal if I decided I didn't like the hair (I was unsure about facial hair at the time) which helped too. 
(Side note: as someone who's nonbinary sometimes I know we're not always looking for ALL the changes of t, and while you can't pick and choose which effects you see, there are things to be done about certain aspects, for example I wasn't sure about facial hair at first so I was prescribed a topical cream to prevent it from coming in. If anything like this is stopping you, just talk to your doc!! There's usually a solution!!)
I think it also helped that I wanted to start at a microdose, I was on a half pump of gel for about 6 months before I went up to a full dose. That helped the discomfort around things too, since changes were so slow. That's how I knew it was really right for me, is that I noticed myself becoming excited for the changes and almost upset that they weren't coming faster. 
Personally going on t was the best thing for me and my mental health, when I started I initially thought I would stop it one day once I'd seen the changes I wanted in my voice and such but now I want to stay on it, I am tremendously at peace. 

Idk. My best recommendation is to get a trans therapist. Like a therapist who is trans. That's what helped me through everything more than anything!!!
Hi there, trans masc nb actor here. I was so nervous to start testosterone, because while I wasn't upset with my body, I was upset with being misgendered. I found a provider who started me on a slightly low dose of T with the understanding that, as I was an nonbinary person, I may want to stop eventually. I'm still taking it years later because I enjoy the effects it's caused, but I was so unsure for the first few months. I find myself more comfortable on stage because I feel like I'm being seen by others properly. It's still hard sometimes, especially when I get bitter about the fact that I felt I had to change for others to take me seriously.

All in all, I wasn't sure. Hell, I may change my mind in a few months still. But if it feels like something that can help you, I say go for it
Nope! HRT has always been something that I kinda felt out slowly as I went. I was sure I wanted to try it, see how I felt and if I liked it, but not at all sure if it was something I wanted long term or would enjoy all the changes of. I went on T for a little over half a year initially, got some voice changes and thought that'd be enough and went off for awhile. Eventually realized I wasn't happy off T and 2 years later resumed w a DHT blocker, and now I'm p happy and intend to stay on this combo long term, but who knows! We will see where fate takes you. To me what's important is doing whatever feels right or needed right now, and checking in with yourself and your needs as you go and making decisions along the way accordingly, not being 100% married to being on HRT or off HRT. obviously it's great if someone knows for 100% what they want. Good for them. But I feel things are always gonna be a bit more murky and experimental for me as a nonbinary person and I'm okay with that. I'm confident in my choices yet also very open to and ready for the possibility that at some point I could decide its no longer for me and change my mind.
I felt scared because its a big change. It has been the best ~75 days of my life since I started. 

I struggle sometimes with enjoying being trans or even wanting to be trans, but I am trans. It was the right decision even if it's scary. 

Life is scary. But now it's beautiful too.
Nah, 90% is good enough to start. Even less.

The only 100% certainty you need is the certainty you can live with the changes that result, no matter how your feelings evolve. Think about what's permanent, what can be reversed, and what can be minimized.
I think being 100% certain you want something isnt the same as being 100% certain youll love all the results, just that you understand the potential outcomes and have made the decision to accept whatever risk of negative results.

I was 100% certain that I wanted T. I would hate to start balding. The acne and oily skin wasnt a pleasant idea either (tho it was better bc it isnt permanent). And i made a decision. 


You need to be 100% certain that you want this and understand that *you* are the one responsible for this. 

They ask this bc they dont want people doing it hc they feel pressured. And they dont want people doing it them coming for them after if its not he result they dont like. 


Amd irt to the co cern for th younger you... dont forget that that younger you is still you. Wouldnt you want your younger self to pursue what would make them happy and more comfortable? If so... why wouldnt *you* do that?

Physically transitioning isnt dishonoring who you were in the past. You dont need to remain stagnant in a place your not comfortable just to honor who you were. 

You can (and in my opinion its better to) honor who you were by becoming (and by extention, allowing your younger self to become) the best version of you that you can.
Hell no.
But I was after that first dose.
This is very reassuring to read, thanks :)!"	z4xogu	NonBinary	19	0.92	2022-11-26 04:13:25
Been a bit kinda sad trying to get out of a funk. Chilly but painted my nails this morning for some serotonin💋🌞🌈 hope y'all have a good day.		Oooh you were feeling blue, now your nails are blue. That looks like art to me! Have a nice weekend 🥰	rdb4sz	NonBinary	19	0.96	2021-12-10 15:30:10
I feel inconvenient and excluded (and am sad and tired)	"I used to identify as a non-binary woman, but for years now have exclusively identified as non-binary, and basically no longer go to women's spaces (they treat me and expect me to act like a woman, and I honestly can't do it anymore) 

Occasionally if there's a space I'm really interested in checking out or joining, I'll message the organizers and ask them if non-binary folks are welcome, and if so can they reflect that in their published language. I mostly don't ask anymore, because most of the time, the answer is no. And it gets really demoralizing after a while.   
\^ ""you're okay to come, but know that people like you aren't really welcome here generally, but we'll make an exception"" or ""of course you're welcome, this is a place for women, and you definitely fit that mold! :)"" is what this feels like  
\^\^ also! if i have to ask, I've also learned that that generally means no, people like me aren't welcome :\\ cause people can change their published language about their group, but they rarely put in effort to improve their internal culture and then trans folks end up getting pushed out anyway

I basically don't feel welcome, except in explicitly queer spaces, and even then only sometimes (depending on how they handle trans and non-binary folks) :T

\---

I'm upset right now :\\ because I found a mental health community that I really wanted to join, and this played out exactly this way. They have a sub-community for women, but when I asked about being intentionally inclusive of other gender minorities, told me that it wasn't a priority and probably wouldn't happen 

I'm so tired and sad of having to expect that people like me are not welcome as default, and that we're treated as inconvenient when we ask for a little room to exist.

It feels like this: [https://webcomicname.com/post/185588404109](https://webcomicname.com/post/185588404109)

I'm so tired of feeling like I have to trailblaze making communities that welcome people like me (for all kinds of things: language learning, accountability, different hobby groups, etc), and that if I sometimes can't do it, then I just don't really get to do that thing. 

I'm just tired and sad :("	"Hugs. You're valid and I'm sorry this is happening to you. I don't feel comfortable in women's spaces either.
I only enter womens only spaces with my cis female friends and I make a point of being an escort for trans people when they need to use them too. Im at the point in my life now where I will force my way into acceptance but I had to battle for that even before I came out of any of my closets.

You might not be able to do it alone, but my group of ladies, cis and trans, all battle on everyone behalf, and the cishet lads are learning. 

Try and find yourself a group that you know will fight for you when you're too tired to fight for yourself. Its hard but once they're there you can bring more into it like I do and like my sister does with her circle
I also don't like women only spaces and hate that I keep being suggested by professionals to go to them. You're valid as all hell, my friend.
I'm sorry you have to deal with it too. It sucks so much. The main community is all genders, which would be totally fine! I usually hangout in those spaces, and just practice correcting and teaching folks how to interact with trans people

But just, dang. Making a special women's space only, and telling other gender minorities to just deal, sends a strong message :\\"	qd7lpi	NonBinary	19	0.9	2021-10-22 02:45:15
Sad that my family thinks non binary people just want attention	They refuse to acknowledge my NB friend's (lack of) gender. Keep referring to them as she and her. Makes me consider just staying in the closet as long as I know them.	"As a 46 yo parent of 2 grown children, with 2 bachelors degrees (starting grad school this fall) and identifies as agender... there are some who may be doing it for attention, but for many - like myself - its NOT a phase or being attention grabby. People like myself, responsible mature adults, can identify as they see fit and with confidence. My gender identity is as valid as the next person, and if you can't accept that, then I don't need your negativity in my life. Just my two cents worth, a reminder that not all enbys are waifish 16 yo high schooler in mixed gender clothes.
Awww that really sucks. I'm so sorry
I’m sorry that really sucks!! Keep your head high and don’t be ashamed of who you are. One day you’ll get to choose your family, and they will accept you for who you are!"	fugmb2	NonBinary	20	0.95	2020-04-03 21:12:46
I was misgendered and deadnamed in my dream yesterday😭	"I dreamed that I’m back to my school age. 
All my classmates treat me as a boy and call me (a masculine name). Some of them are gay and LGBTQ but they just think I’m a gay boy and still deadname me. 
I felt so sad but didn’t feel that I have enough courage to tell other people
“My name is Iris, and I’m a girl”
And I felt so lonely and helpless😔"	"*hugs* That sounds like a horrible nightmare! When I have realistic nightmares like this, part of what helps me is to come up for a plan (or multiple options of plans) for what I would do if I encountered that situation today. That helps me to internalize that I’m not actually helpless, that I do have some control at least over my own actions and reactions, even if not those of other people.
Thank you! I'm still in the closet and deadnamed in my daily life, yet it's still a really bad dream. And I would feel really sooooo happy if someone call me Iris in real life!
I'm so sorry this happened to you Iris!  Do you think it'd be worth coming out to your friends as a girl (and/or as nonbinary)?  In case it helps, have this:

Today Iris posted on r/NonBinary about the nightmare she had.  She hopes that someday she will have the strength to tell her friends of her true gender, so she can be surrounded by friends who support her gender in person.  But in the meantime, Iris has friends here who believe in her and will call her by her proper name and pronouns, and she can hold a good dream in her mind before sleep each night of coming out to her friends, and them hugging and loving her, and perhaps Iris will dream of this next time instead.  

\*hugs\* if wanted.  :)

I'm an idiot	"Don't you love when someone tells your gender isn't real? And you try to defend yourself but you're so upset and have trouble forming words so you just end up looking stupid and the other person comes out on top?


I feel so stupid, angry and sad because I can't even defend myself and my own gender, something that took me a long time to find and accept. It made me feel so invalidated, I honestly wondered for a second if I was in the wrong. It's been hours but I keep remembering and I guess it just hurts.."	"[deleted]
My suggestion to you? Remember that it is entirely possible that their gender also isn't real. Even if they say they're a man or woman. *Especially* if they're cishet.

&#x200B;

Why?

Recently, my dad made me question everything about gender, but not in a bad way. He said something along the lines of: ""Does having a penis make you male/a man? Does having a vagina make you female/a woman?"". 

As much as I don't want to admit it (thanks a lot, binary-gender-biased society✨), my dad has a point.
You're not stupid nor is anything wrong with you. It makes sense to be so frustrated and upset that you can't even form words when someone is invalidating a part of you that you've worked so hard to accept and express. They're the ones in the wrong here and you don't owe them any explanation nor defense. You shouldn't have to feel the need to defend your being against some bigot. None of this is your fault. Smh. You deserve better!
Ive been there. My dad refuses to believe that Im nonbinary and I have a really bad anxiety disorder so I cant even defend myself against him. I dont know how to explain to him that I exist without having a breakdown or making myself look dumb. 

But that doesnt make us stupid or wrong. They are the ignorant ones. We're not getting paid to educate jerks like that, and we dont have to listen to their worthless denials. We ARE nonbinary. We are VALID.
Thank you *hug* I was so excited because I wanted information on how to change my name so I can feel that total gender euphoria you know? And then suddenly im pushing my views onto others?? Whatever the hell that meant.

It was pointless and a  stupid ""argument"" but it still hurt reading all that because they sounded rational while i looked desperate to validate myself
You can’t say “they are the idiot” without more context. It’s good to support people but not to validate what could be an incorrect assumption or piece of information. I have trouble forming words because of ASC, but if I am sure of something then I am sure of it & generally don’t enter into a debate without being armed to the teeth with evidence and information. You saying they’re a terrible person (for debating a contentious issue) is unhelpful as we have free speech and thoughts which mean that even someone’s gender can be brought into question; especially if it is the person who has brought the question up in the first place. If the world worked the way you are implying then we would have “saints” running around burgling people’s houses because they identify as that and we can’t argue the facts as they are presents. I have often wondered though, am I different gender because I have Asperger’s (based on the reasons others give for having differing genders to that which they were born with). I get the two genders thing, but Z and Ze and all this other mess does confuse me as there is a gap in the logic… 🙃
The problem is that they kinda said that but in a very condescending way... Basically I shouldn't stereotype man and woman because its up to you what makes a man or woman and therefore I can only pretend to be change gender, I'm not sure if this is making sense??

Like he said some right stuff but he was going at this in a completely wrong way and just coming out as transphobic. It's why I was struggling so much with my words, honestly it's just frustrating
Thank you <3 i shouldn't have bothered with him in the first place but i got so upset that i just had to reply, i definitely will be smart about it in the future it's not worth getting this upset over someone i dont know nor i care for
That sounds terrible! You are absolutely valid and they are a million percent wrong.
Why are you even commenting on an almost year old comment? Especially one that is literally trying to comfort OP? I already deleted my comment because you are right, I probably could have said something better to comfort OP without resorting to calling the unknown other person stupid. However invalidating another's gender identity in not ok.
I understand. I'm glad you're thinkin' about how you'd go about it in the future. Don't be too hard on yourself this time around !
Thank you so much for saying that!
Thank you, I'll be trying my best! Actually they replied both here on the other subreddit where I asked my question but have deleted those replied, they also sent a message but I ignored. There's nothing else I can say after all

On the other hand I just got to a pet a really cute dog that gave me a lot of kisses ☺️ this must be a sign that this is the right approach
Happy to help 🥰.

Here's my first attempt at creating myself. I was sad that there was no Genderflux flag :( (This is my first post on this subreddit that I haven't deleted due to self doubt and anxiety)			fvrbcy	NonBinary	20	0.92	2020-04-06 03:26:24
Slowly but Surely!	"I've been slowly dropping hints to my parents that I'm Non-Binary. My father once said, ""These are my **offspring**."" And I said, ""I like that. Let's use it from now on."" So now he usually uses that term. It's made me very happy.

Neither my mother nor father have noticed that I'm uncomfortable with she/her pronouns, and I don't know whether to be happy or sad about it. I'm very scared abut what will happen when they learn about how I have no beenies, and very closeted.

Anywhos, happy pride month you androgynous people!!"	"what's wrong with saying children
nothing is wrong with it \^-\^

my father just used 'offspring' once and I found it funny and gender-neutral."	npym9l	NonBinary	19	1.0	2021-06-01 16:54:00
Having to misgender/deadname yourself	Am  I the only one who feels incredibly horrible for doing this? My family isn’t very accepting of nonbinary people so I’m forced to misgender myself and everytime I Address myself as “she” I feel incredibly sad, a few moments ago I had to write my birthname down for a school assignment and I literally felt nauseous and I wanna cry and throw up, I just hate this, in my family only my brother knows but I asked him to still call me by “she” because I don’t want to be outed and I can’t handle coming out again, what Urga me the most is when my dad says I’ll always be his little girl, I’m sure he doesn’t mean to hurt me but I can’t help to get silent evertime he says it...	"I understand how you feel to a certain degree, because I’m not out to my parents. Idk how they feel about Non-binary people. I always refer to myself as a she at home and it hurts every time I do. Because despite me never wanting to be a boy I’d rather go my he/him if I have to pick a gender (I’m a they/them that has anxiety so i struggle with worrying constantly about what people will think even though I’m definitely not a she). I also get sad when people call me my birth name rather then my preferred name (my preferred name is Mika) because I’m not that person anymore and don’t want to be. Sorry I went on my own mini rant ÓuÒ. ( Remember One Thing: You Are Beautifully Perfect The Way That Makes You Happy! )
try simply referring to yourself as a person when around them its true and not quite outing yourself and your not misgendering yourself
I wish I could but there aren’t really gender neutral pronouns in my language that are accepted by all, nonetheless this is great advice, thank you"	glvuvl	NonBinary	20	0.89	2020-05-18 06:07:22
Quitting T because I'm masculinizing too much	"Hey everyone.
I'd like to start this by saying, I don't regret starting T but I've come to a point where I feel that I've gotten what I want out of it and no longer see the reason to keep taking it. I feel like it's important that I state this so it doesn't end up on some TERF reddit as proof that ""all trans people regret transitioning"" or some hogwash like that. 
Unfortunately, I was told recently that my voice is ""passed the androgynous point"". Which made me sad because the idea of having a voice that sits in the middle (without having to do voice training) is very appealing. My pre T voice was shrill and awful though but now I almost sound bored and monotone. It's crazy to me that I have no idea how to sound feminine anymore because I used to have a higher voice, so you'd think I'd have some ideas but I really don't.
Hopefully once I'm off of it, it might be a bit easier to be in a higher register. And yes I know my voice won't revert back to my pre T voice, no do I want that. My main problem is that I only sound feminine (somewhat) if I'm soft spoken but if I want someone to hear me anywhere besides the damn library, I need to speak up and that's the point where I sound considerably more masculine. 
I did plan on coming off T sooner, but I got cold feet because I was scared that they'd think I was detransitioning and not actually trans. But I eventually said fuck it, this is my life and I want to be happy in the one and only body I have. All this to say, always be your best advocate when it comes to your transition. Don't be concerned about what anyone else is thinking or might think. I've had quite a few bad encounters with those in the medical field who have outright disrespected me when it came time to talk about my transition.
Anyways, It's a little late for me now in terms of having a naturally androgynous voice I guess but it's always going to be a step up from where it was.
As much as I dread the idea of voice training, I don't think I have any other options.
If anyone has any videos or tips for a more feminine voice I would appreciate it. I might post a voice clip either here or on r/transvoice to get other peoples opinion on how it sounds and what I should do to fix it.
Thank you."	"I totally support u, I have heard of people taking only light doses of T / E to have this sort of effect, but clearly there isn’t enough support for it.
Same here, other direction. I don’t want to “fully transition” (whatever that means) as that would not be me. Just taking E long enough to meet my body as I feel it should be. Then I’ll stop or reduce to an absolute minimum…
Doing what is right for you is what is right. Frankly, I think that some doctors and therapists are too binary in their expectations. Fine tuning is part of finding who you are.
I'm fully transitioning in my own way, which obviously will look different than the way a binary trans man/woman or even another nonbinary person will transition. I'm trying to break away from the idea that I need to fit neatly and perfectly into the box that is androgyny (which imo has become very white-centric). I mean, the idea of being nonbinary is that we don't fit into the categories of exclusively male or female. But sometimes I feel like we're sort of...creating a trinary?
I'm glad you've figured yourself out and know what you need. I definitely knew what I needed but let my fear stop me.
Yeah, I live in a pretty conservative area of California so I feel a great deal of pressure to seem binary, and to just not be myself when it comes to how I act and present myself to the world. I came out as ftm to my parents too, so the worry of them thinking I'm detransitioning kind of prevents me from looking the way I want to. I'm not sure they would understand it anyways. A part of me is like ""I've only got one life so I should be who I want"" and the other part is like ""but if you do that, will anyone actually like who you are?""
This, a thousand times this! Non-Binary means, for me, that I am the only person who can say what and how they are.

No, it doesn’t mean androgynous, it doesn’t mean “somewhere between male and female” (what I thought at the beginning of my journey).

When I started my journey, I was still thinking in binary-one-axis term: one end is masc and the other end is fem - and that I am somewhere in between. So, one-dimensional…

Further down the road in my journey I realized there are many, many, many more axis’s and I am somewhere in this multi-dimensional space at my own, personal coordinate. 

Now, I’m slowly bringing my body there. And… I FREAKIN’ LOVE IT… I finally found myself and when I met myself, I started crying…

Do, what you feel is the right solution for you. It is your path, your road to go. Once you finally meet your true self, have a heart-to-heart talk and then… do what feels right.

All the love and support I can give shall be with you on your journey… 💛🤍💜🖤"	vvlnhr	NonBinary	19	1.0	2022-07-10 06:48:25
I've realized I may be a bit more masculine leaning most days, it's a slow process and I can't tell any of my family members. I think my short height has made me never consider it sadly :( I don't know what male name would suit me, if anyone has any suggestions that would be amazing.			mxxsen	NonBinary	19	1.0	2021-04-25 01:26:48
Chest dysphoria (AFAB)	"Posting to get this off my chest (lol) because I don't feel comfortable telling anybody this irl. 

I've got small boobs so I'm lucky in that respect because I'm sure my discomfort would be worse if they were bigger. But recently when seeing myself topless I can't help but imagine myself with a flat chest and it makes me sad. 

It's ironic because I got made fun of for having small boobs when I was a teenager so I always used to wish that they were bigger but now it's the other way round... I guess I'm never happy!"	"I feel this so hard today. I'm an F cup and they feel like literal dead zombie flesh hanging off of me, I'm constantly aware of them even on good days but today it's just awful. You're definitely not alone.
I'm in the same boat 🛥
omg, I am literally exactly the same, I use to always want larger boobs (mine are barely mosquito bites), but now that they're growing I honestly don't want them at all, like exactly the same as you, when I see myself I wish I had a flat chest, I'm not sure if I want surgery just yet, but I'm trying to get a binder without my parents noticing! So I understand what you're going through!
Same, I look at guys' chests with envy, wishing I could be flat :') I even have a binder picked (almost)
 thank feck I'm only A cup
:( 

I think we need to set up some sort of swapping system for people who want them... if only!
an E here....  I feel your pain♥♥
Glad I'm not the only one!

Have you ever used binders? Been thinking about them but need to do some research.
I haven't bought a proper binder but I'm thinking about ordering one. I found a tip online for binding without a binder that I use though. If you have a tight camisole with a built-in bra, put it on backwards and then fold it up in layers so that it only covers your chest (like a normal bra would) it flattens it down quite a lot and has settled so much of my dysphoria. I hope I explained that well enough, I'll try to find the link if I didn't
Thanks for the explanation, that makes sense! I'll have a dig through my clothes and see if I have anything like that to use."	g3tpsb	NonBinary	19	0.81	2020-04-18 19:46:50
Stuck in the middle	I shaved my legs for the first time in four months .I wasn't happy with it but shaving it made me sad. I'm a 47 yrs old Afab. I hate when nothing seems right . I think the fact that I've started a new job is messing with my dysphoria.  New people are scary. You never know how much acceptance you will get and I was at my previous job a good 7yrs. Even though it was a toxic environment in more ways than one it was familiar and I had friends there. Anyone else get that nothings right feeling? Not sure how to get past it but shaving did NOT help. 	New people are very scary. I find myself presenting more binary and aligning with my agab when I enter new situations and spaces are not inherently queer. Can agree, too, that shaving doesn't actually help if I don't do it because I want to. It's good to recognize this though--I think we can learn from these moments even if we're not sure how yet.	b13pvr	NonBinary	17	0.92	2019-03-14 18:15:48
got a binder, but it just makes me sad	so my tits are really big so i knew I was never going to be completely flat, but the binder just makes me really aware that I have two lumps being squashed against me. it really bums me out. does anyone else experience this? or have any advice? I feel like i’ll never be comfortable in my body.	"I’ve chosen not to try a binder for this reason. I don’t have anywhere for my tissue to go so I don’t see it looking any flatter and nicer in a binder. I worried I’d feel like you, squished and hyper aware of my chest. 

I’m considering a reduction in the next few years. Not a removal, but I’d rather be a small C than an F
I have the same problem (about an E last time I bought anything with a cup size). I have quite a lot of chest dysphoria and what helped me was realising that the binder gives you a different shape to even a compression sports bra. With a binder I don't get the side curve, even though my chest is still nowhere near flat, and that is enough to keep me binding. 

Also at first I was super aware of the feeling of wearing it, but that has almost disappeared now. You could also try positioning your chest differently to see if that helps (sorry if you've already tried this). I find up and out towards the armpits helps a little, but it does tend to shift around during the day unfortunately. 

Good luck, I hope you can find something that helps!
I got my first binder today and I'm having the same problem, mine keeps rolling up and doesn't push the tits down fully
I am with samll chest and even I feel that way ,there is this myth about how binder should feel ,it is wright for some people not for all people
I am NB have a DD chest. I have been binding for many years. They hurt and make me just as aware of my breasts. Not wearing one also makes me very aware of my chest. I can't win. I found that the Double Design binders are the least painful, though they do not ""bind"" flat. At least they reduce without hurting you. I am getting top surgery at the binning of next year. I have thought about it for years and life is too short to keep living unhappily.
yeah, it's looking like a reduction may be the only way i'll ever be comfortable. i'm a G, so i DREAM of being a C or B.
doesn't pushing it toward your armpits cause the tissue to bulge out of the binder?
It’s hard when you do want breasts sometimes, I definitely have days where I would not have them but most of the time I just wish they weren’t ginormous. The struggle!
It does a little, but I find it helps to stop uniboob for a bit, which looks bigger in front. I usually move it while I'm lying flat on my back, then when I get up it distributes itself a bit so there's not so much overspill."	ikjzyl	NonBinary	18	0.96	2020-09-01 13:12:50
