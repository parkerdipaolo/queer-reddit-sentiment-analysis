“What gender are you?” “Winning.”		"gender is a mortal concept. I am above it
Sadly putting my deadname and she/her pronouns cuz I’m not out
I am a disembodied voice in a hoodie online, and that is beautiful

I feel like it's almost criminal not to link to the tweet bc of one of the top replies: https://twitter.com/JosieKame/status/1313649836340572161?s=19
Honestly what a mood. On good days when I makes moves like that I’m just like “damn, I’m so authoritative- asserting my dominance all over the place by having people respect me” 😂
I am gender-gifted, gender-talented.
Ha I love it when you have your dead name and then they them pronouns on canvas but you’re the only one that put pronouns in your entire class so you go back on that because you look insane compared everyone else because it looks like you just add that instead of it being a function of you completing your profile.
Pain could describe it, because pain is the one who always hugs me and reminds me that I hate chronic pain
me with my genderfluid pronouns
fkn here for it
Me, rn! Except then someone else put a THEY. There’s two of us! 💜🤍💛🖤
Omg I feel seen. More than that, I've felt quite self-conscious about it, so I'll think about it like this from now on.
""Yeah but what's in your pants?""
""Victory""
I’m in the comments of that tweet 🥰
I want to do this so bad but we use WebEx which slices off parenthesis so it looks dumb, plus no one else does it.
I always do that. Sometimes I'll see someone else add pronouns to their zoom name after they see mine.
You know what this is a good way of thinking about it (as the only one consistently putting pronouns in my zoom name and still getting misgendered hell yeah)
I only went on online class once,and when I did I was watching RWBY(volume 4,it doesn’t help that the day before I made the fatal mistake of watching volume 3 in front of my parents)while the online class was on another tab. And then the teacher just starts talking OUT OF NOWHERE!
I DO THIS !
this is beautiful. i have looked at this for 5 hours now.
i prefer ne/bae
Pretty sure that has the opposite effect 💀
asserting dominance ""THEY/THEM YOU LOWLY CLASSMATES""
LITERALLY
Oh wow your soo cool
Gender is a prison and I've chewed through the bars.
The *Traditional Gender Binary System™* is similar to the ice caps.

They're both rapidly going away and people are pressed
You are loved. Stay cozy as you can in that closet until you're ready, I'll send blankets and cocoa!!!!
Your time will come! Stay strong in knowing who you are 💛💛💛
Hi can I join? I have White cheddar cheese its and a big rabbit.
Am I allowed to keep you company? I can bring my dog
I started using my chosen name and still the wrong pronouns at work, I didn’t have to come out but it feels slightly more comfortable and a lot of people accidentally gender me correctly via email b/c they don’t know me. 10/10 recommend.
Hello. I am in da closet too. I have a cozy blanket if you'd like to share. I also have Netflix, Hulu, and Disney plus on my phone. I also put one foot outside the closet to grab some candy. Let's get through this together :3
Not out but still seen and valid ❤️
Can I join? I have a chiweenie and sushi.
Constantly filling a duraluminmind while on zoom like
Oy, yeah, I don't love how it handles in-session name changes. It should really just ask like with video.
I'm in Eng. Most people I know are respectful at least, haven't heard any transphobia from them. I know one NB in engineering and everyone who knows they're nb makes sure to get the right pronouns.

I am gender-deficent, lol.
I can relate
Gender is cheesy and I'm lactose intolerant
Except with the ice caps it's a bad thing
Ahhhhh yes with marshmallows plz
Ooh cheezits
Why have many cheese its, when you can have one *cheese  t h e m*
Aw hell yea, I might steal ur dog if it’s cute tho
Hey, if we’re all hanging out... could I come? I also have puppies. I can bring snacks.
Ahhhh yes blanket blanket blanket
💛🤍💜🖤
Ofc, but I’ve actually since come out lol
Didn’t expect a Sanderson reference on this sub, but yep
I find it so arbitrary what it asks for before meetings. I think I've had it ask for my name and video different times but so rarely
That implies you need more gender. Want some of mine?
Little tiny marshmallows! Here ya go!
I wouldn't recomd doing that, my dogs not the only one who bites
I had my friendo (who is out of the closet) grab us more blankets. We can make a blanket fort!
I just saw the username and had to :D
Hahaaaaa nvm can I just take ur dog home for a few days then? 👉👈
ooh yay! have them bring a campfire too (ignore the fire hazard ;))
That’s what I thought.
Sure, but she does bite a bit. Not in a mean way, she just likes to play

I love your shirt and your hair, never thought pink and green could match so well and look so good

Hey, don't know if English is your first language or not but I'm gonna try not to assume the worst. Be mindful that you've just posted in a non-binary subreddit while specifically calling attention to your ""queer brothers and sisters,"" and it feels a little ignorant. ""Siblings"" would be a good alternative.

So happy reading about this, it give me courage, thank you so much love

....read the room
Not everybody speaks English as a first language my dude. I get what you’re trying to say but it might not be the right situation.
But but but whatabout
There's a time and a place for comments like that.
No problem. 

I'm not trans or non-,binary, I'm an ally. I'm on here because **representation matters**, it's great to have such diversity on my feed.

I'm Australian and doing a social work degree. I'm hoping to do a master's of Social Work with migrants and refugees in Germany after I graduate. It just occurred to me that means I'd work with people like you, queer Africans.

I don't know why it didn't occur to me that being a refugee social worker may involve helping people like you.

I apologise for all the white bigoted preachers that went to countries in Africa to spread their hatred of queer people. I know they aren't the sole cause, there's layers of causes, each varying by region.

Either way I hear you. You matter. Stay strong.
I mean, should I redact my compliment? I did not mean to offend you.

Was asked if I was mtf or ftm based on my look... I guess I should count that as a win.		"atab: assigned trans at birth
them: mtf or ftm?

you: *distant unintelligible chittering*
Yes absolutely! Sometimes others' confusion is a great victory haha
I love that they knew you were trans more than your assigned gender. 100 confusion.
...and the shirt! Damn, I love it!
After all this time I have collected all the genders, and with this no one will be able to misgender me!
Hell yeah! I love confusing people with my gender!
Them: mtf or ftm? 
Your response: Hi!
Assigned Inevitable Crab at Birth

*scuttles away*
Basically you look incredible and perfect and that can be totally intimidating for some people. Congratulations!!
You are so androgynous I’m so jealous
My boyfriend's friend met me for the first time and she asked if I was mtf and I'm afab lol I was intrigued as I'm trying to be a mix of male and female and I guess I did that at that moment. I'm non binary and she didn't know what the heck that is. So I got to educate in that moment too. I felt it was a good thing.
Nailed it
Mmmz, I love the look
I cannot tell for sure. I would guess afab based on hairline and brow (lack of bossing). However if ffs I am at a total loss. Ear proportion and jaw are androgynous. Congrats on being super cute either way, and easily one of the most androgynous people I have ever seen.
Love your haircut!!!!! What does the side look like?
Honestly yeah, you look great anyway
You'd think that they'd be embarrassed to ask the question.  Nobody has ever asked me my salary, what medications I'm on, or whether I pooped this morning.  It seems as if they so desperately need to categorize you that they're saying, It's fine if you don't want to tell us what you *are*... but *at least* tell us where you came from.

Congratulations, by the way - I hope that I can be as ambiguous one day.
I like the shirt! Where'd you get it?
You’ve done it, it’s over you won...
you are winning in so. many. ways. love the outfit, love your bravery, love you hair, love your humbleness in the comments. i'm glad you exist. please continue to inspire others (myself included) with wholesome post like this! 💕
My new response to that question is going to be a grin and something along the lines of ""No shame, but let's just pretend you didn't think that was an appropriate question to ask."" I do enjoy confusing the cishets though.
Very sexy. That’s all that matters
my gosh the androgyny! also your hair 💯
Thats my dream
personally i make no assumptions but DAYUM you look good
I have that shirt too!!
I AM GENDER TO NOTHING I >:D
Gorgeous either way....so yeah, def win
Perfect. The ideal look ✨
Assigned visually impaired at birth. You have the same look I give my eye surgeon when I tell him “I think I need another surgery”
Ughhh I wish none of your goddamn business was a legitimate response in every situation
The first time I was asked this was amusing to me. I was asked by another trans person ""Hey J, are you on estrogen or testosterone?"" It completely caught me off guard and thinking back on this always makes me laugh.
I suppose that nicer than them just saying what the fuck are you meant to be ...so yeah...take it as a win

Haha. Truth! 😅
Am I a boy? Am I a girl? No body knows. But I'm here to sexuallly confuse everyone around me!

I kinda like the thought regardless of what you are, if you're looking at me, that makes you gay 😅
Well thanx! Glad you do!

You're not the first to say so either. The other asked for the details where to find it. Don't know if you are interested but since I already looked it up figured I'd share:

On Amazon if you search ""Minthunter Women's Long Sleeve Crew Neck Cute Tunic Color Block Tops"" that is the name. I purchased it in medium and large and just kept the one which fit best. (I believe I kept the medium because I liked the more slim fit)

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GD9T1LP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_HV49NFJR8T60DE0AM0P9?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
Feel good #goals there.
Mission accomplished then 😅

I'll break the mystery. Amab... and no surgeries or hormones. Just exercise (and admittedly a very padded bra and tight corset) and makeup. 

But thanks!
Amazon! A couple people have been asking me that too. I posted the details on another comment thread above in replay to a similar comment if you wanna grab it!
Twinning! A friend of mine also had it. So we did a thing awhile back with us twinning with (since she had blue hair at the time) blue wigs.
This made me look closely at my eyes here... kinda looks like I'm a little cross eyed 😅
😂😈
As a headmate who wasn't born but kinda just spawned, I'm basically anab

Zomg, I have that exact same shirt (in L) and absolutely love it. It's so soft and comfy.
Wow. No ffs? You are stunning!!
This is probably the best system joke I've ever heard congrats youve done it
I can not  believe how many upvotes this has gotten. As a member of a system it makes me really happy to see. Also no one was like “what do you mean?” Idk, it’s just a cool thing. Made me smile. - Briar
I like to say I was summoned, lol.

Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255

yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚

before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️

Your self-deprecation may be harming people.	"""I don't deserve to be called nonbinary?"", ""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", ""Am I X enough to be nonbinary?"", ""I'm AXAB so I can't be nonbinary without surgery"" and all of their fellow statements, I'm talking about you.

**Your gender identity is not a milestone.**

It's not an aesthetic, it's not a body type, it's not a race you need to win. It's your gender.

Posting self-deprecating (and I'm using that term with the conscious choice to give the benefit of the doubt that that's what these posts are about, without intending to be slights or have ulterior motives) posts about how you don't ""qualify"" as nonbinary does, even if you don't intend to, *harm* to everyone else browsing.

Just to list a few ill impacts, intended or not, that these statements end up doing off the top of my head:

* **Shoving people with low self-esteem about themselves under the bus.**

""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", asks a person and posts a selfie, genuinely having the misinterpretation or trauma related to gender issues that you need to be attractive to qualify as your gender.

Meanwhile, another user sees the selfie, believes the person to be more conventionally attractive than they are (*especially* if the person seeing it has qualifications that already make them ""ineligible"" to being seen as beautiful by their cultural beauty standards), and learns the lesson, ""well, if that person is questioning it, then the bar must exist, and I am *certainly* don't qualify.""

* **Othering nonbinaryness.**

""I don't deserve to be called a woman.""

""Am I too ugly to be a man?""

""Am I curvy enough to be a woman?""

Most cis binary people don't ever feel the need to ask these questions. At most, in the context of people who have experiences of being marginalised out of their gender (usually womanhood), but even then, it's usually in the context of ""to be seen as"", and often acknowledged to be the result of societal lenses rather than that 'woman' or 'man' are sacred categories you need to complete labours of Heracles to qualify for.

*So why do we do this to nonbinary people?*

* **Hurting people who have experiences with being marginalised out of their previous identities by subjecting them to similar standards again in their new-found self.**

Yeah, I wasn't done yet. People who have experiences of having seen their AGAB gender as 'conditional' due to ableism, racism, fatphobia, misogyny, et cetera, do not need having those same pressures applied to them now. We managed to accept a wider spectrum of womanhood, a wider spectrum of manhood, now we *need* to get better about not just grabbing those same boxes and applying them to nonbinary people.

* **Equating your transition goals as the right image for being nonbinary.**

Especially us with the goal of ""indiscernible gender"" tend to be faulty of this. I very specifically ask for AFAB nonbinary people to mind how they talk about ""looking nonbinary"" versus ""looking more masculine"". Feminine nonbinary people, and nonbinary people with different bodies deserve to be here also.

Androgyny doesn't equal being nonbinary, and while you're more than allowed to strive for an androgynous appearance, *please* don't equate it to ""looking non-binary"". Especially because...

* **Perpetuating sexism.**

...more often than not, the image of androgyny, as it's seen in the context of stereotypical nonbinaryness, is ""vaguely masculine."" The image of a non-binary body is an AFAB person who has altered their body, which ends up perpetuating not only stereotypes of what being non-binary means, but also equates AMAB bodies as ""neutral"" and AFAB bodies as ""other.""

(Tangentially related: that post about genitalia, while *hopefully* meant to criticise people's expectation of nonbinary people, ended up specifically equating bodies with vulvas as ""sexual and other"", which brought up a lot of righteous anger and shame in especially AFAB people who have already had to deal with a lifetime of being defined as sex toys for consumption.)

**I don't believe any of the people here asking these questions or out-putting these rants are being malicious**, not unless they prove themselves otherwise. **But you do need to be aware of the impact your words have.**

* If you are talking about societal expectations, *state that*, and point your dagger at the people putting those expectations instead of other nonbinary people.
* Separate your personal transition goals from nonbinary as a label.
* Don't equate your dysphoria with the implication that there are standards for being nonbinary.

**TL:DR; Watch for what you imply to be a fact in your speech, because someone more impressionable may take it as one.**"	"Thank you!! I know most of these sorts of posts probably come from a place of insecurity, and looking for confirmation of “yes, you TOO are nonbinary! And enough!” But you totally hit on the unnamed uneasiness I couldn’t explain
I think this also goes for people who are insecure about whether or not they can claim the word trans as a nonbinary person. It's okay to feel however you feel! But how you express that may tell other people that they can't claim that label either
I really like this post because it's goal isn't to shut down important discussions for us to have, but rather to emphasis the need for self awareness and specificity.

That said, I do think it's absolutely important that people who are new to talking about their identities may not understand a lot of the nuance. I lurked for a long time before I started commenting, and I did a lot of external research. But I don't know that it's fair to expect that of people who are in pain and don't have the vocabulary to express it safely.

Not that any of us owe it to be anyone else's therapist, but that it is important that we can speak what we think we feel and hope that someone will be kind enough to share their experience to help give context to our pain.

So yeah, absolutely. We should have this or something very much like it somewhere handy, but I wish there was a sub, a tag, something we could give people where they can spill out what they're feeling and not have people who can't handle that have to stumble across it. Maybe there already is and I just don't see it (I have observation issues sometimes).

Just thinking.
Yes! This needs to be pinned as guidance for all posts here.
I agree with this in principle, but likewise agree with other commenters who have pointed out the very real need to express these feelings, especially among those who understand. For this type of discussion, I would suggest r/NonbinaryTalk. They don’t allow photos (so you will not see any photos asking for affirmations, whether people “pass”, etc) but it is a good place to talk through these emotions and doubts.
Thank you so much. I have seen so many of these posts lately and it has really started to alienate me from this community so I’m so happy someone said something.

I feel like especially the posts that are about AGAB are really reinforcing my feeling that we are only seen as “menlite” or “woman lite” and it’s so distressing. I’m nonbinary. That’s it. I don’t want to be lumped in with people based on my agab, because it isn’t my gender.

Also people asking For woman and afab enby spaces are terfs.
While I see where you're coming from, I also don't think it's as dangerous as you're implying and can actually be helpful overall. It can even be educating and therapeutic in a lot of cases.

You more often than not, almost always really, see someone replying to the self-deprecating person and explaining why they are valid. First of all, you have one person who is going to feel better and feel more valid, and whoever else that feels like that and reads that will feel more valid. It can be extremely positive for people to get validated for more than just that one person.

This post also implies that someone should know better. Often they don't and that's why they made that comment in the first place. This doesn't apply to like ""do I look non-binary"", but more so ""I don't think I deserve to be called non-binary because so-and-so"". They literally don't know better and don't realize that this is not the right way to think about it, so they're not being self-deprecating for the sake of it, but more out of ignorance and probably wouldn't realize this post applies to it. I've said I didn't think I deserved the label trans because I didn't transition in any form. That was my own ignorance, and people told me, no, I don't identify as my AGAB so I can absolutely use that label. This post wouldn't have enlightened me that I shouldn't say that. It was ignorance, not even knowing that it hurts people, just thinking that's the way things are and that label is ""earned"" in a way I hadn't.

I think there's not much usefulness in telling people not to make self-deprecating comments, because often they pop out and feel just like reality to the person, not like self-deprecation. People are legitimately depressed, don't realize they are speaking out of low self-esteem, and have difficult issues with how they look at themselves. You can even end up targeting neurodivergent people who might be in depressed episodes, basically telling them to keep shit to themselves unless they have something positive to say about themselves. Maybe a bit more extreme but it's like, ""you're saying depressing things and making others depressed, you're hurting people by being in pain"". 

Half the ignorant shit I believed about myself, how I didn't deserve so and so, was cleared up by reading comments like these, and when I've seen others make self-deprecating comments I've taken my time to validate them and explain how I felt that way once but here's why it's wrong. Hopefully that person went on to do the same. Just my opinion, I believe it's a very positive thing overall.
👏👏👏
We need to make space for people to express the real emotions of doubt and confusion that come with gender discovery. Such a space did not exist for a very long time (my entire lifetime until maybe 5 years ago, for example), and that forced many generations of people into the closet and into isolation. Suggesting that it is harmful to others to express your true emotions if they are not positive recedes that space, and if this is the only space someone has it shrinks their ability to get the support they need.
I understand all this, and agree, but I think it's fair to say that not very many of us are brimming with self belief.
I want to apologize for the times I have made self-deprecating comments then. Honestly, being told constantly that I look like a man or I don't look feminine at all has just always gotten to me, and it's hurt to the point of making me feel like I'm not good enough to be nonbinary. But you're totally right in that I should be upset at the people who have set those standards for me. I wish society didn't set such harsh gender standards on individuals who don't identify as their AGAB.
Very well said 👏👏👏
*This.*

I’ve been thinking this for awhile, so thank you for putting words to it.
This this this this!!! I’ve felt like I should leave this sub so many times because of the posts you describe, like it can really make me feel uncomfortable and sometimes annoyed when people ask things like “am I too ugly to be this or that” yknow? Coz I know people are insecure, so am I, but implying you have to be conventionally attractive or androgynous in order to be non-binary is a rough thing to see. I’ve fought to be happy how I am coz I’m non-binary no matter what, how you look and present doesn’t change your gender.
I'm really sorry, and will delete my posts accordingly.
👏!!!!!
I think a lot of people making posts like these are confused/scared, or perhaps young.  It's hard to think about how your words affect others when they've merely been part of a train of thought that's been chasing you off the rails for months/years.

But yes, everything you said is true.
This.
Many of us don't have other safe places to express our insecurities, so it's important to be able to do that
I’ll probs get hate for this but I stand by it. This starts because of the obsession with labels. Just be you fuck what others think. I know it’s easier said then done and it took me till I was 23 to properly do so but if you take small steps I can guarantee that realising that only you define you and no one or any label can is hella liberating.
Good post!
Yes
I personally read trans as ""I identify more strongly with the things typically ASSOCIATED with the opposite binary gender of my agab then I do being neutral, bigender, or my agab enough to CONSIDER physically altering my body to match it"". That doesn't fit me but it does fit better with my new nonbinary thinking I've been working on and the trans woman I know that doesn't want to physically transition because she is just not okay with being chemical dependent on hrt and as result last I heard wasn't on hrt.
all of this. i feel so dysphoric when i see posts that focus on agab when agab is completely irrelevant. i wonder if the mods could include a flair for internalized transphobia or something like that? or if there could be a reminder to acknowledge that internalized transphobia/fatphobia/etc is at play???
You make such good points too! Is it possible to feel like I totally agree with you AND OP at the same time? because I do. That’s what makes this whole conversation so interesting, and how nuanced our collective experiences of discovering our nonbinary-ness are.
This
i agree with you, but i don't think you're really contradicting the op, either. i think the point isn't to shut down discussions of doubt and confusion, but to frame doubt and confusion as emotions rather than as facts (maybe not the right word?). for example, instead of saying, ""am i too ugly to be nonbinary?"" one could say, ""i feel too ugly to be nonbinary and i feel invalid because xyz"" and directly ask for reassurance and/or discussion of the societal forces that drive these kinds of insecurities in nonbinary spaces. if that makes sense??? like i definitely want folks to be able to talk about their fears/insecurities etc without actively perpetuating them within the community. i guess it's a fine line, tho, so it does have to be ok on some level for folks to walk it less than perfectly
i think it's also ok to just feel invalid or whatever and straight up ask for reassurance? like for reals, if i see you posting that you're struggling with some internalized enbyphobia or whatever, imma hop in and remind you that you're nonbinary af, you're fantastic, and you make this sub even more awesome than it already was. cuz it's true!
I just want to say I really appreciated your post about gender essentialism, it gave me a lot to think about. Please don't delete it!
I mean that’s ok with how you read it but trans is literally identifying as a gender other than the one you are assigned with birth. It’s fine if it is a label that you don’t want to claim but that’s what it is 🤷
As a transfeminine nonbinary person (trying to find a label -- agender woman?  rofl, who knows or cares!), the ""trans"" label is somewhat difficult for me.  Yeah, I'm on HRT.  But as someone who isn't very feminine at all, I do feel more attached to the ""nonbinary"" label.  I describe myself as ""trans"" to cis people, because it seems to communicate a lot and they can't understand simple gender concepts without their brains overheating.  In the end, to me, labels are about creating a set of expectations for whoever I'm talking to.

I'm not a transmedicalist at all (dysphoria is *certainly* not required to be trans), but the primary motivating factor in me describing myself as ""trans"" and ""woman"" rather than just ""nonbinary"" is the treatment I've received for dysphoria and society's expectations that all lesbians are binary women (and I'm definitely a lesbian).

It's all a big frustrating word game anyway and I commend everyone who hasn't been tricked into playing!
Haha yeah it's just a discussion. I see where OP is coming from. They are coming from a real place and I think it's valid to agree with both of us at some level. It's not like I totally disagree with OP, just feel differently about some aspects.
Thank you so much. This is so sweet. I get afraid of being annoying asking for reassurance, and sometimes I feel ignored when I do ask for reassurance. But I'm glad you're so supportive. Thank you again. :')
I guess it's shifted to that because that fits me being trans neutral, I honestly don't care about sticking with my ""dead gender"" at all anymore, so yours fits better now. 😂
Yah I just had the I guess I'm trans neutral realization so mood. I have what would be called gynecomastia so I guess I already got what I would have taken hrt for so guess that's a thing.
Dang I started developing breast tissue at around 13 before testosterone did me dirty (never got diagnosed with anything though).  I wonder how common that is?
Idk, maybe ask a doctor, I figure mine was related to high Adderall doses I was on but all I really know for sure about it is I still have my tits at 25, about 10% of the majority of case that start in puberty don't go away last I looked at statistics."	qo1leo	NonBinary	614	0.97	2021-11-06 14:39:15

hey small wins for me: introduced myself in classes with my pronouns (they). is anyone respecting them? no lol💀 but i’m proud of myself for no using “ella” just to make others confortable 🥹		"*not using “ella”* lol sorry english is my second language
Proud of you! I've made the transition to they/them in English but still feel wildly insecure about using neutral pronouns (and nouns) in Portuguese.
We had this activity of getting to know each other and I told my partner in the activity to refer to me as they/them. I was so fucking embarassed, but I did it. And she did refer to me correctly. Uhhhh, so embarassing and so haarrdddd
After reading about all those times pronouns have not been respected I just thought: if you visibly lean one way, just anounce the opposite pronouns so people might use they/them for fucking once.
whooo congratulations! \^\^
Super proud of you, buddy! It's a fucking nightmare but you're paving the way for those behind you, and, of course, doing it for you.
Amazing! So happy for you, finally being out with pronouns is a lot but I bet you did great! you look amazing btw
Yay for you, friend 🔥
Hello! First of all I'm proud of you too!! Ahora estoy aprendiendo español, y tambien tengo este problema en clase. I'd love to use the neutral as well but oof is it hard, I'm going to use it to try it out. I hope it gets better for you, sending love :-)
muchas felicitaciones, tienes más valentía que yo :)
My gender neutral pronouns in my birth language are ones I chose but they sound exactly like feminine pronouns when said out loud so I legitimately don’t know what to do with them 

… they’re in my Pinterest bio I think?
español, no? felicitaciones por presentarte con pronombres neutrales. es *dificil*
Felicitaciones por haberte presentado con pronombre elle :)! . De verdad que es bien difícil hacerlo con tanta gente que aún no lo acepta. Tristemente no lo respetaron pero  siempre es genial dar un paso más en tomar espacio y no acomodarte a lo que esperan los demás solo por  ""no incomodar"".
Hey cool what’s the neutral pronoun in portuguese? morei em porto há muitos anos acho que esqueci como falar mas eu percebo tudo 😌
In my experience, they'll ignore what you say and just use whatever they assume your pronouns to be anyway. It's a good idea, though!
Hahaha that’s funny but i think it’ll only work in english, spanish is too gendered + the neutral pronoun is kinda new
Thanks 🥹🫶🏼
Aww yes that’s so true! Hope there’s some egg in that class that starts breaking after seeing me hahaha 👀♥️
síii en español es mil más difícil que en inglés:-((
Sou Brasileire, mas faz muito tempo que moro nos EUA. Os pronomes são ele, ela, e elu ou ile. Elu e ile são os mais comuns para gente não binaria.

Being Able To Breathe? Sounds Nice.
Not to sound weird but like this picture made me temporarily forget how to breath. I mean this in the most respectful way possible
I don't wanna be a party pooper, but ""i can't breathe"" is a black chant made because there's an ongoing genocide. Using it like this (especially with what happened in California wrt the vp nomination) is extremely disrespectful.
Sorry mate, but ""being able to breathe"" has nothing to do with BLM. This isn't that type of post, and while whats going on with the BLM movement is EXTREMELY important, not everything relates to it. Being able to breathe is an expression thats used to describe the feeling of comfort and relief that things may finally be moving toward change, especially for the LGBT+ community.

You look gorgeous. That dress is killer, and your eyeliner and lipstick are on point. If I could give one small piece of advice it’s that your foundation colour is a little yellow for your skintone, which is a bit pinker. Foundation is really hard though and I know cosmetics are expensive and you may well be aware of it, I’m saying it because I would want someone to tell me. Overall the look is still amazing and I’m glad you had a great time!

Spinny dresses win, if you like wearing dresses then wear one! if you don't then don't. I'm Trans female but cis men and Non-binary people can wear dresses without invalidating their gender, I think it makes you strong.		"That dark blue one is stunning!
Yes!!! I have a 4-yo sparkle boy who gives every dress he has the twirl test, just like his big sis. Dresses are for all, and twirl has no gender!
best part is NO PANTS
Transmen can wear them too! Just adding that in!
I love all these fits, especially the short maroon dress and both the rompers 💜

You rock, fuck the haters
Absolutely stunning!! I love them all!
Wow you look amazing!!
SPINNY
That blue black one looks so good on you! 
Very nice dress
The long pink one is my fav. Matches with the hair and I love it.
The Lore Olympus shirtttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!
You have a really lovely and contagious smile! Hope that's not weird to say, you just look really happy!!

Lovely wardrobe too. Dress spinny is always fun. 😁
 Pockets in dresses are everything, thank you for the fashion show <3
thank you!
I wish this was me but unfortunately I am shy so the few friends I have are special to me. Unfortunately they mostly are homophobic so I am unable to be non-binary :(
Omg ikr 😫 I wish I could've been strong enough to wear that to prom or homecoming or something 😍
Hellll yes 🥰🥰🥰
NO PANTS!!! PREACH!
Truuueee 😅 idk why I said cis men instead of just men
I live by that phrase 😉
Ty ty Lil pumpkin 🎃
Ty asparagus 🥰🥰
I actually recorded a game of beatsaber with that dress and the long pink one because of the positive reviews 🥰 posting it soon 🥰 ty mate
I recorded a game of beat Saber in that dress and in the blue shiny dress because of all the positive comments on the 2 😉 posting it soon

Oof yep, that’s the worst! I wore this drawn on mustache and the person still referred to the group I was with and I as “ladies” (?????) but having my new legal name on more things makes me feel great.
The person at oregano’s knew the other people were ladies, which was great! But my campy mustache is very obviously transmasc!

So tired of “subtle” transphobia/nonbinary-phobia	"I always come across people that claim to be allies, yet they say things that are transphobic but in a (not-so)subtle way. I had a friend talk about a plus size model (who’s a trans woman) winning the beauty pageant and he was like what are your thought on this? Mind you he sent me a video of a transphobic person’s point of view and I’m like “dude, this guy is obviously transphobic in the video”. And he’s like “yeah I know that but look at the video” and I’m telling him I’m not watching a video on a transphobe reacting to that. And he lowkey wanted me to agree that things are getting “too woke”. But again ✨subtly✨. He also claims there’s a “war” on masculinity because “manly men” (aka his version on toxic masculinity) are becoming too feminine. And then when I talk to me people it sucks cause I use they/she/he pronouns and I’m amab nonbinary/genderfluid. So they see me as a man and just use “he” the entire time and get mad when I correct them too much. *sigh*. Well at least that first friend I have kept distance from him so that’s good. And I’m trying to only talk with people that are actual allies and not claiming to be and doing transphobic things.

Edit: forgot to mention that I changed my pronouns to she/they after a while because I was getting so annoyed of him exclusively using “he” and now he would still use “he” a lot and that was my final straw"	"People who act like they want to be allies trying to get trans people to give our blessing to some transphobic nonsense is such a weird thing.  Like they know it's wrong or they wouldn't be asking, but they're hoping we tell them ""no, you're right, it is definitely getting too woke, and also your gaming experience should definitely take precedence over human rights, it's fine if you send your money to that terf.""  Like our primary purpose as a trans person in their lives is to offer absolution for their bad thoughts and decisions.
Last January I was camping with my brother, his wife, and their two kids.  Nieces were cuddled up against me watching the campfire, I felt safe and loved and decided it was finally the right moment to come out as nonbinary. 

Then my brother and his wife started making fun of a neighbor kid (like 5, apparently AMAB and living as a boy) whose favorite thing is dressing up as Elsa from Frozen and dancing and singing around the house.  

A year later and I still haven't even started to crack the closet door open again.
Although I'm loathe to ever link to Twitter (especially since The Muskening), I feel like this series of tweets sums up the 'culture war on manliness' that your supposed friend was going on about:

[https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1572713537910476801?lang=en](https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1572713537910476801?lang=en)

It's a series of clippings from newspaper articles bemoaning 'manly men becoming too feminine' from the following years:

* 2020
* 2018
* 2004
* 1997
* 1984
* 1977
* 1965
* 1950
* 1940
* 1934
* 1932
* 1925
* 1922
* 1920
* 1910
* 1902
* 1893
* 1886

&#x200B;

In other words, bigots rarely get new material. They just re-cycle the oldies due to lack of creativity.

This friend of yours doesn't sound like an ally and doens't even sound like a friend, really. I mean, you know your relationship better than me, but a friend should build you up and respect you, not do this sort of crap to you.
Bro yes. I use they/them, my mom calls me E like i want her too but doesn't they/them pronouns and doesn't try to understand .
This makes so much sense. Literally I felt that and I didn’t know how to explain it. I told him “dude I’m not listening to that, it’s a transphobic guy talking about it” and he kept on insisting like “yeah but just watch it I wanna know your perspective” and I was honestly getting so mad and he kept insisting so many times. He always does this sort of subtle stuff that I find it hard to call him out on. It’s so infuriating and it’s honestly exhausting at this point. I have kept more distance from him for now cause it’s hard to just not be friends with him all together at once. So I’m keeping a lot more distance for now
Somehow a lot of my aquaintances are allies for gay people but are highly transphobic. It is pretty mutch socially accepted to do so and I don't really know why. My dad and his girlfriend talk like this a lot. And being non-binary is a whole other level of being hated.
People talk hatefully so openly and make each other hate others more just for existing and just for the sake of bonding. I can not stand up against these people. I usually just sit silently and scream internally for help.
I don't think I'm strong enough to step out of the closet. But staying in here is so painful...
Oh lordy, my partner has a pal like this. Literally on Tuesday his pal sat there talking about Sam Smith's new music video and about how ""he doesn't want his son to see this kind of shit."" ""But if women want to do this or lesbians then it's all okay."" Like no that's not okay, not in this non binary household. I tried to educate him but it's exhausting trying to do that all the time.
100000% agree. I was scrolling thru tiktok, and there was this one that the overall talking point the user was making was really whatever, but out of nowhere he started going on about “people’s kids these days are coming home identifying as TREES” like gender/etc was not AT ALL what his whole tiktok was about yet he had to go on some mini tangent to shit on trans and gnc people? In some ways, the “subtle” or like passive transphobia feels worse than blatant forms; at least when it’s blatant, it’s easy to point out, but this type feels more insidious and harder to fight.
Ew. People like that probably also think abuse is only physical, too. 🙄
So much of this is what I'm getting from my own family members and it's pissing me off. I haven't been around my family a lot until this recent breakup from a long time relationship and it's just making me wish I could find my own place sooner so I didn't have to put up with this shit. I know they're ""confused"" but it would make more sense if they would actually want to learn and listen when I talk to them. I'm still trying to figure myself out lol.
I just recently made the discovery that I’m a trans man and not non-binary, and I noticed a very subtle shift on how people treat me. It’s so annoying because people shouldn’t have to be binary to be respected and loved, love should come from everyone. Your friend needs to see the error of his ways, but definitely think about if your mental health and mental energy is worth educating him.
I think what annoys me most about this kind of thing is no other minority is expected to provide insightful and informative commentary on the conceptual implications of are own existence.

No one expects random black people to provide oral university level essays on KKK speeches. They don’t stop being black when they fail to convince racist that racism is bad
Well the point of he/they/she is that you don’t mind either. Maybe try to tweak that a little bit.
Watch the video for respect of your friend and right down what you didn’t like and all the things your friend might have not noticed; also is good to try as much as possible to see other peoples side even if they’re “wrong”. Communication is key, don’t close your mind.
sounds like a loser
yo fuq that guy
Wow that is a very accurate analysis of what goes on in their head. You’re right, they just kinda use us to say I support you but… and then proceed to indirectly shit on us cause it makes them feel more comfortable and gives them credibility of being like “hey my shitty ideas work cause I said I support them so I’m safe”. That’s like when people say “no offense but” and then proceed to say the most offensive thing and think it’s okay cause they said no offense
Exactly, I have met so many people that are like ""I'm an ally, but..."" or ""it's hard nowadays with pronouns so I'm just going to use the wrong pronouns"". Like, if ur transphobic just say that no need for (not so) subtle queer-bashing.
Yeah, either that or they're thinking more like:  
 > My ""friend"" is just silly & confused, but I'm too close to them so they won't listen to *me* telling them to get over this gender nonsense already.  
 >  
 > So I'll send them this video where the Really Smart Asshole makes all the points I'm to afraid to say out loud. Tough love by proxy, the ""hard truths"" they need to hear, without me being the one to confront them about it.  
 >  
 > Then my ""friend"" can realize their deviancy and get back to being normal, and I'll never have technically given them cause to get mad at *me*. Once my ""friend"" changes themself to my liking I'll consider them a friend instead of ""friend"".

I think a lot of these people think they're being subtle when they send us this transphobic crap with a ""yeah I know, but just look at the video"" explanation, and that the transphobia on display in the thing they're urging us to experience somehow isn't *them* being transphobic at us. 

That somehow ""Hey, I'm not the one saying these things to you, I'm just the one requiring you to listen to them"" makes their assholery ok.
Yeah, this. A hundred times this. Like, I can't prevent you from buying that stupid game. And I wouldn't if I could, because I respect your freedom. But if you choose to buy it, you are objectively helping a billionaire who uses her platform to harm and restrict the freedom of people whose only fault is to freakin exist. And if you can't bear hearing that, well that's a you problem 😡
it’s sad to see people, especially family members, so programmed into the way our government wants us to be that they make fun of people for being happy. the only thing we can hope for is that enough people get educated on gender. but like they say, you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. those who want to learn would’ve already tried
Very useful thanks! Yeah I figured this “war on masculinity” is the whole “bring back manly men” bs where men aren’t supposed to be doing house work or act “feminine”. I’m so tired of hearing that cause literally nobody is telling men to stop being men, it’s just telling eggs that it’s ok to be a trans woman, or nonbinary etc, but also to the men in general that it’s ok to ease up on the toxic masculinity, and to chill out with everything they do not being manly enough or whatever.
Definitely going to save this link, thank you for sharing!
I think it's just an endless cycle of kids passively picking up on gender roles and expectations, growing up and finding out that reality is different from what they're told, and then believing that those childhood stories were actually accurate meaning that reality must've become worse.
I feel for you. It really sucks all we’re asking is for the same rights cis/het people have it’s not too much too ask
I can’t start hrt or go by my pronouns in my house cause my dad is highly transphobic/homophobic unfortunately.
Glad you shared your experience. It’s not easy being closeted. Even when some people know it’s hard to stand up for ourselves cause sometimes it seems like the world is against us. Yes I have talked to some trans friends and they agree that for some reason cis/het people are more uncomfortable with the concept of being trans and/or nonbinary than concepts of liking the same gender (sexuality).
I think the difference comes from time: for example, Seinfeld was before my time ('89-'98) but there they coined the phrase ""\[something is gay\], not that there's anything wrong with that!"" and that sentiment of ""there's nothing wrong with that"" was pretty pervasive growing up. But only for homosexuality; transgender people were exclusively invoked to be the butt of a joke. More specifically trans women (I can't recall anything transmasc from that time at all).

So people like your dad have grown up during a time where gay acceptance was a big thing but not trans acceptance. Non-binary has barely even scraped the mainstream. So good and bad news:

* Good: trans acceptance progresses at a much faster rate than gay acceptance did, thanks to the internet and to the path having been walked before.
* Bad: the current state of gay acceptance is still lackluster. Gay relationships are extremely rarely depicted in popular media, last year there was a big conservative ""groomer"" narrative surrounding anyone LGBT and there are many people still afraid to come out as gay. So trans people have to catch up on something that's not even finished.
God, I so relate with this… they get so drunk in their aversions that this tiny closet seems a little more comfortable. I’m questioning now and the idea of being out, at least in Indiana, hell no. They already know anyways as I don’t have an intuition to mask perfectly around cis-men.

I’ve tried everything with masking and the only thing that has worked is massive aloofness, which then I get criticized for being self righteous. It’s, like, I’m just not allowed to exist. And feeling this for all of my life has really been a freaking mind fuck.
anddd this is the reason I deleted tiktok- never again.
Literallt though. 🙄
And then they say they’ll listen but when you tell them they get mad again and don’t want to hear it lmao.
Oh I’m sorry I forgot to add more context. My pronouns in reality are he/she/they but I only use she/they when it comes to people like this. I specifically asked him NOT to use “he” pronouns and he still does and then gaslights me into saying he’s “trying” even though he’s really not cause he’s known I’m genderfluid for almost a year now.
I mean yeah it’s not about the video exactly, it’s just that he does this every time. He always shows me something slightly transphobic and wants me to see what I think. But when he talks first he always agrees with the transphobes to an extent and it really pisses me off. I understand not knowing some things are transphobic and willing to learn and understand it, but he basically wants me to feel like trans people are too much without directly saying it idk how to explain it
We got in another fight and this time it went pretty sour. I stopped caring anymore and if he doesn’t want to be friends that’s his problem not mine. I’m done being gaslit into thinking I’m exaggerating asking for something as basic as pronoun usage
Literally though. My friend does this all the time and keeps sort of rolling his eyes whenever I have to correct him. I sort of excuse it but I’m tired of excusing transphobia
The thing is though that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, dogs are less stubborn than humans.
We live in California, so it's not the government as much as a general culture of cissexism.  But I have friends and acquaintances in Texas, and there it really is the government.  :-(
It reminds me of the same BS Douglas Adams parodied 44 years ago in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*:

“In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.”
You're welcome. 🙂
Awww I’m sorry to hear that :( I guess cause nonbinary is less known it’s less accepted in society. Cause human logic is oftentimes: “majority=correct/ethical” even if it doesn’t make sense.
It’s not all bad. I don’t use the app but when I was figuring myself out, I looked up genderfluid tik tok compilations and nonbinary tik tok compilations on YouTube and I was like “Wow! I didn’t know you can be this gender, wow! I didn’t you can dress as a girl AND a boy and feel like both” so that literally helped me so much. But yes I agree, there is still a lot of toxic things on that app and homo/trans-phobia.
Exactly! It's an infuriating cycle of bullshit!
This always happens. Like  seriously u gotta get over it if u want 2 progress bc more and more ppl r coming out.
lmao. i love that. so true
I was confused that you meant me but I realize you meant people like him lmao.

I think they're gender neutral boxers. I have a pair like those except mine are from gender free world. I'd love more gender neutral boxers in my wardrobe tbh.
This cut in ladies is typically called boyshorts.

In boxers, you just look for the length you like. They come in all kinds of lengths and cuts on the men's side of clothing.

I have not. My hair is kind of a mix between wavy and straight.
Thank you!
For what it's worth, my hair routine is pretty minimalist.
Well that just makes it so much more impressive
Wash three times a week, perfume-free anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp, Aussie Miracle Moist for the second half of my hair. Let both sit for a few minutes before rinsing. Before getting out of the shower, I rinse my hair - front and back - with as cold water as my shower can muster. Squeeze the water out, let it dry naturally, brush it once or twice daily.

I used enough shampoo to just fill out my palm. For the conditioner, I imagine stacking about three poker chips in my hand.
Yep, I'm waaaaaaaaay too lazy 😅"	chp0uu	NonBinary	172	1.0	2019-07-25 15:14:07

His child is not winning (hand drawn by me)		"I choose aether bc it was the cuetes for me
Bruh such a mood, took me like 30min to decide (chose Aether cause he cute + midriff)
I’m annoyed that before my egg cracked I picked the girl and now I’m regretting it. I don’t wanna restart my account cause I have special wings I got sense I started playing it from before it’s release  :’)
I picked Lumine because her outfit is insanely cute 🤤

I wanna cosplay Lumine.

Also I might be a binary trans woman in denial lol
I'm lucky I don't tend to have that problem because I have a go to method of not making my character me. If i can customize my player I base it off of the design of a character of mine who looks absolutely nothing like me. They're genderfluid so works for anything and I tend to go:

\-realistic games I play female

\-cartoony games I play male because then I can be androgynous usually.

I can't customize the character I just choose which I like the look of better. If I don't have a favourite (rare) I'll choose the female purely because female player characters are rarer. So in genshin for example I choose Aether because I liked him better+ he looks kinda androgynous but In rdr online my character is 'female' and based on my OC."	q15541	NonBinary	107	0.98	2021-10-04 13:11:06
Did the CHOP, back to mullet town ~ figured I best donate in case T does make me bald I guess (this much hair is also VERY annoying so win/win) 50+cm of hair, hopefully I get one more donatable length. *Disclaimer: these emojis are NOT gendered, they're just humans with different lengths of hair*		"I remember when I chopped off my butt-length hair for a short do! Genuinely one of the happiest moments of my life ☺️ I hope it was that fulfilling for you, too! 🫶 And so kind and thoughtful of you to donate!
You look great. Good cut
Congratulations on that, it felt good feeling so light afterwards.  I had hair down to my knees before and it was so great when I got it cut for donation.  Now I’m toying with the idea of getting a shag cut which is the complete opposite of my old hairstyle.  I know my parents are going to dislike it but I don’t care, I’m an adult and can make my own decisions about my body.
Amazing! I donated my hair twice, before I even realized I was trans
Aw thanks! Sorry late reply, I didn't see any of these comments til now for some reason? Gahhh how good does it feel?! I was glad I was able to donate but DAMN not sure if I have the patience to deal with that length of hair again. Hope you're enjoying the freedom too :)
Thanks heaps! Sorry didn't see any of these comments for some reason. Feels really good to shed the length & gift it away
Down to your KNEES :0
I couldn't imagine! Far out, that's a lot of hair and a lot of work. Shag cut is such a nice neutral style & heck yes you make your own decisions! Tbh I'm 35 & I hesitated to tell my Dad about my last tattoo?! I mean it was enormous, but still, it felt so silly in hindsight. Just old conditioning/evolutionary programmed fear of ""rejection from the tribe""=death, which is uhhh generally no longer applicable...

Anyway, I 100% support your shag cut, as a random stranger on the internet lol. Do what feels good for YOU
Nice! I'm sure there's some grateful folk out there that very much appreciate it :) yea I tried really hard to feel enby-ok with mega long hair but felt like no matter what I did, I just felt like the length was giving super femme. Not that hair length is gendered at ALL. That was just my experience. I've had short/long/shaved/every colour under the sun/3-haircuts-at-once-style-hair and many felt ungendered, but I think I attached a bit more of a transition to this particular chop. Feels great!
Hey, thanks for getting back to me! Hope you're enjoying you freedom as well- I know I love mine!
Thanks so much for your reply, I appreciate your insight and support.  I want to get a tattoo at some point too as well as more piercings."	zx4b3g	NonBinary	104	1.0	2022-12-28 08:19:43

A Tiny Win	"Today I was walking into a store while a lady and her small daughter (maybe 3 or 4 years old) were leaving, I stopped to let them through without getting in their way as they were walking quite fast and seemed to be fairly caught up in what they were chatting about. The little girl - a tiny blonde and purple ball of bouncing energy - was babbling away and attempted to continue down the sidewalk when her mother stopped her. ""Oh! Hold on Stella sweetie, this person was nice enough to let us through, it would be polite to hold the door for them."" And then little girl looked into my face, just smiled and said ""okay mom"" and came over to hold the door for me as I went inside. As I thanked them and turned to continue on my way I heard the little girl ask her mom: ""mom, do you think that was a boy or a girl?"" And I couldn't help but smile as her mom responded: ""Hmm... It doesn't matter sweetie."""	"Beautiful!

How do I parent my NB kid without breaking her huge heart?! 💔	"Hi everyone! I really need your help with how to proceed. My 7 year old came out to our immediate family (my husband, 5 year old and I) as NB. I feel we are supportive and just want her to know she is loved and we are happy and privileged to understand her more. We bought a book on gender, and she has since come out to her teacher, therapist, and grandma (husband's mom).

However, things get tricky when we talk about my family. My first instinct was to suggest that we don't tell them. I have a big and mostly conservative family. I have 5 sisters and two of them I know would be very supportive. I am deeply afraid that the rest, including my mother, will give her negative messaging and cause direct harm (worst case scenario) OR dole out ""I love you anyway"" and ""I love you but don't agree with this lifestyle"" (best case scenario, which is still quite harmful - especially to a 7 year old!)

She told me tonight she wants to tell my two sisters who I know will be supportive, but also wants to tell my mom. How do I do this?? I feel like we can't win here: either I tell her she should hide this part of herself, or I subject her to harm from her bible belt Trump supporting grandmother. Neither of these sit right with me. 

As a final note, I am fully prepared to cut ties. I have no hesitation if that's where we arrive. I'm just so deeply sad that my kid is potentially going to feel all of this and be devastated. Please, any advice or thoughts or support is greatly appreciated."	"Tell your mom initially *without* your kid present and if she wont accept it and would scorn your kid, cut ties and explain to your kid that bigots exist. 

Definitely easier said than done, but this is gonna spare feelings the most. 

If by some miracle your mom is willing to be half decent you can have your kid re-tell her if thats what she wants.
Your kid is very lucky to have you as their parent!❤
I think telling and discussing the matter with the two sisters you mentioned could be a good move, that way you can work together and talk about a variety of options with people who are much more familiar with the more intricate ins and outs of how your mother thinks and operates. 

It's all very easy for us online to say cut ties and never talk to your mother or family again etc but in person relationships of course can be incredibly complex. I did something similar when approaching to tell some of my family, and having a couple extra people (my mother and sister) who were on board with finding a way to make things work/back me up was very helpful, and they brought a couple of views on the situation I hadn't considered. 

Hope all goes as well as it can for you! You're a wonderful parent who obviously cares so much about their child and family and that's what's truly important at the end of the day.
A lot of people saying to protect the kid from bigotry by not telling the grandma. 

Kids are smart. This one asked her mom to tell her aunt's, who would likely be accepting. The kid seems to understand where to find acceptance. Sheltering kids from stuff they already kind of know exists can actually increase fear and model avoidance behavior. (avoiding danger totally a good choice most of the time. But you gotta pick which situations are dangerous vs uncomfortable) 

So it may be a good idea or involve the aunt's, provide support to the kid, and give the option of informing grandma. A kid feeling like they are supported while they encounter bigotry may help them feel more secure than just avoiding known bigotry. That kind of demonstrated, ACTIVE, support from mom and aunts may be hugely empowering for the kid. 

You know your family best, and what would be safe for everyone. But my two cents is to involve those who would be supportive so that they, with your daughter, can make battle plans.
I don't think that equipping your child to face discrimination would be breaking her heart. I realize she is quite young, but many children experience oppressive and harmful forces at ages we think they shouldn't, and being a confidant and walking beside her while she learns to navigate that world seems a much better choice than trying to hide her from it. If she is out as nonbinary, she will undoubtedly experience transphobia while you're not looking.

How are you moderating any other harmful messages she might be getting from her ""bible belt Trump supporting grandmother""?
If you think your child would be in danger, cut ties with such toxic persons. It doesn't matter that they're family -- toxic is toxic, no matter who perpetuates.
im all for the truth is the healthiest choice
BUT this is a child. so, lets protect them.
in ten years they can learn how harsh reality can be. but by then they will be able to handle it cuz their brain didnt had to process weird awful stuff way too early that they internalized in a deep sadness form.
they need to feel safe. so, you can cut ties, you can talk to the grandparents and instruct them how to react. or you can explain your worries to your 7yo and have them decide the next move.
Thank you for trying to be that good for your child. If you need help to understand or for your NB kid to explain other about the gender, I can very dear recommend [Me and My Dysphoria Monster](https://g.co/kgs/FUyDK9)

I read it myself and I love the artstyle. It could also help in school to make the other kids understand yours better.

I cut ties with 99% of my relatives, cause of stuff like actively opposing me being vegan (family Christmas party and to have ANYTHING to eat I had to bring cookies/whatever myself) and so they will never know I'm NB and it's ok for me. They wouldn't understand and I don't need this.

Please stay such a good parent and protect your child from this people who will, with very high probability, just hurt your kid.
Welcome to the messy reality of coming out. A lot of us get caught in tough positions like this. It’s sort of up to you to decide what is best for you and your kid. 

7 is very young. Not too young to know that you are nonbinary (I knew I was trans around 4 or 5 but didn’t have the language to describe it until much later), but very young to really be aware of the social consequences of coming out. I came out as gay at 15 and was not prepared to handle the reaction I got from some of the people around me. I wasn’t emotionally mature enough yet to navigate the turmoil that simply existing as a queer person caused in my life. So it was really hard. Part of me wished I had waited until I was older to come out, but I also know that being closeted was killing me. It’s a rock and a hard place situation. 

I learned some things from that experience and have since navigated coming out as nonbinary very differently. I actually just haven’t come out to anyone in my life that I know would not be supportive. It’s sort of been a balancing act between being my full authentic self while not correcting (some) people who misinterpret me. 

I think you’re right to want to protect your kid from bigotry. I also don’t think you need to totally cut off family that don’t “agree with that lifestyle”. If I was in your position, I would be assertive about your expectations for how your family will treat your child and the consequences if those expectations are not met. Basically, if they can’t say anything nice, then they better not say anything at all. 

I agree with folks who say you should tell your mom without your kid present. Don’t subject your kid to seeing your mom’s immediate reaction to the idea. When I told my mom I was gay, she immediately started crying. I have not told her I’m trans. I don’t want to go through that again. 

It will probably take time for your family to process this new information and actually decide how they’re going to respond to it. So tell your mom, set and expectation about the kind of relationship she will have with your child, and then allow her some time to process before even telling your kid that your mom knows. Figure out the result of the coming out before you present it to your child. To be honest, if I was seven years old and my mom came to me and said “we aren’t going to see grandma anymore because she isn’t supportive of you being nonbinary” I would be devastated. I would wish I could take it back, go back into the closet and have my grandma back. Cutting ties could hurt your child even more than hearing a negative comment once in a while. And it might be good for your kid (in an age-appropriate way) to learn how to navigate relationships with friends and family that don’t have all the same beliefs and values as you. I’m not saying you should dismiss it or say it’s okay, but the fact is that in life you can’t always just cut off the people around you that have shifty beliefs. Sometimes you have to learn how to love each other anyway. 

I chose not to come out to my parents as trans because I did not want to put them or myself through the emotional torment of openly disagreeing about such a fundamental part of me. I try to be authentic around them and let them gain an understanding of who I am just by observing. They have caught on in a lot of ways. My mom no longer buys me feminine clothes because she knows I won’t wear them. She’s still uncomfortable with the idea that I wear men’s clothes, but she keeps her mouth shut about it. So we get along fine because I just have decided not to open the can of worms and harm our relationship any more than it was already harmed when I came out as gay. 

Think about what behavior change you and your child would want to see from family by coming out. If it effectively would not change the way your kid wants to be treated on a day to day basis, then I’m not sure it’s worth opening the can of worms. And if it’s a change in language you are looking for, I think you can express that without ever using the word “nonbinary”. You can share that your child likes to dress a certain way or play with certain toys so your family will buy them things they like and not default to items associated with their agab. If your kid is still using the pronouns associated with agab then that makes things even simpler. Try to use language your mom will understand so she can maybe catch on to what you want from her without having to confront her biases about scary words like “trans”.
Maybe talk to your mother first and see if you can explain it all to her so when your child tells her, she is prepared. If you explain the situation and that there are two choices, respect/kindness and losing you family, she’ll pick respect/kindness. It’s so hard with coming out to family because it is inevitable that someone will have a bad reaction or say very hurtful things down the line or behind your back. That all has been hard for me from when I came out at 13 until now at 20. It was miserable, I cannot imagine doing it so young. Definitely try to protect your child but maybe do it a different way. Don’t hurt them in the process by telling them no you can’t tell your grandma. That’ll damage your relationship and hurt more because they’ll think you’re embarrassed of them regardless of how you’ve acted so far. It’s just a fear us lgbt kids have. Protect your child in other ways. Tell family members that you’re worried about ahead of time and see their reactions. Try to level with them and explain and see if they are willing to be civil and supportive when your child tells them. If not, then protecting your child would be distancing yourself from that family member so your child won’t have to see them much during their coming out process. You don’t want them to get discouraged or to become depressed over the situation. It can be traumatic. Just support your little one as best as you can. My parents made all the wrong choices when I came out and the advice I gave you is what I wish my parents would’ve done
I haven't read through all of the comments, but as someone who has gone through this situation with a tween, I would be very honest with your child about your reservations. It's not that their grandparent is likely to stop loving them, but that they would be confused/concerned. Your child seems savvy enough to understand this.

In our case, we told my parents and my m-i-l. My dad had a negative reaction but has never said anything negative to my child. He just avoid the topic with them and calls them by their legal name & pronouns. My mom doesn't approve, but uses my child's preferred name, but not always their pronouns. M-i-L is concerned and has decided to just pretend that the situation doesn't exist.

At first I avoided the grandparents because of this less than complete acceptance, but my child came to me and asked to visit them saying that they would rather still have a relationship with them because they miss them and understand that they just don't understand not that they don't care.
I would cut ties. I cut off my entire racist, bigoted extended family when my youngest was about your kiddos age. I’m so glad I made that decision now that my youngest has come out as enby.  While you can’t shield them from all bigotry and crappy comments, you can shield them from conditional love from people who are supposed to love them unconditionally.  That is horribly devastating (been there, done that).  And I would tell them that grandma is not a safe person for your family so you won’t be talking to her anymore. My kid has thanked me a lot for cutting my family out and not subjecting them to their bigotry, so I know it was the right choice.  Your kiddo is young enough that unless they had a super close relationship, it will likely be forgotten.
OP, is there a reason you’re referring to your non-binary kid with she/her pronouns throughout? It feels quite jarring in such an otherwise supportive post to see you referring to them in that way.
Equipping your child to deal with bigotry in a healthy manner is very important. It's something most queer people obviously have to learn by themselves, because cisgender and heterosexual identities are pushed on them since birth, which is why a lot of queer people, especially teenagers, don't really know how to deal with bigots. I have learned, it's important not to take interpersonal bigotry from people who don't really have much power over you as meaningless, and not to take it seriously, and obviously it's important to keep yourself out of harms way if they do pose some sort of  threat or have some authority over you. It's tough, but I don't feel it's important for an entire family to know your identity. Most of mine certainly doesn't, and I am happy with that, not only because I know that they wouldn't really get it, but because they don't really have much influence over my life. Don't shelter your child from the reality of the world, being openly queer is not accepted by everyone. And what's more, is that it's important not to come out to everyone. Don't come out to strangers, don't come out to people who's opinions you don't know, and most importantly, don't come out to people who's opinions you DO know, and you know that they're bigoted. 

Also, take all this with a grain of salt. Nonbinary kids are a pretty new occurrence, and so raising one I can imagine to be more than tough, so you'll have to find many answers to your questions yourself, based on your ethical system and what you believe is good and bad. Good luck.
I just wanted to comment to let you know I am in a similar boat(my enby is 10), although my family members haven't completely drank the koolaid, I still fear how they will act. I am glad you're ready to cut ties, because same. Thoughts and support to you and your kid! ❤
I think I speak for everyone in this subreddit when I say that you are an amazing parent for your kid.
This is a good idea. It would be good to have some accurate information on the topic ready because it wouldn't be a good idea to let grandma do her own research in this matter.
This!! Your steadfast support means more than you can know. To be safe in your home is everything.
She came out two weeks ago. I don't think they have even covered pronouns in second grade. 

Jokes aside, we have pointed out the pronouns section in her book about gender. We have talked about pronouns, and left the door open for further discussion. We are in the process of figuring out how she likes to be referred to. Our approach is to present information and let her lead the way as much as possible.
Maybe it’s the child’s preferred pronouns or they haven’t picked new ones yet
If you haven't read the post entirely, the child is 7 years old specifically which means the child in question would most likely be experimenting with pronouns. The parent in question would be coming by with the support and when you have a young child who is coming to terms with themselves, they will be experimenting with stuff regarding to their own identity. Things that you will need to keep in mind is that:  


\- Some people who identify as Nonbinary can still use Binary pronouns to describe their own gender, which means the child may be comfortable with those pronouns generally, however the child also may have requested to use They/Them or similar pronouns specifically. The parent here would be adapting to the child's new pronouns if that were the case, so of course there may be a few errors in the parent's attempts.  


\- Children are more likely to be exploring, which means the child may or may not have found the right pronouns individually. Once again the child in question is at least 7 years old and still coming to terms with Identity and Pronouns, with the parent attempting to support them (By no means do I attempt to gender the child alone, in fact I'd prefer not to refer to one individually until I know of that individuals pronouns).  


Normally this would be explainable for the Pronouns in question, although once again we do not know if the child is specifically comfortable with those set of pronouns and is rightfully set as They/Them until confirmed. My apologies if I am coming off as offensive, I just tend to see that sometimes people do not use a set of Pronouns until they feel it is comfortable for themselves and asks to refer to them as such before they come to terms with it. So maybe the Child has requested, or that the Parent is adapting to the new set of pronouns as the Child has stated privately. I hope this clears up some explanation maybe, as this doesn't feel like intentional misgendering towards a child.  


Once again I do apologise if I have the wrong context, given that the individual in question is a child and children tend to be exploring so it could be one of the outcomes that I stated.
Thank you and to you as well. This is not easy or uncomplicated in many ways. And all because of cultural messaging.
That’s so cool that you’ve talked about it! I was genuinely curious (and I’ve seen a few cases online and irl where otherwise supportive friends and family didn’t even realise they were using a “default” pronoun, and were mortified when it was brought to their attention), so I appreciate your kind response! Letting your kiddo lead the way is absolutely the right approach. I’m happy for her and you.
Yeah I’m nb and I use she/her pronouns so it’s not inherently incorrect
Thank you! People using default pronouns is one of my greatest fears, if some day she decides to change hers. Until then, it's just people generally referring to her as female. 

School bully: ""You have boy hair!""

Well meaning friend: ""No she doesn't, girls can have short hair too!"" 

Neither of them gets it, and it really highlights how a binary is drilled into our heads from birth. 

I asked what I should call her instead of girl, because I'd often start a sentence that way: ""Girl, get your clothes on. We're late!"" Or ""Baby girl."" She thought long and hard about it and said, ""I like 'Honey.'"" 🥺🥰😄
Yeah. My ex boyfriend is nb and he uses he/they pronouns but prefers he in public as to not draw attention. It’s pretty common. Being nb has no rules, that’s sorta the point. You’re just uniquely you and you fall wherever you want to"	x2358l	NonBinary	79	0.97	2022-08-31 03:33:49

Pronoun win!	"I still use she/her pronouns alongside they/them, though I’m leaning more toward they/them these days. 

I’ll be real, sometimes I use she/her simply when it’s more convenient. The other day, my partner and I were at the bank, and my partner referred to me as “they” to the teller. The guy was confused for a moment, but then my partner just gestured to me and repeated what they’d said, and the teller understood. It was such a small moment that was so affirming. It reminded me that my partner sees me as non-binary all the time, not just when it’s convenient ❤️"	"I love that. It really is the most affirming thing when people in our lives make it clear to us that they see us as who we are, and they're not simply memorizing our names and pronouns like many others do.

Nice!
Looking good!!! Also, are those Rothy’s shoes?!
Thanks!
Yup! I love them. So comfy : )

Update on my post worrying about my date not knowing I was NB!	"I posted a couple of weeks ago asking for advice about when’s best to come out whilst dating because the person I had a date set up with didn’t know I was nonbinary... 

It ended up not being an issue... she asked for my insta which clearly states I’m nonbinary, liked a post I made about winning a binder in a competition and I asked for her pronouns and told her mine before we met. During our date I just casually talked about it and she was just... cool with it! And we have a second date arranged already! So it all worked out great ☺️ "	"Aaaaahh that's wonderful.

Do you think it's a bad time to start identifying as non-binary?	I feel like there are lots of bigots everywhere and they are currently winning and keep winning, and I am scared.	"I think it’s gonna be a bad time to be anything out of “the norm” for a while, there are always gonna be bigots and nasty people. If you don’t feel safe to be open about your identity then you don’t have to be. You are who you are, but you don’t have to tell anyone or do anything that might put you in danger x
I would just be very careful about who you come out to. It doesnt make you any less nonbinary to hide it to avoid hate.
Part of why I decided to finally come out was to spite the bigots in my country… but I am also an adult in a state that is very safe. I don’t have a lot I am risking personally at least in the near term. So do what you gotta do to protect yourself.
There's never been a good time to identify as non binary. Maybe there will be, but that will come with experience, when people meet non binary people. Just keep safe and don't disclose to people you aren't comfortable with. Be true to yourself. Love yourself enough to want to show the world you. I'm a socially awkward schizo, but sometimes I find people that accept me. ME. and the best feeling in the world I think is being able to be yourself in front of someone.
Its certainly not the best time to be any kinda trans. Which, while thats terrible, doesnt mean we should be quieter about existing.
Progress is always met with extremist backlash. Progress usually feels like 3 steps forward, 2-4 steps back.
I have to say is that I regret not having done that kind of thing 30+ years ago. 

Or at least have started openly violating the stereotypes enforcing the binary at that time.

At the very least....DO YOU!

I'm talking about the you that's not reshaped to conform to the binary.

And don't wait. The low level suck associated will grind a lot worse in the long run than the initial friction that's part of coming out.
Firstly, they are not winning. At least not for long. Understand that all of these setbacks are temporary and the average person does not care about how you identify and what you want to do with your life (in a positive way). These are not popular laws happening. I can't promise or know when it will get better, but so many people are fighting for us.

Also, we don't live in closets in times like these. That doesn't mean come out to everyone and anyone, but be yourself. It's how we show the world that nothing will make us go away. Trans people didn't disappear during the 50's, 60's, and 70's. They found places to be safe and built community. That's important for your safety.

Dandelions grow under the most harsh conditions, unapologetically. Be a dandelion in concrete. Grow and be yourself. Not doing that is letting the fascists win.
Protect yourself. Very few people know how I identify. My partner supports me, and that is enough to nourish my peace of mind. 

Very few friends know, and 0 family members. 

Living in a progressive area is probably a huge advantage, but as someone living in the southern US, safety first.
I came out on March 31st, trans day of visibility, it went well! 

But there’s no rush to come out or announce anything, knowing you are non-binary is just as valid as being out to the world. I personally have know I was non-binary since 2017, and just now “announced” it. Be out to yourself, see how that feels!
Something I took comfort in is that 30 years ago when conservatives banned (mostly nonexistent) marriage equality, very few states said ""nope."" Already we see legislation proposed or passed to protect gender affirming health care.

I don't feel I have a choice. Living in the closet will kill me one way or another.
Don't let the hate silence you
You're right that there are bigots everywhere and they are very loud and getting a lot of attention. 

For me, this means that 1) I am intentionally not staying too attached to my job and my home in case I need to move, and 2) I haven't changed my gender marker on any official paperwork.

However, I still came out as nonbinary and still ask people to use my correct pronouns. The mental health boost of being seen as I truly am is worth it, as well as being able to be a support for others, including young people who live in my area.
I think it's fine, whether you want to come out of the closet about it is up to you though. Prioritise safety first and foremost
I kind of dip my toes in the water with friends I trust. Like ""yeah idk I think I'm feeling a bit nonbinary, I saw some memes and really relate to it. Makes a lot of sense, you know?"" Actually had one friend ask chatgpt about it and figure out I'm more agender lol. Worst case scenario I get some ally discussions going even if I don't really make anything of it.

For work though... I see so many people list their pronouns. And I just don't do it. People probably think I'm ultraconservative for refusing to list them and really I'm the opposite.
I keep thinking to myself that I should be afraid to be who I am right now, but it has actually been pushing me to be more me, if that makes sense.
You have to weigh your own personal risks. If it helps, I just yesterday came out to my mostly conservative family and the responses have been overwhelmingly supportive.
I came out to everyone when I moved to a safe blue state (NM for anyone wondering). 

I was going to change my gender marker to X on my DL, but with all the laws being passed, I've decided against it for now, as I still want to be able to do some traveling and I don't want to get myself in an unsafe position as a result. It's heartbreaking and I'm hurt about it. I finally am out, I'm even out to my insurance! They have my correct pronouns! 

I did not come out in TX while living there, publically. I came out to one friend, because they have a trans kid and we were talking about stuff in relation to that. 

If I were still in Texas I still would not be fully out, and I would not present myself the same way I do presently as I am very much perceived as queer right now. It wasn't quite as blatant as before.
I know things seem bleak right now, but it’s not bad everywhere. If worse comes to worse, there’s currently a petition in the House of Commons in Canada to allow trans and non binary people to claim asylum here. And no matter where you are, you can find people who support you.
I mean, it's a better time than a few decades ago. It's a worse time than it will be in 50 years. Society progresses slowly, unfortunately. But no, generally speaking most people aren't hateful. Most people are ignorant and don't understand but aren't necessarily malicious or dangerous. It's just that too many people don't understand so they don't speak up for us, which allows those crappy laws and attitudes to spread. But you can always do it one small step at a time, only around people you can trust, and see how you feel over time.
It's not about how you identify, it's about how open you are about it. Discretion is key. Be safe and smart about coming out.
I had this thought when I was coming to terms with stuff. There's not much you can do about identifying as non binary if you do, but I guess you can hide it from people if you're worried. In some ways it's a scarier time and in other ways it's a better time than it has been because there's more understanding of non binary identities.

Whatever the time, how you identify is for you, and that can be wonderful whatever the climate
You can always come out to yourself and people close to you, that you know you trust. I’m very afraid myself and I’m “out” in the way that I made some sort of announcement a while back and never mentioned it again because I’m too scared to correct people and have them possibly be abusive to me. 

You can be who you want to be, you don’t have to tell everyone if it’s unsafe for you.
I feel you on this. I realized just over a year ago that I'm nonbinary. I always knew before that that something was different about me, but I didn't start to accept it until last year. I'm still mostly in the closet. Only 3 people in my life know that I'm nonbinary. Lately, the dysphoria has been getting worse, and I do really want to come out and start transition. But I also feel like you do. I'm terrified of coming out and transition. I'm hearing transphobia every day, and I'm terrified of being visible for fear of backlash/violence. It's such a great time to realize you're nonbinary...

Personally, I'm going to be cautious. My husband knows. I've come out to two people I figured would be supportive (and I was correct). Idk if I'll come out to anyone else right now. I'm definitely not coming out to everyone. I'm also trying to work on affording top surgery, but I think it's gonna take years. I'm afab though, so I think if I don't feel safe coming out to a specific person after top surgery and they ask about it, I'll probably just say that I had it done as cancer prevention. As for hormones or anything else, I'm not sure yet.
Identify: never. Just be careful who you share it with, if you have to 💜"	12cg4fx	NonBinary	49	0.93	2023-04-05 10:46:13

Children for the win!	"Overheard an elementary schooler say, ""you look like a boy mixed with a girl or a girl mixed with a boy."" Made. My. Day."	"I teach kids and the first couple weeks at a new school, even without makeup and with a beard shadow, I would get a lot of “Ms..Mr....uh Ms.” and a few “what are you?” “Are you a boy or a girl?” which would be threatening coming from adults but is pretty adorable coming from kids. It really shows you how many of our gender cues are learned and not some innate sense.
Children really are the best at this. My kid has a toy that is ""a boy and a girl"" and says the same about me. It ain't no thing. He's awesome. Kids can be very good at this. 
I love children. A few years ago, when I was started to present as male more often, I was sitting with some kids at convention and they tried to figure out my gender and actually argued. It was hilarious and it genuinely helps with dysphoria to remember that.
D'awwr :)
I should add I’m nonbinary so being in that ‘ambiguous’ space was actually quite comfortable until all the teachers started gendering me male and the kids picked up on it"	78zhf6	NonBinary	46	0.96	2017-10-26 23:29:33

Unisex condom invented- I feel so relieved?	"I just read about a new type of unisex protection for pregnancy and STIs/STDs and I am so stoked about it. For a long time the personal sexual protection scene has had me a bit uncomfortable due to how they tend to be labeled and referred to(manly man condom for her pleasure blah blah blah or ""Female condom"" for instance), and also how the burden of providing protection and the consequences of ""failed"" protection tend to be distributed(penetrative partner being the one who is often framed as getting to ""choose"" protection and the receiving partner typically being the one who has more risk and recieves more blame). This invention has me feeling much better about so many things. I really feel like this could help equalize and de-ciscentralize sexual protection wherever it is adopted, and I am all for that. The other non-gender related benefit being that it could probably improve protection rates for HPV and other skin-to-skin transmitted infections. Win-win-win! Thought I'd share here in case anyone else would be similarly relieved. They're also latex free! As a person who has a sensitivity to latex this is very, very welcome.

Discuss? Am I the only one who finally feels as if I'm not being cornered by the social framing of what should be a gender-agnostic personal protection product?


[Wondaleaf Unisex Condom](https://www.wondaleaf.com/wondaleaf-unisex-condom/) Currently only available in the country it was invented in, Malaysia, but they're working on international release. Note: headline up above states ""Empowering All Genders!"" which is nice, but the two how to videos for use are labeled as ""Male"" and ""Female"" use. Just a heads up!"	"That's a real game-changer!! Thank you so much for posting about this!!
Will be interesting to watch the videos when I can, as my main concern is that it is more difficult to use and thus have a higher rate of failure that traditional barrier contraception. This truly is great to see though!
Dr Doe of [youtube.com/c/sexplanations](https://youtube.com/c/sexplanations) introduced me to the term, ""in condoms"" (for these sorts of condom) and ""out condoms"" (for the more common type). Removing gender from the terminology as it serves no purpose, (unlike condoms which can be very useful for all people of all genders.)
Ah, whatever my wife has got, I got, and vice versa. This is good for others and I'm ecstatic progress was made here, but personally I'm just gonna embrace the HPV at this point
I was definitely reflecting on this while watching. Classic condoms are the most effective single method when used correctly but are frequently used incorrectly. I like that this design, unlike classic condoms, can be used by either type of partner before any ""action"" occurs, which I feel might improve efficacy rates for some groups. I am aware that the ""Female condom"" can be inserted before hand but I like that this can go either way, not just inserted, and also looks less clumsy than ""female condom"" (some of the most common complaints I've seen mentioned).  It also involves an adhesive, which while possibly a harder sell for some, also has the potential to reduce oopsies relating to slippage etc., and is one size, hopefully reducing fit issues. Only time will tell of course, but I expect the benefits for sex work specifically could be pretty high, especially since initial results suggested that many users preferred the feel to ""traditional"" options. 

I don't want to sound like an infomercial or a total nerd, but I am very into anything that can keep more people safer more easily. I just hope it can be produced at a market compatible price point and green lit within a reasonable time frame.
Nice! I'll check it out. I'm always looking for new good youtube resources. 😊
Edit: link was weird for me but [hopefully this one works](https://youtube.com/c/sexplanations), if anyone else wanted to follow a new rabbit hole as well.
There is a vaccine that protects against some of the nastier HPV viruses. (And in a world where an HPV infection can be just a handshake away, and some HPV cause cervical cancers, I'm glad that it exists.)
the one size and adhesive thing are kind of cancelling each other out. Traditional condoms stay on via a tight fit, you cannot ensure that with just one size and have to make it so that its too large for most people, which means the adhesive will need to do all the work of keeping it on when applied externally. Don't really know all that much about what the differences with internal application would be.
Thank you for the corrected link, (I think I confused reddit URLs and YouTube - I've fixed the link in my previous comment, thank to you.)
Oh absolutely people should get that! It just didn't exist when me and her were growing up and sexually active and we met later in life.

I really do envy some of the younger generations that grew up with chicken pox vaccines, HPV, and now with the even more modern mRNA technology that we've seen with covid, I've heard that vaccinations against HIV might even be possible. I'm sitting here just hoping I don't eventually get shingles.

Thankfully I believe I got the hepatitis vaccine, forget which one it covers."	qoq4xw	NonBinary	41	0.95	2021-11-07 14:55:14

School leaves everyone confused... I love it	"I never told anyone if I'm male or female, I'm pretty much evenly gendered atm (no common neutral pronouns available for me because I'm German, sigh) but I just asked my English teacher if she can use they/them on me, she was confused at first, but said yes!

The girls next to me were confused, thinking I was also a girl and why I wouldn't use she/her (which my physics teacher uses on me and I never correct him) while the boys in front of me were confused bc they thought I was a boy (they always use he/him for me and I never budged about that. No, I like it!)

But NOONE asked me what I ""actually"" am, so the confusion can continue for a while. And also noone seems to even care, and I told them I don't care either what pronouns they use on me. Big win right here😎"	"That’s great!

Pronouns Win	"Okay so,

I have been doing jujitsu recently (past 5 months) and it’s been great. But the space is generally a very “traditionally masculine” “tough guy” environment. I am a non binary masc leaning individual who gets mistaken as a woman often. 

I often get called she and her during practice but I NEVER corrected anyone or lead intros with my pronouns because it didn’t seem like a safe place and I didn’t want to have a conversation or have to be the poster child for gender queerness in this group. I just wanted to fight and learn the sport. 

A few weeks ago my coach followed me on Instagram. I was worried at first. He would See my super gay content and my pronouns        But I allowed him to follow anyway. He continued to misgender me and I continued  to ignore it. Especially since I felt anxious about correcting. I know he saw my pronouns on there but I just figured it wasn’t going to happen. 


Then today at class, he says “now grab her —I mean *their* leg and tried to correct himself a few times today. And I lost it and just cried. After class I thanked him for that and appreciated him for just quickly trying to correct and for seeing me and that I felt much safer and respected and as though I was SEEN. He said he was sorry and was trying to fix it. Told me I was welcome and safe and gave me a hug.

Is this gender validation?	Today I was dressed in a very feminine outfit, tight black jeggings, hot pink belt, pink Adidas hoodie, and a pair of Doc Martin platform boots along with my vibrant blue hair, black facemask with very clear “they/them” pronoun pin on it, moderate eye makeup and sky high mascara on naturally long lashes and my usual noise cancelling headphones. I was purchasing cosmetics, didn’t speak a word and was still referred to as ‘sir’. 🙄 Then, I had to pee so I immediately went into the men’s washroom, ‘cuz why not at this point, where I clearly made some kid question if they were in the right washroom or not. He looked at me with the most confused look on his face, looked around, looked back at me with the most impressive WTF look ever. I was literally misgendered both ways within minutes of each other. I’ll accept that as a win for the day. 🤣	"It sounds like you looked really awesome, by the way :-) I love vibrant blue hair.
What is the nonbinary polite address for nonbinary ppl, instead of Sir or Ma'am?

That question arose for me reading this. Like maybe they did clock the ""they/them"" but weren't sure how to address you at the register in that case.

I wish more places had high privacy, any gender bathrooms. I've been in some in San Francisco. It's basically no urinals, taller doors with no gaps at the sides of the doors. It's not possible to look under or over the doors. They would be more expensive to construct, but I suspect that if there were pressure to build rest rooms to those standards, designers could find ways to bring costs down somewhat. It would always be more, most likely, since more raw material is required. 

Sorry for all the tangents, but I'm glad you had a good day that day! I like your description of your look!
Instead of using sir or ma’am, simply leave those words out. In my case it was “Thank you, sir, have a nice day”, which could have just been “Thank you, have a nice day”. There really was no need for a gender specific response and it still would have been considered polite.

As far as gender-neutral washrooms, there are several places where I live that have “family washrooms” or actual “all gender change rooms”, which is nice. This particular place required obtaining a code from customer service in order to enter the “family washroom” and I had to pee too bad to walk that far and I didn’t really want to talk to anyone anyways.
Yes, I agree! I wonder if cashier training is bad, like if they are usually taught that they must say 'sir' or 'ma'am', or 'miss' if younger, perhaps. I'm a demigirl, read as female, and ""she"" pronouns are fine, but I've always hated being called 'miss' or 'ma'am'. I should have explained in my first message that I asked the question because I often feel irritated at checkout. I understand that they are doing what they are trained to do, so I don't blame them, but I still hate it.

Can certainly understand your choice not to go back to get the code when you need to pee and don't feel like talking!"	slt5v2	NonBinary	33	0.96	2022-02-06 09:53:46
I’m not really okay right now, I was just harassed on the street and I’m not sure what to do with my feelings.	I was out with my fiancé on our average trip to the local farmers market, and on the way back as we were getting into our car, this fat drunk redneck yells “child molester” at us. Mind you, I’m wearing for me a very masculine outfit, something I thought I would be safe in. I guess the silver purse and small choker didn’t help, I guess I just didn’t expect it on a day I purposely tried to be a bit more lowkey. I stopped wearing makeup, dying my hair lately as times feel a lot more terrifying. People in my town weren’t emboldened to say shit like that in the streets before the pandemic, now I don’t feel comfortable even going out dressed in more cis friendly clothing. I can’t fucking win. :( thankfully we’re moving to a queer friendly area, but I’m terrified for the other people who can’t. I’m scared of what this country is becoming, I’m scared of what has happened to my home.  And honestly I’m glad my fiancé was there, I probably would’ve gotten into a physical altercation with this fuck if he wasn’t, and I would’ve won. I’m so hurt and angry, I just don’t know what to do, I know breaking that guys jaw would feel good but it’s obviously not worth it. At least I’m able to defend myself, but what scares me most of all is all my friends and others who can’t. Please stay safe out there, I fear things are only getting worse.	"it's a scary world :( i'm so sorry this happened to you. the part where you said you would've won made me laugh, he'd have deserved it lol. 

its so stupid someone can like verbally assault us or whatever and literally all we did was like. wear something. and people think that's equally as bad if not worse.

honestly i feel scared for the people who's brains are rotting enough to say that to another human being who's just existing......
You didn't deserve that. It's totally OK for you to feel upset or angry. They are the ones that should be questioning their feelings. Jerks have been around forever. Something like 10 years ago, I was with someone that was yelled at from a car for being fat (Not that it's important but she really wasn't, just out living life). 

How horrible it must be to ride around with in their heads all day. To live such miserable, hateful lives. To not experience empathy or have nice people around you. Imagining no other option but to push others down, in an attempt to raise themselves up. Sucks to be them"	12n6mgo	NonBinary	32	1.0	2023-04-15 15:08:35

Local win for NB & Trans folk!	A local school has done away with gendered school uniforms and has instead combined the two into a single uniform! I'm no longer in school but I'm so glad to see progress for the younger people and to see it being shared openly!	"[News Article](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/somerset-school-adopt-gender-neutral-4982807)
That is cool, but I wonder what gender neutral clothing is. I have a feeling that it is masculine.
I did some time at that place! Awesome to hear, thanks for sharing.

After years of misgendering, my dept gets it right	"I am so thankful I could cry right now. 

I've been struggling for years with the university where I'm writing my doctorate. Specifically, they claim to support gender expression, explicitly *including* non binary genders, but are 'unable' to register students as anything other than M or F. Today I was forwarded an email chain between my supervisor and department head about my thesis extension where they both used my correct pronouns throughout. 

It's not much, but a year ago my supervisor *rewrote* a letter of recommendation I had written for myself at his request, to 'correct' all the pronouns! 

I'll take the win, and hope it's the start of something new."	fuck ya! good luck fellow eldrich void!!!	s8i83b	NonBinary	29	0.94	2022-01-20 12:48:44

The results of my kid coming out as non-binary in a professional setting:	"I hope it’s okay to post for my kid, who is too young for Reddit but very comfortable sharing their non-binary status with everyone.

They will be playing a role as a voice actor for a podcast for kids, and mentioned to the creator that they prefer to go by they/them. The creator not only immediately switched to the correct pronouns, but also informed us that if my kid was okay with it she would like to make their character non-binary on the podcast as well.

It makes me so happy for them to be accepted and celebrated in this fashion. Just wanted to share an enby win for one who is young and impressionable. :)"	That's amazing :D	q1of58	NonBinary	28	0.98	2021-10-05 05:43:13

amab enby and i want to give up trying to be myself	"i'm so tired of being amab. (sorry for using AGAB but i just feel it describes the core issue) i came out as trans in my early 20s, (and i'm now nearing 30,) when puberty had already destroyed me, my voice , and height with T, i'm 5'10 (could be worse ig but i still have height dysphoria) but besides this nasty beard (one more reason i wish i was AFAB and not amab, no beard growth...)

whats making me want to give up is just... being amab & nb when it feels like everyone is an afab enby and that i aint valid and can't/won't with a tall, hypermasculine-ish body that screams well, male and society is disgusted if i dARE do anything nonconfirming? ahh

i gave up on wearing heels bc of my height, and now i'm close to giving up on being myself and going back into the closet and hiding until im old and pass away,, bc society hates anyone amab experimenting with gender or presentation and it'll just ruin me unless i'm with my best friends (i love all 3 of them but they live in diff countries)

but yeah, the other part is my features. i'm tall, broad shouldered (since pre-puberty even, idk what creepy cursed linebacker genetics i got but i had broad shoulders at 10-11 years old and its just disgusting.) so yeah i am a V shape (masc again yay) with quite possibly the ugliest and most masculine faceshape in the universe. oblong with a long chin (probably around 3-5 cm), long midface and tiny lips to exaggerate that and a double chin. if i cross my arms i scare myself and look buff, not even trying and i got biceps back then that won't disappear. i am quite skinny but then i got a huge ""beer"" tummy that makes me feel gross ...idk everything just screams masculinity.  i am so so done, i know and see sooooo many afab enbys who are out and proud, have cut their hair short. wear whatever the fuck they want and im here in a prison (my body) and i can't do anything to fix it or ease the dysphoria, heck i get he/himd with LONG HAIR too- there's just no winning i guess. i wanted the reverse of all of this, i wanted to be 5'3-5'6, have short hair, be semi-petite and just be.... androgynous, play around with short hairstyles. but that's impossible in my body.

/ventrantover"	"you shouldnt feel so alone, I'm in pretty much the exact same boat.
I feel this too I’m 6,2 and broad shoulders I wear flowy flowery skirts and makeup in public and get compliments on my “kilt” and it’s even worse in pants and outdoors wear. Your not alone there’s a lot of us we just gotta try our best to keep moving forward one step in front of the other
Amab enby here! :) the beard is a pain, I never seem to get a clean enough shave that I want!
Just another 6ft AMAB enby quickly approaching 30 here :) I don't know if I have any advice, but I can commiserate and let you know you aren't alone.
I’m not AMAB but I get the feeling of being too much like your AGAB, it’s destroying me. I try to present more as masc just to cover up my femininity.
Being NB is isolating enough but I do find that being AMAB makes things complicated both in terms of self expression and in terms of socialising. I've never really had much luck making any friends like myself and I find that most of my friendships are very surface level and tend to run their course relatively fast due to that and not really being comfortable revealing my true self to people

When you're perceived as AMAB most of the people you tend to befriend incidentally are cis men in my experience and it's basically impossible for me to ever feel truly comfortable around them
Amab NB here.  Also older... I hear you and you're not alone. I feel like I'm in a similar boat. I'm not broad but am very tall.    I'm trying to build up my hips and butt to give me some shape. 

Its so sad that society finds it hard to allow anyone amab to present in any way outside of gender norms.   I only hope things will get better... I mean skinny jeans would have been laughed off the street when I was younger but that's common masc presenting wardrobe addition these days.

Don't lose hope. Do small things that help. Paint nails, use mascara you don't have to leap straight into clothes and big changes.
It's painful how relatable this is... Also 5'10"", AMAB, early 30s, have a gut, besties in different countries, etc. I'm still mostly in the closet, but I'm gradually trying to change that. It's not hopeless though even if it sometimes seems that way.
Try being 6' 3"", with a truly masculine face, i.e. big ears, big nose, glasses and between the grey hair, angular face, broad shoulders and narrow hips. I sympathise with you, I know it isn't a contest. The only good thing is I have a great pair of legs. I'm still a gargoyle in a dress, though.
Splitting being nonbinary into amab and afab categories is a self defeating start. Amab is a title that was slapped on your butt when you were born but you don't need to carry it like a badge of shame. You are non-confrontational because a moderate chunk of our society doesn't accept the trans community but if you truly want to be yourself, you need to stand up for who that is. The reason you see other enbys doing what they want is because they've already been driven to that step. And if any of them had a beard or was 5'10"" would you doubt their validity in their identity? Personalize the parts you can change, pick out your favorite heels, throw on your cutest outfit, braid your long hair, shave your beard. Accept the parts you can't change, because being nonbinary isn't about being a 5'6"" perfectly androgynous person, its about being who YOU are. Remember the euphoria of every time you've tried something society said you can't enjoy, commit that to your heart, and step out of the closet to be the baddest bitch you deserve to be.
I am not AMAB, and I can't quite know what it's like for an enby who is, but I do have things about my body I can't change, that I wish I could. But I agree with what ChickerNuggy said. It is too often, perhaps almost always, very difficult for enbies to come out and to live the way they want to, that feels right for them.
Anyone you see doing that, they've probably struggled with it too.
You're not alone here. As an enby or as an AMAB enby.

There are things you can't change. And that is hard. But as difficult as it is, it is important to come to terms with what you can't change. That is something I am working on, and it's so much easier to just hate it, to be unkind to yourself about these things you have no control over. But you should work to be kinder, and to, eventually, come to terms with it.
Maybe try to focus more on what you can change?
There are ways to prevent facial hair from growing. Laser hair removal and electrolysis are ones I saw as options a moment ago. You could also wax. Effective but temporary.
You can do vocal training. It'll take time, I do expect it will be difficult to start, but eventually, you could have a voice closer to what you want. Maybe one easier to accept.
You can do exercises that target certain muscle groups to change your shape to some extent. If you don't want to appear muscular, you can find workout plans that won't cause as visible muscle growth in areas you don't want it. 
That's something I have been wanting to start, but I have difficulty forming habits, even though I actually generally enjoy exercise...
There's a person on TikTok who has videos on workouts to do to achieve several different body type goals. You might find one you like on her channel, bodybydaddy. If not, you may be able to find others who do something similar.

I don't know your situation, but you may be able to start HRT to help feminise yourself, to whatever point you feel comfortable, which may aid in having a less distinctly masculine appearance. 
If you feel it necessary and have the means, you may also be able to get surgery to help with that as well. I think they can sometimes be at least partially covered by insurance, but I don't know for sure, and I don't know where you are, but in the states at least there are several places trying to ban gender affirming care, which may make this even more difficult.
Lastly, and perhaps most physically easy to accomplish, clothes. Wear what you like, haters be damned.
If you are somewhere that this would be particularly unsafe, then do take precautions, there are some things you may want to compromise on in the interest of safety. You may be able to wear things that help you feel better about yourself while not attracting too much negative attention. And if that is the case, I would also suggest finding a safe place to go to, perhaps move somewhere safer, if at all possible. I know it won't be for everyone.
But there may be LGBTQ+ groups you could join, and if so, you may be able to make friends closer to you who will accept you for who you are and who you want to be.
You can certainly wear heels, if you want to. Tall women do, tall AFAB enbies too. I have a 5'10"" AFAB enby friend who loves to wear heeled boots. Makes them feel powerful. Being tall or being AMAB, even when combined, does not mean you shouldn't wear heels.
However, if it worsens dysphoria, it may not be the best option. Perhaps small heels would be ok?
You can try makeup too, if you haven't already. It can really help for some people. Depending on how much you use, it can be time consuming and expensive, but if you are able, it may help you look closer to what you want. Does take practice though.

Dresses, skirts, pants/trousers, heels, makeup, whatever. Wear what makes you happy.
Even wearing things that give you euphoria can be nerve-wracking sometimes. You may be afraid of what people will think or say, but keep going, if it's what makes you feel right with yourself. It's not easy to come out and to live the life you want when society tells you not to, but do it anyway. Be the person you want to be. Seek out the groups and individuals that will support you. They're out there, of that I am certain.
You should always do what is best for you. Nurture relationships with those who treat you with love and respect, and those who do not, you owe nothing to.
Take care and be well.
You’re not alone! Society treats us so differently because of our bodies. I’m not going to make comparisons to the experiences of others because I don’t know them. It’s true thst percieved gender nonconformity is really punished in male-bodied people, to the extent that it can present very real physical and social danger. 

I’m currently compromising a lot. It’s really hard to feel like yourself when you compromise everyday, but the alternative is a real sense of insecurity in the world. I don’t know, just to say that I understand what you’re saying. I’m also super frustrated about the effects of testosterone puberty like DANG it just hits everything doesn’t it.
You're not alone! AMAB genderqueer here. I started to socially transition about 12 years ago in my late 20s and at 30 I decided to start hrt. It has been an amazing journey but I very much feel you about the perception that non-binary is somehow ""woman lite"" and strongly associated with AFAB folks. While we might share the same gender I think that it is really important to acknowledge that our society treats folks differently when they violate gender norms in a way that it's perceived as moving towards masculinity as opposed to away from masculinity.
I am a 6'1"" broad-shouldered solidly-build Gen-X amab enby. I feel your pain. It is also my pain. My gender expression is pretty much masc. Because of my physical stature, I will always be read as a man.

Despite all of this, I have been enjoying my voice training. I am aiming for an androgynous voice. My inspiration is TransVoiceLessons and my favourite trans content creators on on YouTube. I am learning to control my pitch, weight, and R1, and improving my elocution.
I feel ya. I’m About the same height and am super skinny, so it highlights my more masc structure really clearly. I try everything I can to feel right, shaving, some accessories, and such, but it’s hard because I live with rather transphobic family in a pretty conservative (and religious) area. Luckily I look alright in stuff like baggier hoodies and turtlenecks, so I can wear more gender neutral stuff, but it really sucks not being able to experiment or even really have someone to talk to about this kind of stuff. If you ever want to talk, whether about this or anything else, I’d be more than willing to
Same buddy. I’m hoping to end myself too
Also feeling this, as a 35yo AMAB person who hates being called Sir / always passing as male, but also doesn't have any features etc that read as feminine or give any hints. I have a non-binary flag themed backpack and used to have a pronoun pin and stuff, but literally in two years, only one person noticed and corrected themself, so I know that's not helpful. I did however get some shitty remarks from assholes.

I don't know of any good advice or thoughts on this, but I'm right here with ya
Similar here, only I'm just starting hrt at 32, with receding hairline and a grey beard🥲
thank you qwq  thats exactly it. i feel so alone-  i have seen MAYBE 1 amab enby irl in the past year or two, meanwhile i'd see afab enbys (3 in one summer who weren't afraid to express themselves and a whole group of them in the capital the year before that, 4-5 people) and i both times felt like hiding out of shame. shame of my AGAB and my masc agab features , it hurts aaa
i appreciate just knowing that,, thank you ;w;
woowww. you're almost me lol, i also have the gut issue, and it won't go away. ironic how fat goes onto my tummy instead of hips, thighs and such where i'd RATHER it goes instead of on my tummy to make me look like older and with a beer gut-

don't think ive ever seen an AFAB person with just a gut either \*sigh\*
oww, i know,, its just the damn amab puberty and all my.. extreme-ish features. its so hard to accept them!! but i do appreciate your words so much <3

(also this vent helped me out a lot, it felt good to let it out aaa)
well feel free to message me any time you need a friend :)
I started to attend local monthly pride events and found many other amab enbies. One masc-presenting amab enby with a magnificent red beard just got elected to our regional council (local government with responsibility for natural resources and public transport)!
I have it go to my thighs and hips, but my gut has gotten larger faster lol, so it kinda feels like it cancels the others out. I'm trying to get it through my head though that there is a lot of dysmorphia mixed together with my dysphoria and so things aren't necessarily as impossible as it feels like.

Also, returning to your original post: You are super valid and regardless of what kind of body you have, you are absolutely non-binary.

I totally get you on the whole ""feels like everyone is an afab enby"" thing. I think this has been a problem for a while now. I believe that this is because we live in a society built on misogynistic foundations and for those of us who were AMAB and want to adopt what have ""traditionally"" been considered more ""feminine"" traits as a part of our expression, this is seen by many to be especially unacceptable. Femininity is often looked down upon as inherently weak/submissive/etc. in our patriarchal society. Toxic masculinity is engrained into our psyches from an early age. I feel that this is largely the reason why we see fewer AMAB people come out publicly as non-binary. It is also the case that some people (mainly cis) tend to lack a necessary understanding of what it means to be non-binary. When a much larger number of AFAB non-binary people are out of the closet and still incorrectly ""female-coded"" by ignorant cis people, it creates the perception that non-binary people are just ""woman-lite,"" when that is nonsense."	112n8zi	NonBinary	28	0.94	2023-02-15 02:30:52
"Does anyone else feel like they suddenly switch between ""feeling"" male and female?"	"I’m wondering if any non-binary folk experience gender in a similar way to me and are open to discussing it?  Most of the non-binary people I know are agender - which is not how identify, and I just feel really alone.

Does anyone else feel like they switch between feeling inwardly male and inwardly female?  I’m not talking about feeling more masculine or more feminine that day, but actually feeling like your gender in your brain switches?

I’m AFAB, and the ""switch"" to male usually comes on suddenly with a crushing feeling of dysphoria and a little bit of hopelessness because transitioning doesn’t feel like an option when half the time I relate to my assigned gender (and the other half I don’t). I feel like I'm in a no win situation here.

EDIT: This post isn't about labels, it's about how I can transition when the goal posts keep moving. I'll have dysphoria no matter what I do. I guess I'm looking for someone who might relate to that experience for advice or failing that... mutual wallowing."	"> Most of the non-binary people I know are agender

Wow, I'm surprised to hear this! Not to exclude you further, but I sometimes feel like the only agender person in my circles. 

What you're describing could be [gender fluid](http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Gender_Fluid)?
You might feel comfy in the bigender label? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigender 

Myself I understand the feeling lost, unlike agender binary folks I have a sense of gender but I feel mostly neutral and the middle with some slight vacillation from time to time on the male or female end.

I haven't found a label that really fits yet for me either. Just gotta check in with myself alot and see what's going on with me.
Here's what I would do:

Make a list of the things you like about presenting as each gender, assuming there are specific aspects of each that you enjoy. When you're done, compare the two lists and try to find similarities between them.

My idea here is that if you identify the core similarities, you can make that your primary identity and alter it slightly depending on how you're feeling that day. It might give you more static confidence about yourself while allowing you to still express yourself differently from time to time.

 Hope this helps :)
[deleted]
Sometimes i do the switch, literally from one heartbeat to the next, but it's usually short-lived and situational. I'm AFAB bi-gender, girl and demi-guy. For me it can be influenced by who I'm with or where I am. 

I go to the hardware store, and in the back where I'm consulting over parts and the project with the guys who work the parts counter, my guy side is totally in charge. I may be dressed in a pretty silk flowered skirt and a pink top, but I completely forget being female. Then I walk to the front counter, which is mostly women, and I;m a woman again, chatting with the ladies, 100% girl. 

Yeah, it's dizzying and yeah, there's a tiny ""shock moment"" in the middle, but I've been doing it all my life, and for literally decades I thought it was somewhere in the range of ""normal."" I didn't understand what was happening until just over a year ago. Everyone around me saw it and sometimes commented on it (especially my husband) but they didn't have the words to explain what they were seeing.

I have these little gender switches all the time, but I also have the bigger, long term swings. I spend a few months as all girl, there's a month or two of being both at once, then a few months as a guy. I happen to be in a guy swing at the moment, but I still have those girl moments. I find it more dysphoric have a female shift during a guy swing than the reverse.

I've finally decided to fully transition physically, but retain my female social identity most of the time. It was a hard decision, because, boobs. I need them for the clothing styles I prefer, but I've realized they're only a ""fashion accessory"" for my girl side. I can buy falsies at a store so my large-breasted female identity can remain intact, and have the physical male chest my guy side demands. Essentially I worked out a ""treaty"" between my two sides, once I figured out what was most important to each of my genders. I'm also getting bottom surgery (simple meta) because, seriously, who's gonna know what's in my underwear but me?
Been lurking here for a while and just finally got myself a username because ***YES*** — although usually not as suddenly or distinctly as you describe. Most of the time I can't really feel the switch happen, but there are times when I (AMAB) 100% or at least 98.7% want to rock a femme-coded body & wardrobe & feel a deep jealousy towards anyone I see who does... then other times when I feel like I'd actually be happiest with just a more fit masc body and some tighter, more stylish clothes on hand. I often can't predict when I'll feel dysphoria from looking in the mirror and when I'll catch myself thinking I look great. Sometimes I can't stop thinking about how I wish I could make my beard or shoulder width invisible, other times they're not on my mind at all and when I notice them I find them flattering. Etc., etc.

Similar feelings about labels, too — I really don't care about refining my own further than ""nonbinary"" and ""transfeminine"" (which I think of as basically a more positive version of ""AMAB,"" i.e. the feminine aspect of my identity is what makes me trans, not necessarily that I feel more feminine than masculine on the whole). I understand the differences between agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, poly-/bigender, and so on, and recognize that they're important to some folks, but they don't feel like useful distinctions for me personally, at least not at this point.

As far as finding actions, rather than labels... I'm thinking about trying a low dose of E for a few months to see how I feel about the psychological changes, since I care about those a lot more consistently than the physical ones. I know people have done this with T as well — a ""trial period,"" followed by either ramping up the dose or stopping for a bit (or one and then the other). Maybe starting with a patch rather than an injection, in the case of trying T. Basically I've been on the fence too long not to be curious how E will affect me, even though I have 0 idea whether I'm interested in going long term with it. IDK, from what people say it seems like starting hormones can also maybe help clarify/recontextualize one or the other side of a person's feelings about the prospect? (This is me guessing that when you say ""transitioning"" you're including HRT.)

Are there particular body features that bother you more than others when you're feeling in one ""mode"" or the other that you could take non-permanent actions to see how you can change them, e.g. growing out leg/body hair or getting a binder if you haven't already? For me I'm currently looking for a waxing specialist or someone who can advise me on a relatively safe, natural way to remove my beard hair at the root (not laser or anything permanent), because shaving still leaves an obvious shadow and foundation exhausts me. Like, I just want to know what I even look like without the bottom half of my face bluish-grey before I can fathom deciding whether to keep the hair there or ditch it forever. Is there anything equivalent in your case, that might take away a feminine-coded part of your look that sometimes bothers you, while not necessarily adding something that's strongly masculine-coded, but giving you the option not to have Body Feature A out in the open undercutting your presentation should you want to present masc? (For me, having zero beard evidence visible wouldn't keep me from looking masc if I wanted, but just would would mean it didn't have to be there immediately alerting everyone of my AGAB no matter what.) I guess trying a binder before deciding about top surgery would be one analogy, but maybe there are others that are specific to you?

TBH I really feel you about not knowing what to do when the goal posts keep shifting, but I'm trying to focus on concrete actions that can at least help me gather more information about what affects me the most, or give me more options/a blanker canvas.

Sorry for the wall of comment, hope this was mostly quasi-relevant and came across as slightly more helpful than just me spilling out everything I've had pent up! Dysphoria sucks hard and knowing it may always find new ways to come back is really distressing... Be kind to yourself as much as you can, and although it can be ridiculously difficult when you feel overwhelmed I strongly recommend setting little targets for individual concrete steps to try out, one at a time! <3
Sounds like you might be genderfluid or genderflux?
I'm AMAB, and although I definitely do experience switches, they are usually not accompanied by massive amounts of dysphoria, so I can't completely relate. I do, however, agree that fully physically transitioning might not be the solution, given that your assigned gender feels right 50% of the time. How far down the road of ""temporarily transitioning"" have you gone? Do you own a binder, a packer and masculine clothes? Maybe that would be a better solution? I know that breastforms help me a hell of a lot when I just ""switched"" to female for the umpteenth time.
What do you mean by transitioning? If you mean it in the very traditional sense of moving towards one or the other at the end of the day this isn’t something you need to do (though you can of course). I feel there is nothing wrong with approaching your gender identity as you see fit on a day to day basis, and doing whatever you need to feel comfortable in that be it how you present or act in front of others/yourself. 

That is my approach to being a non binary trans person. I’m not doing hrt or anything to actually change myself as of now (though I am socially transitioning). 
i know someone very well who is like this. i am agender so i can't really help, but just know u aren't alone 
Okay so i’ve just stumbled upon this arena sort-of-speak. I tried reading all comments before answering but there were a lot so I apologize if im simply being redundant, in advance. 
I know it’s not about labels, i hate having to use a label yet that is why we have language so that we can best describe how we feel and what we think so yeah. 
I’ve always felt androgynous or probably maybe even more accurately, non-binary. I dont believe (not 100%) that there are “female”/“male” characteristics. I feel as though people are people.
Just a little about me so that when i tell you what im doing now, you can kind of have a full picture: I am biologically female, only attracted to females, and 95% of the time, present myself as a male. I’ve always been pretty much okay with my body but i always had a problem with not being able to have my breasts free and really just having them altogether. I’ve always wanted to be able to walk around with no shirt (if i wanted). 
Idk what triggered it but i bought an stp and started lifting weights. Those two combined idk what change had the most affect on how i feel but i feel even better than i normally feel. It may be the fact that im breaking so many societal stipulations. I am aware that im female. I dont think the way that I behave fall into either male of female characteristics 100%. Now physically i share both male and female traits. 
Simply, at this moment, i dont feel the need to go through a major change. I just happened to fall onto small ones, and I believe that for me, small was better. Oh i also dont wear bras anymore unless i have to (i work at a very physically-demanding job). That too made me feel differently. 
Idk if this helps but i hope it does because, for me, finding that there are other persons that feel the way or similar to the way i feel is awesome!
Joke's on you. I'm plural.
Maybe try getting a binder to use for days you feel male, since you said you wouldn’t fully want to transition. You can wear it and take it off whenever you feel like it
Hi :) Thanks for commenting!

We might need to swap circles :P

It's not really about the label, more about how I can transition when the goal posts keep moving. I'll have dysphoria no matter what I do.
Thanks for commenting! :)

I wish you luck with finding a label that fits you (if you want a label at all!).  For me, it's not about the label - I'm comfortable with non-binary or genderqueer or even bigender like you suggested - it's more about what I do with it now that I know who I am.  I can't just hit a switch that changes my body every time my brain changes gender (how cool would that be? Someone get on that please! :P) . Dysphoria sucks. Many of my trans and enby friends are transitioning in some way, and I just don't know what that looks like yet for me.

Thanks :)

That's great advice!  I hadn't thought of making two lists. I usually just think about my body when I'm dysphoric on ""boy"" days, and at the time, I'm just guessing that I wouldn't like the alterations as a ""girl"".  Maybe I wouldn't mind some of them.
Hey! Thanks :) I'm so glad I'm not alone in this.

I'm not on T, but the fear of getting the dysphoria both ways is one of the reasons I'm not sure T is right for me.

I can go weeks without having a ""boy"" day. To the point where I think I might have made all this up, but then ""he"" comes back with the crushing feeling of dysphoria.  ""He"" wants to be a cis male in those moments too (top and bottom dysphoria), which is obviously not possible. So even if I did medically and surgically transition, I don't know if I would still be happy even on those ""boy"" days.

I'm glad that you've found something that works for you, even if it is a fine line.  It great to hear stories of those that experience gender in a similar way to me finding a method that works for them :)

I'm okay - just thinking that this would be a whole lot easier if I was born cis in either gender, or if I was FtM.  If I was FtM my pathway would be clearer.

Wow... that situational switch is exactly what I'm experiencing.

I hadn't had a chance to talk this through in therapy yet, but so far I have a hunch that (for me) this may be more a thing of switching gender roles, not actual gender. Obviously I still have some work to do on this in therapy.

I'm AMAB, and I noticed that I get thrown back into the male role less often when my estradiol level is at the upper end of what it's supposed to be for HRT (just below 200 pg/ml). When I was around 100pg/ml this happened a lot more often.

I relate to the sudden switches (and the longer term swings).  I also understand the situational switch, though it's not about gender roles for me (if that's what you've described), it's about an inside feeling and the depressing knowledge that I will never get to be a cis guy. It happens a lot when I'm around gay guys or gay characters.  I'm pansexual and on ""boy"" days (or moments) I tend to me more attracted to men and vice versa.

I'm glad that you've found a way to compromise between your two sides. Best of luck with it all!
I'm so glad you related so much to my post that you got a username! This comment was relevant to me absolutely - so great to see once again that I'm not alone in some of these feelings.

A multitude of labels could fit me. Genderqueer/Non-binary fit, but I wish there was an easier way to explain my gender to others that don't experience the sudden switching. Sometimes I feel like a crazy person. It's not multiple personalities - I'm still me - I just wish my body matched my brain.

I've heard about low dose E or T for a short period of time acting as a way of clarification as well.  Like, your body sighs in relief ""yes, this is what has been missing"".  The effects of E are a little bit more reversible than the effects of T apparently, so the thought of T terrifies me a bit.

Trying to find something (like binding) is a good idea. I like how I look in a shirt when I bind, but it's too painful for me to do much because of how large my chest is.  The dysphoria is less painful than binding... *facepalm*.  On days like today, I want top surgery.  But, on girl days I love my femme curves - a reduction might give me the best of both worlds - but maybe then my hips would look disproportionate (I'm a slightly overweight hourglass shape at the moment - my bust and hip measurements match perfectly).

Even if I were to surgically alter myself, I don't know if I would be happy because I will never be a cis guy, and I won't even look like a cis girl anymore. I might make the dysphoria worse.

Good luck with waxing to see if you like how you look without your beard hair.  If you live near a city, most waxing places would have ""male"" (ugh) waxing items on their service lists - you'd probably need to grow it out a bit first though. Waxing is safe if they are reputable and trained (just painful) - there's a risk of ingrown hairs, but you can get those with shaving too.

Focusing on concrete actions is good advice!  I tend to wallow and feel like everything is hopeless no matter what I do, but maybe there is a path for me as well.

Thanks again. Be kind to yourself as well. :) <3 
Thanks for commenting!

It's not really about the label, more about how I can transition when the goal posts keep moving. I'll have dysphoria no matter what I do.

Do you relate at all?
Glad to hear someone else experiences switches as well and that it's not just me!  I own a binder (though I don't use it because of how painful it is) and masculine clothes.  Not a packer - that might be something to explore!  Thanks for the advice! :)
I think in the post I was talking about medically and surgically transitioning to lessen dysphoria (but then I might get reverse dysphoria on ""girl"" days), but social transition seems kind of hopeless too.  I've come out to a few people.  I haven't changed my pronouns (I'm pronoun indifferent because of my ever fluctuating gender) or my name (I like it). My hair and clothes are kind of butch with the occasional ""girly"" dress.  I don't bind, my chest is quite large and binding is too painful.  I love my family, and I don't think they'd ever really understand my gender if I came out to them.  They barely understand my pansexuality.

I'd be interested in hearing about your social transition as a non-binary person if you're willing to share your experience?
Thanks so much for taking the time to let me know about your friend :) it’s good to know I’m not alone.
Sorry, I'm not sure I understand your comment.
Oh, I'm sorry for the unsolicited label! I kind of feel that, but maybe differently. One of my friends put my experience succinctly before; she said ""it's like wearing masc *and* feminine clothes make me feel like I'm dressing in drag."" 

That helped me solidify my agender label, though I lean more masc and feel happiest when I express as androgynous. 

Do you find that changing your gender expression helps you? Have you tried using a binder to affect your body shape? 

I'm actually pursuing transition as a NB person--hoping to get approved for a reduction rather than full mast, for example. Do you feel like transitioning in a minor way would be helpful for you too?
Not personally, but I've had some friends who've taken testosterone in order to defeminize their bodies and allow them to more easily express their gender on ""boy days.""
Of course I’m happy to share! First of all I’m sorry to hear your own transition or journey to that has been a tough one. For me, social transitioning has been with a name and pronouns mostly, as well as openly telling people (though not my family...) what I identify as. 

It sounds simple but it took me a Long time to get there because I never knew that I identified as such so I went through a lot of traumatic dysphoria. But in that I realised that I loved my body as it is. When I look at myself in the mirror I just see me not a gendered body. But that doesn’t mean I’m agender it just means I can really build my own canvas. I think in coming to that acceptance it made my journey a little easier (but I still have dysphoric days of course). I’m not sure if this has answered your question! Most of my friends are good with my name change but some don’t really follow it and continue using my birth name so I get a bit sad.
Here's some reading material: http://healthymultiplicity.com/

It does a much better job of explaining it than I ever could.
No need to be sorry! I realised my post wasn't clear and edited it. :)

Binders are too painful for me, but a reduction could be a possibility for me as well (at the very least it would be easier and less painful to bind than it is now).  I need to figure out if I'm okay with losing my curves and hourglass shape (a reduction will make my hips look disproportionate) - I need to think about it when I'm in a girl frame of mind.  I only ever daydream about surgeries when I'm having a boy day.

Best of luck with your transition! :)
Thanks!

I don't know yet if that's right for me, but good to know I'm not the only one experiencing ""boy days"" and that T can work for some people with fluctuating gender. :)
I'm happy to hear that you've reached a place of self-acceptance and just see you in the mirror!

You definitely answered my question.  So much of what I hear about social transition is black and white from FtM or MtF - NB social transition is more complicated.

I hope the friends who don't use your chosen name begin to soon. :)
Hmm. I’m sorry that you’ve got to struggle with this. That would be very difficult. I’m not sure it applies to me though as I’m always the same person just either male or female. I can see where there can be some similarities with not knowing how to transition.
No problem! It's definitely not something I'm familiar with, but you're for sure not alone!"	88zzww	NonBinary	28	0.9	2018-04-02 15:07:56
Microdosing T Questions	"Hi, figured I'd post this here for fellow afab enbies rather then the ftm subreddit hope that's ok... 

I've been back and forth about whether or not I want to take a low dose of T for a short period of time to get some specific results, mostly I am desperate to have a deeper voice. I feel neutral to positive about the other changes that would come with T (facial hair, bottom growth, fat redistribution), anything that could lead to me presenting as less overtly feminine is a huge win in my books.

For some reason I'm still really scared to take that leap though. The second I found out top surgery existed I knew with absolute certainty that I needed to get it. Now, 5 weeks post op I couldn't be happier with my chest. 

I think that maybe I'm scared about going too far in terms of the masculinizing effects. I know that I won't be on T forever though...

If anyone here has experience microdosing T, being on T short term, or being on T long term then stopping I'd love to hear what your experience with that was. What changes did you notice first? What changes lingered after you stopped taking T? How did you know when to stop? 

Thanks in advance x"	"""Microdosing"" is a misleading term. They can put you on low dose T though. I have been using a gel for 2 years.  My voice didn't drop until I had been on it for at least 8 months. And even now it's not male-passing.
 
Other side effects will happen before you get vocal changes. So be prepared to be sweaty, hungry, and horny. Not to mention the butt hair....
People rarely see much fat distribution on low-dose.

Happy for you for having top surgery 🙂. Mine is in a month.
Also, there is a youtuber ""Celeste"", who does a phenomenal job documenting their progress going on and off T.
If your main worry is facial hair coming in too fast, that will really depend on genetics.  I've been on T (sort of a medium dose) for over a year and I still have just a little bit of weird, patchy facial hair.  My voice has dropped, it's 50/50 whether people gender me as male or female, I have nice body hair and bottom growth, but not even a moustache.  But my dad had weird patchy facial hair his whole life, so that's just the genes I have!  Personally, I'm staying on T for the time being (better for my brain and bodily feelings tbh) so I can't advise on what stopping feels like.  But if you do T gel, it's easy to keep dosage low and adjust it if necessary.
My plan is to stop as soon as my facial hair comes in fully. Im already happy with my voice but dont mind if it goes deeper. 

Ive been on a standard dose of T for... idk 3? 4? Years now?

Im hoping to stop within the next few years. Will need to do smn then to deal with periods but ill cross that bridge when i come to it.

Im not sure whay you mean by ""too far"" though since you said youre okay with all the permanent effects?
Thanks!

I don't care if my voice isn't male passing I just want to get to a point where people don't hear it and immediately think woman. Getting he/him'd on the phone every once and a while would be great haha

If you don't mind me asking I'm curious, how long did it take before you started getting facial/body hair? 

Hope your top surgery goes well! It was, no exaggeration, the best thing I've done in my entire life :)
Edit. ""Celeste M"" if you need to find their channel
Hey, thanks for responding

I've got a hormonal IUD and it keeps me from getting a period, its an absolute god send. 

I'd enjoy some more body hair and bottom growth but the thought of getting facial hair that comes in thick is not appealing to me whatsoever. I know that I can shave it easy enough if that happens but having prominent facial hair that's more then a few patches I could easily clean up would cause me dysphoria. I think that's where most of my hesitation is coming from. 

How long did it take for your voice to get to a place where you were happy with it?
I want to say it was within the first 2 months. It will depend on your genetics for sure.
I kinda stopped tracking after 2 years but I think not long after that it was bearable (it started changing like 3 months in) I definitely think trying it at low dose would be a good idea n just monitor for facial hair so you can stop before it comes in too thick. Personally my voice started to drop before i had any facial hair. It varies per person tho ofc."	yq2olq	NonBinary	28	0.97	2022-11-08 23:53:59

I’m scared	"I came out to my “friends” as genderfluid awhile ago, now just going by Non Binary, as I feel labels are too restrictive. So, I want, like, really wanna wear dresses and clothes other than what’s usually seen as for dudes. I have yet to come out to my family, but that’s cause I’m terrified. There are no Nonbinary tv characters in tv or other medias we watch together, so they can’t comment on it. No news says anything, it’s non existent in the media. I have never heard them say anything and I just want to know how they feel for me to be safe. I know they accept lgb+ but then for t and other things that fit with that, I have rarely heard. I don’t dress conventionally, so I think that if I do end up wearing non masculine clothing, like dresses, they’ll either think I just wanna be a girl or I’m just making a fashion choice. I don’t want that, because I’m such a loser I can’t explain, I can’t talk to them. 

Another problem is my deadname. I guess calling it that is wrong, because of my problem. I have no idea what I want to call myself. I’ve had two ideas, but both sound unnatural and weird. I can’t come out to them like this. I can’t keep my birthname either, as it’s like stupidly masculine and burly sounding. 

If y’all couldn’t tell somehow from reading this, I am AMAB, constantly getting called he/him, even by those I’ve come out to. I was born with a decently neutral face, showing more tiredness than gender. Weak shoulders also help. On my bottom half is where the problems start to come about. Aside from the unmentionable, my hips are very non curvy and boring, along with constantly hairy legs, and very wide feet, although that is the least concerning. I have thought about getting hip extending padded stuff, but I feel it might be too risky, especially when everyone’s home. 

Quarantine sucks. Getting called he/him, saying I’m my parents son, and my siblings brother, it is a nightmare. I know I can’t stop it without telling them, so what do y’all think.

TL;DR: uhhh I’m a loser who is scared to come out, my name sucks, body was where I got closest to winning, and pronouns hurt."	"I know it’s hard, but please make sure you’re safe before you come out, especially during the quarantine. It’s extremely important to keep doing what you’re doing. I’m sorry I’m not much help, but there is a time after this, and you can get there. I recommend potentially talking about a friend you met online using they/them pronouns. See how they react to the hypothetical use of they/them, and that can get you some read. Still, unless they’re the ones assuring you, please consider the danger of an unsafe coming out during the quarantine.

Edit: you’re doing great <3
I'm in a similar situation, non-binary (fae/faer), came out to my friends, but not parents. I've started wearing dresses and make-up, but I think my parents think its more because of the musicians I like (David Bowie wore a lot of make up and dresses). I think the main problem may be parents simply not understanding, but I imagine over time they would come to understand, although it may be difficult to at first.  Perhaps try asking your parents what they think of non-binary, and explain what it means if they don't understand?
I think that you need to acknowledge the really negative self-talk you put into this post. I imagine that you have really negative self-talk IRL, too. Be gentle with yourself! We are all a work in progress. You're in a tough situation. Being called the wrong pronouns is, in my experience, crushing. And it's so much worse when it comes from people who should know better. You are strong! You are still trying to figure this stuff out, even with that crushing weight. You're doing it! So be gentle with yourself. Be kind. Because you deserve it.

Maybe you could make two characters online to try out the names you've picked? They will start sounding more natural when you hear them more frequently.
Shows with Nonbinary people in them: 

Netflix 

New Shera  (they show up s4 ) (it is a cartoon) 

The dragon prince  has one they’re more subtle so idk (cartoon) 

Another life - is a sci-fi show with a nonbinary person. Also has polyamory... 

Rooster teeth 

Genlock -val is a nonbinary that goes by the gender they present as at the time (also a cartoon, but David tennant and Michael b Jordan)! 


It’s kinda a bummer that there aren’t a lot of us in media, but alas... 
pretty sure there are more but these are ones that meant something to me... 

If you like dnd podcasts 
Dames and dragons has 2 nonbinary players and 1 in character Enby.
I probably will try doing it once the quarantine is over, but I don’t know when this will be. I could try talking to them about it, but I’m afraid that if they don’t know or even if they might, it could out me l. Thanks.
Thanks, I probably will try that. I call people and myself loser and nerd a lot, so sometimes I forget that it actually has meaning. Thanks again."	g8u05j	NonBinary	29	0.98	2020-04-27 04:56:14
Getting Sir'd at a hick town diner + my meal was paid for!	"Went to one of the local diners this morning after work to kill time till my bank opened. It was fairly quiet and I sat by myself, far from anyone else, at the bar. 
A rather loud gentleman, a regular I'm guessing, came in shortly after I did and sat at the end. He wasn't rude, just loud and comfortable.
Little did I know, he thought I was amab and was impressed by my mature and professional dress (I work front desk nights at a hotel) so he paid for my meal out of thanks and respect. The waitress tipped me off to his kindness and I stopped to thank him in the parking lot. 
He explained himself and sir'd me before I removed my mask to put on my motorcycle helmet and then he realized his 'mistake'. He quickly apologized and asked if he had misgendered me, saying ""you never know these days"". I told him I preferred male pronouns and he quickly ended the conversation and left.
All in all an interesting and good experience. Plus it was great to be sir'd again! I hope one day that man will come to be comfortable with such conversations and be more gentle with him verbage but until then I'll take this as a win."

I didn't even need to ask him to respect my pronouns	"So for those of you who know/are doing the UCAS application (basically UK universities application), you know that you need a reference from a teacher and stuff.

Today I tentatively asked him what pronouns my referee used, expecting that I would have to kindly argue that he shoulduse my preferred pronouns. But that wasn't necessary. He's already using they/them for me :)

This is honestly great, especially considering that my school is an ""all-girls school"" (it's not, it's an all AFAB school) and it's also Catholic, so administration makes all effort to refer to the student body as girls/daughters/she/her etc.

Little wins at work	"Hey, folks. Just wanted to share this little bit. I got a new job in September. It's remote work, but I'm ""out"" via me email signature, which is more than I can say for my previous in-person job (though I did change my pronouns in a bio for a national  advisory board I'm on, so it's there if anyone googles me). Anyway! We're individually contacting donors today. When I got the script I messaged the coordinator to let her know the script included ""Mr/Ms"" in the salutation, and I wouldn't be including that bit since I didn't want to assume based on name alone. Her response was awesome, and she changed the script for everyone. I was kind of nervous contacting her since that is *not* the way it would have gone down at my old job (I know from experience), so I'm super pleased with this outcome."	"Thanks.  I want to advocate at my workplace.  Need help on strategy. 

I am bi-gender/androgynous/demi-woman.

Any suggestions?
This is awesome! Mr / Mrs / Ms as the default “respectful” honorifics are not respectful for everyone! Glad that it worked out for you!
Is there something in particular you're looking to improve, or just in general?
We presently have the ability to identify clients in terms of many genders, or non-gender.

What I want is for staff members/prospective staff members, to be free to identify, also.

For example, I have considered beginning my effort by adding a ""pronoun designation"" to my e-mail signature.  

Other staff members have done so.  That helps.

As a bigender person,  I face a challenge.  I am concerned that being authentic will be perceived as a ""joke"".  Or, even worse, as an attempt to subvert the validity of non-binary genders.

I identify as a bigender, androgynous woman/demi-woman.

I want to include the pronoun designation ""she/he; her/him"".
I am far from an expert in this area, but as far as email signature goes, absolutely include whichever pronouns fit you best. It might make your life easier to have a link to a resource or even a short blurb you can send if anyone asks what your pronouns ""mean"" (not that it's your responsibility to educate someone). 

I'm not sure what you mean by identifying clients/staff by gender. Can you elaborate a little more on that?
There is now an option to select on a drop box that indicates gender ""outside the binary"".
If it's a digital form you're probably going to want to talk to HR and/or IT to initiate changing it. Just say you've noticed it's an option for clients and not staff, and it should be an option for anyone."	rkry9b	NonBinary	23	0.97	2021-12-20 17:06:35

Binary uniforms	"Been lurking here for a while working on my confidence as I am very new, but I wanted to post a small win I had this week. I work for a department in health and we have always had very binary uniforms. In the past I have asked my supervisor about getting access to the male uniforms as I have never felt comfortable in the female ones but was turned back saying they are not suited for women. The last couple weeks I had some deep conversations with a manager at another site who was so very supportive, while she’s is a very femme lesbian she is a fierce ally  to all forms of gender expression and she asked if I would be comfortable if she looked into it on my behalf. 

She spoke to someone who looks after the uniform allocation and they were actually very open to working something out. She had a lot of questions about expression outside the binary as she didn’t know anything about it but was very supportive and concerned that this is something they don’t have a plan for. They worked out between them a uniform in the men’s cut but the women’s pattern (like stripes vs checkered) so there would be less chance that I am targeted at work for the difference until they work on more inclusivity with the uniforms as a whole.

It’s a very small step as I am the first to ask about this but for me it felt really big. Thanks for reading :)"	"That's a great step! Good for you and I'm so happy you have allies at work. Hopefully there are more options in the future and more people can be comfortable in their uniforms! It benefits the company too, because if workers are happier and more comfortable, they will do better quality work.
You made history! It might not make it in the books; But, someone will someday say to themself, ""so glad there are options that are comfortable!"" and it'll be because of YOU! You'll be the reason someone feels comfortable in their own skin! You rock!!

But in the last week, what I consider a holy grail moments started. Theres no...polite way to say it, but advertising algorithms think I am a lesbian now. Slightly feminine, leaning masculine.... Like from a faceless data aggregation standpoint it makes sense in a stereotypical way, but butch leaning lesbians would be a solid default guess.  


And this makes me happy. Like...I have no interest in physically changing. I wanted to emotionally open up and be me, and being non-binary was a step in the right direction I felt. Suddenly getting lesbian dating app ad's, social media group suggestions, and pride stuff...validates me in such a weird way. I opened up and was myself, and in turn this had lead to not being an easy to nail data point.  


Is this...not actually a good thing though. Since its only just started to happen, I dont honestly know if there are even non-binary specific ads. Honestly don't think there is enough actual traction for that to be a targeted group in general, but maybe i am wrong."	"I'm AMAB and I've been getting transmasc ads for a while. Achievement unlocked.
99% sure that my targeted ads thought I was lgbt for years before I realised I’m non-binary lmao
The ads I see when I watch Hulu have started to trend more feminine and I’m not mad about it
I (afab) started getting mens underwear ads so I think I've properly confused the algorithm. Way better than the lacy bra ads I was getting before
I recently got an ad in which the opening line was something like ""I recently found out I was gay and was thinking about getting a therapist""   
the ads know
I'm still getting Dr. Squatch ads....
Afab trans masc getting ads about peyronie's disease, men's underwear and low testosterone LOL
Oh I know that moment.  I started getting fertility clinic donation ads aimed at cis guys which was maybe just a step too far lol.
<3
Lol, see thats sucha broad stroke...but great
Lol, oh good. Not just me!
<3 Mens is more comfy, womens is more showy...but potato me is a nope in em
Lol
That's the beard care thing? I got like one last year and then it was all car ads lol
Love it!
oh dear lol
It's bar soap, being advertised in a very masculine way.

I'm tired of the way things are	I want that typical summer romance, meeting new people making new friends and new memories to last forever, falling in love, living my very best life, it's too short to settle for anything less than the best quality of life I can get. I have a dream, and that dream involves this being my year, I'm going to win this one and I'm going to take 2020 by storm, keep an eye out, because come the end of the year I'll be in the winners circle with MVP written across my forehead.	"I feel that too much.
Like, I really want to hold someones hands and kiss their lips and be happy not because of them but rather with them.

Is that too much to ask for?
Ugh I felt that. Instead I'm here with a crush on someone I have no chance with and he's ignoring me because he knows I have feelings lol
It isn't, you just need to have the resolve, the drive to do whatever it takes to be happy, attitude is everything, and you have to have the attitude of a winner. (Also I feel that big time, I'd love to just go places and be stupid with someone special)
As much as it sucks you can't afford to waste your time on him, if he's not interested in you then that's his loss, can't waste time on people who aren't worth it
Yeah, I am trying my best to move on. I thought I had to accept that I'd never see him again but then our mutual friend told me that he still wants to be friends with me in the future, he just wanted to make sure I was over him and okay first. I know we wouldn't work romantically because we tried I just miss him as a friend, I don't know if he will ever contact me again"	faay3o	NonBinary	18	0.93	2020-02-27 11:49:47
Blackheart Burlesque	"My wife and I attended the Blackheart Burlesque last night, hosted by the Suicide Girls. It was a sexy, funny, creative good time overall, but there was also a very uplifting moment.

Near the end of the show, the host invited any and all women in the audience to the stage, for a sexy dance-off competition. 

The only rule? There are no rules.

Probably twenty or so attractive women made their way to the stage. In that group was someone clearly going for an androgynous look. I dare say they were non binary. No hips, masculine clothes and haircut.  Very skinny. Androgynous large glasses. Flat chest. The only vague hint about their identified gender was the fact that they were on stage, specifically at the invitation for women only. 

The dancing lasted for a couple minutes. Everyone had a gimmick to try and win the dance competition. A couple girls started making out. Many others stripped down to their panties with huge exaggerated movements - it was that kind of show.

Not this non binary person, though; she/they just swayed slowly, kind of shyly. They undid the clasp and zipper of their pants, and lowered them slightly, revealing completely masculine boxer-briefs. They lowered the underwear just low enough to *not* reveal any hints about their genitals.

I still couldn't tell you what their 'assigned' gender was. Not that it mattered. 

In the end, the winner was selected by audience reactions and applause. I'll cut to the chase; the audience *loved* our non binary friend. They won in a landslide. 

That felt really uplifting. That a huge, mixed crowd full of people - who all came to see a bunch of strip teases from beautiful women with bouncing breasts - recognized the modern beauty of this androgynous audience member, really made my night. 

"	That's awesome.  Need moments like that.	8dmmsr	NonBinary	19	0.96	2018-04-20 10:44:30
Non-binary win today	"Had a big moment today and thought this might be a nice place to share. I was at target with my family, and we stumbled upon a pride themed display with lgbtqia+ flag candles, socks etc. I’m fresh out of the closet with my family, in a place where they know I’m non-binary but don’t know what that means and don’t use my pronouns 90% of the time. Conversations usually end in arguments and invalidation. They started asking me what the different flags mean, and asked me to explain the difference between non-binary and genderqueer. I did my best to explain, being completely open and honest while using myself and my experience as reference, and they actually listened. At the end, my mom grabbed the nb flag socks from the display, looked me in the eyes and said “is this one for you?” I nodded, and she threw them in the cart as a gift. This was the first time I have ever been able to talk about my gender openly and for my mom to actually listen. I almost cried tears of joy in the middle of the damn target. 
On one hand I am anti-rainbow-capitalism, and despise how central consumerism is in our culture and understanding of identity. Then again these these little trinkets caught my uneducated cis het elder relative’s eyes and provided a conversation starter and a tangible representation and validation that people have different genders, and that it’s okay. Just felt like a big step in a positive direction :) Ty for allowing me the space to share

tl;dr almost cried in target because my mom bought me nb flag socks"	"This is why representation matters so much.
Yay!!!! Awesome story!!!! Congrats OP, it is a huge win to feel seen and heard by your loved ones and family, especially when they are cis and actually want to learn and understand your identity and what it means to you. Happy pride month 💘💘💘
This made me so happy to read!

! had a similar experience with my aunt/godmother. I live abroad and we talk quite infrequently, and when we spoke on the phone around Christmas time, she misgendered me quite a lot and I was too nervous to correct her. I told myself that some people weren't going to get it and wouldn't put in the effort, and I had to come to terms with that.

But a few months later, I got a package from her, and she'd knitted me a scarf in the nonbinary colours.
Exactly! 💜
Thank you! Happy pride month to you as well!💜💜💜"	vbxf3p	NonBinary	19	1.0	2022-06-14 06:51:47
A Small Win	"I mustered up the courage to order a pair of ladies jeans the other day, and I'd been hesitant on wearing them outside my home since I was extremely nervous about how I'd look (amab, look really masc, not really in a safe space to change my appearance), but for some reason I wanted to go to a nearby fast food place to get lunch and I decided to wear them, but with a baggy t-shirt since I was still nervous. XD

Either nobody noticed or cared since....nothing happened, I got my food and left, but I felt happy since this is the first time I've worn anything feminine outside the confines of my house, which felt nice, so I figured it was a small victory I'd share."	"Congratulations!

I wanted to add if you ever need a confidence boost my cis boyfriend loves to wear womens jeans and I’ve never seen someone bat an eye. So if you’re ever feeling doubtful remember it’s likely no one will notice or care enough to be mean and you should be happy and wear what you want!
Super proud of you! It's all one step at a time and victories like this are awesome 💜
Congratulations 🎉 I love women’s pants, they actually come up to my waist, and aren’t super tight on my thighs.
It took me several attempts at going out in partial femme before I was comfortable with the idea that no one really cares, and even if they do, they won’t say anything to you. Obviously, that depends on the location, but it’s more common than most of us think it will be until we experience it.

The harder one is spending time with family and/or friends who you’re not sure where they stand. I still panic a bit when I’m going to be queering my look with family or friends.
So proud of you!! I'm taking small steps outside of my home too and it does feel amazing. I hope you keep riding this wave and feel more comfortable with yourself - we got this!! 💜
Yeah, most likely. It's one of those mental ""I feel like everyone is looking at me"" type feelings, I think! In reality most people are probably doing their own thing, probably.
Thank you! It felt good to express myself publicly for once, and I love wearing them, haha. Gonna try to build up more confidence to maybe wear them out more often, maybe go to a store or something eventually, see how it goes
Fake pockets though.
Thanks, and I'm happy they work for you! Comparatively for me, they're more...'shapely', I suppose would be the wording. Mens pants fit me more like kind of a 'box' if that makes any sense, they're much looser than these are; I might not have found the correct sizing yet either though- I've heard womens pants in general are less 'standardized' so it can take a bit of hunting to find well fitting items.
Yeah it’s really hit or miss.
Yeah I realized that when my cellphone barely fit in one, they're less 'pockets' and more like 'tiny pouch' if at that."	tx0g55	NonBinary	18	1.0	2022-04-05 17:37:43

Found a cute skirt. (This is a tale and a half...)	"So, earlier this week, I started, and finished, season 8 of MTV's Are you the one?
(The shows premise in x number of contestants have 10 weeks to figure out who their perfect match in the house is, as determined by 'experts', in order to find love, and win a share of $1 million.)
This season was a little different, as all contestants were queer/pan/bi, so any of the 15 other contestants could be their match. 
(This is a spectacular premise, and go watch the heck out of it. Its a great season, with awesome people, who I now stan. Highly recommend)

On this show, was a handful of people who are gender fluid/ nb/ trans/ gender queer/ non-conforming.
One of these I saw myself in, A tall, bumbling, cute, amab nerd. He was talking to nother trans/nb contestant, who complemented him on his ability and confortability to look masc, but wear 'femme' clothing. Bumbling nerd said that doung that just felt nice, and made him feel cute, and attractive, and sexy. 
This was something I always felt too, but hid it, as I thought it would be seen as more a fetish,like crossdressing, or like a terrible attempt at drag.
But hearing someone I grew to admire being confident in saying this meant a lot.
Flash forward to yesterday, and I stumble across a super cute long skirt, that was my size at an op shop/ thrift store. So I went to buy it. 
I thought it was gonna be $5. Turns out, yellow tags were on sale, so it was only $2. Yes!!!!!! Score!!!! Win!!!! 
There is maybe a party coming up (not sure if it actually gonna happen or not), and I am really excited to wear it to that."	"Congrats and I hope you have a lot of fun with it!

I´m afab so I didn´t have the same problems, but I strongly resonate with the feeling of wearing skirts you described. I stopped wearing mine for quite a while because I thought I´m not 'legimate' enough or that others wouldn´t take my identity serious if I did. Finding the confidence to wear them out again was a great experience, and really wish you the same!

Also the show you described sounds great, even if its not my usual genre. Positive Media representation is so powerful and so important."	d79vws	NonBinary	19	0.96	2019-09-21 12:30:12
Transitioning is difficult 🥲	I started testosterone about two and a half months ago and my t was way too high so I had literal roid rage and my body is changing FAST. We’re lowering my levels so hopefully that helps. I have a beard coming in and thickening up by the day. I look at my face and I look too masculine and look at my body and it’s too feminine and curvy. Will I ever win? I’m so fucking tired of this. I was excited at first and now it’s just a lot and I had a panic attack going out into public since I live in the Bible Belt I’m so scared of being hate crimed. I don’t know what to do. I’m jobless and too scared to get a job with how early my transition is and I just feel so dysphoric lately about everything. I don’t look masculine enough I don’t look feminine enough. Fuck. Why can’t I just be happy with how I look. Why do I have to be scared that how I want to look will put me in danger. I feel so cornered.	"hey there, I hear you. it is so so hard but it sounds like you have taken some big steps to affirm your identity and that is epic. I'm in the midst of a crisis feeling like I can't talk to anyone about my preferred pronouns and gender identity and I want you to know you're not alone! You're doing great and just want to send love and support your way hope this helps ❤️
Hormonal changes can cause some pretty wild emotional changes! It’ll settle down and you’ll get a handle on it all. You reached out here which is a good step taking care of yourself. You got this! Something that helped me get used to presenting differently in public was to go somewhere and sit down and watch for a bit and realize that literally no one was looking at me. Everyone was just going about their day, thinking about their own stuff and the spotlight I felt was imaginary. As for dysphoria it just plain sucks and all I have to offer is a virtual hug. Good luck!
Sorry about your living situation. Stay safe.

HRT is a fickle bitch sometimes. It’s a long journey but patience usually pays off. I hope the new dose helps. Good luck and best wishes."	127xdin	NonBinary	17	0.91	2023-03-31 20:02:57
Enby nails	When you're AFAB and your mother buys you a 48 pack of nail polish for Christmas (not out) so you decide to do this at 10pm. Didn't know what to do on my thumbs so tried out the gold and it looks good. Also doesn't make me feel dysphoric so that's a win.	"Hell yeah i do this every once in a while, i decided to mix some to get around the four colors-ten fingers problem, i draw some nails half and half, made some dots in white on a black nail and such, made the hands assymetric. Its so fun
I have pride flag colors on my nails too ❤️

You might get more even color if you applied multiple thin coats of polish instead of one thicker coat.
great color choices! when you get a chance, get your hands on a little make up brush, a q tip, or even a paint brush and some nail polish remover. you can brush off those pesky edges.
I would do that but I'm lazy so the gold is staying

Personal win (they/them)	In the last few weeks I(afab) got mistaken for a boy twice and got the question whether I'm girl or a boy once. It's not much, but it's a start and I have the feeling that my efforts are paying off (at least a little)	"This is something I've been puzzled about for awhile. I've been gendered as the opposite of my GAAB quite often online (sadly, never IRL.) Somehow, it feels like a win but at the same time it still feels like being misgendered. Being asked if you're a boy or a girl sounds damn awesome, though!
I was hanging out with a friends family and I had a three or four year old girl once ask me, “Do you have a bagina?” “No, sweetie, I do not.” We all had a good laugh out of it. 

AMAB, NB
Yeah, it's like being misgendered, but I'd rather be called a boy than a girl.
I get that! It's the same for me, I would rather be called the opposite of my gaab in the binary system (if I had to choose) :3"	r1tjpt	NonBinary	16	0.95	2021-11-25 10:18:54

is this a win?	"my dad is enbyphobic as fuck, and misgenders me all the time. my therapist leaked to my parents that i now no longer ascribe to pronouns and my dad claims to be thrilled about it. 
apparently hates pronouns. 
i will be calling my dad on every pronoun from here on out."	"I don't think people really consider what it is exactly that they are saying when they say ""I hate pronouns""

Like bruh that very sentence has a pronoun in it. It's like a jedi saying ""only a sith speaks in absolutes"" all over again - it's hypocritical and is literally using the thing you say you hate/don't use
What do you mean by ""no longer ascribe to pronouns""? I'm confused.
My dad is the same way. On the day I considered coming out he went on a rant about how transgenders were sick and people getting offended so easily was ruining society. Safe to say that I’m not doing that anymore.
reference was to 3rd person pronouns. this would include it/its apparently
I don't know in that particular situation of OP, but I imagine when I read that the person only wants to be called by their name 

Instead of He is, She is, They are, and etc etc etc

I came out as non-binary to my partner yesterday	I’ve (enby AMAB) came out to my partner (M) after going through a lot of internal gender exploration on my own.

After I told him, he was incredibly accepting and it was such an amazing moment we shared. I haven’t told many other people, but wanted to share this small win.

Probably agender, maybe transfem. Confused.	"This is going to be a bit of a rant, sorry.

I call myself a non-binary trans girl, for convenience's sake and a way of saying “not binary, not a guy”. But I don't know if that label really fits me. What’s actually happening is that I’m in flux between ""girl"" and ""none pizza"", with a lack of gender winning out most of the time. I'm considering laser (I hate having facial hair) and other ways to look more androgynous, but I can probably never “transition” in the sense of hormones or surgery. Mentally, I'm squicked by the idea of growing breasts; it doesn’t seem to fit my internal body map. And then, this gets stirred together with a general dislike of having my body sexualized and looked at in an objectifying way. I feel like I'm dealing with some DFAB trans issues in a DMAB body, and it confuses the hell out of me. I know agender DMAB folks are out there, and I know the term demigirl exists for those of us who still feel a connection to the “girl” category, but I still feel like a fake in most trans and even non-binary spaces.

Part of me worries that I’m appropriating an experience that isn’t mine, and that I just want the social benefits of being a girl without any of the social or physical drawbacks. I feel like female-read people are more trusted by others, less likely to come off as creepy when they joke or flirt, have more freedom to act in ways atypical of their gender, and have closer and more intimate friendships. I’m also horribly touch-starved, which feeds into this.

But then I look at transfeminine spaces, and a lot of the things they list as positives — yay boobs! yay skirts! — don’t read as positive at all to me. I feel stuck because I can’t perform gender in a way that both feels good to me and is understood by others. Masculinity is the default for gender, the standard, and femininity is difference and deviation. So anything society views as less gendered is automatically read as male. Fr’ex, I like wearing my hair short, but in other people’s eyes, that doesn’t signify anything other than male. At best, I’m read as a twink, never a tomboy.

FWIW, I’m in my mid-thirties, very slightly built, and have been very thin all my life regardless of what or how much I eat. I look about half my physical age, which I kind of like, but I don’t like talking about it or revealing my real age to people who don’t know me well.

I'm slightly romantically and sexually interested in women, but I don't really consider myself a lesbian, or straight for that matter. Just a person who might maybe have a partner someday, but honestly isn't in a rush to start anything.

So... demi-ace, demigirl, and agenderflux? I don't know. Without a good way to realize them, all those labels weigh on me. I guess I'm looking for some advice from people who've been through similar kinds of confusion."	"Not knowing what your gender id is or if you're faking, when it causes you distress and confusion, is totally NB culture.

I'm coming from some very different specifics, other than being amab, but have a lot of the same issues, feelings and conflicts. The ""gender neutral"" aesthetics that I love on other people just read as male on me, which makes me feel extremely dysphoric, but I'm not drawn much to traditionally feminine presentations. I also have no desire for breasts, though being ample in figure I've already got em.

No advice, dysphoria is wrecking my brain this weekend, but your feelings aren't weird or unusual and you're valid as fuck.
hi! i made this account because i read this while searching for stories and threads here that felt like they matched my own feelings, and a lot of what you wrote really feels true to me too. I'm AMAB, 30, and have been seriously questioning for very recently after having weirdness and umcomfortableness for a while. I've recently kind of captured in my head the idea that I'm non-binary, and tho it doesn't always feel real I'm a bit more comfortable with that label now.  


Like you, I'm  am also caught between thinking I might be agender, but also having some connection to femininity or girlness. I've wondered about the demigirl label too, and like you I am VERY worried about appropriating experiences that aren't mine (growing up and living as a man/passing as a man my whole life) but the fact that we're worrying so much about that is PROOF that we're not having these feelings and exploring our gender ""in bad faith"". It's real and you are free to explore how you express your gender all you want — including deciding that you're a non-binary woman, or someone with a connection to femininity (transfeminine??) but also recognizes that you inhabit a male-coded body (for now!) .

I also don't think I like skirts and boobs (tho i haven't explored much with skirts) and I'm wondering if I would ever go on HRT, or if I feel fine enough about my current body to socially transition without any medical or physical changes... all hard questions!

i think we gotta just keep exploring - and something im telling myself a lot is that **it's OK to feel non-binary right now, and then realize you actually are some other identity in the future - regardless of your feelings about physical transition.**   


Hope this helps, writing this out to respond to you definitely helps me think about this stuff >\_>"	92p80w	NonBinary	15	1.0	2018-07-28 20:34:37
I love being non-binary!!!	"Feeling pretty good about my gender finally!!!

For most of this year I had considered myself ftm but I'm finally accepting myself as nonbinary (or gnc)!

I had come out to my parents much earlier than I had liked (trying to get a binder lol), but after my parents agreeing to buy me the boys uniform, I'm feeling really comfortable in my gender identity! I remember being really set on my gender and feeling very male (?) early in the year. It feels a little upsetting that my parents were somewhat right in that I did detransition to an extent? but idrc lol. It's really strange, I showed no signs of being trans at all as a kid but I was still really determined. I'm just happy that I'm able to finally express myself uniquely!!

Lately I've been feeling very indifferent almost about other people's perception of my own gender identity, and it makes me happy hearing people refer to me as not one or the other and being a mix of both. I love being a grey area gender-wise. It makes me so happy!! One of the main reasons I started questioning and exploring my gender identity was gnc characters and I love that I'm finally able to be like them and express myself similarly.

Just a bit of a personal win I wanted to share!"	"We are kinda programmed to fit ourselves into a box. I guess as you didn't quite feel female you must have though ""ooh I must be male then"". I'm still struggling with this, not sure if I'm GNC or just trans or something in between. Glad you found yourself! <3"	ykwn5e	NonBinary	16	1.0	2022-11-03 08:54:03

Struggling with letting go of old toxic ideas (and wanting to medically transition which isn’t possible right now).	"Okay so I’m non-binary/genderqueer (I’m comfortable with both). I’ve known since I was 13, and I’m pretty secure in the knowledge that I’m not cis. There was a while when I had just figured myself out that I got sucked down the Kalvin Garrah rabbit hole (he was the first trans YouTuber that I found and my first introduction to the whole truscum/tucute communities which I try to avoid now) and it ended up with me feeling like I had to look vaguely masculine to be non-binary (and also with so much internalized transphobia). I was in a really bad place mentally and I think I clung onto that ideology to hide behind my own self hate and unbearable dysphoria. Even on the days that I felt less dysphoric I would end up sabotaging that because I felt as though I had to be very dysphoric all the time 24/7 to be a “real trans person”. Luckily I never joined the hordes of Kalvin stans who go out and bully people who they deem to be “trenders” (oh how I hate that word) because even at my lowest I knew that it was an awful thing to do.

I eventually got out of it once I started therapy and became more well adjusted and happy with myself as a person. I started to feel sick at the way Kalvin would talk about people, and the utter hate and anger I could see rolling off him in waves. I recognized how even if I agreed with a lot of his opinions, the way he went about things and the things that he did were unforgivable. Eventually after doing a lot more research and meeting other trans people and seeing how they lived and the vast complexity’s of their genders/lack there of, I stopped agreeing with a vast vast majority of his opinions as well and the few that I still do, I think the way he goes about them is disgusting. In seeing trans joy, I was set free from the cage I had put myself in, where I believed that I would never achieve happiness as a trans person.

Which brings me to now. I’ve been exploring my gender (well, lack of gender I guess) which is something that I would never let myself do before because I thought that I didn’t deserve joy (as a trans person, and just in general) and because I was worried that I would find something that would go outside of the right set of rules that I had set myself to be a “real trans person”. I’ve realized that while they/them makes me feel euthoric and it just feels right, I’m actually okay with he/him as well (although I’d still much prefer they/them) because it doesn’t make me dysphoric, and that sometimes I much prefer male terminology to gender neutral terminology because it’s less of a mouthful sometimes and it can flow better. I’ve also found that I actually really like feminine and masculine clothes, and that if it didn’t make me so dysphoric to be seen as a girl I would love to wear dresses (unfortunately they bring attention to some parts of me that make me really dysphoric, but they’re hella cute) and I would like a beard eventually. 

The thing is, that even though I’ve let go of all those toxic ideas, and judgements that I had before, and I’m completely fine with other people doing and feeling the things that I do, I still struggle with it when it comes to myself. I know that wanting to wear feminine things as an afab non-binary person doesn’t make me less non-binary but there’s still a part of my brain that goes “But that must make you a cis girl” (Just want to emphasize that I don’t actually believe this in general, this is just an illogical feeling from clinging onto toxic ideals for so long. If you’re an afab enby who is feminine then that’s hella valid). I know that having both top and bottom dysphoria and wanting a more masculine body (and wanting to go on T) as a non-binary person doesn’t make me a trans guy but there’s still a part of my brain that goes “But why would you want to look like a man if you’re non-binary?” (Again, I don’t believe this logically, and my brain doesn’t apply it to anyone else, just me. If you want a masculine body as a non-binary person then that’s hella valid as well). I could talk this all over with my therapist but I’m not sure that she would actually get it, because she’s cis and doesn’t really know the ins and outs of trans politics.

I’ve also been struggling because I want to start wearing more feminine stuff and more masculine things but because I still look very fem and don’t “pass” whatsoever, it makes me too dysphoric. I really want to go on T and get top surgery, but I still live with my mom and I’m not out to her plus I’m still slightly too young (I’m old enough to go on T, but the process will take ages in my country and I’m scared of my family finding out). Also I don’t have enough money. The only win I’ve had lately is that I managed to get an undercut (I’m not allowed to cut my hair short) and I’ve secretly ordered a packer. I’ve been watching videos of people getting top surgery and crying because I’m happy for them but I really really want that. 

I don’t really know what this is. Maybe I’m hoping to find that I’m not alone in feelings like this. Maybe I just needed to get all of this out in words so that I can stop keeping it inside of me. Sorry if this is confusing or I’ve made any spelling mistakes. English is my first language but I’m typing this on an iPad with autocorrect and tiny lil hands."	" Are you literally me?

 I'm an agender person who transitioned on T and who wants top surgery. I use masculine pronouns and words because they're convenient (and I look male). I don't consider myself male, but I want a masculine appearance, and I definitely don't consider myself female, but I wear feminine clothing. I also fell down a rabbit hole of enbyphobia/extreme transmedicalist beliefs when I was younger (I'm 20 now). 

 And I am an entirely valid nonbinary person. You are too. 

 I understand how hard it is to apply those beliefs to yourself when you've spent so long thinking that you're not valid, that you must be one or the other and can't just be neither- but I'm here as someone who went through basically the exact same thing to tell you that you can. You can do whatever you want with your presentation: cis men who like pastels or doing drag aren't magically women when they do those things. And in my opinion, wanting a more classically 'masculine' appearance doesn't dictate gender any more (consider cis butches). Ultimately, whatever you want to do to feel comfortable in your own skin is just that. It doesn't say anything about you beyond 'this is what makes me happy, and this is how I want to look'. 

 Good luck OP. And congrats on your haircut! Undercuts feel great c:
A lot of us struggle with internalized transphobia. It's tough but it's something you're strong enough to overcome. If you're able, could you look into gender therapy? If transition isn't an easy option right now, focusing on overcoming these phobias and loving yourself could really help, and make the process all the more rewarding and affirming when it happens.
Thanks you :) I’m loving it so far. It actually really helps to know that I’m not alone and that other people have had similar experiences and unlearned those things. I hope that you have a great day!
 It's always very nice to learn that you're not alone in these things. I hope that you have a good day too c:"	jqc2q5	NonBinary	13	0.94	2020-11-08 13:54:09
A step forward!	I got new glasses recently, and I chose frames from the men’s section! It’s made me feel super valid and euphoric no matter how I feel like presenting. It really feels like a win and a step in the right direction	"Good for you! Keep celebrating your small victories!

Struggling with social dysphoria. Unsure if I should transition?	"I’m an AFAB non-binary person who experiences a great deal of social dysphoria. I hate being seen as female & hate being treated as female. And ever since I started dating my partner (who is a cis bi man), I feel even more dysphoria because now I’m viewed as a cis heterosexual woman which makes me gag even more. My identity and desire has always felt queer so this is like double erasure.

Some of the things I’ve done over the years to alleviate this discomfort is to change my name, use they/them pronouns, cut my hair & experiment with more androgynous/masculine clothing styles. While this has definitely helped, the problem I’m now facing is feeling like I can no longer explore the feminine side of me because of this senseless thought that being “feminine” means I’m no longer “convincingly” non-binary. I KNOW that there is no one way to look non-binary and you don’t have to appear androgynous to be valid. But it’s still something that I struggle with a great deal. Mostly because whenever I dress more masculine, a part of me just feels like I’m tomboy cis woman (and ppl treat me that way) and then I start to feel dysphoric again. Simultaneously, I also feel dysphoric when I dress feminine and wear makeup because society definitely does not see me as non-binary unless I tell them (even then I feel like they just perceive me as girl-lite ugh).

Does anyone relate to this? I’ve been tossing around the idea of going on T because I don’t know how much I can take this discomfort anymore. Part of me would rather I just look more like a male because then at least I could wear makeup/dresses without feeling like I’m being perceived as a tomboy-ish woman. Idk. Sometimes it feels like you can never truly win either way :("	"HRT is a big decision, so definitely do your research. Make sure you're okay with all the possible changes. I am hesitant to recommend it to someone who only stated social dysphoria, and less physical, because I wouldn't want it to have worse effects on you, but it could totally help! Just need to think on it. 

But I can say I am a year on hormones and I feel fantastic. While I  don't dress overly feminine very often, I can wear a skirt and not feel like a girl anymore. I wear a lot of rompers and body suits that I feel I pull off in a very androgynous way and for me that is fantastic. 

I knew before starting hormones that I wanted/needed the physical transition. I also knew that if someone was going to gender me in public, I would prefer male over female. I will mention that that T doesn't make you pass as male overnight, or even in years. It is a hefty combination of age and fashion and body type and so much more than just what hormones can give you, but that worked well for me because I am not a male and don't want to be male. 

We both know you're a valid nonbinary person, and nonbinary people can dress and do whatever they want, but I completely understand the dysphoria you're experiencing too. Medically transitioning did help me feel better in areas like this. I felt like certain people respected my gender identity more, as much as it sucks to admit, once I was transitioning medically.
Yes, I (nb AFAB) understand. My partner is ftm and ever since he transitioned people see us as a straight cis couple and it's the worst. It's like a part of my own identity has been taken from me, I miss my queer visibility. We now have to try so much harder to convince people that we're queer, it's ridiculous, we've even been kicked out of a queer pride safe space because people thought we were just allies.. 

I hope you find a way to deal with heteronormativity, it sure sucks.
Thank you so much for your response! That’s awesome that you’ve had such an affirming experience on hormones. Regardless of what I decide to do, I definitely want to take some time to think about it & hopefully see a gender therapist before making any rash decisions.

I do experience physical dysphoria, mostly in terms of my voice and some feminine aspects of my body. So I would also want to take T to become slightly more physically masculine. I know you can’t pick and choose how T affects you, but I do love the idea of having a more classically masculine body that can then be offset by more traditionally feminine attire. At the end of the day, if I had to choose, I would rather be called a guy than a girl, even though that’s not right either. Much for me to think about!
Best of luck! I also started by seeing a gender therapist and it helped me loads"	iblex5	NonBinary	14	1.0	2020-08-17 19:49:05

Small wins over dysphoria	"AMAB, finally pulled the trigger and got a meundies bralette and bikini cut panties. They feel great and fit great.  The panties are a bit risky to wear as they kinda emphasize things but hold everything nicely. 

The bralette is super comfortable i wore it to an NB friends birthday party on Saturday (themed 50shades of they). On Sunday not wearing it I felt... naked and exposed like something was missing.

Transgender Self-Harm Survey (Win $100 Amazon Gift Card!)	"Hello,

My name is K.D., and I am a student at Towson University. My thesis is working to examine non-suicidal self-injury in the transgender population. This is a topic that I am extremely close to, as I myself identify as genderqueer and trans-masculine.
In order to write my thesis, I need participants to take my survey. If you identify as transgender, transsexual, gender non-conforming, agender, non-binary and/or have a transgender history and have self-harmed within the last 5 years without suicidal intent, please consider taking my survey! All participants will be eligible to win 1 of 5 $100 Amazon gift cards.

Survey: https://surveyhero.com/c/2533931

Thank you for your time!"	"[deleted]
Sorry, the survey doesn't accept my answers.

(""Of the following categories provided, with which do you most identify? *"" how about none? and I know I'm not the only person who feels this way.)
Things were going quite well until I reached the ""which of these do you most identify with"" question. I am a trans man, and I didn't feel like any of those choices fit well as I don't identify with the term trans-masculine.
[deleted]
The former. I like to think of suicidality existing on a spectrum, ranging from an absence of self-injury to successful suicide, with non-suicidal self-injuries in the middle.

Everyone is welcome to take the survey!

You know there’s a story in my country that in my opinion shows how stupidity can be entertaining	In Ireland there was a student who asked the principal to have teachers refer to them with They/Them pronouns. One teacher(doesn’t even have the student in any of his classes) protested against this. He then went on a crusade saying it went against his Christian beliefs. He eventually got so pumped up about it he confronted the principal in an assembly. Got so tense teachers how to get between them. He was immediately suspended. Despite being suspended with Full pay he continued to protest by showing up to school each day and sat in an empty classroom. They eventually got an injunction against him barring him from entering the school. He ignored that and was subsequently arrested. He refused to apologise and spent over 100 days in prison. He was only released there and now that we’re back to school. He has continued to show up in the school. There’s finally going to be a hearing where he will most likely lose his job. I like reading these stories because it shows how people with stupid practices (such asnotletting us go by They/Them in our life’s) end up winning stupid prizes.

Song with they in Singular	So, recently I told my english teacher that you could use They As singular. How ever he didn't believe me and told me I could only be used in plural. He told I should find a song that has They in a song. I'd very much like to teach him that They could be used in Singular. Also I'd like to win the argument xD. Anyways if you know any songs with They in Singular, pleeeease let me know. All help is appreciated thank you!	"I mean the literal definition according to the Oxford Dictionary doesn't appear to exclude singularity:
> used to refer to a person of unspecified gender.

This honestly seems a little unfair of your teacher to do and really doesn't sit well with me.
Yeah. Tell them to screw off. ‘They’ was used in singular for ages, and there are languages that don’t even use pronouns (Finnish for example, hän means either he/she) 

Also, I typed up that response and then realized that I used They in singular to reference your teacher. 

“My coworker forgot their jacket at the office, I hope they remember to come get it!”
You could show your teacher the OED's [A brief history of singular ‘they’](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/), if only because of this:

""Even people who object to singular they as a grammatical error use it themselves when they’re not looking, a sure sign that anyone who objects to singular they is, if not a fool or an idiot, at least hopelessly out of date.""

That's the OED saying it, not us 😂
I recommend just giving him this article instead:

[deleted]
How did he become an english teacher, not knowing something as basic as that? People will deny the existence of singular 'they' and then accidentally use it in the next sentence without even noticing. I can't believe this is still a battle we have to fight...
https://youtu.be/8Hb30PE1xgo 

Teacher sounds like an ass. Maybe if you send this video of a song that would be a good comeback?
I believe the reason they said that is that I'm german and in german you actually can't really use They in singular which sucks, maybe that's why it doesnt make sense if he's only translating from German to English. Or maybe he's just stupid idk xD
Obtuse xD That's a new word for me, the german word is quite funny. The german word for obtuse basically means Dumbass xD
If I would for example say: ""They are a cool person"" they'd say dont doesnt work, you'd have to say ""They are cool people"" And I'm like bruh
Lmao that's just straight up incorrect?
What is?
Your teacher of course
Oh yeah he is. Or should I say... THEY ARE?? Ba dum tsss xD"	q79ysz	NonBinary	14	1.0	2021-10-13 12:21:43
Oh, the strange ups and downs of parents	" Literally on the phone to my parents tonight planning out how it's gonna be when I stay with them to get top surgery and my mother's calling me ""she"" to my father. 

Like, she gets it, kinda, but she doesn't \*get\* it. I've mostly stopped caring and just think it's funny at this point. But there are times like this when I want to be like ""Hello? Do you realize what you're saying or are you just that tone-deaf to the situation?"" I think she understands like cis vs transgender but doesn't quite get what exactly nonbinary entails or that they/them pronouns are, like, a thing. 

I mean, to be fair, by the time I started using gender neutral pronouns regularly, I wasn't living with my parents anymore so they never had a chance to get used to them. But it's still funny, since my mother offered to help me out with top surgery recovery and here she is on the phone talking about it and unthinkingly misgendering me. Oh well.

I came out to my therapist, it went well!	"It was my first session with him and explaining my problems I basically backed myself into a corner and had to say that I was nonbinary lol. But he understood!!!

To be fair he got a little confused at first and thought I was talking about bisexuality so I explained the difference and he understood what I was talking about!!! I also come out as asexual and I think he respects that too, well he didn't try to say that I was wrong or confused so it's a win!

I was prepared to face ignorance or to have to explain everything because I live in a small rural place in Italy and it's not obvious to meet someone who knows what you're talking about but it went well! It went well! I'm so happy!"	"YAAAY! Glad it went well op!!

This was well done, which I appreciate. I like to take surveys just for fun sometimes, and a lot of them—even those directed at trans folk—are just *not* well crafted or inclusive. This one is; so thanks! :D
Took it! Thank you for sharing!
Might I ask why the age requirement?
Thanks for the feedback. We will definitely keep this in mind when interpreting the results. 
Thank you!
Yes, for folks who are considered under age, I would have to get parental consent (i.e., they would have to allow you to take part in the study) via the university institutional review board. This would be challenging given the nature of the study and that it's an online study. Hope that helps clarify. "	5qddad	NonBinary	12	0.94	2017-01-26 22:36:25
Took two difficult phone calls to the bank (HSBC), but finally got them to change my form of address from Mr to Mx!	"Just to be clear, on the HSBC website it states:

>If you don't want a gender-specific title on your account, we can change it to either 'Mx' or 'M'.  
>  
>For gender-neutral title changes, where you're not changing your name, we don't need any proof for the change to be made. Just call us...

The first time I rang the bank, the support person was like 'Errrr... what? Please repeat.' So I repeated, and she went 'You want to change your name?' No, I want to change my title. And it went back and forth until she finally got it, and then put me hold to 'pull up my details' which I took to mean, ask her colleagues what the fuck to do. Anyway, she comes back on and says she can't do it. She can only change me to Mrs, wtf - and then says but if I go into the bank with a photo ID with 'Mx' on it, maybe they can change it there.

Second time, again 'Errrr... you want to do... what?' and so on, and the guy forced me to tell him where on the HSBC website it says I can change it for some reason, and then he looks it up I guess, and puts me on hold, and the comes back and says 'OK, I will change that.' Joy! But if they have the option to change it in the system, why are they making me dance like this??

Anyway, I got an electronic statement and it said 'Mx' on the account name, but the letter was still addressed to 'Mr' FFS. Still some work to do there.

Coming out to anyone IRL scares me	"16 yo AMAB genderfluid kid here. Whenever I think of coming out to people I know irl, it scares me. I felt that if I come out to cis people and they either don't understand/don't accept it/or just spout off the ""two jokes."" Come out to anyone LGBT+ and they call me a transtrender. I feel like I can't win or be acceptable by anyone's IRL. 

This doesn't even talk about coming out to my family. The person I'd most likely come out to, my twin sis', I feel wouldn't believe me or my gender identity exist. My two older siblings I don't think would believe me or my identity. And my parents are the ultimate challenge. They're LGBT friendly and I know they'd accept me as bi (which I haven't come out to my family as either) but I don't know if they would ever accept their child being trans/genderfluid. 

I have no friends either so there's no one in that care to come out to. 

So now I'm stuck in the closet for an undetermined amount of time. And I just found my name, so that's fun. I hope you all are having a better day/life than I'm having."

[Queering the Binary Survey: What's your non-binary experience? www.bit.ly\/queeringdoc](https://preview.redd.it/w8vi9x98uoz51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=019b3eda234efbc4cef6a293910435f43ab0c86d)

**Here are more details about our survey:**

**To be eligible to participate you must identify as non-binary, be 18+ years old, and English-speaking.** **All countries are welcome. The survey is confidential and all data will be reported in aggregate form.** If you indicate you are interested in being interviewed for the docuseries, your email address will be associated with your responses so you can be contacted.

The purpose of this research study is to investigate the life experiences of non-binary individuals. Having current, relevant data about non-binary people will add to the limited, but existing literature and resources on non-binary people.

The Queering the Binary research survey asks questions about the following topics: demographics, gender identity, sexual orientation, romantic attraction labels, relationships, culture, being out, bullying, mental health, transitioning, and gender dysphoria/euphoria. It takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

To thank you for participating, we’ll send you an advanced screening link of the first episode.

Hi. This post needs more info before it can be approved. If you  include the information from the consent page and a link to the production company page we can approve it. Thanks.
Thank you! That's great to hear - we hoped trigger warnings and mental health referrals would be helpful. Glad to know it made a difference. Thanks again for participating and also for sharing with your friends!

Gender neutral names starting with V?	"So for some reason, at 2:30 am today I had the realization that the letter V is super cool and I've always liked it.  To the point where I think even V on its own would be a cool name.

But I am still looking for and open to suggestions for gender neutral names starting with V! :D If I don't end up using any of them then at least I'll have a pretty cool pool of names starting with my favorite letter.  Definitely a win.

Update: Thank you all for the lovely suggestions!  Unfortunately, the names haven't really resonated with me (I've been receiving suggestions off of Reddit as well) as much as I like them, so I've decided to just stick with V, at least for now. C:"	"V is ideal!

I've met someone with this name. So remarkable!

We met on [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates) and fell madly in love with each other.
Valentine
Venus, Vic, Vee, Vix, Val, Velvet, Van, Valor
Just V sounds like such a power move
Vye
Vex
Van or Venn
Valor, Vi, Vin(ny), Vix(en), Vaughn
Just V like V for Vendetta

my queer friends are so far away :(	"Hi I'm Caiti (she/they)
I'm non binary :)!

when I'm at home, I have to pretend to be the cis man I physically present as. my family have voiced their opinions in the past and my gender is nothing to do with them so I've found it best to stay closeted. 
I am only out to a small amount of friends. These friends are over 150 miles away and I've only been able to hang out with them a number of times.

each time we hang out it is absolutely incredible. they are so gender affirming and just their presence is euphoric. I love them with all my heart, they are angels. 

however, going back to my life at home is always so miserable. my life is boring as it is and not having the small wins like being called the correct pronouns is so painful. I've found myself longing to be around these friends but as they are so long distance, it's impossible to hang out often. I feel so stuck. I hate the person I am when I'm at home. when I'm with them, I love who I am. so it's just a whole issue 😂

not really sure what response I am asking for here. 
any input appreciated 

love you all
caiti xoxo"	"Can‘t really help you, but I’m in a similar situation. Best friend, nonbinary like me, lives in another country like 420 miles (680 kilometres) away and we only see each other like every three months on holidays. Back home I primarily live with my transphobic mom, so being with my friend is always an escape. I mostly cope by focusing on school stuff and my hobbies. Also, I got lucky and have a few friends at home, even tho I’m way less close with them.
It may not be much consolation....but know you're not alone!
Hopefully you can find more friends closer to you to spend time with!
i hope you can eventually move closer to your queer friends and start presenting as your authentic self 💜
awe I'm sorry to hear that! think we've just got to cherish the rare moments we get with our good friends :)
thank you <3

but I live in a chavvy town where queer life is almost nonexistent so I doubt it 😂
thank you love x"	yjoazt	NonBinary	11	1.0	2022-11-01 23:02:57
Jeopardy rep	I love jeopardy lol. And I didn't realize rowan ward is non-binary! That's so cool!! They were an awesome contestant. And I hope they win the next game.	We have the same name :D	yf73ta	NonBinary	11	0.81	2022-10-27 23:34:50
I did the new version of FaceApp and it was so confused about my gender presentation it basically did nothing - F*ck them and their normativity.	I hope this is the right Flair - I chose YAY cos it felt like a win for me and my self-expression - they obviously have a lot of work to do and are perpetuating problematic expectations of beauty and gender expressions, so as I said F\*ck them.	"I have an answer for you! If you go to settings there’s a button to be able to manually pick your gender. Pick the one you’re trying to get closer to vs further away from.

sharing a little joy	i got out of a shitty relationship where my partner barely respected my gender identity (would misgender me to mutual friends, never called me by my preferred name), and now i’m in a relationship with a person who’s also nonbinary, and the difference is insane. being with someone who not only respects my identity but actually understands it has improved my mental health and confidence in my identity by miles, sooooo yeah i just wanted to share a win with you all (^^)		wlggrm	NonBinary	11	1.0	2022-08-11 02:54:40
I bought makeup today	"Or rather yesterday. My mom has been trying to push makeup on me for nearly a decade but I always said no- what she wanted was for me to be hyper feminine which is never what I wanted. I recently saw a video on how to look feminine like a boy and I was hooked, since then I've been looking into masculinizing techniques and got interested in the craft. I asked my sister to help me pick out stuff and ended up spending $130 on makeup that I was excited to use and it was my choice to use...


Then the moment I got home my mom started yelling about how im finally ready to be a real girl and not a dyke. And then when I told her I bought it for masculine makeup she called me things I dont feel comfortable repeating. Apparently she's digging for my binder as I speak so I expect to go home to a disaster... I feel like I cant win."	That really sucks dude. Hide that makeup and stuff well so she doesn’t destroy it.	l23li4	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-01-21 17:50:28
Coming out yee²	Came out to my best friend after months and months of stress and anxiety bogging me down but it all turned out well in the end. She was super accepting and her using my new name was such a validating experience. Anyways all of this resulted in me sobbing on my bedroom floor at 1 am.  Despite everything going in the world rn I at least have this small win to happy about.	"Glad it worked out!

Stay strong :)"	gbesgl	NonBinary	10	1.0	2020-05-01 09:10:26
Happy Enbie day!!!!!!	"So i could go and show love to all the enbies stepping out individually but its too many of yall and I'm way to lazy.  Instead Ill post this:  


I fucking love yall,  I love yalls strength to be you; your real selves  
I love yalls power, to simply not give a FUCK about gender and be yourselves  


In todays day and age it is a powerful statement to live free in a world that still hates us for being different and for demanding the space to live that difference.    


I wish I had the strength to live my truth when i was younger but i chose now to live and i mean live.    


IDGAF if you are black white purple or polka dotted you are my family and i will stand with you.    


If you have no family that supports you , we got you.  If your dad wont support you I will: i got 5 kids 2 are enbies and we dont play that shit in my house and you ALL are apart of my house.    


you can fight me or i can make pizza either way we both win.

I had no idea this was a thing.
I am ravenously supportive about my kids and all those in my life. My space is inclusive and I will spill blood to protect those in my space. I have no problem breaking someone's face for hate and disrespect. 

Like I said this is my house and in my house we love and we support. If hate comes we stand and are violent in our defense of others and their right to exist.

Came out to my teacher and it went really well	"(I'll be posting this on r/Nonbinaryteens, r/BisexualTeens and other reddits too)
(Sorry for any grammar/ortography mistakes, as english isn't my first language, it can be a bit rusty)

Giving some context, I've got this history teacher who always, when he talks with the class, what is lot, says about some themes as feminism, LGBTQ+, racism, social issues, reality, depression, adolescence and others in a really well rounded and based way. He is probably my favorite teacher this year, and in some sense, giving the fact that I already've gotten some counseling from him, I trust him.

So, I'm non-binary, specifically demigender, and bisexual. About my sexuality, I'm out of the closet, even to my parents. Some of my friends know about my gender, most not, but in those past two years (I'm yet 15yo) I've done a pretty good job on getting to understand and accept more myself. On this case, thank you Levy (it's not their real name) for being this amazing enby friend of mine.

Now to the actual thing,

while I was talking with Levy, I got this taught: ""Wait, teachers should be able to help and counsel students? Right?"". We live in Brazil, and here people have a really big bias against the LGBTQ+ community, and I was really needing counseling from an adult recently, as everyone who knew was around my age, or a bit older, and this teacher instantly came to my mind. Levy was like ""OH NO, AREN'T YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?!?"", and I was like ""Yeah"".

So, one week past and I was in a really bad day. Disphoria was killing me, I was sad with some of my friends and colleagues, so I was like, ""Why not?"". Then his lesson came, and at the end I asked him if I could speak with him at the pause, and he went, ""Come, speak now"".

My head was on full speed, and we went out of the classroom to talk in privacy cause I asked, then, I said, looking down, fearful and going all in this bet: ""So, I'm not a man, nor a woman..."". He was like ""Didn't expect this"", but he took a breath and started to talk calmly.

First he calmed me down, and asked how I saw myself, if someone knew, and many other well done questions, without getting agressive or disrespectful even once. 3 minutes pass and he starts saying things that I really should know, and I was just so bad to notice it.

That I'm really well, in the sense of in a good way.

He made me notice that, for having people who know and support me, having someone, even if only a cousin to count on in my family, to already have accepted myself as non binary, while others struggle to even know this, and other many other things that really made me think how I'm really well, when I could just have done everything wrong. He also said that he could keep talking to me when I needed, man, this dude is awesome.

In this time he once said ""You're a really intelligent boy"", and instantly he stopped and asked if he should call me this way, or which pronoun to use in a very polite way. I said that I don't have problems, and any of them are ok. He even recomended me to talk to a transmasc high school student on the school (which I already talk, ha) and a documentary about a non binary person.

That day I also went for the first time to gym, random thing but a win to me.

One day passes (it's today), and I'm like, insanely happy going crazy with Levy. His class comes (we have classes with him twice a week) and while he class, he says ""vocês, meninos, meninas... e meninxs"", it has no direct translation to english, but would be some thing like ""you, boys, girls... and (insert gender neutral equivalent)"", an then he looks to me. Man, I instantly got red, nobody in the class got the meaning of this, but me and Levy. I looked to them and they were like, laughing to me, I was laughing, which is rare. Ok it actually isn't the best way to refer to nb persons, as it's hard to speak, and mainly for blind people to understand using a programm to read on cellphones, but even I didn't know that until some time ago, and it stills valid, as it shows that he cares about how I'm feeling and how I see myself.

This alone made two of my last days incredibly amazing. It's too good to know that, even slowly, things are going well and I'm starting to go out of the closet. Me and Levy are planning to out ourselves to our friends on the nb day on the pride month next year, but we still don't know.

Thanks for reading this, and sorry for the big text.

For the (trans)Horde!"	I came out to my textiles teacher (enby) when I got into an awkward situation and she took it really well. But she said she can't call me by my prefered name unless I've told the school and parents and stuff, which I'm fine with as I don't really expect her to call me by my prefered name.	dpel9a	NonBinary	11	1.0	2019-10-30 23:07:51

Crisis: A poem	"
CAUTION FOR ANYONE STRUGGLING WITH A LOT BOAT LOAD OF THINGS 

I WROTE THIS AND AM VERY PROUD OF IT 
THIS IS ABOUT MY SELF JOURNEY 
IVE BEEN MENTALLY PRETTY GOOD FOR 2 YEARS NOW WORKING ON MYSELF AND THIS IS MORE OF A SHOW OF THE PROGRESS IVE MADE OF THE PLETHORA OF QUESTIONS IVE HAD OVER THE YEARS AND HOW MANY I NOW UNDERSTAND AND HOW MUCH FARTHER MY JOURNEY ON MY MENTAL WELL BEING CAN GO AS I BECOME BETTER EVERY DAY. FUCK YES 2020.I PRESENT TO YOU CRISIS : A POEM ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE.

——————————-

When will I ever stop masquerading as something I do not feel?
When does the moment I touch the sky become what is real?
When do I unearth the lies and begin to heal?
When do I realize who I am is not the whole deal?
When do I unzip completely from what once was a seal?

How do I begin to pick apart the peel?

Over the course of the past two years I have promoted this concept.
This innate ideal that I am not whole.
This raw thought of what should, and could I be?

How do I blend myself elegantly?
How do I blend in?
Do I even want to blend in?

I must want some luxury of fitting in.
I spent most of my school life trying to fit in until I realized I could not.
But I tried anyway.

Am I a sin?
Did I deserve being raped?
Do I present authentically?
Do represent the truth I preach?
Does my message ever reach?
Why does everyone feel like I’m arguing?
I swear I’m not trying to play devils advocate.
I’m not being combative; you just don’t understand.
That’s not your fault for not understanding.

Is there something I don’t understand?
I’ve always been able to see both sides.
But why do I ever rarely change my mind at all?

Do you know how to find the answers?
Am I to blind?
Both of my parents have cancers.
Should I give up this personal fight to be at their sides?
Why do my abusers deserve any light?

Are they at fault for the absurd misguidance I needed in my life?
I’m 23 Its time I accept some blame for not just doing this, right?
But I’m stuck in their world not mine.
Their rules on my time.
Slowly, ever so slowly will this idea die?
And the first moment I become what they need will my future dissolve?
How do I solve this in a new light?

I need to make my parents proud, they always tried to do me right.
They tried me in soccer- I would fight.
They tried me in band camp- I would cry.
They tried me in a play- I failed but they said that’s okay.
They tried me in basketball- my height got the best of me.
Baseball too, too weak for the bat. 
Fuck lacrosse I wasn’t even dude bro for that.
Track, yes Track, let me try that.
Hold on get addicted cigarettes so don’t do track.
Fall in love with a girl down the road 3 or 4 girls 3 or 4 different roads.
My voice dropped before chorus would hold.
Listen to the music you would wish to compose, now try but don’t forget about those
Who would say look at the joke who cannot hold a damn note?

Watch
 your
 friends 
die,
 they didn’t try that. 
They ignored that.

Date
 a 
boy? Or a a few?
They didn’t try that. They ignored that. They don’t even know that.

They ignored the bullies, no matter how bad.
If it became themselves, they pointed back and also laughed.
I have a hard time dealing with that.
I should be cutting my wrists to pretend I’m ignoring all those facts.

Hold on replace that.
Weed? (we’ll get back to that)
Xanax? Check.
Cocaine? Check?
Molly, k2, PCP, heroin? Ok go for that.
Why do I have wait for the 27 club, what the fuck is that?

Pause, breathe, relax. Try to keep yourself intact. You have one more year left of high school.
Meet the best friends of your life.
next year you’ll go berserk when you shake your head, finally get sober, then get cheated on by the girl you tried over and over to win over until it was over.
Maintain a few jobs, go to a few colleges, fall for a few guys a few more girls start to accept yourself and move on.

Finally have time to think back.
What did I miss but need now through all that?

2006? you played in that play pretend doll house with your friends, fake cooking bread. Slept over playing the Barbie game snuck over in a Hot Wheel’s box to save grace.
2010? Okay let the cross dressing begin.
Pause 2014-2016 for more rage.
Resume 2018.
Go to school meet some temp friends some hook ups also again
Come to think of it from 2010-2018 how many crushes did I have?
Do I know where to begin?
2019 fall in love with the first real love.
Real love.
Actual love.

I can accept myself again from within
Flexible self, soft skin.
Do I know who I am? 
Am I just biting time again?

I know what I am
Who I am…?

I’ve just been terrified to admit
Because being called “it” scares me enough
To not piss when / I sit.
And being brought up so aggressive is hard for friends to even forfeit.
My interests are my interests.
My attitude is mine.
But I am not who I am with.

I will fill in that line when I know what ones to draw.
Right now, I’m letting the non-binary label thaw.
First, I need to crawl before I walk.


I’m Ryan and
I’m ______________
So there it is."	"This is awesome. Super powerful. Thank you for sharing.

Parents support TERF cult disguised as Christianity (Mormonism); making SI bad	"TW: Discussions of suicidal ideation; fundamentalist Christianity; mean parents

Hello my loveliest of lovelies, 

Enby here, raised in the queerphobic Cult that is Mormonism. I'm a direct descendant of one of the founders, Parley Parker Pratt so my family consider themselves proud of their heritage. The first 17 years of my life I held onto my faith with every fiber of my body because it was the only coping mechanism offered to me for dealing with the crushing gender dysphoria, but as a young child I regularly asserted my actual gender and tried to get my family to recognize me for who I was. Obviously that didn't happen because in the Mormon church, socially or medically transitioning to any extent is apostasy, meaning they excommunicate you from the church. (Mormons now consider the word ""mormon"" a slur, so you should be aware they are officially called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but I'm going to call them Mormons because its a ""win for Satan"" apparently.) 

Anyway. Recently I came out to my Bapuji (that's what we call my grandfather, it's Punjabi for ""respected elder"") He was born and lived his young life in India and then came to the US in the 1950s to study mathematics. He married my grandmother, who is a Pratt (basically mormon royalty) and joined the Mormon church. Coming out to him was such a big deal because he was the first ethnically Indian mission president to preside over the Indian Subcontinent and because he did a fuck ton of genealogical work for the mormon church gathering records from India, translating them, and then giving the names of my ancestors to the mormon church for proxy covenants, which is what Mormons do in their secret temples. Mormons believe that everyone has to receive certain covenants in order to be saved, so members of the church go to the temple to perform covenants for someone who is dead. 

Now, here's the thing. Prior to British colonization, Trans and Non-binary people enjoyed a lot more freedoms. They were recognized and didn't face widespread discrimination. Because of colonization, those same groups who were once revered are now endangered. So in my mind, my Bapuji who I have always loved and respected immensely, bought into the Mormon church's teachings about the divine binary nature of gender, and then performed proxy religious covenants for my ancestors, some of whom were definitely not ""men"" or ""women."" So basically he mis-gendered people in a really sacred and religious way that basically invalidates their whole existence which is crazy ancient and beautiful and is INCREDIBLY offense and harmful to me as well as MAD FUCKING RACIST AGAINST HIS OWN ANCESTRAL PEOPLE

and the vast majority of my extended family, as well as my Mom, dad, older sister and older brother still pay more than 10% of their gross annual income to the mormon church. They all served missions, teaching people on different continents that gender variance is a sin. The Mormon church is incredibly wealthy and tax exempt even though they regularly interfere with local and national politics and have a whole lobbying organization which mobilizes really intensely against any form of queer rights. 

And all of this just makes me want to not be alive. My mom says she doesn't believe what the church teaches about gender variance and that ""more revelation is coming"" but I asked my mom to stop paying tithing years ago, and I thought she did. I said to her ""if you pay tithes to the LDS church and have a queer child you're not gonna have a queer child for very long."" My mom is justifying her paying tithes by saying ""well i'm going to pay for top surgery too"" like...i don't want you to pay for top surgery if you're still paying tithing. I don't want you in my life if you're still paying tithing. I don't want to be alive if you're still paying tithing. You're putting your brainwashing transphobic cult rituals over your own child's health. How can you say you love someone and simultaneously pay for their oppression?"	"You may find some advice in r/exmormon too. Dang... you have the added pressure of being “pioneer stock” too!

So I’ll give my two cents as an exmormon with lots of active family members, hope it helps. I think this is a very complicated topic, and you have every right to be upset about it. Allow yourself to feel what you feel and know that it’s okay to feel that way.

But—and this is a big, painful, unattractive but—you probably will not be able to get past your anger/sadness until you accept that you simply cannot force someone else to quit their religion and stop paying tithing to it, even though it hurts you tremendously.

I have no idea why my family members still believe what they believe when they know full well it makes no sense when you consider my situation as a queer person. But they do. And I can’t change that.

Where you CAN find solace is in focusing on what you yourself can do about the situation, such as a) separating yourself from the church, b) having honest conversations with family about it, and/or b) distancing yourself from family members who you feel you can’t be on good terms with while they are still involved in Mormonism. And most importantly, practice SELF COMPASSION. It is very important that you learn to love yourself regardless of what your mormon family may think of you. It will make it easier to deal with the pain/betrayal you feel. When you have done this for a while, and processed your own trauma from being involved in the church, you may be better able to practice compassion for your family members as well, and be better able to accept what you can’t control.

If you want to talk more in depth about it please feel free to DM me. (P.S. sorry about all the caps; I still don’t know how to italicize on mobile)
I'm still reading, but I had to stop and laugh at ""Mormon"" as a slur.

Imagine being such a shitty social entity that their own *name* became ridiculed and weaponized against them.

It's as hilarious as middle aged white Karens trying to equate being called ""a Karen"" to being black and being called the n* slur.

Absolutely hilarious when shitty people whinge.
I'll post to r/exmormon too

ok a little background: 

Born in the covenant, raised in Provo. My faith crisis was 6 years ago, I'm 6 years resigned from the church next april. I have had honest conversations with my parents about it. I never asked my parents to quit their religion and I would never do that. I just want them to stop paying for their religion to oppress my people. If they still want to follow the law of tithing I sent them lots of queer mormon organizations they could give to instead. (like the encircle home, which would be fitting considering they kicked me out when I left the church.) I am pretty distant from my family already, I live in NYC and they live in Utah. But I think i got more emotionally close to them because of the pandemic, and that's why this stings so much. I miss them so much. I love them so much. I have been to a LOT of therapy and have processed a lot of my experiences in the church, and I thought I'd come to some sort of plateu in the rollercoaster of our relationship, and then this shit. Imma DM you, just thought i'd reply in case anyone stumbles upon this."	itcqbf	NonBinary	9	0.91	2020-09-15 16:54:11
[possible trigger warming] How do you deal with knowing that you will never be valid to other people?	"
I’ll avoid the details of the conversation because its not important. 
Its become clear that a friend has only even used my pronouns as a curtsy. She always used they/them when describing me, because she’s a nice person. And she is a nice person, but she has never seen me as anything other than my assigned sex.

However this isn’t a new though. My struggle with non-binary identity has never been with how I see myself, I always though enby was great at expressing my personal experience, but as a self descriptor it feels pointless if even in queer spaces it’ll only be seen as a skin deep aesthetic.

I’ve see a lot of posts reassuring that eventually a person who will gets it will appear. Which even if that was true, which I’m not sure it is, I don’t know if really helps. The problem is with the world around me, which I can’t change. I can only hope it’ll decide to change on its own.. 

I don’t mean this as to mean an uncertainty with being enby. I feel comfortable in that. It feels like a fact that I couldn’t even wish to change. But it prevents every relationship. If its a fact about me that only I am willing to acknowledge and so every relationship will to an extent be shallow.

I don’t feel angry or upset with this person because they don’t see my gender as valid, thats not new to me. The friendship feels less than it was tho. They are always going to make assumptions about how what I want, how I’m feeling, and why I’m feeling, based on a gender I don’t have. 

And this will be every relationship. No one I will ever meet is going to truly think differently. There is no win state of finally passing as enby. The best case will only ever be placation. 

I don’t feel invalid, but I feel lonely. 

What do I do with this?"	"I choose not to give the power of my emotional state to other people. I get to choose how I feel about a situation, even if I can't control the situation itself. If I choose not to care whether someone else thinks I'm valid or not, then if they consider me invalid, it doesn't affect me. This applies everywhere, not just with gender.
I deal by remembering, as the saying goes, that those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.

I also don't defend transphobes by saying they're ""nice"" for meeting the most basic, low bars of human decency. I know it's really easy to fall into that trap, but using the correct pronouns for someone isn't ""nice"", it's *normal*. Give credit where it's due, sure, but no more than is due.
It can be lonely being nonbinary, sometimes even in queer or trans spaces people don't seem to understand.

I don't think your friend should make any assumptions about what anyone feels or wants based on their gender. Not all women feel or want the same things or even have similar experiences. Not all nonbinary people do either. All people are individuals.

You did ask how others deal with knowing we won't be valid to other people, and I want to try to answer that. First of all, I remind myself that lots of people have beliefs I find ridiculous. So there will always be people who are small minded about gender. Then I remind myself that I have lived in my body for long enough to know who I am and what I feel. Then I remind myself that I get to make decisions about my body and presentation, and I get to respectfully ask people to use my pronouns, etc. 

Then I go outside and remind myself that I am on a planet in space and the universe is so much larger than me.
I'm one of those optimistic fools who think we ARE changing the world, sometimes just by not giving in. It can be so difficult to just move through the world, but keep in mind: no amount of disrespect or disregard can alter who you are. We see you. We're with you. You are as you should be.
I worked to make non-binary friends, at first online and then irl so at least I have some space where I can be seen. It really weighs on me, especially in trans spaces, where people struggle to see me as anything besides my agab despite me putting considerable energy into being seen by others as anything but my agab. Having even one person that could see me for me really helped.
There was a line in a book I read recently-“not my clowns, not my circus”. I like to remind myself of that saying when I’m worrying about how other people perceive me. Their feelings are not my clowns, not my circus to run.
Gender only exists in people's heads anyways. When I say I'm genderfluid I'm basically just telling people to toss out their sexist stereotypes when looking at me. It's easier than saying I'm a man and not all men are how YOU see men."	syve4s	NonBinary	9	0.91	2022-02-22 19:01:35
My terrible experience with a dermatologist!	"Someone's having a right laugh at my life cause a while ago I quit a really stressful job, bought two months later tried hrt (testosterone) and stopped two weeks in cause my hair started falling out. A lot. Was it the stress of the job situation? The hrt? Idk but I ignored the problem until today when I finally went to a dermatologist. 

It was fine at first, she asked why I was there and how she could help and then asked some questions trying to figure out why my hair might be falling out. As soon as she found out I had been on hrt she just automatically assumed that was the case and almost like.... got an aditude about it? Idk I'm still kinda processing what happened and I forgot a lot of what they said to me I just remember feeling hurt and betrayed. Can't catch a win someone definitely cursed me fr.

I felt so alone after that. Sat in the shower desperately wanting a hug. I want to be jelly I want to turn into slime. I didn't ask to be born like this. SORRY for the bummer vibes!!! I'll try to bring something positive next time I post!!!!"	"HUGS….lots of HUGS…

Sounds like you need a gender affirming dermatologist that will help actually determine if there’s a hair loss issue related to testosterone or if it’s stress….and leaving any job, even a stressful one, is in itself stressful.
That's awful.  It's fucked up how some doctors can get away with treating their patients so poorly.  T can cause hair loss, but I don't think I've ever seen it cause a problem like that so quickly.  Can't rule it out, but . . . back long before I was on T, I had pretty bad hair loss for a while that turned out to be due to an iron deficiency.  I'd definitely go to another doctor (not necessarily a dermatologist, even) and try to figure out the root cause here, because it could absolutely be a symptom of something else.
Close your eyes and if i may, give yourself a big wrap around squeeze, its from me <3 im sorry we cant be with you physically but were there in spirit always. People are just cunts sometimes, you shouldn’t be the one who has to deal with it.
So, so sorry that happened to you, friend. You are lovely and do not deserve treatment like that. And don't apologise for letting it all out, it's not good to keep it in! 🖤
I’m sending my best energy and vibes across the internet to you!  It’s probably a combination of factors (like most things) and the stress probably made you particularly vulnerable.  But some doctors like to be right and not be challenged.  Very frustrating as a patient to deal with a combative person like that when your just trying to take care of your health!  A little empathy and understanding goes a long way and it’s a shame a lot of people don’t get that. 

I love the phrase “I want to be jelly I want to turn into slime”. Can we PLEASE get that on a t-shirt?!?!  I totally feel that and love the word usage. Here you are spreading some joy even in a dark and difficult moment. How wonderful and magical you are. There is queer magic inside all of us 🌈💖🪄"	11rglkj	NonBinary	11	1.0	2023-03-15 00:45:42
Should I forgive someone who deadnamed me on purpose?	"So a little context, I'm an NB (They/Them) and I changed my name and auditioned for the musical our school held and got in along with the deadnamer who we'll call 'B'. B was a \*huge\* gossip and loved telling secrets. Fast forward a couple months or so and we are in the green room at the college the musical was taking place and I was watching (read: Forced) Good Boys with some friends and B. We were talking and I said something she apparently didn't like, so she decided to say something along the lines of: Shut up deadname. When I responded 'that's not my name' she said 'I know that's why I said it'; I initially brushed it off until my other friend 'E' pulled me aside and convinced me to tell the teacher so I did-not for me but for others who might have this have this to them. B tried to pull a BS story about her having a bad memory and forgetting but she explicitly stated that she did it on purpose, and was just trying to play it off and win my sympathy. After it happened when the musical was over I started just crying whenever I see or hear her-and still do. I don't know what to do and keep thinking I'm over reacting but I don't know anymore. Should I forgive her?

Btw sorry for grammer and if this was too long and/or if I used the wrong flair please let me know if I did!"	"i don't even need to read the body of the post to say: fuck no. if it was an accident, sure, we all make mistakes. but someone hurting you on purpose, *for any reason,* isn't worth your forgiveness.
No, don't forgive them. They did it with malice and forethought. They deserve no quarter. I'd advise bringing it up with the director and getting her barred from other productions. Destroy her future. Then maybe she'll learn
they don’t deserve to be forgiven. if it was an accident, sure, but they did it knowing damn well they wanted to hurt you.
It's of my personal values to be willing to forgive if they are truly repentant. Until then, politely and professionally refuse their apology. It's possible that in the future, either near or distant, your offender may have a change in outlook.
It only seems like an exreme reaction cause you're trying to be a nice person and assuming she tries to be a nice person. And it's very stressful to have someone be so blatantly mean and show she's not anything like the standard you hold yourself to. She's not going to be able to be reasoned with in regards to your own values. So that can be really painful that a value of yours is functionally unable to requested to be respected. (Sorry that was a bit of a jumble) 

Personally, I think there is no purpose to forgive her. She's not really functioning in a space that forgiveness is even functional. I would just accept the kind of values she has doesn't play well with your values and make some space to not have to deal with her if you don't have to.
If B admits to having done it intentionally and apologizes, maybe it'd be reasonable to forgive her (we all do things we aren't proud of, and then we try to do better next time). 

But it sounds like she stands by her actions and would gladly do the same again. That's not the sort of thing you forgive. B deserves to have people hold a grudge against her for as long as she's proud of having intentionally caused you pain.

That being said, crying might not be the most useful way to act on your grudge? It's not that B doesn't deserve your animosity, but you don't deserve to be inconvenienced in this way. If you have access to therapy, maybe mention this to a therapist.
I threw something at the last person who did that on purpose. She doesn't deserve a millisecond of your time or energy
Go ahead and forgive if you’re ready.

But don’t befriend her (or whatever this relationship was) again. The crime is bad enough, but then she didn’t even apologize! She lied to make it sound like calling you by a literal name wasn’t her fault somehow. I’d advise you to stay the fuck away from her.
Do you think she truly understands what she did? I'd be less pissed off at somebody who didn't understand why that was such a bad thing.
I don't see where B has done anything to seek your forgiveness. Personally, I view forgiveness as earned, so I don't think you need to pressure yourself to forgive someone who's not sorry and not trying to fix it.
I think you both should forgive each other. You accidentally said something they disliked, so you could’ve forgiven that. They said your deadname on purpose and tried to lie herself out of it, so she definitely needs to apologize as well. That way, there won’t be any more drama between you two
I do think she understands what she did. She deadnames her trans brother all the time and the only reason she doesn't do it around us is because we accept/are people like that and she doesn't wanna get in trouble.
I think that would be a good idea except that the thing we were arguing about was whether a doll was a cpr doll or not, I thought it was since the 12 year old kids said it was (it wasn't) and I eventually gave up and she deadnamed me. I don't feel like I have to apologize/be forgiven for what I thought was a friendly spat but I might be wrong.
Now that I know what you said, I now know that you don’t need to apologize. You were just having a little friendly non-serious argument, and she took it too far by saying something serious"	vhr5zf	NonBinary	8	1.0	2022-06-21 23:52:34
Some mussings	"So I've been watching this sub for a few days and it's prompted some random thoughts. Hopefully getting them off my chest will help a bit.

First off, I was AMAB and I'm old compared to a lot of the people posting here. I'm 35 and, while that feels like a lifetime apart, it's amazing to see people in their teens thinking about these things. I only learnt what nonbinary was in my early 30s, only came out to myself at 32 and to my parents a few weeks ago. It was hugely damaging to me not knowing why I felt the way I did and it's wonderful to know that other people won't have to grow up in that same world.

I recently changed my name - I now go by Dorian Crane after years of \*hating\* my previous name. It's taking a while for people to get used to it (but that's fine, they are trying and that's all that matters). I'm lucky to live in a liberal enclave and have lots of trans friends, so I'm not doing anything unusual in my circle - we are aggressively queer and it's wonderful. Again, I didn't have that growing up and until I found it I didn't know how much I needed it.

My parents have been.... mixed. My dad was amazing, when I emailed him his reply was perfect and made me cry a lot. My mum less so. She objects to singular they, she doesn't understand why I'd want to make a fuss about it and I think she's taken my name change pretty badly. Luckily they live several hours away and I don't really see them very often. And my sisters, who are the best, have adopted the cause of winning her round. She I guess I'm pretty lucky as far as it goes - while my mum hasn't been the best, she's trying and isn't a huge factor in my life (I've never been close to my parents).

Another thing that it took me a long time to come to terms with is  that I started losing my hair in my late twenties. It used to be shoulder length, then I cut it short to avoid looking like Bill Bailey, then over the summer started shaving it off entirely. It's hard to explain why it bothered me so much - it gave me massive dysmorphia because balding is such a male coded experience and I hated that I couldn't go anything about it. Luckily bald heads can be really queer coded and I have a head shape that suits it. I'm going to try and attach a photo to this - probably as a comment? I'm new to Reddit and still figuring it out.

I'm not sure where I'm going with a lot of this. Mostly that I'm old and I'm still very confused by all of this but I'm brute forcing my way through it. I wouldn't have had the confidence to do this a few years ago but getting out of a horribly toxic relationship and into a new friendship circle of hella queer folks helped massively. I'd like to be able to help other people with this journey but don't really know how - any suggestions on how to get into activism online would be much appreciated.

Just... look after each other and try not to spend decades not being yourselves I guess. Don't be like me.

You are not alone in not being a teenager; I'm 32 and going through the process of coming out, and one of my partners is also NB and they came out last year, they're 31.
Here is another maturing one, 48yo now, afab. I only figured the appropriate term nb about 3 yrs ago. Came out to a few friends who are the closest. I don't feel the need to change anything more than that, but it is reflected in the choice of a partner. All is well 😁👍
I don't know much about on line activism, more about face to face 😁
That's good to know. It feels quite lonely sometimes, especially as the typical image of an NB person isn't something I've ever looked like."	f8d5jc	NonBinary	8	0.91	2020-02-23 18:07:42
Euphoria	"I'm not here very often, however I want to share something I'm geniuenly proud of and I have a feeling it might help some people.   
By now everyone has heard "" Just hold on it gets better"".  
And I think we all know it's bullshit. It does not ""just"" get better. In may I graduated high school, which put an end to a rough chapter in my life, I started working on myself. Allowing myself to enjoy stuff, to feel stuff. By then I knew i was enby for a while, and I was out to the closest people (familly excluded we are not close), but I was terribly scared of doing anything that would make me be percived as non cis. There were multiple reasons, which are pretty valid like homophobia in my country, fear of being kicked out of the house ( not very likely but still). Now I'm in uni, I've found 2nd partner (poly), while still being with my amazing girlfriend. I've met new people in and outside of uni, months of work payed of as I am ""out"" to everyone and every single new person gets to know me as Percy. In ""wise"" words of one of my recent dates ""hot,alt, enby"" (ksksksk). To saying it feels right is to say nothing. I've also started doing makeup, acting more like myself, stopped being scared to be more fem presenting. 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying I bet dysphoria sometimes it's there, but I'm surrounded by love and care (and lots of other trans and enby people). The work dosen't end there, my mental health got a lot better. My first psychiatrist appointment is next week. There is also this support group for trans people that my new girlfriends girlfriend (Wiki) told me,  she also took me there becouse I was scared to go alone (holy woman <3). I'm finally done represing anything that isn't in front of me. 

&#x200B;

It's not all sunshines and rainbows as touching bad stuff from the past causes me to have really heavy moodswings. Also in order to fully be myself I've cut of my ""best friend"" of 9 years. It is a really long story, which i might tell in another post. But here comes another win, I've cut down on using the unhealthy copying mechanisms. I've really fought to be myself and it's paying off.

&#x200B;

I've been feeling so much gender euphoria lately, and I finally see myself as an attractive person due to lots of validation. Even as stupid thing as getting a lot of matches on tinder, or randomly getting asked out. This week I ordered my first ever dress, it is supposed to come tommorow. It's made in a way that's supposed to be non-dysphoric regarding the cut and how it will fit (Wiki's advice).  
I am so fucking happy. And the first people to see me in it ever will be my girlfriends and Wiki.

I know it's a bit chaotic.

I just bought my first binder!!	"I have for quite a while now been really not that happy with the whole titty situation I got going on. A while ago I promised myself when I moved back to uni I would get myself a binder to at least see how it feels and here I am, back at uni armed with birthday money from grandma that covers the cost perfectly. The fact that it would piss grandma off immensely to know this is what the money is being spent on is an added bonus.

I went with spectrum outfitters based on some recommendations I’d seen on here saying they’re good for both comfort and flatness. They also ended up cheaper than gcb2 when you took shipping into account. 

I’m really hoping I like the result, but if not then at least I know I didn’t feel as bad about the titty situation as I thought, so it’s kinda a win win (pretty sure I’ll like it though.

Misgendering At Work	" 

I've been hesitant about saying anything here, since I'm not sure what I'm looking for from the community. Maybe just a little validation and support would be nice.

I'm out a non-binary to all my family and close friends, and am super supported by them all. My sister even asked me to proof-read a non-binary information pamphlet before she sent it out, saying she wanted an opinion from someone in the community before she sent out any misinformation. So I'm surrounded by love and acceptance.

But I have a co-worker at work who misgenders me all the time. He is a really great guy to work with in all other ways, but he constantly calls me a woman or young lady. I took the plunge one day and told him I actually identify as non-binary. His response was essentially:

""I am a good Christian man. I believe God made Men and Women. But the devil got into young people's minds and has started confusing them. But you can identify however you want."" And then continues to call me a woman and young lady.

I'm ok with all pronouns and female titles (sister, daughter, aunt), but being called a woman or lady causes me mild dysphoria. He doesn't say it in a condescending or mysogynistic way, and has gone out of his way to explain how he respects women and their abilities (once again categorizing me in a way I don't want to be). But after his explanation of his views on men/women/non-binary people, I don't feel like it's going to be a fight I can win to try to get him to stop. And I'm certainly not going to be able to convince him we're a valid identity separate from men and women.

I generally don't make a big deal of my identity, but I'm not sure if there's something I can or should do about this co-worker."	"go to your direct supervisor and HR, and if you haven't already, document each of these interactions. this is a workplace harassment issue and it would be no different if you were binary trans and he were deadnaming you/misgendering you that way.
As a good Christian man, he should want to avoid causing harm to anyone, especially someone he values and respects as he says he does for you. The harm done by misgendering is objective fact. There's plenty of research about the psychological damage it causes. Having some [citable sources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CXQWFWpHU_l4gxk0lncHFt4CdAZlHLWaIYdm4f0qq64/edit) may help. Respecting your identity is a requirement for avoiding causing you harm, and does not conflict with his beliefs in any way. He doesn't have to accept that non-binary people exists to gender you correctly.

""Love others as much as you love yourself"" (Mark 12:31) means to treat people respectfully the way they wish to be treated, just as you would want to be treated respectfully. It does *not* mean ""ignore anything they tell you and just do what you would prefer in their shoes.""

If he continues to cause you harm, he's not a Christian, he's a hypocrite.

On the topic of ""God made men and women"" angle, that's just logical fallacy. God made two people in the garden of eden. That's not an exhaustive list of everything he was capable of creating. The people he created probably had brown skin, but there are plenty of lighter skinned people on earth now. Did God not make them? If the bible had said ""man and woman with brown skin, He created them"", would that justify racism? Intersex people exist. That is objectively verifiable fact, even if you accept that gender is in ""young people's minds"", intersex people have things in their *pants.* 

- [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beyond-xx-and-xy-the-extraordinary-complexity-of-sex-determination/) has a cool infographic in their article.
- [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/opinion/sex-biology-binary.html) guest article from a professor of biology on the complexity of sex.
- [Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2470289718803639) on the topic, including the quote ""The view that the world’s population can be separated into a clearly defined dyadic unit of male and female is defunct; not only clinical observations, but molecular biology has established that sexual identity is on a continuum, with an enormous potential for variance"".

Of course, all of this is just argument and citation that might help you if you decide to discuss it with him further. It doesn't actually address the question of whether you *should* discuss it, or how to handle it. Ultimately the decision of whether or not to have that conversation lies with you. If it's causing you harm that outweighs the potential negatives of the confrontation, you should do it. If you don't feel it's safe, you might lose your job, etc, then maybe don't. Perhaps there's someone in HR, or a manager or other respected coworker, that could act as a mediator for you.

In the end, even if he claims to respect you, actions speak louder than words. He's actively harming you, abusing you, and that is not ok. You are right to be upset and hurt by his behavior.
Hey, that is work place harassment, depending on your State (assuming USA) and employer there are State and Federal legal protections for our protected identities which he is violating. You need to contact HR today to report the incident and file a complaint while standing up for yourself. Regardless of your company's policy on pronoun use and Federal equality laws, he is pushing his religion onto you as an excuse for misgendering you which actually violates your own Constitutional and natural right to freedom of religion - unless you work for a private religious institution.

I am not a lawyer, just a queer with a lot of experience overseeing labor and assessing risk. Speak up, we our are own best advocates and can't stand silently by expecting others to correct the wrong. If you have some questions or want to share more specifics hit me up, these matters are a bit of a personal passion and I am happy to offer some advice and further encouragement.

I'm tired of being questioned and I don't know what to do	"Let me preface this by saying that I'm FTM, and I identify as non-binary, and I don't pass. I never will pass. I don't TRY to pass, because I don't necessarily want to. I'm naturally cheerful and flamboyant. I don't want to have to change my mannerisms or how I speak, I shouldn't have to. I've had top surgery and I've been on hormones for 6 years or so, but I'm overweight and I have wide hips to boot. I know I could be doing more to pass, but that's not what I really, really want at the end of the day. I just want to feel comfortable in the body I have right now. I want androgyny and I want to be cute, but I'm not either of those things, really. Just dumpy and feminine with a beard and wide hips. 

Anyways. 

I was at a party and this drunk guy ""just had to ask"" how I identify, and I wasn't feeling that kind of conversation at a fucking party with a fucking drunk guy, so I just said ""masculine"". He was blown away. Couldn't believe it. Was worried I'd bite his head off if he called me a man.

Like... I guess he figured I was mtf instead? Which should flatter or comfort me, maybe, I guess--but it doesn't. He still clocked me, and he still had to ask what fucking time is. At a party. Where I'm just trying to enjoy myself. I had introduced myself as my sisters ""brother"" very clearly earlier and his surprised reaction should've tipped me off that he'd get weird about it later. 

I'm visibly queer so I guess I just have to prepare to deal with this shit for the rest of my life huh? I have to be patient and nice about my answers too or I risk being shit on.

How do you cope? How do you deal with your existence being questioned every day? I'm so tired of being watched and causing confusion everywhere I go just by being there. I'm so tired of being asked to explain my gender or my journey.

At work, I've had people ask how long I've been on hormones. What my journey was like. Those I could mostly deal with and smile through, but then one of my managers has started asking to buy my T because he thinks it'll help him not lose his hair and build muscle... Or something... And I just. I'm so tired. How the fuck do I even begin to approach someone higher up with this. My word against his, even though he's asked five times. He'll say it's a joke even though we both know it's not.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. I wish I could just wear a full body cloak but even then my voice would be questioned lol. There's just no fucking winning. Does anyone have any advice?"	"I’m sorry that I don’t have much advice - more of a support post here. I hear how hard it is to be gender diverse and I understand very much. All of my life I didn’t have the courage you do to just be authentically me. I was always trying to still pass as a binary gender to cloak myself from the bullying and pain I experienced around gender in my younger years. But, I have finally embraced the truth that I am non-binary and mostly transmasc. I definitely still embrace more feminine qualities of mine but I lean more masc of center. Either way, this body I inherited from the AFAB’s in my family is as curvy as they come. I have yet to put in the effort to work out on T to try and make my shape less female appearing. I don’t know if I ever will because honestly, as much as it bothers me, I’m also weirdly comfortable at other times. 

As for the asshole at work trying to get you to do something illegal, I would absolutely report it if you work in a large enough company that provides an HR department and some level of protections. Legally, these protections exist if there are more than 20 people at an organization. Nobody should be allowed to do that and it isn’t related to gender. He’s asking to illegally access medication from you, period. 

My last encouragement is that you might benefit from having a trans-ally therapist. Some of your experiences (and ours as trans folks) get heavy and it never hurts to have someone to process it with who is trained and safe to share with. There are several online options now for companies who provide access to LGBTQ allied therapists.

Sending you love ✌🏼
Thank you my friend, it means a lot just knowing I'm not alone. I work for a big enough place I should be protected, we just don't have an HR department lmao. Thank you so much for your words and time and kindness"	ox2fhw	NonBinary	5	0.79	2021-08-03 12:27:59
Gender Marker ?	If I could change my gender marker to X I'm not sure I would do it. I would be extra worried about discrimination since you can't really go stealth. Especially if I was handing my license to a cop or something. I would be fine keeping my gender marker as is, especially because changing it seems really complicated/expensive/stressful. However, thanks to HRT I don't really look/sound like my AGAB anymore and I'm worried that's going to get me in even more trouble. I am nonbinary tho and I wouldn't want to switch it to the other binary. Is there any way to win here? What have you done?	I can definitely understand matching your gender marker to what most people assume to avoid discrimination, totally legit decision. I'm AMAB and planning to get an F because I lean femme and I want that to be as obvious as possible, and I think that if I do start passing that may shift my identity further, and I don't want to potentially go through the process twice.	xxorvx	NonBinary	8	0.91	2022-10-07 03:45:51
So, is it non-binary or nonbinary without the hyphen?	"I'm an enby (which is my favorite of all the ways to say it, honestly, but a lot of people don't get that term yet), but I get super confused when I poke around the internet and some people say non-binary with a hyphen, or nonbinary without. It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things...BUT I'm a published fiction writer and would like to know how to school my editors so that they get it right--if there is a right. And I want my work that gets out there to get it right, too. (Because that's a huge reason of why I'm writing it--representation for the win!)

So, is there a right? Or is everyone still figuring that out? Is either version okay?"	"I'm pretty sure it hasn't really been standardized yet. Personally, I go hyphenless.
I use the hyphen.
I like using nonbinary because it's just one simple word like male or female. It fits in better imo. Also typing the hyphen is extra work.
It's not totally standardised, but US english has a bias towards nonbinary, UK english has a bias to non-binary. Some people type it as ""non binary"" too.
So you're saying that there are more than two choices and all of them are valid...

Jokes aside, I tend towards non-binary grammatically, but lately end up typing nonbinary out of laziness.

Personally, I prefer enby anyway.
Thanks! I didn't know there was a geographical bias toward either one. Huh!
enby is good. 

Alternatively just tell people their minds cannot comprehend the dimensions your gender exists on. /s 
I hope that enby becomes more common. It's so much easier to say! And type!
In general the UK has more of a bias to hyphens than the US for many words, this being just one example. 
A very valid explanation, haha!"	agvbws	NonBinary	8	1.0	2019-01-17 07:25:12
Who wins when I have my period?	"I'm happily child free. I have no dreams or goals of carrying my own child ever.

Someone explain to me how it's to my benefit that I have a period every month/two months that is debilitating and emotionally draining. I don't want to call it dysphoria because I don't think that's it, but I have a deep feeling of being disgusted and feeling like some kind of imposter every time my period starts.

I don't want to birth kids myself due to a legitimate fear of what pregnancy can do to my body. Why must I continue birth control until I'm like 30 or have 2 kids when I KNOW I'd much rather foster or adopt.


I know r/childfree has links to help with this but I've hadn't luck. I feel like my status of non-binary would be fully true if I couldn't get pregnant. This is just my personal feelings bout myself. I'm not saying everyone needs to get sterilized to be ""truly"" Non-binary, but for myself I feel it would close a final chapter of me being Tayler the woman vs just Tayler

Am I alone in this feeling? Do I simply just hate my period so much that I've attached it to being Non-binary? What do you humans think?"	"I know that getting sterilized was absolutely one of the best steps towards feeling secure in my non-binary identity that I have taken. I still get my periods, and feel like an imposter when I do, but knowing that I can't get pregnant definitely helps with that. Solidarity hugs, if you want them.
Others' MMV, but Essure and Novasure *absolutely* set my AFAB-self free. Living with the ever-present threat of my own fertility and a schedule-defying but consistently heavy menstrual cycle was seventeen years of wholly unnecessary hell, even before I realised somewhere along the way that I was nonbinary.
BuT wHaT iF yOu ChAnGe YoUr MiNd

Seriously though, I don’t see the point in continuing to have periods also
You are not at all alone in this, I had my first period in years unexpectedly this last month and it was dreadful. It solidified my want for a hysterectomy as well. 

I am curious why you don't think it's dysphoria related, but of course you know yourself best. But there is something to be said about searching for a hysterotomy as a gender affirming surgery instead of a sterilizing one, some folks have an easier time that way, and it's the route I plan on going just because of my transition.
I would love them. 

My S/O is on the fence about kids so I've made the choice that if I did get snipped ""as a woman"" I'd get some eggs harvested and pay for a bio woman to carry my kids (though the idea of an infant scares me)

My mom had her tubes tied after I was born and still gets a period so a full removal is ideal but I know unlikely, at least getting pregnant wouldn't be an issue and that's my second best plan but I know mmaannyy doctors don't support a hysterectomy on someone who is 21. I'd be willing to take hormones to balance out the issues I may have, but if I'm not having a period that would be a win even if I need a shot to keep me from suffering from early menopause
I know birth control is an imperfect solution, but if you're willing to take hormones to deal with the problem anyway, why not start taking bc continuously? I do and haven't had a period in years.
My birth control doesn't stop my period unfortunately, I'm looking into other options to get it to hopefully stop but the goal is to just get it all out
Hope it works out for you"	jhcq61	NonBinary	6	0.8	2020-10-24 17:19:33

I corrected my mom about pronouns for the very first time! Such euphoria!!	"I just wanted to share a huge win for me: in the last week I was gendered correctly by strangers and it gave me the strength to advocate for myself to my mom!

On Wednesday I was gendered correctly twice by complete strangers. I cried after the second time because that’s never happened for me before. It felt so good and validated the choices I’m making in terms of my social transition.

Because of the strength and affirmation of my self image that came from that I was able to correct my mom about pronouns for the first time on Sunday. Her initial response was “well, I’m just not going to do that. I’ll giggle every time”

But instead of crumbling like I usually do I was able to hold my ground and tell her “ok so giggle then. Practice using my pronouns when I’m not here, you need to try. I need you to try, I need you to do this”

I was able to explain to her why, how it’s about my comfort and being treated the way I want&need and not about her comfort.

It was terrifying but such a huge relief to be able to do it, and I think for the first time since coming out to her she actually heard me/internalized the fact that this is something she has no choice but to work on.

The next day ANOTHER stranger gendered me correctly! I know not every week will be this good, and the work around pronouns with my mom will be long and painful, but I am trying to let the good things in when they happen so I wanted to celebrate this with all of you 💖"		oo8c6h	NonBinary	6	0.88	2021-07-20 18:46:54
Scared to ask parents for a binder.	I asked my parents if I could go bald. They said that everyone at school would bully me, I‘d look ugly, lose my friends, and my mom said I need to be a girl, and that I’m never going to a boy, even though I’m nb. All of that left me feeling even more ashamed about who I am. I’ve even considered cutting my own hair, before realizing how dumb it would look. I’ve been begging them, but I just gave up after my mom just got annoyed. After all that, I’m pretty sure my parents will never buy me a binder. I’m scared they will find out what it’s really meant for. I’ve been thinking about just saying it’s a bra, or even a sports bra. But then again, binders aren’t that cheap, and they would probably just buy me a bra from the store. Also I would have to either ask my dad or brother to buy me it. That is so awkward to think about. But I don’t know who to ask, or if I should even ask. I need someone’s help. Also happy new year everyone. It’s 3:49 am for me rn. Stayed up watching memes and there was this lady saying “subway surfers for the win mother EFFERS!” and tried to keep my laugh through my nose? (If you know what I mean.) And I had to bite my tongue, cause I was afraid my mom would hear me like I swear, it’ll be like 1 am or so and I will think I’m safe, so I’ll just turn over in the bed and she will hear me cause of the freaking squeaky bed. But um I kinda got off track and that was totally unrelated, so yeah but yeah anyway any advice would be appreciated sorry sorry	"You know what - this doesn't solve the basic problem that's with all of what you wrote (namely, your parents not being supportive and emotionally pressuring you and all of the other things that are wrong here) - but for solving your current problem, I'm going to buy you that binder. I just ordered mine a few days ago, I'm 32 years old and just now thought of buying one instead of being annoyed by my body shape - I'm so happy for you that you are able to reflect how you feel and what you would want to try to feel better with yourself in that young age (at least I assume you're a bit younger because of having to ask your parents), you truly deserve that. Hit me up with a DM, we'll talk about how to make it happen.
Have a lovely new year!
I havent tried it but the underworks makes a sports bra called the 'magic cotton sports bra' or something like that. Its supposed to be almost as good as a binder but is definitely advertised as a good sports bra. There are also lists of giveaways and crowd funds on the internet for binders if you look them up.

If you can save up cash over time you could maybe ask a friend with a debit card or a friends parent to make the purchase. Buy a visa gift card from a grocery store and ship the binder somewhere other than home?
I’ll contribute if you want. I want to help other kiddos feel comfortable on their own skin. My kiddo likes their binders from spectrum outfitters.

Anyone know of a good website for binders?	"I'm recently out to friends and family as agender and using they/them pronouns (Even one of my best friends who is super conservative supports me, which is a huge relief. Friendship over politics for the win!) and I'm hopefully gonna get a job soon where my sister works, she's leaving the first of July. (They can't allow relatives to work at the same place at the same time, weird I know.) One of my first big purchases I'd want to make is a binder, as I get fluctuating chest dysphoria. Sometimes I'm fine, other times it gets really bad, hence why I'd rather not get top surgery if I don't have to, I hate hospitals and am... Pretty poor.

I'm a bigger dude, about 2x in men's clothing and 3x in women's. I was wondering if there were any reliable websites for binders that also tailor to plus sizes? I'd also hope they'd be relatively affordable, not super high end. Thank you for reading and any help!"	"GC2B!!
i got mine from gc2b and i really like it! another reputable brand is underworks. shapeshifters makes custom made-to-order binders if you can't fine your size in the others, but is a little more pricey. good luck!
gc2b is run by trans people, so I always recommend them, but some folx prefer underworks
GC2B doesn't work great for me as a big guy (size 16, I get so much spilling out the arm holes no matter what). I used to use Underworks and they were better for being fat and having a bigger chest but they hurt my back. I've never used a Shapeshifters binder but a lot of bigger people recommend them because they're custom."	bwuboy	NonBinary	8	0.9	2019-06-04 21:26:53
Hi, my name's Rowan, and my pronouns are they/her!	"AAAAARGH!! I'm sorry, the gender euphoria is strong here. I'm not out to my family yet, but I'm working on it. It just feels so amazing to finally have a name!

For some reason, I thought picking a name would be like that scene in Harry Potter where he gets his wand from Ollivander's, and everything's glowing and Mr Ollivander says 'you are destined for great things. He did great things too. Terrible things, yes...but great.' Off topic, sorry.

This post is just me gushing and being so happy now, but I wanted to know how you guys picked your names? I did a hunger games simulator, Rowan didn't win, but I knew I wanted it to win, so I chose it.

I stood up for myself twice yesterday	"I’m 33 and out, though I suspect I just fly under the radar as a queer intellectual with a metalhead sense of fashion. My pinned post on Twitter is about being trans and my pronouns are in my bio as well as my Zoom username and professional email signature.

I was interviewed about my work for a podcast. Our contact was through Twitter and the recording was through Zoom. The podcast will publish our episode in a few weeks, but the cartoonist who does a quick sketch of each speaker worked on me already and the podcast put it on their Twitter as a promo. I was clearly and embarrassingly encoded as my AGAB. 

I gave it the night to think about whether I was being too sensitive and then messaged in the morning that it wasn’t all right. This is my professional image, after all. I had no idea what to expect and braced to have my interview binned, but the host apologised and had the cartoonist do a second sketch that was far more accurate, right away. Wahoo! 

Still wondering if it was somehow my fault for not being more obvious about being nonbinary/agender, I went to a work conference for women and nonbinaries over Zoom. Not only was this a legitimately progressive space, I wasn’t even the only one with they/them in their username. 

As an icebreaker we were paired off to interview someone new and then introduce them to the rest of the group. Asking about pronouns was part of this exercise, even. My counterpart and I have a nice chat in the breakout room and then she presents me to the rest of the group: ‘*This is Cúglas, she uses they/them pronouns, she’s been a part of the company for [X] years...*’ 

I wince every time but no one says anything. The facilitator is a trans woman and I wonder if she’s going to say anything but I think everyone was just too polite at the beginning of a two-day workshop to interrupt. Or maybe no one noticed? Real blow to my gender identity. 

During the first break I reach out to my counterpart via direct chat and politely point out that she misgendered me throughout. She apologised and said to stop and correct her next time. I don’t want to be That Guy but I guess I have to advocate, even in a space explicitly for gender minorities? Call it a win and a half-win. 

Should I say anything to the facilitator?"		m5f4h7	NonBinary	6	1.0	2021-03-15 07:15:53
Feeling really dysphoric and I hate it	"Hi all you lovely peeps,

Just need some virtual hugs from internet strangers right now. I’m feeling super dysphoric and it’s killing me. 

I’m not out to anyone but two of my closest friends because I’m still figuring this out and don’t want to tell people at work or like people who I’m not 100% close to before I’m sure (and I don’t really have a lot of friends other than those two lol). It’s really rough because I only really hang out with one of those two friends at a time (introverts and pandemic for the win I guess) so I don’t really ever hear them call me “them” and every time I think of myself as female (I’m afab) it just destroys me a little. 

But at the same time I’m originally from a culture where there’s no gender neutral pronouns (living in an English speaking country now but my whole family and a lot of childhood friends are still there) so there’s no way for me to be non binary at home and it just feels like if I can’t be myself in my original culture then why do I even bother? I’ll always be female to most of the important people in my life anyway so it just doesn’t matter. Even if I tried to explain it to them I doubt most of them would understand, they’d try to accept me but definitely feel weird about it and they’d still have to call me “she” anyway because “they” just doesn’t exist. 

Can someone just give me a hug and make me feel a little less sad about this?"	"*virtual hugs*

I'm here. and I'm with you <3
*virtual hugs*

Plz know that I be here and that I care :]
Thank you ❤️

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.

There's no reason to use his/her here. Just use their. It's inclusive. :)
Nice survey, it seems very thorough. I've completed it, I have no idea how I missed it since I'm active on samplesize too


I completely missed this in that measure! It's not too late, I can go in and change that wording. Thank you for letting me know, no one else has caught I didn't fix that from the original scale wording! \~Eleanor
Thank you for taking the survey! \~ Eleanor
I left some other feedback in the field at the end of the survey. Hope it helps :)

Pride month W (? If you can call it that, it definitely feels like it to me :))	"I just really want to express how happy I am right now, in full, out somewhere. I don’t care where. I wish I could scream from the rooftops rn. I feel like I’ve finally come to complete terms with me being non-binary. I thought I was a trans male for 4 ish years, I realized I didn’t really think it fit me and I just decided to present as female for the past 3 years (still questioning my identity but unsure), and now I’ve come back around to thinking I’m non-binary. I’ve been having a hard time as of late, I told my boyfriend 2 weeks ago about this. He took a week to process it but I genuinely thought we were going to break up, because he said he wouldn’t even call me my preferred name or pronouns, but he finally came around when he realized this was so important to me, I cried so hard and had to call in from work or else I would sit there and cry while doing my job. I was so happy I cried when I heard my name come from his mouth, he’s even given me a nickname. He still doesn’t understand and I really don’t expect him to, I don’t expect not to go through this without slip ups, but just the validation of not having to hide myself for any longer than I have (we’ve been dating 2 and a half years) makes me feel so weightless, I have no weight crushing me anymore. I’ve already told work informally but I’m not sure if I wish to go forward with changing my name tag at work. I also came out to my best friend and she’s had no problem calling me my preferred name.
The second hurdle though would be any immediate family. I live with my grandparents. My grandpa I don’t talk to because he’s technically not related to me and due to other problems I really am not close to him at all, but I’ve been close with my grandma for as long as I can remember, I was always her favorite (sorry, everyone else related to me in the impossible chance that someone I know would somehow identify me LMAO). I lived with my grandma during my phase of thinking I was a trans male. I never formally brought it up, my mom had always scared me into believing that if I had mentioned to my grandma that I am bisexual or non-binary that she would kick me out of the house. My grandma was definitely aware that this was happening during high school, I cut my hair, I have several things from high school that stated my preferred name at the time, and I wore boyish clothes. In fact most of these things that I have that state my old preferred name are hanging on the walls right now, the few awards I did receive during school or anything like that, she doesn’t hide them. I had recently come out to her as bisexual, and it was funny, because all my grandma said was that she always kinda knew. I had told her that when mentally I was spiraling that it was about telling my boyfriend that I was bisexual and him not accepting it because I honestly wasn’t sure if I wanted to tell my grandma. But tonight after work I had explained it to her. I gave her the same conditions that I had given my boyfriend, I don’t really care or mind if you slip up. And for her especially (because I imagine it’s a bit more difficult to change what you call someone if you’ve known that person for 20 years as in comparison to my bf only knowing me for 2 and a half), I don’t mind if she doesn’t change what she calls me. Being female presenting regardless of what I do will always grate on my brain but I’ve accepted by now that just because someone else doesn’t understand or perceive you as you wish, that doesn’t mean that you have to hide yourself to fit their expectations. But in reverse, that does mean in other contexts I won’t put up with blatant misgendering either. For my grandma, I’m really just happy that it’s finally off my shoulders even if it means nothing changes. She said that she probably won’t remember the name I chose, but it is a pretty name. I consider this a win in my book. Not the most ideal, fairy tale ending where everyone just calls me my preferred name and pronouns with no mistakes and no problems, but it’s a whole lot better than continuing hiding and feeling like no one will ever accept me unless I fit into the female box, and I’m so grateful that it’s not as bad as me getting kicked out of the house or being disowned by my family. My phone has been slowing down tremendously so I have nothing further to say. Just so glad to share things with whoever finds this post at whatever obscure time of night it is :)"	I’d say that’s a W for sure! That’s amazing!	v6md6r	NonBinary	4	0.84	2022-06-07 04:23:36
Coming Out and Being More Gender Non-conforming.	"So I have only identified this way, generally nb (amab) (same as sexually I just identify as queer), for like almost 2 months (im a baby, I know).
But I still live at home, and am not out to family, and wanna start being a bit more 'adventurous' in my personal appearance. 
Any pointers on how to do this subtily do this without fully outting myself until I feel ready?

At the same time, my hair is a mess, and my Mum is getting married soon, so I need to get a haircut and wanna get a side undercut, long on top kinda thing done. She said she is ok with it, as long as I show her reference pics of what I want before I get it done, so she can ok it. #win 

Also, as an unemployed person, I need to stay presentable and not 'weird' (for lack of a better term). I also have to do placement at a school soon for college, and again, I need to stay school presentable and employable, which I think the hair will be. And Im still happy to go shirt and slacks for work, for the mean time. So no real stress there, appearance-wise..."	"What about jewelry? You can sometimes find really cool pieces at thrift and antique stores, and it can be a fun outing with friends. I also like to diy bracelets and necklaces; you could possibly come up with the excuse that you’re making gifts for female acquaintances or family members?

And as far as clothes, I’m a big fan of longline shirts and jackets. For example, I’ve got a hooded cardigan from forever 21 men’s that goes past my hips and makes me feel very andro, especially when pairing it with  leggings/skinny jeans and combat boots 😎
I'm embracing my other side more carefully, I'm out and proud but I'm still aware of how people may treat us. So I started with small things too: soft pink nail polish, I've always liked makeup so I use foundation daily and recently add some contouring and highlighting. You almost can't notice it, but for me is satisfyingly goood! As for clothes since it's summer here I'm abusing of short shorts and I have just ordered my first skirt! I've used top cropped before. And I started buying pink clothes that I don't even like because the Minister of Human Rights said ""boy wears blue and girl wear pink"" so now I tend to mix both. 

I know you're still young and you depend on your family, but they can not define who you are and the way you are born to be. 
I wouldnt even know where to start with jewellery tbh. And I would just be so worried of losing it. (Im that kinda person)

I do like longtime stuff, and would live a long cardi. And been thinking about leggings, though there is the issue of the front that kinda worries me... hahaha. 
Atm, me aim is to try to dress like a lesbian and see where that gets me... hahaha.
Aussie here, so yeah, summering it up. :P
I dont rely on my family, really. Only for housing, and kinda food... And they wont really give a shit when I tell them, its just finding the right time to tell them. I wanna do it soon, I think, but I cant overshadow the wedding, so idk, ill figure it out. 

Nail polish is a great idea. Thx. 
Not sure im ready to adventure into skirts yet. Wore one in HS as a joke, and actually liked it.
But also have a very masc beard that is staying, so I dont feel the two mix too well.... hahaha. 
As for pink shirts, thats something thats ive gotten back into, and hoping to find some cute light purples, just being a colour I like. 
I was thinking about makeup, but my skin is just kinda too eww to wanna bother, and I dont really wanna have to cover up my freckles. 
Maybe if I was going to a party or something... idk. But yeah, thanks a heap. 
Oh man yeah losing jewelry can be a pain especially if you’re absentminded like me ! Haha

I’m personally in the “leggings aren’t pants” camp so I rarely wear them unless my shirt/jacket/whatever covers my butt :P

Oh and re: dressing like a lesbian, maybe try some women’s flannel/buttoned shirts? A lot of men’s and women’s items can *look* unisex and yet the cut of the item can make a big difference with euphoria/dysphoria, even if there is little to no visual difference to the casual observer
Maybe some like eyeliner or something... 
Just something to take it up/ down a notch a bit... hmm, got me thinking...
I am as absentminded as they come some times. 
My parents hate me for it (but also love me for it. :P )

Oooo good point on leggings. Hmm. That might be an adventure I partake in, come winter. Kinda excited tbh. 

Woman's top sizings a real weird on me, and I kinda hate it, as they just get wider and wider, and I end up wearing a tent. Plus, there are some really cute things I wanna buy/ wear. 
Tall, wide shoulders, but 'fit' 'guy', so yeah, sucks to be me....

Leggings are also great from layering under baggy sweatpants if it’s REALLY cold! (Idk where you live though)

You wanna give me some of that shoulder width? 😅😂
Aussie, so its never THAT cold. Down south, maybe, if of an evening or night. But also, my family love their heating at home, and Im happy with just an extra blanket or two. 

Kinda using it all atm, unfortunately. Sorry. :P"	afrt0c	NonBinary	3	0.67	2019-01-14 03:56:04

How do I explain myself	"Hi there,
I changed my name about three years ago and everyone in my family (barring my Grandma but she's got late stage dementia so I make an exception for her because I love her and don't want to confuse her) has made the change and seem fine with it. I came out as gay the year before that and even my family members that I thought were more conservative were fine with it.
I came out as non binary just over a month ago. My dad (who I've always viewed as more conservative) was pretty supportive in his own way. He's very much of the view that its nobody's business what you do behind closed doors. He said a similar thing when I came out as gay, but did support me going to pride with my then girlfriend so it doesnt feel like he's pushing me back in the closet, as that phrase can sometimes feel. He's VERY particular about the English language (we're British and he hates it when I accidentally use American pronunciation...my generation says schedule the American way, even the BBC use that way now!) and insists that they/them is plural. I've heard him use it singular (""someone left their waterbottle""), and I know I can make that point, but I've decided to save it for another day. In terms of me wanting to change how I look (I'm AFAB and overweight so I have plenty of curves), he's been pretty supportive and tries to help me get over my fear of presenting more masculine where I live (which is so conservative it took them 3 years AFTER gay marriage was legalised to fly the pride flag in June). So he's not completely there, but he's most of the way which I count as a win.
My mum also said supportive things when I came out. She's not so picky about the English language so understood that they/them can be singular so I did ask her to use my correct pronouns. She told my step dad and said afterwards he was fine with it, although he later pointed out that I probably wont hear him using my pronouns because we tend to use names when the person is in the room. Sort of true, but also not really. We do use pronouns once we've established who we're talking about.
I have never heard either of them use my correct pronouns.
My mum has an interesting history; she grew up in a very backwards part of the country and worked in STEM all her life. Her parents were more forward thinking and brought her up pretty gender neutral. She's had many comments all her life about how she wasnt very feminine and always responded that whoever made the comment had a narrow view of femininity. She sees herself as *her name*, a human being, before her gender.
I made myself a shirt today and asked her opinion; I've always done this as she has a fantastic eye for clothes. It's my first time making the pattern and I didn't know if it was the right size (yes I followed the measurements for my size but it was a big 4 pattern with HUGE amounts of ease) or if it was gender-neutral enough. She responded with her history (as I've already explained) and a bit of a rant, which made me feel like somehow I was offending her by choosing to not identify as a woman?
It really upset me so I left the room and made lunch (she can get rant-y when she's hungry) as I thought that would help. After lunch I said I'd like to respond to our earlier conversation and she said she thought it would be something we would reflect on and probably come back to several times. This makes me feel like she wants me to change my mind?
I don't really know how to explain myself to her...any tips?
(I am an adult but currently living with my mum and step dad due to mental health issues.)

TLDR: My mum is pretty gender neutral in her approach to life but seems to be having problems with me not identifying as a woman?"	"mmm i dunno if my mom is the same way but yeah she's also very gender neutral but feminist due to working in sexism in STEM fields and her family. ive told her about the fact that i feel the same way she does but never used the actual word non-binary but generally saying that being gender neutral is ""*technically* under the trans umbrella"", and ""*technically* lgbtqia"" and she seemed ok with it. she sees herself and me as women because that's how society treats us. the thing is, i don't really disagree with her and still say i'm female but dress however i want and dont care about pronouns or anything so yeah. i don't really have any advice, but i mean you're definitely not alone by any means in this."	oyi1vh	NonBinary	5	0.86	2021-08-05 13:55:20

Psychological flexibility is the ability to stay in contact with the present moment and behave based on personal values regardless of any unpleasant thoughts, feelings, or memories we experience. Psychological flexibility can be increased by participation in a therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).

Afraid to come out to family	"My parents are very religious (Evangelical Baptist) and while my mom tries to act accepting of trans and gay ppl, she doesn’t put much effort into even really trying to understand at all (she’s one of those “agree to disagree/live and let live” types) - my dad however is vocally transphobic and regularly misgenders my nonbinary partner without any remorse or attempt to change. 

I’ve recently come to realize that I’m also trans and nonbinary. I’ve started going by a different name with friends and changing my presentation. My next steps are talking to a doctor about maybe starting hrt, and making plans for my official name change. ….but… I’m afraid to do those things because they would mean having to come out to my family. That, or I would have to live a life were they’re only in part of it at best. None of it at worst….

My older sister tried to get my parents to agree to call her by a different variation of her given name, back about 15 years ago or so. It was a giant fight that my sister never did win. Dad still calls her by her full given name no matter how angry she gets about it. She didn’t even come out as a whole other gender, just a name change. My dad also started emphatically repeating “you’re a BOY! A BOY! Never anything else.” To my nephew from the day he was born. 

I don’t know if there IS a way I can come out to them without everything blowing up. But if anyone has some advice on ways I could go about this, I’d really appreciate it. I’m thinking about writing a letter. It doesnt seem quite right though…"	"One piece of advice, write or type out what you want to say, read it once a day at least three times.  This will help you set the tone and wording. Even if you want to talk with them in person about being non binary, it will help focus your thoughts.
From the sound of it, living a life where they're only in part of it or not at all doesn't sound bad... I understand your perspective is different because of your history with them, but they're not people of common decency & at the VERY least that's something that you deserve. I'm not sure that continuing to have them in your life would bring any joy or love at all, because they have shown time and time the kind of people that they are & it's not even close to support. Unfortunately they're much better at hating than loving. I want you to live a life where you're surrounded by love and support. <3
I think regardless of how I come out to them or if I even officially come out to them at all…. There’s a large chance it will drive a wedge between us. Either the tension will be too much, or I’ll have to create distance for myself and cut contact at least mostly… 

It breaks my heart. As flawed as they are, I love my parents. I love my grandparents and my aunts and uncles, who I only have contact with through my parents right now. And anticipating this change feels like anticipating a death."	yp8f3y	NonBinary	5	0.85	2022-11-08 02:19:42
xpost from trans - brother kicked me out at 12am leaving me crying on the street	"t/w intense, violent, and almost sexual assault but more intimidation 

For one I am safe now and waiting for a flight home, so I'm okay.

I still can't fucking believe what happened last night. I visited my brother in Portland and was staying at his place, and then he kicked me out at 12am after drinking, right into the street where people shoot up and I have no idea where I really am or the area, just know that from what he said that some places a couple blocks away are dangerous to be there at night. He wouldn't even let me use the bathroom before he kicked me out. He told me to piss in the street.

My brother is such a fucking hypocrite. He claims he's a communist and cares about all the homeless people, all the disadvantaged minorities, literally telling me that day how hard this one homeless guy has it. Then he decides to kick his trans sibling out at 12am crying, trying to make me go through what he acted so compassionate about.

I was begging him to at least let me spend the night so I can figure out how to fly home and not be stuck out on the street at night. He was telling me no, that I'm a pussy bitch, to get the fuck out. I was asking him to at least let me use the bathroom. He told me to piss in the street. I was fucking crying and shaking, had a bit to drink and now I'm stuck out in the street with no idea where I fucking am with a backpack and suitcase.

He was yelling at me earlier in the day. He gets obsessed with communism, but he's got some fucking weird extreme views that I argue with him about, like how he thinks Russia is defensively invading Ukraine, that they're actually Nazis, that they want to be a part of Russia. He gets really intense about it when I tell him Russia invaded Ukraine. He gets super defensive about Russia for some reason, and is pretty tanky about it all, thinking dictators are not that bad. I try to avoid this stuff because he gets too intense but he thinks it's like the best thing and healthy to have political discourse. Definitely not the way HE does it though. After a bit of arguing I leave to pee and he starts punching his punching bag super hard.

He was getting so intense about it it almost seemed like he wanted to fight me. At this point I was already scared he'd get violent and he was sober. This is a big middle aged straight cis white dude who is actually fucking dangerous and really good at jiu jitsu and muay Thai and knows it.

He was acting violent that day. Someone stole his skateboard at some point a while ago and he was watching people skate by trying to see if it was his board, telling me he'd beat their ass. Two homeless guys almost got in a fight and he ran up to ""de-escalate it"", but I could tell he almost wanted to fight and show off. He'd kick someone's ass easy. I was telling him he shouldn't do that, he could get stabbed, it was dangerous and some guy is going to feel a lot more threatened if he has another tall looming muscular white dude looking over him, that he could make shit worse. He starts calling me a pussy when I try to tell him that he shouldn't do that. Acts like he's some vigilante hero when it's more like he wants to kick someone's ass and dominate the situation.

It was his birthday and I took him out to a couple bars. He gets too drunk. I'm telling him to slow down. He used to be a bit more crazy and start bar fights, then someone kicked his ass and after that he learned BJJ. I get worried but then it gets real fucking ugly. He start borderline hitting on these young girls standing in lines at the club, not really able to articulate, but scaring the fuck out of them. I try to pull him away, he keeps fucking with random people acting like a drunk idiot.

It was around now I'm just pissed off. I call him out on it. I call him a fucking hypocrite, that he acts like he cares about all these disadvantaged people yet he starts hitting on some young black girl scaring her. I tell him that he acts like he's so socially conscious yet throws his cishet white privilege way in a dangerous and violent way, that it's the most basic fucking respect for someone to not scare them, that this young black girl doesn't deserve to feel like she's in danger, that that is the most BASIC thing he could do if he really cared about how it is for people.

He starts getting real fucking gross now. He tells me how dominating girls makes them WET. He tells me they want this. He tells me that it turns them on and acts super macho. I tell him that that's rapey as fuck, that he isn't having sex with them, that they didn't consent to being dominated at all. He acts like he's some super macho god that can do whatever the fuck he wants and own the street, and at the most basic level that is the white power shit that is dangerous. Knowing you could just walk up to a young black girl and hit on her and scare her and get away with it thinking it's a turn on, knowing he could get into a fight and win, knowing that if cops show up he's the big white dude who wouldn't get in trouble for sexual assault. He gets super offended that I called him rapey, that I called him out on his hypocrisy. He's calling me a pussy for saying that if there was a civil war and the alt right fought that I'd run. He tells me yeah I'm trans but I'm a pussy, that I don't know shit, that I'm a little bitch. I'm trying to tell him this violence is the fucking problem, that he's imposing himself on others as some cis het white privileged dude in very direct and dangerous way and he just keeps getting more and more mad at me.

We go back to his place and that's when he starts telling me I'm stupid and a pussy bitch, that I'm basically the problem for not wanting to be in a violent revolution, that I was a pussy for not getting involved with two homeless dudes fighting, that I'm acting like a bitch, and that I need to get the fuck out and that he doesn't trust me. I'm begging to let me sleep to the morning so we can talk in the morning and he's like no get the fuck out now. I beg to be able to use the bathroom at least and he says to piss on the street.

At this point I'm shaking, crying and literally just scared he might kick my ass. I'm scrambling for my wallet and passport trying to pack as quickly as possible, telling him that he says he cares about how hard it is for those homeless people but in the end he told me to stay at his place and now he's throwing his transgender sibling out into the street in a city I don't know, at 12am, right where people fucking shoot up heroin, fucking terrified that I might have to sleep in the street, might get robbed, scared. I'm calling my wife crying asking her to see if she can find a hotel, that I have no idea what to do. I'm practically praying to god, drunk in the street with luggage, praying that I'll be safe and find a place to stay

I end up getting REALLY lucky. One hotel said that they had a room and that I was lucky, and they usually wouldn't. They tell me I'm super lucky I was able to get an Uber at 2am to even get there. I'm crying and tipsy drunk and finally manage to get there and crash and I'm just so fucking thankful that didn't have to sleep on the street, that I didn't get robbed.

My brother is texting me telling me he loves me, that he wouldn't have done that if he thought I'd be in danger, and then starts swearing at me telling me I'm acting like a bitch. I wake up and no apology. I thought he'd at least sober up and realize what he'd done. I was telling him crying last night that I'm his only family and he's going to hate himself for what he's done. He is separating from his wife and moved to Portland and I was going there to support him, and now he's literally just fucking throwing me out into the street. He didn't even apologize, just asked me if I wanted to pick up what I left and he'd leave it outside, or to ship it. I just say ship it and that's the last I heard from him.

I found a same day flight. I'm going home soon. I'm comfortable in a hotel room and safe and I am so fucking thankful for that. I was fucking terrified, of him, and of what he was throwing me into. I just fucking don't understand the hypocrisy of it all. He acts like such a huge ally, talks about how dangerous it is to be in the street, talks about how bad minorities have it, then he terrifies a young black woman who couldn't do anything about it, acts like some super powerful white man that can do whatever he wants, talks about how it makes them wet to be dominant like that.

He fucking acts like an ally to LGBT and homeless people then throws his trans family right into the fucking street at 12am to literally piss in the street and tells me how he's not worried about me, right after telling me how dangerous it is for them and where I was especially. He says shit like power to the people then throws all of his privilege around in violent and terrifying ways, acts like some egotistical white god that can do whatever he wants and control all these situations he's not involved in, that other people don't want him involved in.

He fucking scares me. He is violent and highly fucking trained in martial arts. And he knows it. And he thinks he has a right to do whatever because he can't get fucked with. He literally terrifies me. I've never seen this before. I had only reconnected recently and he wasn't like this before. I don't know what the fuck happened. I think it's mental illness.

He hasn't really done anything explicitly illegal, but he intimidated this girl regardless and his reasoning was very fucking rapey even if he didn't say anything sexual to her. He hasn't started throwing punches, but he puts himself in situations where he'd have an excuse to. I never want to see him again. I don't feel safe around him, and I'm not. I learned that last night, crying, holding my luggage trying to desperately find somewhere to go.

I'm just glad I'm safe and I can get home. Our family situation was pretty abusive and he was one of the only family members I grew up with that I still kept in contact with and felt comfortable telling I'm trans. Now I see that this ally shit is just fucking ego and not real, that at the most basic level he will hurt a trans person and make them experience homelessness, and not give a shit. And he doesn't even have being drunk as an excuse.

I'm sorry I've been crying all night and day and fucking just felt so fucking scared and he was the only family I felt super close to and would say I loved the most. Now I'm just fucking terrified and want to run away."	Ugh. That's messed up. So sorry you had to endure that. You're brother sounds super toxic. Glad you're safe. So sorry you had to experience treatment like that from a family member. Nobody should have to put up with that kind of shit.	woilkq	NonBinary	5	1.0	2022-08-14 22:27:15
reconnecting win	A couple years ago I disconnected from writing because it wasn't good for my mental health (long story. ) Flash forward and I've rejoined my writing community because I miss some people on there, particularly one good friend that helped me through a lot. Turns out that friend is a nonbinary demigirl just like me and has also kind of rebranded and refocused their writing. I was so worried everyone would be mad at me for leaving/ghosting and then my first conversation on coming back was so wonderfully positive and supportive. That's my life win for the day. Lessons learned: people really do understand sometimes and sometimes more than you ever imagined.		ryqaxm	NonBinary	3	0.72	2022-01-08 03:34:16
am i enby or just failing at coping ?	"(Hi! Sorry if I don’t do some of this right I’m totally new to Reddit, but I needed advice. tw for an undetailed mention of sexual trauma)

Basically wondering if anyone has any insight as to how an afab person’s gender identity can be impacted by sex-based crimes. I (f? 18) have experienced a lot of the harassment and etc that afab girls tend to, and I just want to make sure my current gender identity crisis isn’t being impacted by my past experiences. I’d feel like the perp is “winning” if I let what happened change my identity, which is why I’m scared to question my cis girl identity any further. On the flip side, I worry that I’m trying to reclaim the very “girl-ness” that made me vulnerable. 

I also just hope it’s clear that I don’t think trauma is the root of being non-binary ! I just wanna know if I’m actually possibly enby or if my personal experiences are making me change who I am."	"I don't know if there has been research on this, my gut feeling is that your gender could not be changed by your experiences, but your gender expression can. 

I'd say go ahead and explore, it's perfectly fine to try things. Should you come to the conclusion that you are not nb, that's also cool. Allow yourself to try stuff, being wrong is okay, nobody forces you to pick an identity and then stick with it forever
Our experiences obviously aren’t exactly the same but as someone who has also had sexual trauma in my past I definitely struggled with similar feelings. I ended up taking the long road which involved me going to therapy for my trauma as like a “process of deduction”. Once I had moved far enough forward from that I still felt non-binary and at that point I just accepted it. Hope things go well both with your gender and processing your trauma <3 I know how difficult that can be.
it's always theoretically possible that our life experiences impact the gender we feel most comfortable in. but even with that in mind, so what? there's not a secret version of you wandering around in the universe that *doesn't* have these experiences that's going to come claim your body back at some nebulous point in the future. if being nonbinary makes you happy, then you should do it! if you decide later after some more therapy that you're actually cis, that's okay too! if it helps you now thats all you need.
you are all so nice thank you so much !!
Thank you so much !! I’m so glad things have gotten better for you 💖
that’s a really good point !"	kc3qjb	NonBinary	4	0.84	2020-12-13 03:57:03
I chose a placeholder name and apparently it was deemed ‘unacceptable’	"So I chose to go by my last name for college because it would be simple and it matches what would be used in a professional setting for what I’m going into. I have always hated my middle name and I have recently been uncomfortable with my first in most situations (even outside of gender it was a stressor for me at times since I’ve always had to correct people on pronunciation), so it seemed like the next available thing and it worked.

It worked too well though? Like, I legit like my last name for my first in a pretty much permanent scenario? It’s neutral and feels pretty natural. I even thought of alternative last names and I’m pretty sure of what I would change my middle to.
One of my siblings says they could get used to the idea, another said they didn’t care but to keep them informed, but the the last said they could Never call me it. 
They all would likely not be keeping it as their last names in the event of marriage, so I don’t see it as much of an upset. In the event of me marrying (idk if I would want to) my last name would be expected to change anyway and I’ve kind of always been against letting that part of me go, so it would seem like it’s a good option! Win-win!

I’m just a little confused and torn about the one sibling since they have been instrumental in me learning to be myself and expressing myself? They’ve never even really slipped on pronouns where the others have, correcting others on it when they hear it. 
Do you think there’s a way to reason them on it? I was feeling on a high when I told them since I had already heard from the others before that and I thought it would be smooth sailing to their acceptance, but… it feels like I hit a wall of sorts"	"I'm sorry that your sibling didn't give you the reaction you were hoping for.

Maybe their reaction has to do with you changing your surname? Families can be really weird about that. My family had no issue when I changed my first name and middle name, but they got hung up on me legally changing my surname. Even outside gender issues, families can be really weird about changing last names. There are often posts on subreddits like TwoXChromosomes about families being weird about people changing or not changing their surname.
That is odd, and I'm sorry it was such a jarring experience to get that from them. Did they say why at all? I'm wondering if they have negative associations with it you're unaware of.
Maybe, but if I followed our family cis traditions then it would have changed anyway? At least like this I still keep it with me. 
I suggested that if they couldn’t then I suppose they could use the middle I chose (it would be the more masculine of the names) but they didn’t say anything on that, as if that was unheard.
I mean, they are called by their last name at work because of their organisation , but it’s set to change soon because she’s engaged. 
It’s the ‘I don’t think I could ever’ that has me reeling because that’s not even trying?? Full flat out could never. 🙁
I know it makes sense to you, and it makes sense to me too. My family had an extremely negative emotional reaction when I changed my surname, so I just wondered if perhaps it was the fact that you were changing your surname might be the reason your sibling is not supportive. My guess could be completely way off, though.
I agree, that's a very abrupt change from getting the pronouns correct and everything! It feels worth talking about with them if you're up for it, like ""when you said you'd never call me that, I felt rejected,"" and seeing what they say.
Any guess helps I s’pose. These are the only folks I’ve told about it since legally changing it seems way down on my to-do list"	t2emwl	NonBinary	4	1.0	2022-02-27 03:20:19

Creating opportunities for NonBinary poets and writers to be heard	"Dear poets and writers of r/NonBinary,

I'm from a writers’ resources company called [Winning Writers](http://www.winningwriters.com/).    Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes    underrepresented in publishing,  including (but of course not limited   to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body   positive, and \[dis\]abled. I’m  posting here specifically because our   long term goal is to change the  composition of our entry pool to   include more entries featuring diverse  characters and themes. These   voices need to be heard, and we are  actively reaching out to find them.

We are currently looking for new talent in humor poetry, short fiction and essay:

[The Wergle Flomp Humor Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/wergle-flomp-humor-poetry-contest-free)offers a first prize of $1000, a second prize of $250, and ten    honorable mentions of $100 each. Entrants are invited to submit humor    poetry on any theme. The top twelve entries will be published online.    The contest is international and the deadline is April 1.

We'll be continuing with this effort in  order  to  keep trying to get as many people into the national and   international  conversation on literature as we can.

Sometimes    when I post, there are some replies worried about a scam, so in order    to head that off I just want to say that our competitions are listed  by   The Write Life as some of the [top writing competitions out there](https://thewritelife.com/writing-contests/), and we’re in Writer’s Digest’s [top eight sites for writers](https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/top-websites-for-writers-best-publishing-marketing-resources).

I’m worried the only reason my mom “supports” me is because she’s trying to seem like a better parent than my dad	Context - both my parents are shitty and divorced. Both are very Mormon. So gay isn’t okay. My mom cried tears of sorrow when I came out to her as bi when I was 16. She was shockingly supportive when I told her my new preferred name tho. She’s been trying to win me over since I finally called her on all her bullshit and moved out. I feel like the only reason she’s being so “supportive” is to love bomb me then bring me back into the abuse cycle, then point out how unsupportive my dad is and convince me he’s terrible and I should only love and respect her. Like it’s nice not getting deadnamed but I’d rather she just not support me than fake support me to manipulate me.	"Fellow exmo here. I'm sorry, that sounds really shitty. A good parent supports you because they love you, not because they want something from you. If she really supports you, she'll eventually have an opportunity to show it by choosing that support over following what the mormon church or her peers would have her do, not just when it's easy or convenient. Until then, it's totally valid and understandable, and probably healthy even, to doubt her sincerity. If she's hurt by that, she hasn't really changed.

Remember if your family isn't what it should be you can find your own! Blood relation is meaningless without effort to actually develop a good relationship. It still hurts knowing people will choose their shitty beliefs they've been given by a shitty church over you though.

You are valid! Keep being authentically you and eventually people who appreciate you for who you are will find you"	12c8s0f	NonBinary	4	1.0	2023-04-05 04:49:17
Workplace rant (cw: misgendering and cis nonsense)	"I work at a salon and all of my coworkers are cis women. Im just so frustrated. I walked into a conversation in the break room today talking specifically that feminine people being non-binary is “confusing” and “makes no sense.” (Of course they all changed the subject when I walk in) All while they keep misgendering me day in and day out. I’m the only person who is non-binary at work and I feel so isolated and mocked….they all know that’s how I identify but they have already decided in their dumb little heads that I’m “just another one of the girls” 
It’s my job so hashing it out and trying to defend myself is an uphill battle I won’t win and won’t end up better for me in the long run….every day I feel like I’m going crazy. I wish I could be away from transphobic people permanently….but there is no such place."	Any chance you can get a job in a queer salon? The vibes of straight salons tend to be pretty toxic and awful. The only positive experiences I’ve had in salons have been queer salons. Most big cities have them, it might be worth looking into. The queer salon I go to has maybe 1 cis stylist, all the rest are trans. I’m sorry your work environment is like this. Is there anyone higher up that you trust that you can talk to about this? Who can maybe make it clear to your coworkers that they need to stop disrespecting you? Ultimately i think you’d be so much happier in a queer salon. Good luck!	xsbgff	NonBinary	4	0.84	2022-09-30 20:20:09

Help us understand how our gender and sexual identities shape us	"Hi r/NonBinary!

I’m a queer, non-binary individual from Deakin University in Australia. As part of my doctorate in clinical psychology I am exploring how specific experiences that we might have as gender and/or sexual minority individuals can influence the ways that we think about ourselves and others, and how these beliefs are linked to our psychological wellbeing. We are hoping this research will ultimately help us shape affirmative psychological therapies for LGBTQIA+ individuals. 

We are seeking participants aged 18+ of all gender and sexual identities to complete a 15-40 minute survey that explores these areas. You can enter a raffle where you have the chance to win one of three AUD$100 international gift cards (equivalent to approx. US$70). 

Here is the link to the survey: [https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV\_6ie6NICBz2s79uS](https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_6ie6NICBz2s79uS).

This research has been approved by the Deakin Human Research Ethics Committee (Project Number 2022-282), and the mods have given me permission to post in this space. Thanks for your support."	"hey, there is a slight problem. There is a question about your assigned gender at birth. In the question text-body it says:

>For some people this is the same astheir current gender identity, and for other people it is different.Often, people are assigned a gender at birth based on the primary sexcharacteristics that are visible when they are born. Why do you want to know this?

I assume the last sentence was supposed to be a link or something similar, that leads to an explenation, but that doesnt work.
This survey seems off. There are a lot of inconsistencies in grammar and the scale from true to untrue is unbalanced. I don't know how far I was through it before I changed my mind but it seemed like pretty much all of the questions were about negative traits or phrased in such a misleading way that you might put an answer the opposite of what you would intend.
Ahh thank you for the feedback - that's really helpful. There is meant to be additional information that comes up when your mouse goes over ""why we are asking this"", and I wonder if it isn't working properly across different browsers. I've made it so that the information is always visible so this isn't an issue for others. 

If you were curious, the text reads *""We are exploring the relationships between gender and how we perceive and interact with the world. For many people, the gender they were assigned at birth influenced how they were socialised as a child: people treat boys and girls differently, and this influences how we engage with our environment.""*
Thank you for your feedback. We are using standardised measures in this study which allows the findings to be related back to previous research and built upon in future work. I'm guessing that the scale you are mentioning is the YSQ-R, which measures early maladaptive schemas and can sometimes be challenging to complete. If you are interested, here are some recent papers about the [development](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00050067.2021.1979885?journalCode=rapy20) and [validity](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/3/1778) of the scale, as well as a paper that outlines [why we are looking at these constructs in this community](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03086-y). 

We are also seeking to understand factors that may be protective against poor mental health outcomes, focusing specifically on pride in one's identity and community connection (as theorised by the [Gender Minority Stress and Resilience measure](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fsgd0000081)). Additionally, we are drawing on findings that suggest [minority communities can display greater signs of flourishing](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-56597-001) and positive mental health because of their resilience and community resources, so are also measuring indicators of positive mental health as a way to examine the strengths of the community in this research. 

Please feel free to get in touch with other questions or concerns.
> If you are interested, here are some recent papers about the development and validity of the scale, as well as a paper that outlines why we are looking at these constructs in this community.

Feels weird that my in-laws have said nothing about me coming out while I’m visiting them	"Ahoy hoy. I came out a month ago on Facebook. I know my in-laws saw the post because they spoke to my cousin-in-laws about what to do. They suggested if my in-laws have any questions then ask me. I came down a few days ago and nothing has been said. I’ve walked around in a dress and nothing. 

I’ve been at the in-laws 4 days now. Feels a little weird. We did get a wedding anniversary present off them. I think they’re ok just it feels like I’m an elephant in the room. 

I’m telling myself that this is how it should feel when it’s normalised. But I worry that they have a lack of understanding and fear about how to act. I’d prefer to talk and discuss.  

We met up with the cousin-in-laws last night and the first thing they said was “Congrats” and I felt so validated and accepted. It instantly made me relax knowing I was ok there. 

I should take this as a win. They could have properly freaked out and disowned me. They have some misguided views on race and identity. So things could have been a lot worse."		pnzibw	NonBinary	4	1.0	2021-09-14 09:38:19

So i just came out as NB for the forst time	"I came out to a close friend recently about being NB. It's been years of me hurting and punishing myself trying to not only discover what this word meant but how it applies to me and only recently have I realized it. 

I talked with a light group of friends I made in college and they basically helped me understand it more and offered ways if they could help me understand myself better. Thankfully they did and I came out. I went very well as I knew it would. She accepted me being gay one the spot but then again she's also a lesbian so wow mom solidarity for the win. 

Aside from that, I'm still trying to clear up my own emotions on this and due to my current situation in only coming out to friends and not family but cool with that.

Anyways just wanted to come here and hopefully celebrate this. Thanks I guess. -Z"		hs2wlw	NonBinary	3	0.81	2020-07-16 04:08:42

Feeling terrible, need support	"Hi everyone, I’ve been going through quite some stuff lately (TW: enbyphobia).

I was at an online LGBT+ hangout yesterday, and there were a lot of people who were saying very hateful and unnecessary things. I try not to take internet stranger’s insults to heart, but hearing “there are only two genders” over and over really makes me question my identity and it hurts a lot.

So after that, to feel better about my validity, I decided to look up some videos about there being a gender spectrum, etc. Bad idea. The two videos I watched had an insane amount of dislikes, and I also made the mistake of checking the comments. On a video titled “People who say there are only two genders- how to respond”, so many comments just said “you agree with them”. That hurts. The video admittedly had pretty terrible advice, but it was clear by the comments where the dislikes came from.

So yeah, I’m feeling pretty bad, and pretty doubtful about my identity. Can anybody help me out here? I think many of these people are stuck in their idea of sex = gender, but even when you explain it to them, they *still* want to fight against you, saying that NB is “made up” or just something to make you feel “quirky and unique”. I just want to give up with these closed-brained people, but I don’t like letting haters win. I’ve only been out to myself for a few months, but I’ve already faced an unbelievable amount of hate and rejection (almost daily). Makes me feel like I should just pretend to be who I was assigned at birth and try to forget about all of this :( But I don't want to give up.

**TLDR**: need support with my validity and legitimacy, maybe need some believable (and of course truthful) quick scientific facts about there being more than two genders so I can tell people.

If you’re curious, I’m 19 and I just like to identify simply as “non binary”, but if that’s just an umbrella term, then maybe agender is more accurate for me."	"Hiya! I'm Lake, they/them,  20 y/o. I'm so sorry people treated you like that. I've been in similar situations where people have been talking about there ""only being two genders"" and feel myself just trying to shrink away into a corner. You should know that you are valid and being an enby is nothing you should be ashamed of. A lot of people are still uneducated on how the minds internal gender actually works and as such are still very enbyphobic which is really hard for us but in the future, hopefully things will be different. If you want someone to talk to just send me a message:)
Hey, thank you :) I’m glad (but very sad) that it’s not just me going through this. I hope things will improve too. It’s just hard to believe that I am who I say I am, when so many people say my identity doesn’t exist. I think of myself as a rational/logical person, so the high amount of judgement makes me want to question myself heavily. With being pan, I was judged for liking who I like (but not denying my existence), and I could live with that. But now, I’m straight-up told that nb doesn’t exist. You get what I mean?
Don't worry my fellow pansexual enby, you yourself are proof that non-binary does exist, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's only natural to question but don't let that distract yourself from what you know you are. You're an enby and nothing anyone tells you will change that."	oa0l09	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-06-29 04:01:57
Looking for opinions on non-binary marathon divisions	"Cis-male ally with some questions that are outside my realm of knowledge and hoping for some enby opinions. Please help me, all opinions are welcome. Please remember I'm trying to learn here so if I make an inadvertent insulting mistake be assured it wasn't malicious. 

Background:
The Boston Marathon is one of the most prestigious marathons in the world and aside from running for a charity the only way to get to run it is to qualify with a fast marathon time. Historically the time you had to beat has been determined by your age and gender. [Here](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/qualify/history-qualifying-times) is a history of how those qualifying times have changed. Qualifying for the Boston Marathon is a very big deal for runners and for many runners is a huge goal, so the fairness of the qualifying standards is pretty important. Age groups go by 5 year blocks starting at age 35 (under 35 is one single group) and in every age group the women's time is 30 minutes slower than the male's time to keep the playing field level. Generally speaking the running community thinks this setup is reasonably fair.


This year Boston is introducing a non-binary division. The NYC Marathon and the Brooklyn Marathon started non-binary divisions last year. There may be other marathons with non-binary divisions that I'm not aware of as well. For this first year Boston has set the qualifying time for the non-binary division to be the same as the women's division and they have stated this is because they don't have enough data yet and setting it to the slower standard is meant to be the most inclusive this first year. A runner who wants to submit an application must submit a qualifying time from a race in which they were registered as non-binary and the qualification window is already closed so the common (dumb) ""but all the men will pretend to be non-binary to win"" argument is irrelevant since they can't travel back in time. They have said going forward the qualification times will probably change but if they remain the same that argument could be relevant. In the two races I found there were only 3 athletes that qualified so currently this isn't an issue currently.

Not non-binary but somewhat related, many sports are just starting to introduce rules for transgender athletes. They are not perfect but any means, but generally speaking any trans man can compete and a trans woman can compete if she has gone through hormone therapy and meets certain testosterone limits. This can be extremely problematic because there are afab who naturally exceed those limits such as Caster Semenya who are then restricted for their natural biology. 

Questions:
What is a fair way to determine qualifying standards for non-binary athletes?

Would it be insulting to non-binary athletes to have standards similar to trans athletes that are based on physical/hormonal advantages?

Edit: mods I did follow the rules. Unsurprisingly this did not come up as an answered question."	"Seeking fairness in a competition like this is in inherently unfair. You are never going to have every competitor have exactly the same qualifying time, same leg length, same mL lung capacity, same red blood cell count. There's always going to be some amount of unfairness; that's what makes it a competition. If everything were perfectly fair, then everyone running would get exactly the same time.

The goal isn't to create fairness, though that's what everyone talks about. The goal is to create reasonable competition, where the individual competitor's efforts are the deciding factor rather than some genetic or environmental factor. The higher the level of the competition, the more narrow that range of entrants has to be.

Here's the thing though: sex is an absolute shit metric for athletic performance. There are plenty of women who run the Boston marathon that would absolutely destroy the average male runner in the US. There are cis women who have naturally higher T levels than the average cis man does. The variations within either sex are much much greater than the differences between the average man and the average woman. And it completely erases intersex people.

So where does that leave us? Let's measure the things that are actually relevant to the athletic performance. Lung capacity, cardiac output, pick a metric. Boxing uses weight classes as a reasonable parallel. Throw away this idea that sex is a reasonable way to make competitions fair. And *definitely* throw away the idea that gender is; gender doesn't define one's body at all, and is a downright insane thing to base athletic performance tiers on.
Why point out that you’re a cis male ally? Do you start all your posts l like that? That’s so weird.
I registered for a marathon this year that didn't require a qualification and was pleasently surprised to be able to select non-binary. 

Are the other brackets data driven based on historical finishing times for the ages/genders?

Honestly, while I appreciate being able to select non-binary (and i guess it's extra relevant because I'll be about two months into hrt on race day, so physically very non-binary too) the whole gender thing in sports is a bit of a crock. As you pointed out, hormone levels, chromosomes and gender only influence ""performance based on sex"" at a population level, and in a sport that focuses on individual performance it is not a suitable category.

Non-binary people come in all shapes and sizes and if you're looking for fairness it doesn't solve that problem. The category will nearly always be won by trans men, non-binary and transfemme people who are not on hormones etc. Afab folks who are on low dose T or not at all will struggle to place. This variation already exists in the current gender categories but is more pronounced. I am curious to see where I will place (I'm amab, and since I'm training while only starting HRT I will probably not lose too much in the performance category, but my hormone profile will be solidly in the female range. I'm also a first timer so.) I am not a woman (in this context anyway) and would not want to compete in the female category, but how would you handle someone similar to me who would?

Non-binary people as a group are generally chill about the differences between our bodies, but there is a competition to contend with, so you'll get people who disagree with you no matter what. As long as you are always grateful for their feedback and validate thier point of view, I think it's manageable.

Your org probably isn't there yet but I think the future is probably more class based like weightlifting (without the additional sex based category). Of course when this happens you will be endlessly harassed by trans exclusionary people who never want us to even be considered.

Marathon start times are already segregated this way, so I don't think it's too big of a leap. Of course you'd risk sandbaggers but asking for an average of qualifying times over the last x years would help, without too much extra overhead.

Keep asking questions! The change will happen regardless, pretty cool that you get to be a part of it!
I want to see leg length ""classes"" for marathons lol
First off, you're right that it's inherently unfair. But the goal for a race with a qualification standard isn't to achieve equity of athletes, it's to achieve equity of acceptance to the race as you say. For endurance running two of the biggest correlators with pace are VO2max and running economy so perhaps the ""fairest"" way to accept athletes would be to have a qualifying time based on those two metrics, but that's not feasible in reality.

I wouldn't necessarily agree that sex is a ""shit metric"" but I would say it's probably the ""best dumb"" indicator. On the flip side of some of the women being able to absolutely crush the average male runner there are NCAA D3 cis-male runners that could beat olympic cis-female athletes. Only 12 cis-women in the world have ever run faster than 2:18 which is the olympic B qualifying time for men. And of course as I said in my original post and you mention, intersex athletes get extremely mistreated in a binary system.

All that said, I think it's a good step for Boston to introduce a non-binary division. I'm just trying to think of ways that the qualification could be done that fits somewhat into the current system.
You're just making up a new metric for the division/classification divide. The naming of the classifications as men's and women's was never intended to be a gendered distinction, but rather a biological one. The lack of general awareness in gender identity has implications in both directions, obviously.

You're correct in pointing out that marathons in particular are dramatically less modally separated by sex than many, MANY other sports, due to the human race as a whole being so heavily evolutionarily selected for long endurance running at moderate speeds. However, the bimodal ranges and percentile spectra are unavoidably clear. Whatever percentile a non-transitioned XY athlete exists at in the marathon will be bumped up should they compete in the XX division/classification. This fact is beyond any possible attempt at dispute, and it is in fact more pronounce at the higher percentiles.

The remediation of this fact, of course, could lie either in the transitioning therapies required for cross-sex competition or both puberty blocking and transitioning therapies or.....it is possible that a ""fair"" solution isn't possible.

Edit: Note, your interpretation of ""fairness"" is mostly nonsensical. It's just a ""Hey! NO FAIR!"" child's contention as to the meaning of fairness. I don't allege unfairness in professional surfing because I'm 6'4"" and therefore could never possibly compete at Pipeline....I just recognize that I'm not made to be an exceptional surfer in that scenario. I don't shout ""Hey! NO FAIR!"" when my 8yrold daughter had to realize she'd never be a competitive gymnast because she was already 4'8"". I could have taken up or invented some sort of tall man's artistic surfing. She could have gone off on her own invented some new implement that played upon her height....but we didn't, and we certainly didn't ask anyone to do it for us.
The new rule is that thoughts, rhetoric, facts and logic cannot exist outside of the cultural identity of the speaker....at least that what I've gathered.

Feeling conflicted about presentation	"I am non-binary, which is known by those I work with and friends. Earlier this month I entered a raffle for some tickets that my company had to go to a fancy masquerade gala with dinner, key note speakers, and auction, idk. I've never been to any sort of ""fancy"" event like this before, and i did win one of the tickets. The attire is formal and I was excited because I have some formal clothes that I never have any reason to wear. My presentation fluctuates between masc and femme, and I have no issue with that. My thing right now is that I have a nice black and white velvet suit and a beautiful gold shimmery dress that are the top contenders for this event, but I know that I will be validated, asked my pronouns etc if I wear the suit, but if I wear the dress, people will automatically assume I'm a cis woman, and i feel like correcting people while looking extremely feminine will make me feel invalidated, and i usually dont even say amything anyway when its not people im going to be around again. I know I don't owe anyone androgyny or any type of presentation, but I'm just feeling really conflicted about this and I don't know if there's a way to kind of keep myself looking like ~gender unknown~ in a dress or if I should just go ahead and wear the suit to feel more comfortable in my identity. I'm comfortable with my identity but it's much more accepted by others when I don't femme it up, and I know I'm already going to be incredibly anxious at this event. I will probably make my mind up the night of but I guess I'm looking for words of encouragement and any advice (whether for my brain or the attire)."	"I think that it’s ok to wear the thing that will help you feel comfortable in your presentation. There are other stages to teach people that we don’t have to look androgynous to be who we are.

I think it’s also ok to allow others to put a mask on you in order to just enjoy something. But you have to be honest with yourself on whether accepting that mask will hurt your ability to enjoy yourself."	qc49mp	NonBinary	3	0.81	2021-10-20 16:04:36
Struggling to find a gender identity that fits.	"Hi all. I recently came out as demiboy (I'm 19 amab) after a bit of wrestling with my gender identity, but I'm still not entirely sure if that's correct for me. 

Ive always had a weird relationship with gender, even as a young kid. For some history, when I was 7 I proudly said I wished I had both sets of sex chromosomes, but then change my appearance to be a boy so that I could still look like me but win arguments like girls could. I also had no problem doing the more ""girly"" things and actually thought they were pretty normal. 

Throughout school, I never had a problem being grouped together with the girls, and I would often prefer it. I felt really disconnected from the other guys in my schools for the most part. That being said, I also never considered myself a girl, just a boy who was more comfortable being addressed collectively in a group of girls as ""ladies"" or ""girls"" by a teacher than singularly as ""boy"" or ""young man"". ""Mister [last name] always made me feel a bit iffy too. I much preferred Master. Despite thinking of myself as a cis male at the time, I would say to people that I was basically half-female when they tried to apologise to me for accidentally lumping me in with girls when greeting everyone (I was often the only guy present in my drama class, which is where this most commonly occurred).

When puberty started to hit, I got really annoyed with my body hair. I think it's unsightly and uncomfortable, so now I shave it off when I can be bothered. But I do like to have some facial hair. Currently, I dress in men's clothing, but nothing particularly masculine. Most often a plain t-shirt and slim jeans. I've started trying to buy some feminine clothing and have felt really good when trying on items that aren't as masculine as I'm used to. 

Demiboy resonated with me when I first researched it as it was described as ""partly male, partly something else"". I'm fairly sure it fits what I feel, but all this history has made me question if there might be a better one (or maybe I'm just put off by the word ""boy"" in the label :P and can probably just say demiguy to make it sound more comfortable in my head). If anyone has any thoughts on some possible gender identities that sound like they might fit, Id love to hear them so I can do some research :) thanks in advance."	"My personal system is a sort of ""Color Wheel"". You know the typical binary employs male and female as color-coded with one being red and the other being blue?

Typical non-binary explanation turns this binary into a spectrum, with Purple between the two. And then further nuance can be added as per the specific shade of purple. (Such as if someone is Indigo, or Maroon, or Fuchsia, or Violet.)

&#x200B;

I caveat that whichever color you employ as male and whichever you employ as female is your prerogative.

&#x200B;

This COLOR LINE, however, falls a bit short. What I add to it, thus, is a Yellow dimension. So that you can have an identity along the RED-ORANGE-YELLOW or RED-PURPLE-BLUE or BLUE-GREEN-YELLOW edges...or something somewhere inside the resulting triangle."	kcddro	NonBinary	3	1.0	2020-12-13 16:22:32

What's in a name?.. Not gender!	Soo.. if we all just kept our birthnames, regardless of what gender it's traditionally for and what gender we actually are (if any), over the course of a few generations we will shake the very idea of names being gendered. And wouldn't that be a bigger win than changing our names to suit?	"Why are we going to worry about how names are gendered in a few generations if they're gendered now?

There are other reasons people change their names besides just the gendered affiliation. It can remind them of how they presented as that gender and how wrong that was for them. Their dead name can simply just not fit them anymore. And even if they're changing their name due to gendered connotation, that's fine. Despite the idea that names *may not* be gendered in the future, names are unfortunately gendered now, and people have reasons for changing their names.
I'm changing my name because I _really_ hate the name I was given. It doesn't reflect who I am at all and it was a name given to me by my abusers. To me, the importance of what my name is goes beyond gender. It's a reflection of everything in my life that brought me to this moment and made me who I am - and that's Jesse.
 In some cultures, a name means much more than just an expression of gender, and changing your name as an adult can be a way of expressing ownership of your identity and who you've become. I think the real problem is changing conservative people's attitudes about gendered names rather than forcing LGBTQs to just get used to what they were named at birth.
For that reason I have a lot of respect for people who keep their birth names, like Jeffrey Marsh. Unfortunately I am not brave enough. Plus, my name has never really felt like it belonged to me and I feel some dysphoria about it.

Similarly, if none of us physically transitioned, it would hypothetically make people not view biology as gendered. But I have dysphoria about my body, so I’m going to do whatever helps me feel comfortable. While I care about future generations of queer people, I’m not going to sacrifice feeling safe and comfortable just on the off chance they have it a little easier.
Why do we care about the world we set up for those who come after? Well, I guess it's not a requirement. I do agree that individuals have valid reasons for changing their names, I just prefer a different approach.
I wish you all peace and happiness with your new name, Jesse
""Expressing ownership of your identity""- this phrase really speaks to me, thank you. My birthname means ""father's joy,"" and I agree that names are so much more than an expression of gender.
Because while it's good to care about those who come after us, people making themselves uncomfortable by keeping a name that doesn't fit them for some hypothetical future that they won't even be a part of is ridiculous.
Thank you very much! I hope my personal experience has helped offered some insight. I too hope that gendered names become a thing of the past and someday I'm sure it will. I think teaching the next generation is one of the best ways to do that.
Your name has such a beautiful meaning and I'm so glad that you can enjoy it. :)
I don't think it's far enough in the future to exclude those living now.. and I think that's like saying ""why protect the Earth? We're all going to die anyways.""
We need to think about those living now as well. Someday names might not be gendered, but we have no idea when that will be, and it's not our responsibility to keep names that don't fit us to ensure that. 

It's not like saying ""Why protect Earth? We're all going to die anyways."" That's incomparable."	qe5nou	NonBinary	4	0.67	2021-10-23 14:14:54

Can someone help me parse my feelings?	"Okay so. Stream of consciousness time, sorry in advance.

I'm AMAB, and have lived my whole life (I'm 33) without ever questioning my gender or sexual identity. I'm a cishet man, never wondered about that. But I am \*fiercely\* supportive of LGBTQ+ rights, having even founded an online community dedicated to increasing equity and diversity in a space in which I spend a lot of time. And I find myself getting especially passionate about issues relating to trans rights. Again, never thought anything of this. I figured it stemmed from my desire to be an ally and the fact that trans rights are under especially heavy fire these days.

&#x200B;

Recently... I'm less sure. I know a number of people who have come out as nonbinary, despite outward appearances and mannerisms aligning with what I imagine cisgender to be. I'm not under any delusions that nonbinary folks owe anyone any sort of androgyny, so that doesn't bother me or anything, but it was the first seed of ""okay so if 'acting like a man' doesn't inherently make me a man, do I have some thinking to do?"". So I started doing a lot of thinking on gender expression and how much, if at all, gender identity is tied to that. I had settled pretty firmly simply having a more progressive understanding of gender, wherein I'm comfortable wearing nail polish, open to wearing traditionally feminine clothing (I don't, but mostly because I don't own anything that fits), I take on many of the household duties and tasks traditionally associated with female members of the household (this one is especially outdated and I honestly don't think it plays into it). Coupled with my efforts to be more emotionally healthy and therefore not subscribing traditionally masculine personality traits, I figured this all boiled down to ""I'm a man who is comfortable with a 21st century definition of masculinity - that definition being that masculinity doesn't exist because things are not inherently masculine or feminine."" I still believe this, for what it's worth.

&#x200B;

The thing that has kept me from ever seriously questioning my own gender identity is the fact that I have never once been uncomfortable with my biology. I've never wished that I didn't have a penis, or that I did have breasts, or that I had curves or less facial hair, etc. But recently I've started circling back fully to my friends who similarly appear to embrace their assigned biology while still identifying as nonbinary. And in the last couple of weeks, my wife and I have had a number of conversations about what it means that I simply can't let this go.

&#x200B;

That's the real sticking point for me, I think. My wife asked me, ""if you were told that you were bisexual, would you entertain that notion?"" and the answer is an easy, immediate no. While I can appreciate that many men are attractive, and would be perfectly happy being in a long-term partnership with another man, I have never once in my life been physically or sexually attracted to a man. (But don't get me started on my desire to see terms for sexual identity die out, as sexual preference is a fluid thing with an infinite number of points along a spectrum.) But if someone told me ""Yeah dude you're enby"", I don't think I could dismiss it out of hand. I'm tempted to say that's only because - for me - sexual identity is so much simpler to define than gender identity. But... is it something else? Is there more than my desire to be an ally driving my passion for working towards trans causes? 

&#x200B;

Here's where I'm at right now: I am confident that, if gender identity were determined solely based on the existing definition of gender expression, I would identify as nonbinary. If, instead, gender identity is determined by occasional or persistent discomfort with assigned biology, while gender expression is simply the extent to which a person subscribes to traditional gender roles, then I am definitely cisgender. I just... I don't know what to think about those two definitions (if you can call them that).

&#x200B;

One other thing: since I have started to do some real introspection, I've found that, in my core, when I'm being completely honest with myself... I hope that someone tells me that I'm nonbinary. That's what I want the answer to be. I've heard people describe feeling gender euphoria, and I have experienced something like that when considering the prospect of using they/them pronouns. But then, I ask myself why I feel this way. I honestly don't know if it's because that's truly how I identify or if, as someone who is extremely online, I find the prospect of no longer being a cishet white man, the most oppressive of groups, and instead being able to ""win points"" by identifying as a marginalized identity and thus be welcome in spaces dedicated to those groups, enticing. That's a horrible, terrible motivation, and I shudder to think what it says about me if it's true, but I legitimately don't know if that's the case. It goes back to my desire to work with marginalized groups: do I want to be welcome in those spaces only because these are the people I care about, and want to support as an ally? Or do I want to belong to those spaces because they reflect who I am?

&#x200B;

Anyway. If anyone read this whole thing, I appreciate you taking the time. I don't even know if this is the right place to be spewing all of this, but I can't afford therapy. Love to you all."	">I figured this all boiled down to ""I'm a man who is comfortable with a 21st century definition of masculinity - that definition being that masculinity doesn't exist because things are not inherently masculine or feminine."" 

Can it be both that you're comfortable with a progressive masculinity as a man AND that this makes you nonbinary? It doesn't have to be either / or. Gender being a social construct means that it's formed through relations and interactions with others, it's a generalization, an amalgamation of every experience you've ever had. When every person you meet has a different understanding of gender, it's difficult to form a clear image of yourself. I think it helps to refuse the urge to simplify.

Remember, also, that nonbinary doesn't mean a non-man non-woman. If you felt, for instance, that you're 99% man and 1% something else, if that 1% was important to you, I would gladly welcome you as a fellow nonbinary person. People use the label for different purposes and to mean different things, just like people have different concepts of manhood and womanhood.

>While I can appreciate that many men are attractive, and would be perfectly happy being in a long-term partnership with another man, I have never once in my life been physically or sexually attracted to a man.

What if I said there's many people who would consider that a valid way to be bisexual? (At the very least, biromantic.) Sexuality and attraction has a lot of different schools of thought too. I think it only seems simpler than gender to most people because it's been discussed in the mainstream for much longer and has been boiled down to very clear societal messages, while nuance-adding factors like aromanticism haven't entered the mainstream yet. 

>If, instead, gender identity is determined by occasional or persistent discomfort with assigned biology, while gender expression is simply the extent to which a person subscribes to traditional gender roles, then I am definitely cisgender.

It's controversial in the community. People who believe dysphoria over physical characteristics is what defines transness are called transmedicalists, transmeds, truscum (derogatory).

>I don't know what to think about those two definitions (if you can call them that).

A third option to consider: gender identity is based on the processes of group recognition, the same ones we use to decide to call ourselves humans, adults, or members of our racial group for example. Gender isn't bound by rules, but an internal experience of being in a group of people like you. If you look at nonbinary people and think, ""I'm like them... I'm one of those people,"" I'd consider you nonbinary. Or conversely, if you experience a sensation of not being like cis men or cis women with regard to gender, and find the term nonbinary useful... that's a very real and valid nonbinary experience as well.

>I honestly don't know if it's because that's truly how I identify or if, as someone who is extremely online, I find the prospect of no longer being a cishet white man, the most oppressive of groups, and instead being able to ""win points"" by identifying as a marginalized identity and thus be welcome in spaces dedicated to those groups, enticing. 

What if I said you can't lose privilege just by identifying as nonbinary? Privilege isn't something you have inherently by virtue of simply being something. It's a social position gained by your experiences, how others in society treat you. Privilege isn't generated, so to speak; it's conferred to you by somebody else. If people give you privilege now, and are still giving you privilege after you start seeing yourself differently, you haven't won any points. If you wear feminine clothes and people remove that privilege... it isn't because you identified as nonbinary. It's because you wore feminine clothes. It's a problem for people to discriminate against any person who wear feminine clothes, regardless of whether they identify as nonbinary.

Approach privilege in a way that acknowledges that simply having privilege is morally neutral, and that the system that assigns privilege according to gender, race, and other discriminatory factors is the real problem, and you won't have a problem with this. Look at the privilege you have objectively and with the aim to dismantle the systems that unfairly assign it to you (or don't assign it you). And obviously you shouldn't purposely wield your identity to gain an upper hand, but I think that hypothetical is often overvalued by questioning people.

-

I'm running out of steam here, but the last thing I want to say is, for every person who will say that you are nonbinary, there's another person who will say you aren't. You have the right to develop your own understanding of the term and to express and enjoy that in a group of like-minded people if that's what you so wish. It's an extremely diverse community. But yes, plenty of people including myself would say that you're nonbinary, based on what you said and because you want to be.
First of all, know that you can experiment with pronouns and expression just to see how it feels. I asked some of my closest friends to use they/them for me for a few weeks and it helped me realize that it was right for me. 
Imposter syndrome occurs for a lot of queer people, especially people who fall in greyer areas like NB/bi/pan. Usually when people do things for brownie points they're aware of their dishonest motivation, FYI. 
Overall, as an overthinker I'd encourage you to try to think less about this (easier said than done ofc) and follow your emotions and instincts. What do you feel when you say, out loud (maybe to someone you're close to) ""I'm nonbinary""? Try to stay in touch with what you're feeling without analyzing it. 
I'd also recommend the essay ""Uses of the erotic"" by Audrey Lorde. It's geared towards women but it resonated with me a lot as an enby and as someone trying to be more true to myself.
It’s very normal for some people to start out as an “overly enthusiastic ally” before actually coming out to themselves. I definitely had a moment where I realized I had written “we” instead of “they” when talking about the struggles of nonbinary folks and it was a big part of me realizing I needed to do some gender pondering. I can’t tell you that you are nonbinary, that’s a leap you will have to decide to take on your own but I can tell you that your experiences are very similar to plenty of nonbinary folks I have heard talk about their experiences. As far as feelings of imposter syndrome or wondering if you are only doing it to be more welcomed in queer spaces or to not be seen as an embodiment of cisheteropatriarchy I just want to note that it seems from your description that if you are as involved as you say with lgbt activism that you are probably already pretty well accepted even when people are reading you as cis. The idea that people are becoming nonbinary for clout or whatever is BS. Do what feels true to yourself and try not to worry about what other people think (very difficult I know).
The way you write sounds like a lot of my thoughts, the ""is my allyship influencing me into this?"" And the answer is often no, your allyship is how you were exposed to and opened up to a possibility that feels right for you.


""I have never once been uncomfortable with my biology."" For the most part, me neither. Once I accepted being non-binary and gave it a name, I actually developed some dysphoria which I think had been repressed under comp het, but that's a different story.


 ""But if someone told me ""Yeah dude you're enby"", I don't think I could dismiss it out of hand. I'm tempted to say that's only because - for me - sexual identity is so much simpler to define than gender identity. But... is it something else?""
Based on how you talk about the amount of thought you put into this and the feelings you keep coming back to, yeah, I could see it being something else. 


Maybe I'm out of line, but I feel like you answered what you really feel right here: ""I am confident that, if gender identity were determined solely based on the existing definition of gender expression, I would identify as nonbinary.""
i highly recommend reading the gender dysphoria bible! its written partly from a binary transwoman’s perspective but it helped me as a genderfluid person, feel more solid in my identity and has a lot of good info about the nature of gender and how the understanding and experience of ones own dysphoria can change as your ‘egg starts to crack.’ its a long read but its worth it. https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
So I think there's definitely more movement in the community to realize that you don't need dysphoria to be nonbinary (or to look at it another way, being non-binary is not a result of trauma). Some of us developed coping mechanisms where that wasn't the outcome. Some of us didn't have words for what was going on until a few years ago when talking about the nonbinary spectrum became more prevalent. And a lot of us agender folk stumbled on it because since gender wasn't a part of our experience we just assumed everyone was like this until we realized that our experience was different.

A couple things to think about:
- if you could change your body to be anything, what would it be?
- can you think back to previous moments where you balked at gender norms, even growing up?
- based on your notes above, do you *feel* like a man?"	sdi76j	NonBinary	2	0.67	2022-01-26 22:23:04
Newfound gender euphoria!!	"I’m Rex (they/them) and this is my first post here!

I wanted to share what a win it feels like that I went out last night with a light masculine contour and a new hairstyle and was “he/sir/hey man”’d all night!!

Being AFAB, usually hard masc-leaning, but without T or surgery and a penchant for wearing tight tops, I receive a variety of gendered assumptions with a tendency toward she/her. So to be assumed male *as a rule* felt amazing, like I’ve finally unlocked boy mode.

As a fan of upsetting gendered expectations and a believer that dressing femme is one of life’s great pleasures, this feels particularly joyful: Knowing that I am able to present in a way that allows me to be assumed the opposite of my AGAB, I somehow feel a lot more free to experiment and present however the actual fuck I want.

Plus, whether I could feel gender euphoria in my body as-is was one of the conditions I wanted to determine before committing to medical transition or not. This experience felt so good that maybe it’ll push me toward taking T to have it happen more often—or maybe it feels so good to have the option to be perceived this way *without* dramatically altering my body that I’ll decide against it. But whatever I choose, the choice now feels much less like I’m making it to affect other people’s assumptions and expectations and a lot more like I’m making it for *me.*

It feels amazing.

Thanks to all of you in this gorgeous community and thanks for reading!!"	"That’s amazing friend!! I hope you have more experiences like this in the future <333

What to do about a non-supportive parent?	"TW: gender dysphoria, non-supportive parent, Boarderline Personality Disorder

Some more context before I start: I am 23 years old and do not live in the same household as my mother. She has Boarderline Personality Disorder and struggles with fear of abandonment and creating healthy boundaries so I can either have her in my life to an extent that is uncomfortable or not have her in my life at all. 

My friend was asking what I was trying to accomplish by coming out to my mom specifically. I told her I did it to try and help her understand that I don’t feel like a woman and don’t want her to buy me clothes as gifts that look feminine or praise me for wearing girly things if I happen to, because that is not what I like. She makes me feel uncomfortable because she wants me to look like a woman. I know she does because whenever I wear feminine things, she is the happiest person alive and says “see whenever you do actually dress up, you look incredible.” When I came out to my mom, at first she was supportive and I thought everything was ok finally, but then she said: just don’t let your evolving identity erase your history, because I was at the doctor and they told me it was a girl. A long time ago, I came out to my mom as pansexual and she said something like well you chose to be in a relationship with a man, so you shouldn’t feel oppressed, and stop telling everyone you’re gay on social media because I don’t want the family to find out that way... etc. I know my mom is completely unsupportive of me for saying these things time and time again and I want her to start thinking of me as the real person I am and not who she wants me to be. 

My friends response was that she thinks I am letting it hurt me too much what other people think who don’t care about my well being. She thinks it is impossible for me to expect someone to get inside my head and think of me the exact way I think of myself who has core values as strong as she does. It’s like trying to convince a racist to stop using racial slurs. I don’t know what to do with this information. I just want to feel understood and don’t think I ever will get that luxury. I feel invalidated by her but I don’t know if that’s a misdirected feeling towards my mom instead. Is she right? Is she just being honest and trying to help me come to terms with the fact my mother won’t ever be supportive of me and I need to move on? Am I being ridiculous for over explaining myself to my mother all of the time to try and win her approval? With her, everything is black and white. If I try to make a boundary she won’t respect it, so I’ve just been letting her overstep my boundaries because I don’t want to loose her forever. I don’t have a lot of other people in my life and cant really see anyone due to the pandemic."	"[deleted]
Ugh it sucks because I am in the process of planning my wedding and it breaks my heart not to invite her but I don’t want her to ruin it for me. I was thinking just make sure there is a lot of booze there or something but you never know. Maybe I’ll give her that at least. But you’re right. It’s been going on for too long at this point and I just want to be happy. I don’t want to bring the baggage she puts on me into my spouse and my work and other relationships I have. That’s what it’s becoming and I don’t want it to consume me. Another thing is she still has health insurance I am on and I couldn’t be able to afford my own healthcare with my salary. Honestly though, stress is the number one killer and that may be a priority for me to focus on. 

I’m glad you were able to make that decision for yourself and honestly I’m so proud of you because that’s very difficult. It’s easy for others to say just cut her out. But there are so many facets of life that not having a mother figure affects, even as an adult. I’m starting to learn what I am willing to sacrifice more and more. It will take a while but eventually that’s probably going to be the end result."	kbxx6k	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-12-12 21:57:36
Why is God the default argument for a man-made (person-made) construct	This has been something that’s been on my mind for a while and I cannot figure it out. It seems that every time we begin winning the argument as to why there are more than two genders, people resort to “well god made male and female”. Is science to complicated to understand or are they just so indoctrinated by their religion that they truly cannot comprehend reality? Don’t get me wrong, I was raised in church and am well-versed in biblical ideology but for me it just proved that the religion is based purely on opinion and not solid and replicable fact. Do people truly believe in their hateful ideologies or are they just using it as an excuse?	"i think people just accept it to be the ultimate truth or whatever, and usually nothing ever counteracts that. from their perspective, it's reinforced and agreed with through every ounce of their life and experience. stupid though
When people say this to me, I ask if night and day are also binary as G-d supposedly created that as well with no in between. If they were then it would immediately get very dark at sunset and immediately very bright at sunrise.
just because God made 2 biological sexes\* doesnt mean He mandated 2 genders. i mean God Himself and all of His angels are nonbinary anyways right? and we were made in His image? Maybe Adam was androgynous AF before Eve was split from him?

ultimately it's slightly interesting theologically, but theology is really not super useful in navigating life anyways IMO. the philosophy of Christ is why I'm Christian. Love one another. Thats why I'm Christian  


EDIT: \*and actually even '2 biological sexes' isnt always entirely accurate either....
Its a construct made by authoritarians, it is not a construct that was made with people's natural inclination to gender expansiveness in mind - but to control them.

That is what is truly being communicated here I think. ""You cant just go against authority / hegemony!"" Except you totally can! which ilicits this incredilous reactionary response.

Terfs trying to psyop their way into saying they are ""counter culture"" when that's not how that works at all. They are just fascists who dont want anyone but them to have ""freedom."" 

Counter culture exists because of those very same puritan material and social conditions that are foisted upon us."	12k6owd	NonBinary	1	0.57	2023-04-13 01:13:14

My First Gender Euphoria Experience.	"Hi, name's Wynne (pronounced like win), and I thought I would share my first experience with gender euphoria.

So, one day, when I was around 14, I was fooling around on the sims.  My sister had downloaded a bunch of mods and I wanted to try a few out.  I made what my body and face looked like, then looked for hair.  I found one that was about mid length and very stringy, and loved it when it was in green.  Then I found a striped flannel and a pair of black jeans with a chain.  Then found some nice shoes.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I was DUMBFOUNDED!  Like, I cried because all I could think was 'THATS ME!!'  It still gives me gender euphoria today. Now 15, year old me looks a lot like Sims me :)

TL;DR: A year ago I made my ideal self in the sims and HOLY SHIT!"	AFAIK, it's common among gender diverse people to experience gender euphoria through fantasy and gaming. I play a MMORPG where I made two avatars for myself, one male, one female. Over time, as I acquire and experiment with different clothes, hairstyles and accessories in the game, I also make slight adjustments to face and body parameters to more closely align with my actual body rather than an ideal. Both of my avatars have drifted away from the poles and closer together towards androgeny. But still, only one of them is who I want to be.	w92mo0	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-07-27 02:32:15

Non binary dating	Ok so I’m AMAB lean towards more fen presenting.

"That is entirely up to you. Is that something that you like being called?
I agree with the previous comment. It's up to you. If you liked it, that's okay! If you didn't, that's also okay! You could talk to her about what names are okay and not okay to call you during sexy times

Little rant (sorry) but also in need of a bit of advice.	"I'm graduating this year, and the IB lets you pick a preferred name to put on your diploma that would also show during announcements. Now, I'm nonbinary, but any LGBTQA+ activity is illegal in my country. I'm not sure how to bring this up to my school, teachers or family without creating any issues. I don't want to create a drama or hassle, but I also don't want to have to see or hear my name.

The other issue is, I brought this topic up to my family and my mom did her best not to make me feel unwanted or challenge my decision, but she kept pushing feminine clothing on me (and still does from time to time till this day). My brother and father, on the other hand, said I was: Confused, mentally ill, stupid, trying to be trendy, etc. I'm not really sure how to respond to all this, for the most part, I just kind of smile and take it. (I'm not fighting back as last time I did it things didn't go well, it's not a battle I can win, and to this day there is still tension about the topic.) 

I'm not sure If I should use the diploma a final stance on the matter, because I don't want to hurt them or lose them. I don't even want ""freedom"" quite literally all I want from them is acknowledgement for my achievements and tolerance for my gender identity (or lack thereof)."		j4jruf	NonBinary	1	1.0	2020-10-03 18:07:52

"Any suggestions for neutral names with ""win"" in it"		"You mean the Germanic element meaning ""friend""?  The website [BehindTheName has this page](https://www.behindthename.com/element/win) listing all first names including or derived from that element.  I used that site to find my own name, which, incidentally, also contains the element ""win.""  
There are very few Germanic names which are traditionally neutral, but imo that might not be a huge obstacle.  For example, the name I chose - Alfwin - is traditionally masculine, but it's also not at all common where I live so most people I meet don't associate it with masculinity per se.
Irwin, Erwin, Owin, (like Owen). Winx, Rowin (like Rowan). Rywin, Gwin, Kwin, Wing, Kowin, Suwin, Winji, Dewin, Winnet.
Oswin (Doctor Who theme plays vaguely in the distance), Edwin, Winston, Winnifred, Darwin, Corwin (Charlie's Angels theme plays vaguely in the distance). That all I can think up now. Godspeed, non-binary pal!
Winnie
Winnifred
Carmen but make it Carmwin
Winter
Gowin
Winter is epic
Wow this website is awesome! Thanks!
This is kinda my original name which most people assume it a feminine name in place where I live.

But still thanks for you suggestions!

Top Surgery vs Mastectomy - what's the difference?	"
Hi everyone, I'm a 16-year-old almost-certainly-nonbinary. I've felt severe discomfort with my large chest for quite some time, but lately, I've explored binding and it's made a *world* of difference. The (emotional) discomfort was completely gone, but there was one large problem - the physical discomfort. 

Due to my chest size, I have to bind (with a sports bra, no less!) quite tightly to get anything *remotely* close to a flat chest. I quickly came to the realisation that unless I have surgery, the appearance I want is devastatingly unattainable.

Now comes the crux of my problem:

1. I'm not out to my parents as *trans*, although I am out to my mum as a lesbian (she's supportive).
2. When I brought up the idea of removing my breasts, my mum was shocked and said she would pay for a *reduction*, not removal. After some discussion, she said she would think about it. (Knowing how stubborn I can be, these damn lumps are coming *off*! I'll take her consideration as a win).
3. A requirement for top surgery where I live is to have well-documented gender dysphoria. In order to document this, I would have to come out to my mum as trans, which isn't happening (she's old school & wouldn't understand)

**Could I get a mastectomy instead of top surgery?** Would results be similar? I *really* don't care about a ""masculine"" chest, I just want it to be flat. Shape be damned!

td;dr Can I get a mastectomy instead of top surgery?"	"You don't have to be trans to be diagnosed with dysphoria, as far as I know. Many butch lesbians want and have top surgery. Some even use testosterone, but still identify as lesbians.

I would think you can please your mother & get the surgery you want without having to come out as trans. It kind of requires bending the truth a little with your mum and the medical profession. Once it's done, it's done. I would think it might be easier for your family if you do this whole process in stages rather than come out as trans from the start. They'll get used to it.

Also, if you have a breast reduction, your breasts can grow again. It happened to me and seems to be more common that you think. Therefore, it would make more sense to have them completely removed.
Hmm okay. Basic background, I had top surgery a few months ago. Here is what I know:

""Mastectomy"" is, generally, taking the boobs off. What most think of as ""top surgery"" is usually called something like ""mastectomy with masculinizing reconstruction"" but I don't think there's really a standard term for it - the ""reconstruction"" part (arranging scars, repositioning nipples) isn't usually prioritized for someone who's getting a mastectomy for breast cancer or similar reasons.

I don't know where you're located, but in my case I needed a letter from a therapist basically stating ""surgery is an appropriate next step for this person's transition."" For a minor, it might be a bit more involved, particularly in terms of insurance coverage (I paid for mine because my insurance had weird requirements that didn't cover me). I don't know that this requires you to officially Come Out to your mom, but you'll have to talk about it eventually. I think the way to approach this is to frame it as ""I feel happier thinking of my body this way, and want it to be like this in real life"" rather than ""part of my body is bad and needs to leave."" When moms look at your body they see *you*, and I think to them it can feel like you're having part of you, the human, surgically removed. I had to really explain to my mom that my chest didn't even feel like part of myself - it was just something extra that showed up.

Weirdly, my mom said she became much more okay with the concept when she started thinking of it as ""chest reconstruction"" rather than ""breast removal."" I am an entire adult so it wasn't like she was able to prevent me from doing it, but it did help her feel a little bit better about it. 

The person who commented before me mentioned breasts ""growing back,"" which is an issue I hadn't considered, but I think if you're younger and not taking testosterone, it is worth looking into. I'm old enough that I knew my body was done with puberty, but I know some people's breasts can keep changing and/or growing well into their twenties, so it does seem possible to me.
Thank you, so, so much for your advice. I think you’re right - I’ll have to explain to her that in order to get the results I want, we’ll have to bend the truth a little (without telling her I’m bending it for her too lol). 

I didn’t realise a breast reduction could grow back! That, along with reading about surgeons in my area being (pretty much) unwilling to give their patients flat chests (but rather just half the size of their breasts), makes me realise I’ll have to get top surgery.

I guess the first step will be just talking to my local doctor. Once again, thank you so much for sharing your advice.
I'm the person that commented before you. I believe it's a hormonal thing when they grow back. I was in my 30's when I had the initial (radical) reduction, and mine grew back over an 8 year period. I then had top surgery. If there is no breast material left, then they won't regrow.
Many of the women over at r/butchlesbians talk about top surgery. It's worth reading through some of the historic posts for more information and other people's experiences.
Oh that's interesting! Makes sense though, I hadn't considered the factor of having some remaining tissue. I think there are probably a lot of things, hormones in particular, that aren't as well understood as we tend to assume. The human body is a weird place.
You're right - I'm pretty sure it's hormonally related."	lcf9ej	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-02-04 13:07:59
