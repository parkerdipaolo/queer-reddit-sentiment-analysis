OOTD first time wearing a skirt :}}		"Oh my gosh you look great!! Congrats on your first skirt-experience (idk what to call it)! I hope you felt as good as you look
That's a really cool outfit and I love your cuddlies!
[removed]
You should wear more skirts. :)
That is so cute! I love it!
i love this look !!  (and your plushies + monster high doll) !!
It's the rocker babe hair and the eyeliner I'm interested in
You are a hottie!
Adorable!
Hehe! I know that feel. Tried my first one yesterday as-well!
SLAY
You look amazing! And I love your squish collection
You look great in it and overall your makeup is amazing.
It suits you so well (‚ó†‚Äø„Éª)‚Äî‚òÜ
You look so beautiful! I loved it
You have a pineapple stego! I want one so bad!

Your ootd is great tho, the skirt looks super cute on you o3o!
I love it!!
Hey well done for pulling off facial hair with a fem look. This is proof people that energy doesnt lie - we all have both energies within us - but make sure you always look after both sides of you okay?
You‚Äôre cute :)
Damn sib.  You got the legs for that skirt
what does ootd mean?
Looking fantastic my friend üòÅ
Great outfit
This skirt is so cute!!
You look amazing!
You look so good!!! Hope you had a lovely night!!!

Omg you look so amazing!!
I'm so glad this made you happy and confident! You look great üòä
Cute!
The biggest issue that I found with skirts is that they are sized based on hip size.  I have bought skorts that appear to be the right size and they are loose of even fall off.
Great look and hair!! Looking very good
Cute, you and Frankie match!
Looking fabulous!
You're so cute! Love the look :D
*from one non-binary to another*
***You rocking that skirt you non-binary beauty you*** ‚ù§

(all jokes aside the skirt looks poggers <33)
You look so cute!

Get it, regal!
You look amazing! And I hope you don‚Äôt mind me saying but I think you‚Äôd look super awesome with a pair of heeled boots!
Aaahhhhh!!! The whole fit is so good!! You look great!
bestie lookin fab
You look amazing!!
You look great
Thank you so much. It felt so nice to present in a way I don‚Äôt normally get to. My parents recently moved to another state which gave me the confidence to say fuck it
Exskirtience? No..
Tysm! Going right to goodwill as soon as I get the chance to look for more cute stuff like this
Same
Thank you!!!
100000% gonna do this
My boyfriends mom called me cute and she said that if anyone in her family told me any different then she‚Äôd fight em hehehe
TY!!! I‚Äôm actually in my boyfriends room for this pic since and all the background stuff is his. He has the best room decor imo
I got a haircut just recently and I love how much bounce it gave my hair. Before it was shoulder length everywhere and fell a lot more flat
Thank you!! I for sure felt it in this look :))
OMG YES! I saw your post and you look great! Proud of us both
I want to learn more than just eyeliner but today was also the first time I tried double wings and it looked more innocent than my normal look which is just one curly wing
Yee I‚Äôve always kinda preferred my face with a bit of facial hair on it but I prefer my body with a skirt on. Luckily I don‚Äôt care if someone sees me having both because I look adorable with both
TY I love them and I love how they look naturally. Idk if I‚Äôll ever do hrt but I love my legs just how they are
It means ‚Äòoutfit of the day‚Äô (but really I went through two since earlier I was feeling more masc and was wearing some skinny ripped black jeans and in the evening I felt confident and femme enough to pull this look off)
I think Bobby pins can help you to an extent. That‚Äôs how my mom used to do it
Oooh thrift shops are so much fun! üòäüòäüòä
That's great!
you‚Äôre so right !!
It looked awesome, I can't really put on eyeliner in a good manner yet
You absolutely are adorable.  This is very inspiring for NBs.  Thanks for sharing! Look forward to more love pics
Did you have a Dress Go Spinny moment?
And I love your looks over all and I think you're adorable and cute.
Okay thank you
YES!!! OFC I DID! I was spinny at the host stand of the restarting we went to :)) but the skirt doesn‚Äôt fan out a whole lot
Even cis girls want a Dress Go Spinny moment.   I dang near fell over when I did mine I was so happy."	viqk3h	NonBinary	1219	1.0	2022-06-23 06:46:26

Great pic! Great look! What does ootd mean?
Omg! I love your outfit! The anklet and the hills suit really well on you!
I love the court heels with this outfit; you look great! I was on the fence about trying a pair myself but now I‚Äôm gonna try them! The anklet is a very cute touch.
Well done Sir Great positive attitude! Great look too - it suits you.
Great outfit!!
Look at you just rocking this outfit!
Oh! And the ancklet! Such a nice touch.

Oooooh. Well I like the outfit of the day :)
Ty
Hey thanks very much! I think what stands out the most is two things...

1. How comfortable you look / feel which comes through to the viewer.
2. You look brave and honourable.

So well done once again.
True but I still like it xD;
I'm not the OP, just answering your question since I knew :)
I just be me and wear what makes me feel beautiful. But your comments make me feel beautiful as well.
Thank you, I realised after i replied
Hey thank you very much!
Would I look better with hose?
The comfort bravery and honour I see are not anything to do with what your wearing. Once someone can see a soul the exterior is unimportant - your soul is wonderful. 

Next question?

I got a question - can you get a surgery like this without doing hormones first? Cause I don't wanna do hormones and my breasts give me massive dysphoria.
Thank you! The revision was a lot easier than the original mastectomy lmao
Thank you! It's definitely my favorite I have lmao
Thank you!! üíï
Depends on the surgeon. Mine specifically required I be on testosterone for 6 months before he would perform surgery, but not every surgeon requires it. I also had to have a letter of recommendation from my therapist."	jeferg	NonBinary	626	1.0	2020-10-20 01:12:27

Oh. That‚Äôs not fair. Do your coworkers always chat to you at work, on breaks etc? And they went all rude just because you‚Äôre wearing something a little different? 
Sounds like a them problem and not a you problem. Sorry you had that happen
Everyone knows I'm non binary as I came out in 2020. Most people are remote. Idk, my boyfriend said to let it go and said I was very pretty. I feel like dirt
Don‚Äôt feel like dirt! 
Some people can‚Äôt handle things which are outside the typical boundaries. That being said, some of them could make the effort to socialise!
Did they just flat out ignore you or say anything rude? I‚Äôm really pissed that they behaved like that."	wdgnpf	NonBinary	130	1.0	2022-08-01 12:48:18

professional ootd, no hose as I had runs in all my pairs		"I love love love those shoes on you!!
The skirt length and style is so nice on you! Is the top a work uniform top? If so, try pairing it with a navy or orange toned skirt, I think that would go nice too!

ootd, not sure but my shoes are nice		"You better work it hunny! üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæüíúüíú If I were you I would choose a blue heel to match the shirt.
With high waisted slim fitting skirts - tops with more volume, tucked out, only tucked In front/side - are usually a good mix.
I like your skirt ‚ò∫Ô∏è
They are a bit clunky, but just as you, Im not sure if I like em or not.  
That skirt looks great on you.
Honestly? I‚Äôm digging it
Took me forever seeing your posts to realize that ootd means outfit of the day and isn't a greeting in some language I don't know.
Aww ty"	vtjgg5	NonBinary	76	0.98	2022-07-07 14:04:03
