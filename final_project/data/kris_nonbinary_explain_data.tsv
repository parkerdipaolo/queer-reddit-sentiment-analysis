My closeted nonbinary ass explaining to my parents why I'm going to my sister's wedding in a suit. Waiting for a binder. Also I'm selling cars now		"Looks fantastic on you! If I drove, I'd consider buying lol
If you don't do a Loki cosplay this Halloween, missed opportunityyyyy. You look good!
Loving this look!
*pats roof* this baby can hold so much enby envy!
This album is a 10/10 descent into madness, and I love it.
That suit is fireeeeee!!
*Buys a new car I don’t even need*
You actually look like a car salesperson
Because dresses can be hella annoying after hours of wearing them. Also, suits with pockets are so much easier to find
What explanation could possibly be necessary beyond the fact that you look damn good in a suit?
*taps roof of car*

This baby can fit so much [GENDER EUPHORIA] inside it!
Omg this suit is FINE and I need one!!! Also love your expressions with the cars you seem like a really fun person lol
Omg LOVE your suit!! Where did you get it? The color is something I have a mighty need for.  I have a closet full of dresses and gowns but I probably should have a good suit as well, and this is my fav color! 

At any rate, I’d trust you with my car-buying needs.  Hope your binder arrives soon!  You look *fantastic*!
Everyone looks good in a suit, I don't know why your parents would be against you wearing one to a wedding.
oh my god i love this
Lookin’ good fam! Also I swear your facial expression and pose in the last pic reminds me so strongly of some character from something but I can’t put my finger on it and that’s going to bother me
I'm sold 🤩
Sharp looking suit, though.
Rad! I wanna buy a suit *and* a car now.
Pack it up Phoenix Wright, ace attorney

&#x200B;

Fr though you look so good. That color is amazing on you :)
Oh my god how did you get so much bigger than that car
You look so good! My uncle’s wedding is in a month and I still can’t decide if i want to wear a suit or a dress. I’m only out to my sister but still my cousin was like ‘of course you’ll be in a suit’ because she knows me so well lmao
that suit does give “can i interest you in this bad boy” vibes and i love it
*im here to talk to you about your car’s extended warranty*
I want to say something, but I fear it would be taken as hitting on you.

So I'll just say that I adore that suit, your sense of humour is awesome, and I love your dimples!
That fit is killer, you look fabulous,  fucking SLAY!💜
Give me total Loki vibes 😍
I'd let you scam me!!! Jokes aside you look DAPPER AF. Go get em 😉🖤💜💛
I'm saving this for outfit inspo! Thank you!

You look like President Loki and it’s incredible
WEDDINGS ARE FOR CLOSERS
You have a real Loki/Sylvie /Trickster vibe going on here - and I say that as a compliment.
*slaps car* This baby can fit so much gender euphoria in it
You have such an amazing energy, have an amazing wedding <3
these photos are so funny and joyous. thank you for sharing
I can't believe you had to explain! That suit looks amazing on you and you're clearly EXCEEDING the formal dress code. Good for you! My youngest sister wore a suit to something in high school years ago -- I think homecoming? -- and it looked amazing!!
Omg thank you for all the upvotes and awards and messages, this is amazing, you are all so awesome and funny I can't even even ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WOW YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK AMAZING HOLY FUC

You don't need a license to drive this baby!! 🚘 It has a matching remote controller and goes up to ALL the miles per hour!! Only now when buying it you can get additional feature package that incudes:

- making ""broom broom"" when starting

- going ""zyoom zyoom"" on the turns

- and the color RED that makes it go even FASTER!!! (everyone knows red cars are the fastest, trust me bro)
Omg it fits so well, I'm definitely doing it now!!! 💚💚💚 Thanks for the idea!
I also love it! 😍 I just got it 🤩
Lol ya beat me to it.
r/BeatMeToIt dayumm I was looking for this kinda joke lol
Oh honey, not only this album, my whole life is just me getting progressively more chaotic when I thought it was already impossible 😂
I wish I went with that answer... Instead I went with overdramatic ""A dress? Like a girl? EWWWWW"" and everyone laughed
Seconding this.

I am in the market for a suit and this one looks so good!
and good luck w the binder!!
❤️Thanks and you're welcome for the sleepless night! Let me know when you find the character, I look like that on half of my photos form parties 🤣

You have the suit and the knack. Go out there and get that commission.
>goes up to ALL the miles per hour!!

If we assume that ""ALL the miles"" means one circuit of the Earth, then that's 24,901 mph. That's nearly 7 miles per second, which is probably illegal in a school zone.

Ha! Got you there! I already work for a luxurious car company! I do something completely different and know shit about cars, but now is the time for the change!!
but that wouldn't be ALL the miles... what if we assume all the miles of the universe? which is an infinite number of miles, and an infinite nunber of miles per second, which sounds slightly more illegal in a school zone.
Probably ,
😂😂😂 That's my new life motto now.
Let's make the roads upside down again!!
You're awesome, thank you!
Oh wow that’s only like $40 USD! 
Too bad shipping 💀
Thank you so much!!
It's an infinite and ever-increasing number of miles, which is an infinite and ever-increasing number of miles per second! EXTRA illegal!
My pleasure!

I (22) came out to my boyfriend (24) as afab non-binary and he was fine with dating me until I told him I want to get a chest binder. (I also have no idea what flair to put for this post)	"First off, we’ve been together for a month. 

And I’ve explained to him that me having a female chest is causing major gender dysphoria and his response was “if you turn into a guy then that’s a deal breaker.” My bf obviously likes my chest while I hate it. EDIT to add: he also said “no don’t do that. I like your chest.” 

I may delete this post because I know the answer is obvious. I should break up with him if he doesn’t accept me. I’ve given him the weekend to process everything since I’ll be out of town. 

I just need advice.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the advice. I just need to find a way to break up with him nicely. I’m sure I’ll find another partner eventually that accepts the real me.

EDIT 2: I was straightforward about why I broke up with him and he hasn’t responded. Which I expected. Even though I’m upset that I’m not in a relationship, I’m also happy because it wasn’t a good relationship in the first place. Again, thank you all for the help ❤️"	"Yeah, in your situation there isn't much else to do I believe. The guy is into women, and you are not a woman after some reflection, so it's understandable that it wouldn't fit together. Try and break up as amicably as you can -- you can probably stay friends. If that's any reassurance I'm certain you'll find another partner later who will take you as you are. I wish you well and I hope this goes as well as possible.
you're right on the money babe. find someone who likes you for *you* not the made up version of you they have in their head. if he's only ""fine with it"" if he can pretend you're cis, he's not actually fine with it at all (and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)
The deal breaker comment alone would be enough to dump him for me. I get that people have their preferences,  but ""turn into a guy"" is a poor choice of words.
You absolutely can find folks who don’t just “tolerate” you and who don’t put themselves between you and what you want to do with your gender expression.

As for breaking up gently, I’m sure you’ve got this. Advice abounds, but just be clear about how you’re not willing to put him before your needs. This isn’t happening because you’re interested in binding or because you’re not a woman, it’s because you two don’t mesh and your boundaries are clashing.
you are who you are and you can't/shouldn't have to change it for a partner, but he's straight and into women, that's also nothing he can or should change. 

this is a situation where neither of you are right/wrong or anything, you just don't seem to be a good fit as a couple.
i’m sorry this happened to you. but i’m glad you’re taking care of yourself and ending it. in terms of doing it nicely, i would say just be straightforward and honest. “i like you, but i need to do what is best for me. if this is a dealbreaker for you, then i’m sorry, but this relationship isn’t right for me.” it sounds like he also doesn’t respect your terms/pronouns, if he insists on calling you his gf, so if you do want to maintain a friendship you might want to have a serious conversation about that. even if he doesn’t fully understand your gender identity, he needs to respect you. i also hope you can start binding to help with your dysphoria! i struggle with the same, binding helps a lot. ❤️
There's a lot of great responses here, but there's a couple of things I wanted to touch on and emphasize as someone who has been in a similar situation. You sound like you have things really figured out on your end, but in case anyone else needs this:

There's two things at play here:

1 - your boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

2 - his boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

The way I see it, people in relationships (regardless of romantic or not) negotiate these boundaries and preferences through communication, particularly ""I"" statements. We can't control what the other person does or wants, but we can state what we need to continue this voluntary relationship, and leave if these aren't met.

You did this - you trusted him with important, relevant information about who you are and how he can best respect you (terms like ""partner"" for instance).

What he did, from an outsider's perspective, is respond - not with ""I"" statements that communicated his boundaries in a respectful way - but with ""you"" statements and ultimatums, while ignoring your needs. IMHO, relationships shouldn't come down to ""do this or I'll leave."" It's much more like, ""This is what I need, and I'll be adult enough to communicate to you if this will no longer work for me.""

The difference is this:

""If you express your gender in this way, that's a deal-breaker.""

VS

""I like you a lot, but I only see myself in romantic relationships with people whose gender identity and expression matches that of a feminine woman. I am sorry that our needs and preferences no longer match up.""

Your gender identity, your expression, isn't the problem and should never be made to seem that way by a partner. The issue is that your have different wants and needs that no longer line up.

All of this is to say -- I'm sorry that you had to try to read the tea leaves of his thoughts and preferences and make this decision for him (though of course it's for you as well). This breakup should've probably come from him, with him communicating what he needed in response to your own communication, not him blasting past your needs, disrespecting your identity, to try to keep the relationship the same.

Anywho, that's my 2 cents as an internet stranger.
Dump his ass
You’re not transitioning to male just from wearing a chest binder lol wtf? Lots of nonbinary people wear binders without being full on FTM. 

I wear a binder during the day, and I enjoy my partner playing with my chest during sex (it feels good to me!) It’s a win-win arrangement for us. I think your bf is being unreasonable. I could see him drawing a line with top surgery, that seems reasonable, but a binder is literally just clothing.
I agree. Being with someone who doesn't accept the true you is worse then being alone. Just be safe and be honest, that's the best way to do it. Good luck 😌
I’m so very glad you broke up with this person (friendly internet hugs or high five) I was about to comment how it’s a serious red flag and he has a stipulation on who you are or are not “allowed” to be- but then re-read the edits :) I’m so so glad you found that out a month in and didn’t waste anymore time.

Especially where chests are involved. I like plastic surgery/conformation surgeries specifically and hate when people mod their chests due to what someone else likes or dislikes. Like you have to live with it and all the pros/cons it comes with
He was fine with your gender as long as je could ignore it. He wasn't fine with dating you, he was fine with imagining you were a cis woman then ignoring who you were entirely and using corrective measures to get you to conform to his vision. You aren't woman-lite. Glad you stood up for yourself and dropped him
Get rid! My partner met me when I identified as a trans man. I wasn’t transitioning any time soon and so was really distrustful of him even being with me (he was previously only with girls). 

He has stayed with me the whole time, only ever respected me, used he/him pronouns without question behind my back and to my face, and always called me boyfriend or partner on my request. I now realise I’m non-binary and he’s adjusted everything accordingly. The right partner is out there for you. 

You can’t really blame your partner for being straight - I can understand where he’s coming from. He didn’t sign up for you to not be a cis woman really. But then he isn’t the best person for you. Glad to read your update and I wish you all the best in the future! The right person for you is out there! Xx
Hi, I'm also afab nonbinary, just wanting to share my experiences with this. 

Due to my transphobic and homophobic fathers side of the family, I was very fearful of my identity and never tried to figure myself out. So I've always been nonbinary, but after a huge wave of dysphoria a few months ago I actually identified as enby and came out to one person, my boyfriend. 

He and I were together for 3 years before this, but it was still nerve wracking especially because he swore he was straight. I was scared shitless coming out to him, but after I did he accepted me. I told him I'm comfortable with any pronouns but mostly they/them. I cut my hair ""boy short"" and have been experimenting with it ever since. He refers to me in whichever ways I feel most comfortable and will say different terms for me that make me happy. He's since said that he's pan (but really is only attracted to me) and has made a lot of validating and progressive comments. 

So, I promise you there is (yes, even men) that will accept you and love you for who you are. I also want to start binding even though my chest is already ""small,"" and I just want you to know I understand. You are loved and you will continue to be loved more than ever. Best of luck, friend!
Just commenting to let you know that there are guys out there who will love you for you. I’m 23 afab non-binary and I came out to my cishet boyfriend about 6 months ago and he has been nothing but supportive. He uses my pronouns correctly and corrects other people (and myself even) when they use the wrong pronouns. He’s helped me find more masc clothing and given me advice on what mens-style clothing looks best on me. I can tell that he still really loves me deeply and supports me and my gender identity. So there is hope out there! You will find someone so stay positive!
Yeah, I think you made the right choice. He didn't love you, he loved your chest
Hi pal. I am afab non binary and married to a woman. My wife has always identified as gay and is not attracted to men in any way shape or form. I have always had severe gender dysphoria surrounding my chest as well. My wife is actually the person who first started talking to me about being non binary. I had no idea what it was until then. She suggested top surgery to me. I never thought about that before either. Due to finances, I can’t get top surgery very soon so she ordered me a chest binder. I’ve asked my wife how she feels about me being non binary and not being feminine at all, and she always says that I’m her person. She doesn’t care what gender I am. My point to you is, you WILL find your person too. Get the chest binder, you will not regret it.
If He's going to get upset about a binder he's clearly got more problems going on.
I broke up with my bf not long ago, but he was a huge boobs guy. I hate my chest, and I got a breast reduction a few years ago. Before I told him about the reduction, he always said that he liked me for who I was. BUT after he found out that I had a reduction, he couldn't let it go. He was obsessed, saying that if we have been together he would have tried to talk me out of it. He would fantasize over my old pictures, and make me feel terrible about myself even though I'm much more happy now. 
I honestly don't believe it's worth it. I gave him a chance, and I told him how much it hurt my feelings when he would say hurtful things like this. But eventually it got to be too much
Much love OP ❤️
Glad to read you put him in the bin where he belongs!!
if they don’t accept you for who you are and how you want to present yourself, then they’re not worth your time. you did the right thing, i wish u good luck on your journey👾
I get it. I (35 AFAB) am dating a man. Luckily he has no idea what being Agender means. But there are other issues to the relationship.    

I plan to leave and go on my own when I can. I have to save up first.
So I want to be clear about something.  While your Ex-BF may have not been nice about it, neither of you are wrong.  He doesn't have to be in a relationship with you if you're not what he likes/wants either physically or mentally.  AT the same time, you have a right to find someone who will love and respect you for who you are.  It was best that you ended things with him.
You're going to find someone who loves and celebrates you in all your enby glory! I'm glad you made room for it.

💛🤍🖤💜
OP people should love their partner no matter how they look. Think of it like this; he wouldn’t like you if you had to get them removed because of a medical reason. Even if that reason was your own peace of mind. He can’t even comprehend you doing the nonperminent solution, so that tells you how things would play out in the future if that is something you want.
Awww! I’m really impressed with you! You identified something that was not ok with you, identified when he said something that was essentially a red flag for controlling your identity, and then you found a way to exit that felt ok for you. I feel like I sucked at making any of those statements because I didn’t want to summarize anything in a way that didn’t feel authentic, but I also want to honor what you did because it’s really hard.

You deserve to be in relationships where your identity is cherished and supported. I would be incredibly sad if I broke up with someone and they didn’t respond too. It’s so hard to move forward with our that closure. 

❤️❤️❤️
A girlfriend I dated had a preference when it came to my hair. She liked that it was long and even though it was sometimes uncomfortable and i thought short hair looked better on me I liked it because she liked it. I cared more about what she liked on me then what I liked on me. I say “what I liked” but because she liked it I didn’t dislike it 🤔.. yuh know. If you care more about what you want different about yourself than what your boyfriend likes about you as you are then that’s cool but is that really the case. Obviously hair is much different so how about this. I’d love to have a vagina (this isn’t hypothetical) but if my girlfriend loves my penis I love the fact and even feel fortunate that I have one. I would think ugh what if I had a vagina then I’d want a penis because I’d know my girlfriend wants that more. Or if your girlfriend thinks you’re an ass wouldn’t you want to not be an ass or would you just be selfish and think “I’m just an asshole this is who I am”. Idk just something to think about 🤷‍♂️ wouldn’t you want to be what your boyfriend wants? Obviously to a certain extent. Like if if he want to be a druggy (hard drugs) and wants you to be one with him then of course but your chest?? I don’t really get what the big deal is and you broke up over it??
P.S. idk maybe I think this way because I’m a very submissive person.
May I commit physical violence?
Hey, I know you already solved the issue but I just want to say as a fellow afab non binary person that I am so proud of you for putting yourself first. Our identify is more important than any partner. You rock.
it’s been a month, break up with him
I think it is really harsh that just because you might wear a binder he would not date you anymore lol. Definitely not one to keep imo, you are not your chest and deserve someone who will like you no matter your chest ey.
All the best, and best wishes going forward.
Really happy to hear you felt safe/comfortable with getting out of a relationship that wasn't working out for you. You put your own happiness and wellbeing first, and that's something to be proud of.
i had a similar situation happen where my friends were dating the male didnt want his significant other to get top surgery. i would say break up with him. sometimes, as accepting as men may seem they may put that and simply use people to get what they want.
I had a similar situation a few months ago where my gf took an interest in a female coworker after I expressed that I was non-binary. She denied everything for months, until we were drunk one night and she said she’d just started identifying as lesbian and didn’t know where I fit into that. Just take your time with yourself and enjoy openly expressing yourself and exploring what makes you happy!
That sucks, but you did the right thing. Better a month wasted on the unworthy than years.
was going to comment then i saw your edits. you did the right thing, i’m around the same age & if someone won’t love you for who you are you don’t need them. i’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself!!
Imo if he presents you with the ultimatum of ""if you become a guy it's a deal breaker"" then he ain't it chief. I get it not everyone's on the spectrum but kinda shitty to be like ""you can't be who you want to be""
break up with him. y’all only been dating a month, not worth it.
I know this has already been dealt with my but I wanted to reinforce that the break up was smart! This exact same thing happened to me when I figured out I was some form of non-binary and started exploring my gender in high school. My at the time boyfriend (now ex) said he supported me but that he couldn’t date me if I ended up being a boy and that he didn’t like when I dressed masculine or even mentioned my dysphoria with my body. Well that ended up being one of the many red flags that I should’ve seen in the early relationship because he became abusive within 3 months of dating and I got stuck with him for a year and 5 months
Best of luck for you to find a better and accepting partner!
Yo this shit why it would take a miracle for me to date a cishet
First, ew. You did the right thing. It’s sad that he said what he did but telling someone that they like them for a part of them that they openly say causes discomfort is just freaking disgusting.

I hope you find people to surround you and affirm your identity. You deserve to present the way you want to, screw presenting to others. You had to do that crap for 16-18 years, you earned the right to be you.
I think breaking up with him was the right choice, but unless you were already digital/ldr then breaking up over message is pretty lame.
I'm glad you broke up with him! Even though he is straight I still think the way he responded wasn't right - you have a right to your own bodily autonomy even if it's something that he personally would rather you do different. I'm straight too and I like boobs more than anyone I've met but if my girlfriend wanted to wear a binder, I wouldn't stop her. It's her choice what to do with her body, just like it's your choice what you do with yours.
my spouse came out as non-binary before i did. i can’t imagine not being supportive of anything they feel, or them not being supportive of anything i feel. if this is causing a problem now, then he’s probably not going to change. find someone who loves you for you, no matter who you are or what you look like.
You've already made the right choice so I'll just say that you cannot hold it against yourself if they don't take it well. Block them if you need to, if it's best for you.
Congrats on the first step of moving on to discover someone who loves you more than the sum of your parts. I wish you all the best, because you deserve someone who can compromise and make concessions for your mental health and wellbeing. You deserve to be reassured and supported, and he wasn't doing that for you. I'm sorry.
Congratulations, and I’m sorry you had to go through that
im so proud of you for making the right decision!! take a biig hug from me (if you want one :3)
Even though the answer is obvious you just got to vent and have people behind your back agreeing with you and makes the situation so much better.
I’m so proud of you for putting your well-being first and not giving in to your ex’s pressure. You will find someone who loves and supports you completely, I guarantee it!!
Oh no after reading this and some of the comments I  just realized I might be in this exact situation right now
good for you for doing that, i know it will have been hard if you cared about him but you’ll be happier when you find someone who loves you the way you are :))
I’ve tried to date straight boys before, it’s not worth it
I can see I'm too late to change your mind and I'm probably going to be the only person with this opinion, but I think you should give your boyfriend some time before going for the nuclear option. I mean, a 1 month relationship isn't that big of a loss (in the scheme of things at least), but coming out as NB is a lot for a romantic partner to process and it's something you may have to do again in the future. When I came out to my wife, she found many different ways to express how repulsed she was by the idea of me being feminine. At one point, I remember complimenting her on a dress and her response was to put on this disgusted look and say, ""did you want to borrow it or something?"" That was about a year ago and, even though she still struggles with my gender identity, she becomes more accepting every day. Yesterday, she freely offered to go out with me in support when I told her I was nervous about wearing a dress to a concert I'm going to. It sounds like this guy may not have been *the one*, but one of these days, you might have someone really great that just needs some time.
You... broke up by text..?
Kinda arrived after the war, but just wanted to say congrats for breaking up. I'm very sorry it had to happen, truly, but I'm impressed you stood for yourself. I really hope it gets better for you!
Thanks. And I will. I’ll figure out a way to break up with him.
Yeah, I’ve thought about that too. Plus he refers  to me as “his girlfriend” and not “partner” like I want him to. And I agree with what you said, I (as many other enby’s) do deserve to have our gender celebrated and not tolerated. I just need to figure out a way to break up with him nicely.
It's not wrong for him to want to be with a woman, because that might just be what his orientation is. But pretending that the OP was a woman after they came out as NB is where he went wrong. If he wasn't okay with a partner who wasn't a woman, then he should have been up front with the OP and said that he didn't swing that way, rather than what he actually did.
>you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

I like this
>(and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

Quote of the century right there.
These are the correct words.
I’ve found people who celebrate my sexuality but tolerate my gender, and people who tolerate my sexuality but celebrate my gender. You’re 100% right, and I hope someday I’ll find (or maybe have found!!!!) the one who does both.
It was for me too. And I know. While I prefer being mistaken as a guy I don’t want to fully transition into a guy. If that makes sense.
I know. 

And I did. I was straightforward about why I broke up with him but in a nice way.
It’s okay and I’m glad I’ve ended it. And thanks! I’m planning on ordering a chest binder this weekend but I’m not sure where to get one from. I’ve heard that GC2B are good ones.
I 100% agree with what you’re saying. It should’ve come from him but he continually misgendered me when I told him multiple times I didn’t like the term “girlfriend” and he wasn’t going to change then I decided enough was enough.
I did
I know. But I eventually want to get top surgery because I want a flat chest.
Thanks :)
Me too! (internet high five) 

And I eventually want to get top surgery but I’m going to wait till I’m financially stable and living on my own since I still live with my parents at the moment.
I’m glad I got rid of him and that’s so cool! I’m happy for you :) and I know.
Hey. And ah, I’m glad everything worked out for you! 

And I know I’ll find someone eventually. I’m also pan so I don’t really care who I date/marry. It just my ex refused to use the pronouns I wanted and stuff. And yeah. I know I’ll find someone eventually
Oh he definitely loved my chest and not me. His other response to me chest binding was “No don’t do that. I like your chest.” And that’s when I knew I needed to break up with him.
For sure. I’m glad I broke up with him.
I wish you luck and hope for you to be free ans independent soon!
I agree. And I eventually want to get them removed once I have enough money to do so.
Lol sure. I actually thought about that too 😂
I’m going to
I know lol
Thanks
I know. When he said that I decided I was going to break up with him. Which I did and I’m so happy I’m not with him anymore.
Yeah for sure. I also should’ve included this in my original text but he also said “No don’t do that. I like your boobs.” So that’s when I knew he liked my chest more than me. 

And I am. Thankfully my dad and siblings and friends accept me for who I am.
I know breaking up thru text is pretty lame. But our relationship was digital.
I’m glad too and yeah that makes sense. Like I get that he likes boobs, heck I’m pansexual, and I like boobs too but just not my own 😂  but the fact that he knew it caused me gender dysphoria and didn’t care was a red flag.
I know. And i did block him.
Thanks and it’s okay. At least I realized it a month and not any time later
Thanks! And I’ll take the hug :)
Oh no! Hope everything turns out alright for you
Yeah.
I don’t think I went for the nuclear option. I came out to him as non-binary before and he was okay with dating me UNTIL I said I’m getting a chest binder. That was the dealbreaker since he didn’t respect my decision and he liked my breasts more than me. So I broke up with him.
Yeah
If you're thinking of breaking up, just straight up tell him something like ""I think we're not compatible anymore, we have different values/views and continuing like this will not benefit either of us."" Preferably *in a public setting* to make sure you're safe. Don't get into a whole ""You hurt my feelings"" thing, it's very tempting but the mature way is the truth, and (based on his comments) the truth is that you guys just aren't compatible. You don't owe him or anyone else an explanation for why you're choosing yourself over a relationship that might not be serving you anymore.

Alternatively, (again in a public setting lol) you could try explaining more about Nonbinary people/the community/casually bring up any Nonbinary role models you have, watch Anthony Padilla's vid on NB people together lol, ect. If this is his first time hearing about all of this he probably has a lot to think about and needs both the information from you and time to himself to think about your relationship. Maybe it's not over, maybe you just need time, patience, and be willing to work together to figure this out as a team (NOT settle!). Again as long as you make sure you're safe, this is an option too.
Even if I’m with a cis person or a binary trans person I still hate the words “girlfriend” and “Boyfriend” partner is jsut the superior term ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
honestly he should know what's coming. you could start calling him your girlfriend until he gets tired of it :3 (this is a bad idea do not do this)
I was in your place a few years ago and I made the wrong choice (stayed with the asshole) out of fear that I couldn't get any better than someone tolerating my transness. Wasted 3 of the best years of my life with someone who treated me poorly.

Anyways, like 3 months after we broke up I met the person of my dreams and every day with him feels like a fairytale, he loves me and is proud to introduce me to his friends and family as his partner, and supports and respects my decisions and bodily autonomy. Been together over a year and a half now, planning on getting a place together in the next few months, depending.

What I'm trying to say is, your person is out there! Life is too short to waste on people that don't appreciate all of you. Don't settle for anything less than exactly what you want in a partner!
I had been with a supposedly young enby and they called me their ""girlfriend"" and it was upsetting. I have learned from dating or knowing many closeted and  not fully open sexual minorities since I have been out that you will only feel bad hiding who you are and as my therapist has said, some relationships do not survive a transition but that is true.
It does :) because you’re non binary. I’m the exact same in that respect. Means we don’t adhere to the binary- which male is. People can be so silly :/
Makes sense to me, I feel that honestly
gc2b binders are very good! i got my first binder from there, but unfortunately i have problems with my shoulders which makes it hard to get on/off, so i can't wear it anymore
My fiance has a couple. The black one fits better than the nude one they got even though they're the same size? It's odd. Just don't be afraid to go up or down a size if the first one isnt just right!
Hell yeah!
Had to comb the comments for this!! I literally cheered ❤️
Yeah. In that case sounds like y’all ultimately won’t be compatible
Aw that’s wonderful! Yeah it’s definitely really expensive. When you’re living on your own too, insurance might cover some of it? Something to look into. I’m so excited for you!!!
Thank you!
Alright! I’ll get me mallet!
Hence why I prefaced it with that lol, I understand in that case. It can’t be helped. You did what was necessary ❤️
Yeah maybe I just understand what it is like because I'm trans lol. I wouldn't want to cause someone that discomfort even if I liked that part of their body before.

I was actually kinda excited to grow boobs at first because that meant I would have a pair of boobs I could play with 24/7 (I was obsessed with boobs even back then) but when it happened I was like ""what the fuck is this"" because they actually caused me great dysphoria lmao.
\*hugg*
Well he broke up with me now so I guess it did turn right
That's... a very last resort thing to do
I agree. I prefer the term “partner” it’s nice to say lol.
I prefer the term joyfriend to partner. Partner is for marriage.
Ok but....lovefriend? Absolutely a lovely term to get called too, just feels SO good lmao~
Lol I thought about doing that. But I didn’t. I blocked him after he responded with “ok have a good life”
Similar boat, I settled for someone because I thought they were the best I could find as a non-binary person. They were asexual, I am not; I wasted almost 1.5 years.

Over 1.5 years later I’ve just found another enby who seems super promising. I really hope this ends up going well!!!
Cool :) and yeah, I know. Heck, my mom is convinced I’m trans when I’ve told her multiple times I’m not :/ my dad and siblings on the other hand are fine with me being non-binary.
Im planning on getting one from there. I need to email the GC2B support people to figure out my size. Since my chest size is bigger than my shoulder width I’m not sure which size to get.
Ah cool, that’s good to know. I’m also going to get the tank binder instead of the half binder, seems like it’ll fit better. And I may get two of two different sizes and see which one fits better.
Yep :) I’m happy and I’m going to order a chest binder this weekend :D
Yeah, hopefully my insurance will cover some of it. And yeah, I’m really looking forward to it :)
Lol I know :) and yeah. Hopefully I’ll find someone better in the future :)
*hugg* thanks :)
They were together a month. Hardly enough to warrant a large break up discussion. Text is very reasonable in this situation.
I'm personally fond of ""datemate""
My husband is absolutely wonderful about gender-neutral terms for me but I think I should have nipped ""snoogywoogums"" in the bud...
Awe that’s such a sweet name 🥺
Spouse is for marriage. I call my boyfriend my partner because we’re past boyfriend/girlfriend/joyfriend, we’ve been living together for years, but we’re not married yet.
Mmmm that’s quite dapper as well
You didnt have to block him.. he was gone. That's what have a good life means.
It’s such a weird thing- that when people learn one definition, they like stick to that a lot of the time, even if it doesn’t fit. It’s such an odd thing to me. Like partially trying to learn and be supportive but half not… 

It’s up to the individual. Like us. Me, I’m non binary and trans. You, you’re afab and non-binary :) both are equally valid. I’m very glad your dad and siblings are on board though, hopefully your mum will be soon too. Don’t see the point in insisting you’re something you’re not
yeah, i had that issue too. i'm fairly sure they recommend going with the larger size, but definitely email them to confirm!
I just want to reassure you they are the friendly staff ever. 

I had a problem thats taken weeks to solve (not their fault, my binder got lost in the Mexican mailing system) and they have offered me the best solutions and with great follow up.

10/10 for gc2b and my binder hasnt even arrived lol
Yeah they have tank ones. Not sure if they're made slightly differently or?
I’m happy for you. I wish you the best
I am so happy for you!!! Good for you for knowing what works and what does not! <3 I also love datemate as a term as someone said. Partner is good IMO bc it is gender neutral but then also I am like yes I am not straight haha.
I respectfully disagree. It leads to exactly this situation, where you aren't sure if they've read your message yet. Text is also a very bad medium for emotional stuff in general. It's cold. It wouldn't be an option to me personally even if we'd been together a week
Datemate is pretty cool! I'm a big fan of ""joyfriend"" personally
My name is Stevonnie.
I meant for me partner seems more serious than joyfriend or datefriend.
I mean he blocked me after he sent that so I did it back lol
So why does it matter?
Yeah I agree. 

And yeah, I know. And like I also want to do low-dose testosterone HRT to look more masculine. Plus It’s such a weird thing to explain to my mom lol.
I'm AMAB Nonbinary and I'm bisexual and polyamorous.
Ah. And yeah, I was planning on getting a size bigger but wanted to confirm with them first.
That’s cool! I emailed them a couple hours ago for advice on what size binder I should get. Should hear a response soon :)
Thank you!
Thanks! And haha yeah datemate is pretty cool too
ooooh I am liking both datemate and joyfriend! I personally ask my partners to call me ""babefriend"" lol
Oh I meant joyfriend, but hi Stevonnie~ I’m willow
Oh yeah, that’s fair!
40% of people like boobs and 40% like twinkies. Why would anyone be mad at anyone for this? Do you like one or the other? Some people like both. That's ok too. But why are you mad at this fella?
Aw that’s awesome!
oh yeah absolutely. good luck and i hope you enjoy your binder when it comes!
That's great! I'm sure they'll help :)
Hoi, Willow!
Partner is for when you're living together but you're not married yet. Two of my coworkers are gay men. Both are very outgoing and energetic guys. One is slightly more feminine than the other one.
Thanks! Whenever it arrives I’ll definitely post a pic here :)
Yeah :) I’ve been wanting to order a chest binder for a while and I’m super excited to finally order one

Guess who broke my schools Gender structure 💛🤍💜🖤	"My sixth form is running the yearly Head Boy and Head Girl elections soon. I was debating whether I should run for it as my birth sex or not, but I spoke to my form tutor about it (who is an absolute legend by the way). She knows that I have a lot of internalised homophobia and etc from my old school, so she told me not to be afraid of who I am and it really inspired me! 

I emailed my head of sixth form explaining that I am Non Binary and thus I would like to run as ‘Head Person’ or something along those lines instead, arguing that it was more inline with modern gender inclusivity. 

He agreed with me and promised that he would re-make the election structure to allow me to run (as usually one boy and one girl are elected). This is me coming out to my year group and teachers, and everyone that knows about it so far has been to excited that I’ve done such a progressive thing!! 

I needed somewhere to share this because I’m so excited and proud! Thank you if you read this far <3"	"That’s so awesome! It sounds like you have some really supportive people working at your school. Wishing you the best of luck in your campaign to become head person!
""Head Person"" sounds a bit clunky but ""Head Student"" would be so good! It's inclusive and more descriptive of the role. Also if they want to refer to one specific Head Student, they could just say your name
It just made my day knowing that there are people out there who are willing to break the gender norms in our schools.
Thank you so much for your contribution. I will watch your career with great interest. Please do update or make another post as to whether you get Head person or not!
(◕ᴗ◕✿)
That's great! Hope you do well in the election. And hey, even if you don't win, imagine all the other closeted enbys at your school, looking at you and thinking, ""Hey... it's safe to come out.""
Yay!

💛🤍💜🖤
What you did was brave and will help others, too.
🥺🥺❤️❤️
That's awesome!

Good luck!
Great job yo!!
That's amazing! ❤
You should be proud ,that’s awesome ! ❤️
OMG brilliant! I'm so glad your teachers and everyone is supportive! Best of luck in the elections!
I wish I could run for head person ;;-;; I’m a masc nb, but I go to an all female school and sadly they’re very big with having the Only Head Girl thing
People really underestimate how easy it is to change policy at your school. Simply asking the right people can get you very far. I remember, both at my high school and college, just asking for help or accomodations started a few great programs. 

But also remember that you're probably not the only one dealing with your issues at your school, so just by asking, you can help others who are in a similar situation as yourself. Take the steps to ask for help, and you'll be helping more than just yourself.
God your so awesome! We need people like you to speak up and spread hope!
Good work!
great, proud of you 🙈
I am sharing in the excitement! Go you! You are helping that school take the right steps! And congrats on coming out to those people! I hope you are elected Head Person!
Stuff like this needs to happen more, awesome!
We stan
I'm sooo proud of you !
Omg you are so inspiring!! Not only did you advocate for yourself, but you’ve helped with updating traditions for others. You are goals ❤️
You are amazing! So glad you've got good adult allies at your school. Keep being your awesome self!
Congrats and good luck!
Also an older Non Binary person who went through hell within the school system long ago I say thank you. Amazing!
That’s amazing and gives me hope! Well done 💕
My sister's school has 2 Head Students now rather than girl/boy!!!! It's generally understood that the two people aren't usually of the same gender but if it came down to it there's no specific rule about it. Great system.

Good luck with it!!
I'm curious how it will change the game. One head girl, one head boy, one head person, making you automatically the head person as long as you don't lose to any other non binary competitor? Only one head person? Two head people regardless of their gender?

I need answers.
All I know is the title General Secretary has no gender, comrade
Based!
Oh my goodness that's awesome! Great job!!
Omg that's great!!  Good for you 💖💖
Epic. Good luck.
That’s fantastic!! Congratulations!! 😱😱❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻🏳️‍🌈
Sooooo..... Was ""Badass in Chief"" already taken?
Thank you so much!! My philosophy teacher called me a revolutionary which I think may be the best compliment even lmao
Thank you for the advice!!
I agree, ""Head Student"" sounds less strange. I said ""Head Person"" out loud and it was kind of funny.
Of course, I’ll be sure to update!! Thank you so much for your kind words
Hello! It’s been a while until I could update because COVID held everything back, but we got the election results this week. 

And....

I was elected!!

Me and my good friend were both elected to hold the two non gender exclusive offices as created by my head of sixth form and I couldn’t be more excited!

The fact that the sixth form and teachers elected me just shows that people are getting more progressive and accepting, gives some hope :))
Thank you! I do hope that I can help other people with it <3
Thank you 🥺
Thank you so much <3
That’s so true! Hopefully by making even small changes we can help other people in the future.
I plan to run my election campaign on making the school as progressive as it can possibly be <3
Thank you so much ☺️
Thank you so much 🥺🥺❤️
I hope that all is well for you now! Sending love <3🥺
That’s the system I proposed to my head of sixth form! I think it would work great
The system I proposed to my head of sixth form was two Head Students regardless of gender, but I’ll update it if he makes a different system!
To be fair the title General Secretary is pretty cool
Thank you 🥺🥺
💛🤍💜🖤
Good job my friend I hope your new position treats you well!

That’s amazing!!!"	jdej24	NonBinary	1365	1.0	2020-10-18 11:08:32
i fucking hate people	so i work at spencer’s right, and this older couple comes up to me asking if we have any small rainbow flags. i tell them no, sadly we only have small non-binary flags left. the man asks what non-binary is, so i explain, and in response he laughs in my fucking face??? keep in mind, i’m wearing a non-binary flag beanie, i have a non-binary pin, AND my pronouns on my lanyard. im already having a horrible day, it’s shipment day and it’s been fucking packed all day and this is the biggest shipment we’ve ever had. that remark genuinely set me over the edge and now i’m in the bathroom crying lol	"When I was young being gay or lesbian was offensive to the straight people.  Now there is a month of pride.  You exposed them to something new.  Sometimes a person's reaction is to laugh at things they don't understand.  You were brave.  What they do with this new knowledge is on them.  Thank you for teaching the Cis people.  Be you!
Im so sorry to hear that. I was at hot topic ( as a masc presenting NB) shopping for new clothes for fem stuff for  school. These people,  very clearly in there 50s, starts to destroy a fellow NB. Understandingy, I rushed over to help them. I hope they are doing well.
Ugh, that sucks. I used to work at an ice cream place, where I mostly sold sugar to cranky Floridians on vacation. Can't tell you the number of times crusty old Republicans would intentionally misgender me because I was...AFAB and had short hair. A person just existing was enough to set them off. Somedays I could give as good as I got, and others were like ""oh, this part of why LGBTQIA suicides are high"". 

When I have rough gender days, which thankfully is pretty infrequent lately, I watch an episode of something like Owl House or Schitt's Creek. Stuff where homophobia and transphobia just don't exist. Or I'll look up YouTube videos of Alok Vaid-Menon or Jonathan Van Ness. People who make me hopeful about the future while validating some of m6 current struggles.
fuck im so sorry that happened, people are dumbasses
I think its so cool you have your pronouns on your lanyard! After seeing half a dozen or so people doing this I finally very recently started putting my pronouns on my name tag. I'm pretty socially anxious so I knever told any of those inspirational people what seeing their pronouns meant to me. I bet you make nonbinary people who come into your store and see you feel awesome.
UGH I’m sorry people really suck sometimes. That’s just awful and you didn’t deserve that in any way :(((
I’m so sorry about that happening to you :/ slightly off topic tho, do you like working at Spencer’s?
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened people are so shitty.
Why can’t people just be respectful and not laugh at someone’s identity in their face??
It takes some skill to be that guy. I'm impressed. I take it he came up to you on all fours? After all, there's no way something with that small a brain could do the calculations to balance on two feet.
Man go follow there car and go throw a eggs at there house and dip
I had a similar experience at my job. I wear my pronouns at work and a young girl talked to her grandad about how cool and brave it was. He then came over and asked me about it and I politely explained and he made an attack helicopter joke.

My manager came over in case he needed to defend me and calm me down. Girl was telling her grandad off while I stood there calmly with eyes like ice. He went ""see she doesn't mind"". To which my response was ""they do, but I've heard all the jokes and have no energy to entertain it today"". I sent him into his film, thanked his granddaughter for being an ally and got on with my day.

The people that don't want to understand will either lose family or die off soon anyway. All we have to do is wait.
I’m sorry love, you’re very valid❤️
WHO let the bigots into that hot topic 😡😡😡 exit our sanctuary IMMEDIATELY
Sorry
I also hate these people but it's really cool that you work at spencer's
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Customers can be real shitheels.
That sucks im sorry
i am so sorry to hear this. people are delusional and rude!
same thing happened to me when i posted something with my avatar on r/gocommitdie, needless to say the people in the comments constantly shit on me because of my pride flag
That would press my defiant little buttons. Mm, makes me wanna chew that guy out.
It shouldn't be your responsibility to teach the straights when Wikipedia and Google are free, but you did. Their reaction says infinitely more about them than you
Oh my god. I'm so sorry. People are so insensitive and fucking rude. I don't understand why people can't just respect others. Even if they don't understand. Even if it doesn't make sense to them at the moment, there's no fucking reason to laugh when you're learning about an identity you don't relate to. You are valid, I'm sorry you went through this.
Bruh wtf. Who in the world would life at you like that?!
This may not be the case, however it could be that when he laughed he was laughing in pleasant surprise, like a celebration. Sometimes when I encounter something unexpected I laugh, not to be mean but to express gratitude and appreciation for life. In some situations it may not seem ""appropriate,"" however that tends to be an perspective held by people who don't often find reasons to laugh. 

To be clear, I am not dismissing your feelings or perspective. I don't have a way of confirming the spirit in which he laughed, and not everyone laughs in surprise. It could very well be that he thought the idea of gender non-conformity amusing rather than something worthy of respect. I'm simply offering another potential perspective.
Hope your feeling better OP <3 <3 <3
Sounds like a rough day. I hope everything turns around for you
Working retail is the fucking worst.
Yeah that shit pisses me off when peo do that especially my parent, like my dad will go on full rants about it and my mother will make snippy comm about it making it less easy to come out.
Assholes gonna be assholes!
I mean doesn't that qualify as becoming baligrant or rude can't you at this point I don't know redirect the customer out of the store and tell them they are no longer welcome.
You hate some people. Me too
Not to defend their behavior too much, but maybe the way you explained nonbinary was wrong in the context. Idk, I definitely see that different explanations are necessary for different people. If you went with some ""people who don't identify with being a man or a woman"" or ""outside the gender binary"" can simply be too vague for someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. It's like the explaining evolution 200 years ago and people going ""I didn't come from monkeys"".
What a douche, why’s he laughing when he’s the dipshit who not only doesn’t know what that is, but knows so little that he’s surprised to see a non cis person working in a place like Spencer’s (dunno what it’s like at your store but it was known as a place trans, gnc, and non cishet folks in general were when I was growing up). I think ppl like that are currently over-compensating with even more blatant mocking and assholery towards us because underneath the bravado they’re realizing they’re wrong.
pronouns on a lanyard 🗿
thank you 🥹🥹 that honestly makes me feel a whole lot better about it. in retrospect i was overreacting a bit but stressful days will do that to you
When I was young we were still getting pistol whipped to death for being gay.

All-in-all, we’ve come pretty far… Just gotta get the rest of the way. Now is not the time to lose hope or focus.
omg that’s horrible!! i hope they’re doing well too :(
Wtf what happened?
destroy them? Like yell at them or physically hurt them?! wtf?!
Literally Owl House is how I coped through dysphoria today it’s amazing
OMFG soOO many ppl here in florida always emphasizes to call me ""ma'am"" way more as of recent after NB became more well known, a lot of it had to do with me cross dressing, it's honestly annoying
that’s a great idea :) i’ll try that right now 

no but fr i worked in food service before and i wish so badly it was legal to spit in stupid peoples food
The intentional misgendering is so fucking dumb. When I was a cashier a guy saw my pronoun pin and kept looking me straight in the eyes and saying ""ma'am"" in this dramatic tone after every sentence. 🙄🙄🙄

JVN is one of my comfort people as well. 🥰 She's so beautiful and has such a healing energy. I'm so thankful they're a public figure because he helped me come out to myself 😭
I also find that lgbtq inclusive and positive media help balance out the unpleasantness. 

I'd add The Penumbra Podcast and Dimension 20 to the list.
i will cry rn omg that is the best thing to hear. it’s so scary being as out as i am but the fact that i can inspire people like you make it worth it, i hope nobody gives you shit! you’re awesome
yes i do!! most people are very nice and have great vibes. 

all my coworkers are in some way alternative and LGBT+ and so am i, so even though i haven’t worked there as long as everyone else they accepted me with open arms. i’m pretty close with most of my coworkers already. 

plus everyday you leave you have a new crazy story to tell LOL. like we have a guy who comes in every single sunday to buy a pocket 🐱. we found out after he denied toy cleaner everytime that he USES A NEW ONE 5 TIMES A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK AND HE BUYS A NEW ONE EACH WEEK BC THEY END UP DESTROYED.
it’s a party for sure.
LMAOOO
bruh wtf that’s dumb asffff
it sadly seemed like the latter, but i appreciate your point of view. :)
i am! everyone’s love on here lifted me up a whole lot. i’m so glad to have a community like this <3
Nah, this is too much defense. Asking for an explanation and laughing at the answer you get is rude, period.
I'm gonna go a kinda big sibling on you if that's alright, if not, just disregard my comment: You weren't overreacting. It sounds like you were overwhelmed and that's okay to feel that, especially on stressful days. <3 your identity is valid and your feelings are valid and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise
You were not overreacting!! They laughed in your face over something that's an integral part of you that took bravery to come out with. That's hurtful!
People are scared and ridicule what they don’t know, plus, some “allies” are pretty gross acting. Be yourself, accept that, and don’t ask for permission to be yourself. Sorry this happened, but until people catch on that “this isn’t a phase, mom”, it may happen more. You’re valid, trust that.
They started disintegrating them with their mind beams, but thankfully u/local_ENBY06 came in at the last second
They were yelling at them, and starting to threaten to physically hit them.
Owl House and Amphibia are what I'm watching while I wait for this bout of food poisoning to clear. Definitely great comfort shows. I love that kid's shoes have such great representation these days. God knows more adults could benefit from them.
I wonder if they think you're a trans woman and are trying (ineffectually) to be respectful?

Also, the ma'am/sir problem for enbies is real. There just isn't an equivalent non-gendered term. ""Friend"" doesn't have the respect connotation, and ""comrade"" makes one think of Russia.
Food service is definitely a special hell. I'm pretty happy to be in healthcare now. The fact that my job now involves counseling trans folks who are on hrt is really validating. When work does suck, there's Our Flag Means Death.
Some people have been kind of rude, others havent acknowledged it at all, others have been really cool about it, but a few weeks ago since I was out to my boss they felt comfortable coming out to me as they had just realized they were nonbinary, i spent years at this job feeling too scared to tell anyone at all and they felt like there was someone there to support them day 1, it honestly felt pretty great so I try to focus on that when other people at work get me down.
That sounds amazing!! I actually asked cause I have an interview at the store where I love tomorrow :) it’s good to know that it’s an enjoyable place!!
OMG you wouldn’t believe what some customers at my store do, I had this one guy DEMAND that I accept a return for this stroker that was obviously USED, not to mention the whole bag he had brought it into the store was sopping WET with god knows what 😭😭😭

He wouldn’t accept making an exchange instead until I got my boss involved too (I’m already in a management position, however this guy wouldn’t listen to me after I explained our policy on these things… he may have thought he had leverage over me since I’m pretty obviously queer, this guy struck me as homophobic asshole 🙄🙄)

The list of crazy stories goes on lmao
im replacing my account so the last thing i do will be giving you a silver award
thank you so much <33 🥹
what an incredible rescue effort, I couldn’t imagine recovering from near disintegration but hopefully they’re healing up okay after being blasted with so many mind beams
jesus christ, it’s so spooky out here for our community, I’ve had people following me and pulling weapons on me while they said “people like you need to die” and shit
I meant to say shows, but shoes works too.
mayybe but i look cis since i still present somewhat femininly (at least as of recent more comfortable with that) , i have booba and i'm 17 and look young so like they couldn't really think i have had any surgery either (especially with the political state here ik it's harder for trans people now), but yea i mean maybe that's the possibility? still hurts 😭
trust me, you’ll love it. good luck at your interview!! :)
EWWWW OMFG THATS AWFUL
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH :D
Absolutely it would. I'm sorry it happened. You are valid just as you are.
Thank you!!
hello!!! based on these replies, you can probably guess who i am

My college assignment is gendered :(		"Yikes... it would be more reasonable to give everyone the option of choosing which thesis they wanted to write on, or maybe assigned by last name? A-H gets thesis 1, I-P thesis 2, etc.
Dude, what is with this making the ""females"" write pro-feminist topics but making the ""males"" write anti-feminist topics? This teacher really wants to reinforce in men that women's oppression is just their perception and isn't real >.>

I would go higher up to fight this assignment, especially if the school has a code about inclusion. There is just so much that is wrong with this assignment
If you have an LGBTQ friendly university, the office of the ombuds may be able to help. Not sure about where you go, but where I went to school they were heavily invested in advocating for students. I can see that the instructor was attempting inclusivity by saying it’s your “gender identity” rather than just saying “sex” or “gender”, but this feels rather hamfisted and I question the necessity of bringing gender into the equation at all—splitting groups based on name + birth month would have worked just as well without making anyone uncomfortable.
Damn sucks to be a man or a woman, they have to do thesis assignments!
It's not only gendered, it's heteronormative. You can either try to discuss your point with the teacher or you can choose a sex that's not the one assigned to you at birth and encourage everyone in your class to do the same. The point of the assignment is being able to argue what love is or what is not with supportive statements and everyone should be able to do that.
I once (2009 or so) had a college interviewer ask me (then female-presenting) what a Disney Princess I would be and I said Mulan and asked if she also asked the boys the same thing. She said she asked them what superhero they would be. I said Nightcrawler and crossed that school right off my list.
""According to your own gender identity"" and then proceeds to be weirdly heteronormative. Lol
I don't for one minute condone it, but I wonder if the creator of the assignment believed there would be better empathy if females wrote about the challenge from a female point of view and likewise for males 

It's incredibly outdated and non-inclusive to do something like this ☹️
Pretty sure this is straight up a Title IX violation even if you ignore the existence of trans people
I could see where the instructor was coming from if and only if they were instructing the men in the class specifically to empathize with and write from the perspective of the narrator, who is a woman. It's incredibly easy and reductive to tell the men in the class to find reasons to argue that the narrator's husband is actually doing what's best, or that there's a literal supernatural explanation. This is just a poorly-designed assignment all around, and forcing a gender divide is the icing on the cake. If you're gojng to enforce a gender binary in the reading of a text (which you shouldn't) it ought to at least be with the goal of teaching people to interrogate the text from a different perspective than what their unconscious bias might direct them towards.
That is the most bizzare assignment i’ve ever seen…
As a college professor, what — and I cannot stress this enough — the fuck
Guess that means you get a freebie for the assignment?

In all seriousness, that's absolutely not cool. At a minimum they should apologize, let you pick which one you're completing, and change the assignment for the future.
What a weird way to assign things out anyways? Just let students pick one of the four! Plus it seems super sexist hoe those prompts are split regardless
This is so stupid. Why not just split the class into 4 groups and give each group a thesis statement? What's the point of dividing people by gender and birthdays????
Low key the way they split it up is kinda sexist too because why do the girls have to write about oppression but the boys don’t
Why TF not split it up into 4 different birth dates instead of gender?
Can you email your professor and ask them if you can do the assignment differently? Like having the option to choose any question you want to work on.
There are better ways to divide the class into four parts.
I’m a college professor (15 years in) and this honestly the dumbest structure I’ve ever seen for an assignment this prof needs to take a fucking workshop on Transparent Instructional Design and Assessment like fucking asap 

Also this probably why I never talk to any of my colleagues lollllll
I love literature. I love analysis and criticism and interpretation. If I got this assignment, I would tell the teacher to shove it up their ass. It being gendered is absolutely horrible, no doubt, but it's also a terrible assignment because it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that may be unsure what to take from it. It's like making someone write a paper about how the mob in Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" were correct to do that they did; it entirely goes against the point of the story.




And yeah, because I was AMAB and don't try to not look masculine, the teacher would expect me to do one of the ""male"" topics, which I wouldn't be able to do because I have a functional brain and know that those interpretations are bullshit. I get trying to teach critical thinking and seeing other perspectives, but would anyone try to get students to argue FOR the men in A Handmaid's Tale?



I'm sure the teacher thinks they're being inclusive by saying ""according to your gender identity,"" but they clearly don't understand that much about different identities. Or the point of the story. Good luck, OP. This class might be tough.
What class is this? Being assigned a thesis statement at all is weird to me, even if the point is to make you look at the writing in a specific way. Your teacher's writing is also... rough. 

The unnecessary gendering is definitely a rotten cherry on top, I'm sorry you're dealing with this and hope you can safely navigate the situation and conversation with the teach! There are many other ways to make four groups, I'd just split into groups of three months each, irrespective of gender(/sex, which the specific wording they used seems to indicate and kinda icks me).

Edit: Just realized they did say 'gender identity,' so B for effort haha! It was the Male/Female wording that triggered my last response.
Oh boy, I feel this. I'm taking a language class and while practicing a conversation as a class, my professor was like ""women read for Mary and men read for Takeshi"" and I was just frozen 😂😭
I guess that means I dont have to do the assignment. There’s no thesis on here for me.
Assign everyone you perceive as boys the role of defending the patriarchy, gaslighting the protagonist, and making up some ghost stories to avoid respecting a woman.  Yeah, great idea, fearless leader 🫡 And should the boys also write a list of punishments they'll use when assaulting their wives some day? Only when the females try to escape, of course!

What a shit professor.  What's the lesson here??

""Symbolism is when everyone's wacky ideas are equal, no matter how sexist, and stories like the Yellow Wallpaper are full of 10-12 clues about why feminists are wrong and Steven King's Rose Red was the real oppressor the whole time!"" 🤡
...even outside nonbinarism I'd be asking professor why the prompts are gender segregated.

Also, in general, assigning theses is bad teachering. Should be grounds for professional repremanding.
Honestly I would look at your university's policy on lgbt issues and consider reporting it if you bring it up with the professor and they don't change it/even acknowledge it. (Or just report them upfront if you're uncomfortable talking directly to them about it, which is what I would probably do. Definitely the option that will make you look like more of the ""bad guy"" possibly but hey.)
If they wanted four thesis choices why didn’t they just split it in groups of three months?
Alright. Alternative selection.. no matter which gender. If you were born in January-June you can choose from either: 

>John is not genuinely interested in helping his wife get well; he truly loves and cares for her, and thinks he is doing what's is best for her, against better judgement.

>The yellow wallpaper represents the oppression the narrator is under from her husband--the space they live in is, in fact, sinister with a bad history, and the narrative is in danger of the male-dominated world in which she lives.

And if you were born in july-december

>John truly loves and cares for her. His intention is to control every aspect of his wife's existence in order to maintain his own position of power under the belief that he is trying his best to help his wife get well.

>The house and the room represents sinister spaces with baf histories, the narrator I'd under oppression from her her husband who had been possesses with the male-dominated world in which he lives. They are both in danger from metaphorical figures outside and behind the wallpaper which possessed the husband psychologically.

Really mess with them and then when they ask, say ""well i don't fit into the ""male"" or ""female"" category specifically so I made the prompts reflect my gender identity by mish-mashing them."" And then send along the other three prompts for their use on future assignments and say ""you're welcome.
Oh lucky you! You don't have a paper to write :)
This screams title 9 violation
Okay wtf “according to your GENDER IDENTITY” and then goes to list FEMALES and MALES. 
Do they even know how language works? 
I have had forms to fill that ask for my sex and it kind of irks me but at least they ask for my SEX.
Yikes. It's not just about the gender options here, it's also which genders have been assigned which viewpoints
Email time!

Hello, professor. Seeing as I don’t fit into any of the given categories, it is evident to me that you must want to give me an automatic A for this assignment. I appreciate this generous offer and accept. Unless the language on the given assignment document changes, you will not be receiving an assignment from me, as I will be accepting the A. Thank you very much. 

That’s what I would do ngl
welp i guess you don’t have an assignment to do 🤷 if they’re assigning based on binary genders they’ve assigned you nothing 😎
You should directly ask the prof (via email) what you should do.

Always via email, always get it in writing
That sucks, friend. I am in school right now and I’ve just started politely emailing the professor and asking what nonbinary students should do when stuff like this comes up. I usually get an overly apologetic response and an updated assignment. I live in a liberal area though, so YMMV.
Ewww this is so cis- and hetero-normative. Wtf
Welp, I'm neither male or female. Guess I get to skip this assignment.
That is dumb, also if they wanted to break it into quarters they could go off of birth seasons, or random lots, or literally anything else
Why the fuck are they referring to, on paper students as males and females anyways??
Ew. Why Tf is this necessary. NGL I would refuse to do it and talk to the dean about it but that’s me.
Legit, my lifelong indignation with bullshit like this should have been a very early sign that I was non-binary.
I don’t like how this is laid out. The females have to pick one side (that homie isn’t at all interested in helping his wife, and being toxic for lack of better words, and the males are to pick the other in which he’s the “good guy” and actively loves and wants to help. I just don’t like that, and it gives me ick vibes. 
Also, if you’re ballsy enough, I’d tell the teacher my gender identity is none, but I’m also very sassy and petty. But honestly, I’d have a conversation with them at least, because that’s not entirely fair for you to be forced to pick one.
i guess that means you don't have to do work then
They could have just done the first letter of first and last names and gotten the same number of options.
That's unfortunate
Be cheeky and write from the perspective of someone (or something) else but follow the required points to the assignment for both the gender options.

Write from the perspective of a house plant or something explaining the issues objectively. Sometimes professors appreciate creativity in their assignments. And you can use that to say “hey my gender wasn’t included so I fixed it for you.”
This seems to be intentional transphobia from my perspective. It instructed students to do the assignment based on their “gender identity” but then immediately referred to terms easily recognizable with biological *sex*. What class is this for??
Not only that, they're telling girls to take the perspective that the man is manipulative and telling the guys to argue that he's good intentioned... breeding attitudes of suspecting others and being self righteous rather than trying to understand how other people may have good intentions or how we might be in the wrong... idk just feels a bit off to me.
Say fucking what... That assignment is COMPLETELY fucked up.
FUCKING BULLSHIT. Also I vote since they gendered it on husband vs wife that nonbinarys are now the strange wallpaper that is driving the wife mad.
So your comments show it’s Comp 2, and for writing for “the humanities”…

Choose a section, (I’d personally choose the “sinister spaces” avoid sex/gendered issues)

Write your chosen thesis statement at the top..

Then explain why you chose this thesis statement (in my mentioned choice it would be because it’s the only non gender based viewpoint)

Then do the assignment.

Also….wait to turn in till last minute, see if you can get a response that actually helps you fulfill the assignment.

And a final bit of fun, here’s a story…comp two…had to write about my “weekend waste”…mainly food and trash based…

So I made a roast chicken for Friday, chicken soup Saturday, and ate leftovers Sunday….a few bits of plastic bagging for the chicken and veggies, and some degradable trash…that was my paper…

I got “talked to” by that teacher because “most people can’t eat that little”…I was on food stamps at the time, and I never eat much because of swallowing issues….I just shrugged and said “I did the assignment”….I got a passing grade on it…

Write a decent paper, that YOU can feel proud of, AND that feels like it fulfills the teacher’s expectations….if you get singled out for it go to the administration and file an issue.
Sounds like you gets to choose whichever argument you prefer 😎 and if the teacher gets angry see who can make a bigger deal out this obviously sexist/transphobic assignment.
You could try reaching out to the EDI department.
They could probably do something about it , or maybe emailing the teacher? Good luck!
This giving me huge “She uses they/them pronouns” vibes. They tried to sound inclusive, but then missed the mark completely.
Not only is this ew but I read the prompts and they specifically gave only ""female"" students the ones that go deeper into the underlying message of gender roles and oppression and they gave the ""male"" students the ""everything the dude does is justified even though he treats her like a child because he *loves* her"" and ""it's not her husband's neglect and oppressive behavior that made her lose herself, it's the evil house even though the house was very clearly a metaphor"" bullshit readings. Not only it it cisnormative and forcibly reinforces binary thinking, but it specifically reinforces sexism by intentionally discouraging young men from thinking about sexism and it's effects and different ways of showing. All round gross.
It also looks sexist AF.  Women have to write about resenting their husbands and men have to write about their experience as Doctors?  What the fuck?
I hate that story so them adding some weird binary and hetero rules to the thesis is some double level bs
lmao, no instructions for enby folks means no work for them

sit back and chillax lmao
Tell the professor that the instructions were unclear, so you burned it
Flex on the professor by writing two papers. (not a serious suggestion because holy crap)
I guess you don't have to do the assignment! 😬
Guess you don't have to do it then :D
This is actually disgusting in general wtf
Boooooo!
I FUCKING FEEL THAT! I know it’s not necessarily the same… but every damn job app I’ve put in only provides male or female.. like it’s 2023… GET WITH IT
The horses name was Friday
🤢
powermove: dont do it
*FEEEEEEMALES*

That's something to report, yes?
yikes. I'm sure they could've just split the birth month into 1/4ths or just assigned them randomly.
Looks like you don't have to do the assignment then
Do the opposite of your agab to spite the professor
You don't need to do the assignment ig
Dude I HATE IT when when things are pointlessly gendered. Like seriously. Something else that pisses me off is boys versus girls. Or anything that differentiates girls from boys. I mean, there’s a small difference but nothing much, and there’s no point in changing things due to gender. Especially when you’re nonbinary or something else. Like what tf am I supposed to do? Split myself between the two groups??
There is also a bad rapresentation of men. All in one basically ahah
Just pick whichever you like best I guess. But I hate shit like that, just let people choose their own thesis instead of ""oh btw you were born a month premature from July? Fuck you, male post-July is your assignment""
How is this legal?
That's a really weird way to assign school work
Noooo :(
this professor sounds sexist or something.
This seems so needless why not split it up based on birthday and split the year into quarters
Non-binary people don’t have to complete this assignment.
YIIIIIKES. I’m a college prof and this would never occur to me. Why doesn’t the prof just split it ALL by birthday? Or by last name? 

If you have the spoons for it, consider giving this to your school’s EO (Equal Opportunity) officer. LMK if I can help you figure out who that is or what to say or anything.
If you have the time, you could do all of them just to prove a point to your teacher/prof and then end the assignment with an explanation that not every person identifies as male or female. I’m such a try hard though, I know that solution might not work for everyone
Well that's obnoxiously unnecessary and intrusive.
Looks to me like you’re excused from the assignment. Automatic pass.
this made me remember why i dropped out of school 😅
OOF. If they weren't gonna add more than male or female, they should have done it by sex assigned at birth. Whatadumbass teacher.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I guess you’ll have to do them all lol
In addition to the shitty gender stuff, assigning someone a specific topic to write about is how you get way more students to hate academic writing. I’ve always found that picking a topic I was genuinely interested in to be the best. Seems to be a bad teacher all the way around.
It would take a while, but do both and turn them in and if the teacher asks why there are two just say a random word or nothing.
Ewww this is such garbage.
Say you can not do the assignment because you're neither.
Guess that means you can get both the male and female option then
Is this like when someone finds an item without a price tag and says “I guess it’s free!” You just get to skip this assignment, I guess.
Looks stupid anyway!!
Every time I have to pick male or female on some form, I just sigh and pick the closest thing to what I’m feeling that day. But being forced into a gender based on someone else’s expectations would really piss me off. Sorry you have to deal with that OP.
This shouldn't be allowed. Is there someone you can report this to?
Yikes
This makes me sick…
🤮🤮
is it only me who understands why its okay to do this and also why its not okay.
Ew
wtf they do this in college too? middle school shit fr
Fight the power
What was the reason? I mean... just WHY?
That is such a bizarre way to assign prompts to someone. Assuming you’re in the US, is this a community college? It looks like something an adjunct would do.
Just ask where is my assignment
If that were my class, at this point honestly I'd just pick a completely different angle / lense through which to analyse it, and go absolutely ham on making it legit and meaningful. Come up with something that fills the assessment criteria that isn't either of the shitty binary options lol. I did this a few times for my creative writing degree, naturally not all of my teachers liked that whatsoever (and admittedly I failed one class because of it lol but that dude was an asshat). But some of them thought it was snarky but well done 😆 and I got great marks

However as someone else mentioned it's awful that the split is such that some of the ""males"" (ugh) are literally arguing pro abuser stance but ok. The person who designed this assessment sounds like they would literally be the last person to give a fuck about this ...

Edit: yikes I just noticed too it says ""According to your gender ***identity*** ..."" and then completely leaves out other identities lmao ok
Yay, I have no thesis 🥳
I would politely point it out to your professor and explain to them how it made you feel. They may just be unaware, which is not an excuse. However, it provides a great opportunity to make them understand.
I'm guessing the plan is to pair up people who were assigned contrasting theses.  But you could also do this randomly or by last name or even by birth month alone.
Or hell just organize it by the four seasons of which you were born, much easier to work with
There are 1000x more sensible ways to divide the class into 4 groups. I’d be disappointed but not surprised to see this in elementary school but college???? Also deeply weird how it’s set up so that the men and women get different assignments- and how the “female” prompts both are about how it’s a feminist text while the “male” prompt is how the doctor/husband are in the right or the house is to blame(?). Idk the vibes are off
You know I thought about this too and almost said ""they should have it swapped"" and then I decided it actually wouldn't be better to make female students defend John's medical abuse and decided that actually. It's a terrible prompt either way.
I immediately thought this too, it seems geared towards reinforcing any biases students are already likely to approach the text with. Just a poor way of assigning topics all around.
I don't think any of the theses are particularly anti-feminist (and I actually think the fourth one takes the narrator the most seriously, accepting her experience at its face value), but I do agree shoving all the analysis of symbolism for oppression onto the women in the class is bizarre and... shitty, for lack of a better word. 

The ""male"" topics are also a lot more superficial, analytically. I hope it's just a case of thoughtlessness or legitimate ignorance, but they kind of get off much easier.
Yup, i'd go higher up!
My thought, too. I got such a weird feeling when the first statement for males was in defence of a man that is supposedly supposed to be dangerous or toxic. My only guess as to why it was divided that way was to make sure all of the statements were used?? It’s still way over complicated. 

OP, do none of them lol. Or flex on them and do one from ‘female’ and one from ‘male’
If there's not an ombudsman office, Student Life should also be able to help mediate issues between students and the academic side of the institution
Reach out to the EDI department of the school. They are usually helpful. I work in higher ed and when going through the university website looking for something, I found very gendered suggestions for students on how to dress for an interview. I sent it over to the EDI department of the university and it was fixed pretty quickly.

ETA: Your university should have an EDI department as most accreditation boards are now requiring the university and the individual colleges and/or schools to have an EDI department. They are pretty much required now no matter what.
More genuinely, I'm finding it hard to believe that the way this assignment is structured is doing a good job of teaching about the book. 

If this book is meant to have multiple interpretations, to me, that can suggest that the subversive material is being obscured, at least in part, intentionally to give plausible doubt to the people who the work can influence, so that they may defend it from the people who would suppress it. To put it bluntly, those people don't exist anymore. It seems.. crude? Ineffective? To separate modern students by gender in an attempt to recreate divisions that were naturally formed in the unique cultural climate that this book was written in, doesn't seem like a good basis to analyze how a contemporary man or woman would have read this book.

Why not explicitly structure the assignment to say ""I want this section of students to find evidence to support X argument. Given that evidence, I want you to research the cultural climate of the section of society that gave way to this interpretation on the book, contemporary men and women, and analyze how their life experiences might have influenced them to take X argument."" Any modern student, regardless of gender, could complete every one of those prompts in this hypothetical structure. I'd take it up with a gender studies professor, in or out your institution, and see what they think.
I giggled. 😆

It's like the thought that non-binary people aren't bound by laws in some countries because the wording is always ""he/she"" ... 🤭
Yeah I emailed my teacher about the possibility of me getting a non gendered option for a thesis so I will see what happens \_o_/
Perfect.
And why would they assume they'd all want to be a superhero?? Are supervillains not cooler?
Brilliant responses from you tbh 👏🏻
Even if it was a matter of empathy it should've been the opposite: let men do the anti-patriarchy and the female POV thesis, and the women the male POV. (I agree with you, I just double disagree with the professor)
Oh it definitely is.
title IX?
Legit. Given that it's significantly less challenging for the average cis man to lean into the whole toxic-masculinity-abuse-bias lense as opposed to literally anything else kinda makes it seem like this assessment was designed to academically favour at least that 25% of the class tbh
I like your thinking. I was like: Time to work twice as much as the other students ^^. I guess it depends how OP sees their gender
I get a feeling this teacher wouldn’t have made this gendered unless they wanted someone to challenge them on it, but maybe they just weren’t thinking.
Putting an additional mental burden on the ""females"" who now have to confront their own experiences with oppression to support the thesis, while the ""males"" aren't required to do any extra work addressing internalized experiences with gender.
For real. Like the year is very nicely divisible by 4 ffs...
I did email my professor about doing a different thesis, but they are out of office for a few weeks right now so I don’t know if I will get a response
By months, for example lmao... JAn-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec.... I mean this is not rocket science.
> it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that __may be unsure what to take from it__

This is *such* an important point.

The students are not doing this assignment for giggles; they're doing it because it's part of the *learning.* What are they *learning* from this assessment?

When a person is actively taking instruction for a skill they do not yet possess, they are very easily *positioned* based on the instructor's actions, expectations, and biases. This is especially true in a high-pressure institution like a school where students have to learn *right* and learn *fast* or else they fail – which can have lifelong financial, social, and/or career consequences for some, on top of the regular emotional & social trauma – so they're more likely to hit the ground running with whatever they can grasp and hope that'll be enough.

It's one thing when you're heavily experienced in critical analysis, as you fundamentally understand that there are multiple different conclusions to reach and all of them have unique merit that is separate to one's own personal opinions and biases. But when you're literally still learning how to analyse and write about a piece critically, a polarising assessment like this is more likely to *position* students to accept a singular interpretation as ""correct"" and learn interpretation bias going forward ... *especially* given how polarising abusive men vs. silenced women is as a political topic and how traumatic the class is going to be after this. I hope there is *zero* in-class comparison of perspective because it's going to end up with the men insisting they're right and the women being (re-)traumatised tbqh

That was a bit of a rant sorry lol

I miss when the point of studying was to actually *learn,* rather than to rush through hoops at breakneck speeds to prove you're slightly less incapable of doing a shitty entry level job than the next schmuck with the hope that one day you'll be able to buy food without doing a job that makes you want to die inside
I saw you already emailed the professor, OP, but if they're willing to take any specific suggestions, I'd recommend allowing students to form their own theses based off a choice of leading question. 

For example: 

Please choose one of the following questions to answer as the thesis of your paper. There is no wrong answer to these questions; feel free to go with whichever fits your own opinion, or the opposite of what you believe for a challenge!

Does John (the narrator's husband) care for the narrator and legitimately try to help her, or does he have no intention of helping and is only exerting and expanding his control over her life? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.

Are the figures that the narrator witnesses outside and within the wallpaper purely symbolic (if so, what are they symbols for?), or are they real entities that she ultimately finds herself possessed by? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.
The class is composition two, we are learning how the write for the humanities.
Depending on genderfluxity I'd either read none or both 😆
Lol if I was braver
Title 9?
I have had to fill out such forms, and as an intersex person, binary forms get old fast.
If I were in school now, I'd absolutely be doing this. I didn't know I was non-binary at the time I went through uni but I had a few of these and it is very clear to me these days why I hated them ... lol egg moments

(also nice username 🥚🐺)
It's completely fucked up.
It’s for comp II
I agree with your point.
Genius lmao
Ya at my job I left it blank lol
Thanks, I need this
May not be, especially considering the gendered nature of the different writing prompts.
I was going to try and get into contact with someone at the school, but my mom (who I live with) got mad at me.  She said I haven’t given the professor enough time to fix it herself. I emailed her yesterday morning, but haven’t gotten a response. Wich I was expecting because she is currently on sick leave, and will be out for another week. We are supposed to finish this wile she is gone.
The instructions specify ""gender identity"" in the instructions, but then lists sexes under the prompts. From what was written, I don't think we can assume that this professor knows how to distinguish between sex and gender. The content of the assignment is about gender and it's repercussions, so I think it would be giving this prof way too much faith to say that splitting a group of people based on sex for a gendered topic wasn't meant to conflate the two.
I'm interested in hearing what might possibly make this okay
Oklahoma
I’m sure it’s just a coincidence the men were all asked to identify with the abusive husband and construct arguments in his favor!
Last name, birth month, favorite color, astrology sign, draw a slip of paper, roll a dice, literally so many different ways they could have chosen to do!
Gender is a terrible thing to pick for this considering it's rarely a 50/50 split when it comes to college classes. Most classes lean heavily toward one or the other. Biochemistry and ochem were the only classes I took where the split was about even.
I don't think academics should make you argue only for points you agree with, but instead teach you the different ways one may interpret any piece of media, so I don't think having both sensible and completely insensitive interpretations of a story as an assignment is bad in and of itself. But then going ahead and assigning these interpretations based on gendered viewpoints so that everyone gets the one they are more likely to agree with is just dumb.
But isn’t this about The Yellow Wallpaper story? A story in which a man imprisons his wife within a yellow bland room because of ‘hysteria’ until she actually goes crazy and starts hearing voices? In the end she has a full mental break. 

Having the guys write a thesis about how a man has the right to imprison his mental distressed wife seems very anti-feminist.
I would argue that it's very much anti-feminist to ignore the overt commentary on gender that The Yellow Wallpaper is making and instead read it as a literal haunting. That reading strips away all of the context of the story, which is rooted in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's experience being treated much the same as the narrator was (which did not, to my knowledge, involve ghosts) and finding it utterly soul-crushing. Ignoring the gendered aspects misinterprets and defangs a very pointed feminist piece.

And IMO the other thesis given for men is even worse- the closest you can get to a non-awful interpretation is that John means well even as he's hurting her, but that's still abuse apologia, because it's focusing on the allegedly good intentions of an abuser instead of the harm their actions cause. This is especially offensive considering that it's excusing away the trauma the author actually experienced.

Also tone doesn't always come through well in text, so I just wanna say that I'm not trying to rip you a new one or say you're an antifeminist or anything like that. I'm upset with the shitty assignment and the awful theses it gives, not with you.
There were certainly contemporary women who took the side that the woman was being genuinely cared for. It's hard to notice water when you're a fish. There were certainly contemporary men who took the side that the woman was being oppressed. Men might be collectively motivated to maintain their privileges, but it's always up to the individual whether or not to take it. 

What benefit would the modern student take from taking the book out of it's historical context and substituting an echo of the modern student's position within gendered society, across an artificial line that wasn't held the reception that this book was originally received in?
Please update!
Go the chaotic route: Your thesis is about how the husband and society are trying to force the wife into a heteronormative life in which she feels her role as ""wife"" and gender as ""female"" does not align with who she actually is. Thus showcasing the fact that by the teacher insisting on using binary gendered language to assign the thesis topics they took are forcing a narrative upon you that does not fit, thus becoming the husband in the short story.

Side note, I've always loved The Yellow Wallpaper for exactly the fact that there are so many ways to interpret the story without ever being explicitly right or wrong.

Edit: grammar
This. Men don’t need help sympathizing with John.
I agree I was doublely disappointed that male was assigned sympathy of the male protagonist. If the goal is to challenge preconceptions about the world, this assignment is not doing that.

You probably may, you never know. But it sucks that the assignment is based on birth month. Like it would make more sense if it was first initial or last name initial type of thing that you could decide.
Discrimination based on gender
I’m a professor myself. I would recommend that for the credit, you do the assignment, picking whichever gender you think fits you best on the day you’re doing it, or whichever gender’s prompt you like best at the time, or else flipping a coin since they’re all shitty prompts. As for reporting, you could wait until you talked to the prof after her return.
idk how to say it without getting cussed out or called transphobic. i can see both perspectives, both reasons why the other is wrong or why they are right. 

i dont need people to tell me why its wrong, i know why its wrong, i just understand that people always think its not a big deal. ive already accepted that people arent going to change, ive already accepted that people arent going to empathise with the lgbtq community. or maybe they simply cant empathise, they dont know that its a big deal. they always say ""suck it up"" because they think its fine. now i want to say that the truth is, its not a big deal, but i know i cant, and i know that it isnt for some people.

its a way to make groupings more fun and interesting,  i realise that, and it works considering how boring school work is. 

i realise now i may or may not have phrased my first comment wrong, what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.
Yeah where the fuck was the critical thinking in designing this assignment? does it not make more sense to have the men think about why the husband is being patriarchal and controlling and to have the women look at why the husband might think he’s trying to help even if they appear uncaring?
Not only that, but the author wrote something called ""Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper"" and she confirmed that it was about being treated badly by male mental health professionals. The fucking author herself confirmed that the main character is the victim and John was a POS.
(Not relevant to OP at all but) I am heartened somewhat that it's the sciences that are evenly split 😊
Thesis Defense and Interperetation Lessons Should Not Be Mixed.

There is a difference between ""Here is an assigned thesis defend it no matter how fucked up it is"" and something like ""Here's an interperetation try and dissect how someone would come to think it and then discuss how defensible you find it.""
This assignment actually surprised me most because of its limited interpretations of the story. I always thought of it as more nuanced than all of these - it's about more than power to John. It's about the societal expectation that a man be able to care for his wife in a way that makes her well, especially being a doctor himself. He actually thinks he is protecting her from herself and ruining his reputation by keeping her in there under the guise of love. It's more complicated in the sense that John is acting on society's expectations at the time for the best way to provide care, which turned out to be damaging for mental health - seclusion and ""bedrest"" for depression is the opposite of helping. It not only addresses feminism but also the medical model of Healthcare. Beautiful stuff. Really loved reading it in college and discussing it. This assignment reeks of misogyny and a lack of understanding that we exist.
Just adding here…

https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf

In case anyone was interested.

I also assume it’s THIS story that the assignment is about…

This site is a free version of the story where I am, hopefully also free for all….
That is the story and the plot, yes. I think we're interpreting the prompts fairly differently though, the one about John caring for the narrator and being well-meaning says nothing about having a 'right' to imprison his wife; I interpreted it as having the potential to be an analysis of intent vs impact, and is more of a character assessment than anything.

I don't disagree that having the men of the class write in defense of a man who clearly abused his wife is tasteless and potentially harmful, but John's motives are a valid topic to write on, and the prompt doesn't imply his actions were justified at all-- that's an entirely different thesis.
Yeah, the guy in this shitty thesis assignment must be related to Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre?🫣
I guess I was reading too far past the prompts' face-values, haha. I thought a literal reading could be an interesting twist, and figured the class had likely already gone over the actual intentions of the story and commentary that Gilman was making, so I saw the prompt not so much ignoring what The Yellow Wallpaper says as a fiction, but playing with what it would mean as a real journal, as it was written in-universe by the character of the narrator... if that makes any sense. But that completely ignores that in-universe the narrator is experiencing hallucinations and the implications that come with that.

I agree completely about the prompt about John, I was thinking too much about what **I'd** write if given this assignment, and I would've taken the impact vs intent approach with a focus on impact, but ignored that the prompt does not set a student up for that, and definitely frames the feelings of an abuser as the focal point.

I appreciate your thoughts!! It sucks a little to realize my interpretation was naive, but that's not your fault and I took no offense from reading your perspective. I appreciate the clarification of tone as well and want to echo it haha!
The idea that there wasn't conservative women or progressive men, would be very reductive.
Minor update I still haven’t received a response
Okay but I actually love this angle for analysis.
Noted, thank you.
>what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.

Okay that makes more sense for sure. Yeah it's clear that from their perspective there's nothing harmful about how it's done

But nahhh ... splitting them into groups is all fair and good, but doing it by gender this way – as well as tasking half the males with *defending an abusive husband* – is just not even remotely a good way to do it
this was exactly my thought. if they're going to gender something like this at least use it to broaden people's mindsets a bit
In my moms english class she does a lense assignment where everyone is randomly assigned a lense and she says its really annoying how painfully slow it takes some guys to understand a feminist lense.
If this is about Charlotte Perkins Gilman, i just learned that this author was very very racist even for her own time. I'm bringing this up bc i think it's important not to divorce an author from their work even if their work does have value not tied to their bigotry, especially since their bigotry may even seep into the work. You know, the easiest example is Rowling where you may like the books, and they teach some generalized good values but also have anti-Semitism and racism weaved throughout. If someone recommended Rowling today I'd wonder if they didn't know about the bigotry or didn't care. (I'm not saying this about you or anyone else in the thread I'm just saying all this in case someone wants to read the book, that they're aware!)
Depends on the science but definitely when taken overall! Comp sci, physics and to some degree chemistry are still male dominated. Biology is female dominated (I say this as a trans guy who's a biologist, although I'm a bioinformatician, so I did pick the most male-dominated subfield). So classes like ochem and biochemistry which are taken by chem majors and bio majors (all premeds in general) end up more evenly split. 

It's really the humanities and social sciences that lean the most heavily toward one gender. My little sister is studying speech-language pathology at the same school where I did my undergrad and every. single. student. in her cohort of 60 people is a cis woman -- not one man or trans person. Part of it is ofc going to be a product of the fact that there are more women who get college degrees than men so when a major is female dominated, it can be *really female dominated.* But I also think there's less stigma for women in male-dominated fields than the reverse. ""Breaking down barriers"" vs ""intruding"" or [insert homophobic slur here].
Yes exactly this. ""Support or oppose this interpretation"" it involves more thought to it as well. If I *just* have to support a statement it's easy to do becausei just have to pick out a few supporting points and defend it. But if I'm faced with needing to support or oppose it. I have to think about which option would be most sensible to defend given the informstion on hand, and not just make the argument to support it--but make the argument for why you are supporting it instead of opposing it (or vice versa).
Yeah, I can see where you're coming from about the second prompt. Like, the more I think about it, a literal haunting doesn't necessarily detract from the piece thematically. Like, if you read it that way, John's still ultimately responsible- he brought the narrator out to the house, insisted on putting her in a haunted room, and ignored her (correctly) identifying that there was a ghost. Plus that creates room for interesting parallels between the ghost of a woman who presumably also suffered under misogyny ultimately harming the narrator and the other women who help John control the narrator- I think you could get a solid analysis paper out of that reading.

The prompt's still complete dogshit because the instructions are all about finding evidence for the haunting rather than analyzing what it means, but thinking about the story in the lens of ""this is all real and the narrator imagined nothing"" is interesting food for thought.
Thank you for this heads up! I'd forgotten all about that tbh
Knowing how male-dominated sciences are in general is what make it so warm to me to hear it being relatively even in some sciences 😊

Yeah the humanities you've described matches with my experiences too. Ugh, *intruding.* Can't wait for that to be a relic of the past

it was surprising to say the least.
My MIL is in her 70s and calls all dogs puppies and puppers. Picked it up from me and my niece lol. Anyone who has regular contact with someone else will pick up at least a bit of their slang and mannerisms. Usually without even realizing.
That's what my grandfather calls dogs 🤷‍♂️
Not sure how many people you know, but I know a lot that say it. It comes from the baby talk part. ""who is the cutest pupper wuppers."" ..... really I have no idea why they say stuff like that to dogs in baby talk
Aww people thinking their generation invented everything… you know pet/baby names for animals and small children have been used for generations right? Probably since humans started using language…
yeah, and anyone would remember this long a conversation word by word. Nice story though.
Wow, I really didn't think about that part of it. Glad for your buddy.
i can make it, it is just a bit of work. embroidery.
Why would everyone clap? It was a convo between 3 peeps.
Yeah, this. Never happened. People aren't like that.
this is just not true. people can be nice, and even old people can be non homophobic. woww, shocker
now I am just sad for you.
That sounds like my family. My mom usually corrects herself but my dad uses the ""old"" card. I get referring to me as my AGAB for several decades makes it easy to mess up but all I ask is to at least try.
Yeah I got a ""I don't understand that stuff"" and ""humans have to have a lable for everything"" from and older coworker and I had to stand my ground.
Agreed. I started typing something a little similar but I didn't think I was expressing myself well so just kept it to 'cool neighbours instead.

They're trying to say that this is a r/thathappened made up post. It's sweet but I don't think an elderly person would ever use online slang like ""puppers""
Yes trying is way more validating then not.

Cute Isn’t a strong enough word😍😘🥰
You have hair. I can see it right there on your head all purple and glorious. 

Its not as if youre the 'bald girl' from Friends

Silly granpa.
I love that eyeshadow colour (violet), may I ask where you got it / brand?
Yeah when I cut off my hair my grandpa was like, all the boys are gonna fall for you, I wanted to say so bad that, that’s not exactly what I’m going for, but I kept quiet I said nothing because, I too have little to no mental or emotional capacity left (as shows in this long run-on sentence)

My boyfriend constantly misgenders me and argues with me on trans/ non-binary issues. I don’t know how to explain to him.	He even refuses to Google any of the terms I use and it feels like talking to a brick wall. I love him but he feels like he is purposely trying to do this to get me upset and trying to force me into the mold. I’ve tried time and time again to explain to him how I feel and how this affects me.  I don’t know what to say anymore, he tells me he loves me and then he pulls this and I don’t know how to feel. Not to mention half of my friend group misgender me it’s just feeling like a mess.	"You don't, he's wilfully ignorant.

He's shown he doesn't respect you, he doesn't love you, so you need to consider why you're with him.
Baby you don't explain yourself you leave him
dont be involved with people who show you no respect. break up
The solution to the problem isn't explaining. People can respect you even if they don't understand you.

Just because he loves you doesn't mean it's selfless or that he's even got your best interest in mind. Love is just a feeling -- for that feeling of love to make a healthy relationship, there needs to be an aspect of altruism and willing to change behaviour for the better of both people. You've already done enough by letting him know his behaviour is damaging you, you probably have tried to help him and make it easier for him. You aren't responsible for his actions.

It's very sad that he's willing to risk destroying the relationship and you for this.
I'm sorry you're going through this. you deserve to be surround by people who respect your wishes. it sounds like you've done all you can. you might try one last time to make it clear, to both your friends and boyfriend, that this is important to you, but at least with the bf it sounds like it won't make a difference. you deserve to be around people who bring you peace rather than distress.
*time to get a new partner*
throw the whole boyfriend out.
I'm sorry, this sounds super stressful. Someone who loves you wont try to make you upset on purpose and wont misgender you even if they dont fully ""get it"".
If someone who claims to love you consistently pushes you back into a mold for their own comfort, it’s rather likely that they are more in love with their own comfort than they are with you. That’s a really sad and scary place to be, but you do not need to abide or allow it. 

Setting clear boundaries, communicating your intent and clarifying that this is make-or-break for you might well be a hard conversation to have in the coming days. This man doesn’t get to push you into a binary for his own comfort; that’s wrong, and at the very least it’s terribly unsupportive of you and who you feel yourself to be. 

…. also, I might be reading more into it than there is here, but if someone is intentionally trying to upset you to push you back into a gender binary, that fuels fairly abusive and gaslighty. Those would be big ol’ red flags to me.
Break. Up. With. Him.
Sounds like you need a new boyfriend (or no boyfriend) and new friends. Why surround yourself with people who constantly disrespect your very existence? Because they say they care? Their actions say differently.
He doesn't respect you and/or he has a religious/political agenda that he feels is more important than you.  I'm sorry :(
Your relationship will end. It is your choice how soon. I would recommend sooner rather than later. His behavior indicates much broader problems, such as a lack of respect for your general happiness and well-being.
You're on a subreddit full of non-binary folks who love you and support you.

Dump him, date one of the nearly 200,000 of us on here, frankly.
Honestly, he's being an asshole and it's transphobic behaviour. After the first coming-out and explanation, it is not your job to continue finding ways to explain to him. We get enough shame, doubt and misgendering by the outside world you shouldn't have to experience this at home as well, somewhere that you HAVE THE RIGHT to feel safest and most seen. I would ultimatum him -- he can either respect you and SEE the real you, or GTFO. For your friends, I'd give a few more ""hey would you mind using my proper pronoun"" reminders (because they don't necessarily live with you and see you every day), but you can set the same expectation of them as well -- ""look, I've asked you enough times to please respect who I am... etc""

You deserve better on both fronts
It's time to part ways..
This is where you firmly and consistently set and keep boundaries. Make it known like ""Hey when you say/do ______ it makes me feel _______.  if you do this again we can not and will not be together."" AND THEN THE HARD PART keep that boundary. Of they say/ do the action again its on you to walk away. No explanation no bartering no going back and forth. Just a ""because of your actions this situation is not one I wish to be in."" And cut all contact and ties. Does not matter if it's someone you consider a friend or a partner.
As someone who's been in a similar position, end it. You need to be able to be yourself, and be respected. Take care of yourself 💚
You don't dear. You dump him. That's shows so much disrespectful to your person.
Dump him. Don’t date someone who is willing to disrespect you.
Dump him. You deserve better than that
Red flags. You need to leave this person, now.
I’m so sorry. Honestly, it sounds like he doesn’t love *you*, he loves the person he wants you to be. You deserve someone who loves you are who you are.
As the saying goes, when people show you who they are - believe them.

He has shown you how he really feels about your identity, and about trans and non binary issues in general. He has shown you that what he loves is his idea of how you could be, not who you are.

You could either just leave him; or you could give him an ultimatum - make sustainable changes in these areas or you leave. Personally I think I'd go for the first.
I'm terribly sorry to say this so bluntly but your boyfriend is a jerk, so is half your friends. It literally takes no effort to address someone by their gender. I've been there, done that. Dropped anyone who didn't respect me and let me tell you something .... IT GETS BETTER.

I have a boyfriend who doesn't misgender me, I have a friend group that doesn't misgender me, that is how it should be because they all love and respect me. Shit even some of my coworkers address me as they/them.

I love and respect you, though. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER. When you feel that love from people who accept you as you are, you will not settle for anything less and let me tell you, sugar, you deserve to be treated well and respectfully.
Oof. My ex wasn’t accepting of my identity, but he at least did the research. Maybe this is a jump, but if he’s willing to act this way about something so important to you, there is a chance it won’t even stop at that. This is a part of you. Your partner should accept all of you, even the bad parts (not that this is ofc). I don’t mean accept in like a toxic way, he doesn’t have to agree with everything you do/say.  Just that he should take the time to try to understand you for who you are.  
Also I think it would help to reach out to people in the LGBT community near you if you can. Depending on your age and where you are that would look differently. Most of my family misgenders me so it makes it hard to be around them, but thankfully I have friends and a partner who accept me the way I am. I know it’s scary, but you’re not alone. I wish you the best!
Listen, the man can't love you while denying a fundamental truth about your basic existence. Dump him and any friend who doesn't respect you and your pronouns. Get better people in your life. You deserve it.
Break up with your bf and friends
A lot of people here are saying he can't love you if he treats you so badly. This is incorrect. He might love you but you should still leave him. Loving someone should mean that we respect them and treat them how they wish to be treated but that's not the case. People love each other and do awful things anyway. Love is not enough. You should leave him. I don't want your situation so set yourself up to leave. Start making new queer friends too. You don't deserve this.
Your boyfriend sounds like a genuinely bigoted and emotionally manipulative person. You absolutely deserve better. He’s not worth your time.
He likes his fantasies more than he likes you, DUMP HIM
I would leave him or put your foot down. If he cant give you the bare minimum of referring to you how you want to be referred to as well as not educating himself then he doesn't deserve you. I would also consider giving your friends the same treatment.

Everyone deserves more than the bare minimum and it's an insult to get less than that.
Alexa, play Get Another Boyfriend by the Backstreet Boys
I am so sorry, but he doesn't love who you really are, he loves the version of you he has created in his head.
You cannot love someone you do not respect. If you don't listen to someone when they tell you what's important to them, then you don't respect them.

From what you've said here, he does not listen to you, he does not care to know what's important to you, and he absolutely does not respect you. So why keep trying? I suppose you could lay it out for him, that he clearly doesn't respect you so how could he possibly actually care about the real you and therefore love you. But it's not likely to change anything. That being said, sometimes it can be important to say these things for yourself. After a bad break up I *needed* to tell him what he did wrong, not because I thought he could or ever would change, not because I hoped to get back together, but because I needed to put it out there how shitty he was. The safer way to do that is to write a letter that you never intend to send (burning is a good option to put those thoughts ""out there"").

You know your situation better than we do. But from what you've described, your boyfriend does not currently love you for who you really are
He's telling you he loves you but not showing he loves you by his actions!
Talk is cheap 
He needs to learn, it takes time and effort, as it did with my partner.
You are worth the effort!
I have made this mistake before with my ex before I realized I was non-binary myself as I honestly didn't understand it at all as I was never really exposed to what non-binary was. We worked things out and we dated for a while after that. 

So what I'm trying to say is if they love you, they would be willing to accept you for you and respect you. Misgendering you and arguing with you about it just shows they don't care as much for you but for how you look which is not what you want. You want someone who cares for you. If it was me I'd end the relationship which is what my ex was going to do before we had a very long talk about it which I took to heart which your bf seems to be unwilling to do.
I hate to say this, but this doesn't sound like someone who is going to remain your boyfriend.

Love is blinding, we have good histories or want to see the best in the people we feel for. But the fact is you and the trans community are not getting any respect from him, and respect pretty fundamental in any good relationship.

If he loves you, that means respecting you. If he loves you, that means *not* being completely flippant and disrespectful towards who you are and others like you. It sounds like you have tried exhaustively to educate him, so you may be past the point of ultimatum. Cuz the only thing I could recommend in the ""fix relationship"" route is an ultimatum to wise up or you're out. You know your relationship best, but to outsider me this sounds like you should already be out.

If it has to go that way, you might feel bad for a while. You might miss him or feel lonesome or think maybe he might change now. Maybe he will someday. But for you, there will be others. The heart is resilient, you will find others who make you feel whole and happy, and all while giving you the respect you need. Don't ever settle for less.
Look, no amount of facts about trans people will ever chabge his mind. I think your strongest tool to make him understand is telling him how his actions make you feel. 

Tell him every time he misgenders you, you feel bad and shitty and all the rest that I am sure you know better than anyone. Even if he doesnt understand, the bare minimum has to be him at least havinf empathy for you.
Why do you want to be in a relationship like this?
Just dump him.
Why are you with him?
Cut contact with him and those ""friends"". If they cannot respect you in such a simple subject then they don't deserve you.
This sounds incredibly harsh and obviously it’s outside a point of view, but he doesn’t sound like a very supportive boyfriend and maybe you should just leave if it’s safe to do so it sounds really hard for you and I wouldn’t like to put up with it if it were me
This is absolutely NOT a description of a boyfriend. This is an abuser. Throw him out
I know this is hard, but if he doesn't respect you and your choices, I think you should leave him. Your identity comes first, and no one gets to stand in the way of that!
He doesn’t want to try. He’s not doing this by accident. 


My husband, among the straightest and cisest of people I know, proudly proclaimed to his family once before we were married that I was ‘binary’ - he’s got the spirit for sure, even if the terms might be wrong. He’s excited for me. I feel the love and respect from him and he shows it to me. His love and joy for me shines even though he’s never really been in queer circles, so a lot of this is new to him. He’s a thoroughly decent human being and ya know what? That should be normal. 


Like ok, not all relationships can survive someone coming out, but for the love of god arguing with you and wilfully misgendering you? You deserve better! If he’s really not willing to even try, and he continues to argue with you about it, is he ever going to change his mind? If no, is that someone you want to spend any time with?


Best of luck, honestly this whole situation is so difficult. I’m so sorry you’re going through this
Drop that mofo. You deserve someone who will RESPECT you. Even if they don't understand. And will do the research. Damnit. Sounds like I've done more research on the Sonic games my boyfriend likes than this man has done into being able to respect your identify.
The bar is in hell.
Dump him
Oof I'm sorry. He's definitely not the one for you.
He doesn't truly love you if he doesn't respect you enough to care
Dump his ass
Agreeing with others here that see the writing on the wall.. he doesn’t actually love YOU. Maybe he’s trying to still love a version of you from the past or a version of you that he wants to exist, but it doesn’t sound like either of those scenarios are the real you. I think you’re totally valid to leave him. He’s shown you who he is and how he shows you emotionally. It’s your responsibility to choose better. It’s not your responsibility to teach him basic human acceptance. You can’t make him change. But you can find other people who are the change that you want to see in your life. 💜
You can't talk to someone who won't listen, just like everyone here has said, he doss not respect you or value your mental well-being. You need to have a serious sit down conversation where you tell him whats going to happen, he either respects your identity or the relationship is over, if he tries to argue with you or guilt trip you DO NOT give in. You stand firm and tell him that this will not be negotiable. I understand that it would be really difficult, trust me i know, i had to cut my parents out for this same reason. You can do this though
Time to kick that dewche to the curb, seems like.
Seriously, ask him if he still considers himself straight, and if the answer is anything other than an INSTANT ""of course not, I'm with you"", *move. on*.
This is textbook emotional abuse. You don't deserve this - you deserve so much better. The hardest thing about getting out of an abusive relationship is that you may never stop loving the person who is hurting you but at a certain point you have to choose yourself. 

Good luck, and stay safe ❤️
If he loved you, he'd accept you as you are.
get rid of him. thats all im gonna say.
Like others have probably said; sounds like you're being manipulated, time to consider the options and tell all involved parties. Please seek the company of humans and non-humans responsibly following this (not saying you didn't, but I do know sometimes we don't know what's going on till someone says something).
People will respect you even if they don't understand, they just need to put in the effort, he nor your friend group seems to be putting in that effort.

Ex of 3 years was constantly in arguments with me a out this stuff, I have a trans little brother and he just refused to accept him, no matter the amount of explanations and time.

Now my bf of all of a week accepts that I'm questioning if I'm non binary and vibes with my little brother even tho he doesn't fully get either.

Some people simply won't respect you no matter what and it's not your job to fight for them to change, its to find people who will respect you without u having to beg them.
He's not trying. You deserve better.
You need to make queer friends, everyone around you sounds like they suck.
The bottom line like many of these comments is that he doesn’t respect you. Respect is the basic non negotiable foundation of any relationship. Leave him!
There is no magical phrase you can say to get him to care about your feelings. You don't need to understand something to respect other's feelings. I absolutely do not understand people's love of professional football but I'm not going to go up to someone in an Eagles football jersey and tell them their team is stupid and they should just accept that they should be a hockey fan like they were meant to be. 

You have told him how this makes you feel. He is choosing to act like this. When people show you who they are, believe them.
You can’t fix this with explanations. You should not be forced to argue about your own existence and validity. I understand that it is very hard but you need to dump his ass and find someone supportive who’ll love you for who you are
That man is no longer your boyfriend. Tell him he either has to take you seriously or get out. His respect for you is missing.
That's the neat part, you don't. Otherwise, break up with him.
And why is he your boyfriend again?
My parents are like this, but I just ignore it because there's no point in fighting a brick wall in the first place. However, I do recommend you make it clear to your friends how you would like to be gendered. If you get lucky your boyfriend will either realise that he's the only one who misgenders you and fold to peer pressure or your friends will talk to him about it.
Don't, just run
""he is purposely trying to do this to get me upset ""

You love this man? You don't love you? 

What would you advice your best friend to do if their boyfriend was not on their side? Do that...
The magic words are: ""I'm breaking up with you""

Seriously if he upsets you on purpose he does not respect you. He is not worth it.
Dump him. Then he can identify as an ex. Stop trying to explain. He doesn't care.
As a mental health professional and therapist, my advice is put things together to break off the relationship. It doesn’t matter how much he claims he “loves you”. People that love you don’t do things to purposefully hurt you and refuse to work with you on something that matters so much. The fact that he won’t even do research and stuff shows me he’s using your relationship and “love” as a way to control you.
throw the whole entire man away
This sounds like abuse to me - doing something shitty and disrespectful, violating your boundaries and not honoring who you are; then saying ""I love you"" and making up, but then doing shitty thing again. That fits very much into a cycle of abuse.  


You deserve so much more than this prick who doesn't respect you. Please care for yourself and get out <3
Run.
This isn’t true love. Someone committed to misunderstanding you and not respecting your gender identity only likes your for what they want you to be, not who you are. Dump him, you can do better.
[removed]
I don’t know how to say this (autism is a bitch sometimes). But were the two of you together before you came out as NB? He says he loves you but I’m wondering if he loves an idea of you that he deems socially acceptable. 

Regardless, you deserve someone who loves you wholeheartedly. You should never have to hide a part of yourself from someone who says they love you. I’m sorry and I hope you find the strength to leave.
My friend.

Throw the whole man in the trash.

One of the BASIC fundamentals in a relationship is communication that goes both ways. This is healthy and normal. If someone is refusing to do even a basic task like that for you, that requires almost no effort. Is he really worth keeping? How can someone love you and put you in destress? You have to take your own value into account here. He's misgendering you and will keep doing so. You're worth more than that.
Ditch him :p
He does not respect you love
I know that it isn't always easy, but I am 100% certain that you should leave him.
looks like your bf and half your friend group need to GTFO of your life
Um. Are you sure you love him? Doesn't sound like he loves you or respects you.
Please update this post saying you dumped his stupid ass. The man is transphobic. He doesn't respect you. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't love you. It'll hurt now when you gotta break up with him, but in a week, a month, a year? You'll be so glad you did. That you didn't waste another day of your life feeling bad about yourself and who you are. You're a beautiful and amazing non-binary person and you don't need to be worrying over some dollarstore piece of shit bigot. He was goddamn *lucky* to be ever dating someone as wonderful as you when you're so far out of his league. The absolute loser can't even see how blessed he was and he fucked it all up. Now it's time for you to kick him to the curb. Get him the hell out of your life and go be happy being you. Being single and comfortable with yourself is *always* better than being trapped in a relationship and miserable. You don't ever need to explain yourself. You are valid as a non-binary person and anyone who doesn't respect that is not worth a second of your time. You deserve to be happy.
You.Deserve.Better.🖤
It’s not your job to educate him. Move on and save yourself a lot of wasted time.
you shouldn't have to explain anything, he should accept you as you are. it definitely shouldn't be a fight.
you're gonna put those boundaries and find new people who will respect them
Look, I've had people I was close to treat me this way and it's not worth it. They don't care about you or respect you, if they did they'd support you. Your life will be better off without those people in it. You deserve someone who treats you well.
i used to think people close to me did this by mistake and they were just clueless, but really they are just pretending to be clueless. he knows how much it hurts you.
Dump his ass
Love is an action. He is showing you he doesn’t love you. Leave him, he will not change.
Leave him. I was there. It’s not worth it he doesn’t love you he won’t change.
This doesn’t sound like a good relationship
echoing what so many people are saying - please leave. 

been there and it’s heart wrenching. You don’t need that.
Fuck him, fuck them. Everyone deserves to feel respected in their relationships
Four words: Get out of there. If he isn't going to accept you, he doesn't deserve you, end of story.
Throw the whole boyfriend straight into the trash.
Dump his ass right now. Fuck that shit
he doesn’t love you, he loves what he wants you to be
Start misgendering him and if he gets pissed, maybe he’d get the point

If that doesn’t work, leave him cuz he shows he doesn’t respect you
Breakup. The key aspect of “boyfriend” is FRIEND. And he is being a terrible friend.
BEEN THERE, GTFO!!!
Get you a partner who actually respects you and dump his willfully ignorant ass
Find a new boyfriend
Honestly, dump him. That guy doesn't respect you and hence isn't worth your time.
Do you think he may just be struggling to accept it? He may be very attached to a flawed concept of who you are, and this may be the selfish byproduct of that.
If he loved you, he would hear what you have to say about how you feel he is treating you over your identity. If he isn't willing to treat you with basic dignity, then he is not worth staying with. While some may mock me for saying this, what he is doing *is* abusive.

Remember, they are *NOT* your preferred pronouns. They are your pronouns. He can either use the right ones or he can just not refer to you at all. And the same goes for the people who lie about being your friends. If they know you don't go by what they are calling you and they aren't even *trying* to get it right... They can piss off.

And if they don't get why it's such a big deal, you can always take the nuclear route with those individuals by telling them they have a choice: stop misgendering you or you'll start misgendering them until they get the message. And take it to an extreme. Go out of your way to start calling the guys ""Miss"" and gals ""Mister"" *constantly* as a substitute for any time you could possibly use their name.

And if they get upset with you for that, ask them how they think you feel having endured it for so long with, by this point, equal if not greater malice. Because make no mistake, when a person refuses to change bad behavior, that *is* malice. Ignorance and malice are not mutually exclusive.
My ex bf couldn’t comprehend the idea of me being non-binary. We didn’t last long after my self discovery.
I knew he loved me, the version of me who only displayed their feminine side. As a cosplayer I only have male character cosplays, every time I’d try kissing him while being dressed up as a male chara he’d push me away telling me it’d feel gay because I don’t look like a girl 😂
I kinda knew we won’t last after he pulled this first but it wasn’t the only friction between us. We were dating for 11 years I was engaged to him for a year and I had to break it off 4 years passed and although I’m still single, I’m also a lot happier.
I’m still friends with this guy tho because we’re like family and despite this major hiccup he’s a decent person and a great friend. (My main language doesn’t have pronouns so he can’t misgender me 😂)
Hit him with a big stick
I’m sorry you are dealing with this. If he loved you the way he claims he does he would respect you. Break up with him.
dump him
Speaking from experience just dump him. My ex was like that about my sexuality and it seriously was not worth the mental/emotional trauma. Ditch the ""friends"" that are misgendering you too (if they aren't willing to learn or try it's not worth the effort).
This doesn't sound healthy to be in. Honestly either he respects you or you leave. Shouldn't give someone the option of disrespect without consequences. You can't let someone walk on you like that, it's abusive and not good for anyone.  

Hoping for the best for you
He loves an image of you he has and it is different than the new one you are trying to paint for him.

Doesn’t mean that can’t change but if things continue this way you are in for some hard and painful times.
Put glass in his cereal :/ he’s garbage
Dump👏🏻him👏🏻
Tell him to kick rocks
Dump him
He’s gotta go.
Coming from someone who might be normal... I think showing enough compassion to at least humor you is the bare minimum of being a *friend*.  

If something your friend does hurt you... and it doesn't cost much to relieve the pain and you let them know about it.. then that's basically a toxic relationship.  It's time to branch out to more people who are open to your identity.  

This gender thing is relevantly new and it will take time to get on board and to accept it.

I believe relationships are about compromises.. and I don't think pronoun counts as a big one.  .. in fact, it's insignificant.  

Personally, I don't care about which pronounce people use on me... but this isn't about me and my lack of feelings, it's about your feelings.  I believe you want to be around people who make you feel like you're worth having as a friend and give you some respect in regard to this new and different thing.
it's clear how much you love him from how much work you've done trying to help him treat you better. unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be reciprocating that work. you can't convince someone to treat you well; either they want to, or they don't. it sounds like he doesn't. I know it's scary & hurts, but I think you should throw out the entire boyfriend.
you deserve someone who actually values and care for you, hes not worth it
You're dating a transphobe? Wtf
My egg started cracking like a month after I got married. My new husband flat out refused to use they/them pronouns (at that time I was just politely asking to try them out). I should have left him then. Fast forward two miserable years I was filing for divorce, another two years later I'm finally starting to live my truth and wish I didn't waste so much time on him and similar men. Granted, in my situation I wasn't exactly ready to accept myself as trans yet, if you are then why are you with someone who isn't?
I'm sorry you're experiencing this, you don't deserve this. Your attempts at educating him and your friends is only half the battle, they have to willingly learn and try. Def lean on this community for help and comfort!
>he feels like he is purposely trying to do this to get me upset and trying to force me into the mold.

Yes. This is almost definitely what it is.
I’m sorry, that’s terrible. 🙁

Maybe you should break up over this, but you might want to first ask him about his feelings and motives. Why is he acting this way? I can imagine that he might have some complicated feelings about losing his monogender partner, or what it says about his own monosexual orientation if he loves a nonbinary person.

He’s probably not the right guy for you, but there might be room for more mutual understanding as you two disentangle.
Wake up and break up. He doesn't respect you. If he did he'd make an effort to learn. He isn't. You can stay with him and be miserable, or leave and find someone who will accept you for you.
My partner recently came out as nonbinary, and while it's been a struggle for me to understand and adjust at times, I can't imagine not putting in the effort to give them the most basic respect regarding their own identity. You're who you are and deserve to be recognized as such. Time for a serious heart-to-heart with him to see if this is something he feels he can learn to accept and celebrate, or if he can't picture a future with a partner who does not ""fit"" into whatever binary gender he is attracted to.
no. that's not acceptable behavior for someone who is supposed to love you. sit him down and tell him he needs to shape up. If not, consider leaving the relationship. Strongly consider.
leave him
Break up with him lol
He doesn’t love you. He views you as an object to be fixed. Leave him. Now. Before he does any more damage.
I know its difficult to hear this because you love him but if he cant accept you for you, its not meant to be.

Dont live your life with someone who chases what you used to be. You are the you of the present. The past is dead.
He chooses to be a toxic influence in your life, you should look to remove toxicity from your life.
T4T is the answer
You explain it to him by leaving him. That’s all he need to know about the community, we don’t want to deal with his nonsense.
Explain to him by dumping his ass
Uh. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, but I would think that intentionally and repeatedly insulting you on such a cornerstone issue would be grounds for discussion of the relationship.

There's a barrel minimum of respect one should be able to expect from a partner and you're not getting it. This flag could not be more red if it were neon, on fire, and literally growing out of Rupert Grint's head.
This 10x. Don’t let his man disrespect you. Love yourself.
If he loves you enough to be your life long partner then he would listen and respect your feelings. He does not thus he is not worth it. I would suggest telling him he is driving you away by not respecting your gender and pronouns and give him an ultimatum and follow through with the consequences. It may be scary but you may need to start preparing to move away from him. I would also tell your friends that you are giving him an ultimatum. This is not directly giving your friends the ultimatum. But it Will make it Clear you are serious about your gender and being respected with the correct pronouns. Do 👏 Not 👏 Let 👏 Anyone 👏 Guilt 👏 You 👏 Into 👏 Backing 👏 Down 👏!!! You are worth more than that!!!!
Exactly, my bf would never purposefully misgender me but he still does not understand because he has never experienced being outside the binary but the difference is he fucking loves me and respects me
Yeah to boyfriend, no to friends. If these friends are trying but get it wrong a lot of the time٫ that's excusable. Obviously it's tough to hear٫ but life is tough. If they are trying٫ and take it seriously when they realize they made a mistake٫ keep them around. One needs friends much more than a SO and these ones don't seem to be fully at fault. Being misgendered is one of the unfortunate struggles of being non binary. Just gently correct and discuss. Be open.  And break up with your boyfriend٫ he sounds like a willfully ignorant bitch.
Cant upvote this enough!
I’m rather young but an adult. It’s like my fist serious relationship so this hurts even more. I’m going to listen to the advice given to me from the lovely people here who even though made me cry again, made me feel so much better and accepted. I can’t thank you all enough for the support. I’ll be talking to him privately soon.
^True. Love alone isn't enough, it requires ACTION.

""Well it's been almost a year to the moment/
When I finally realized it was over/

Okay but transphobia ARE wrong for how they feel and I’m not sorry about it. If you don’t support non binary people get off this subreddit and sure as hell don’t reply to this. And don’t say you’re not against non binary people because if you’re on his side you clearly are.
It’s also worth noting that the worst case scenario here isn’t a breakup. 

The worst case scenario is never breaking up, and having to live with this pain/judgment for the rest of your life. 

Frankly? Even if it’s just another year or two of carrying this pain, or even a month, that’s so much worse than the relatively-short period of heartbreak you’ll feel following a breakup. 

Plus, like… it’s hard to see it this way, but it’s better for him too. If he doesn’t want to be with a non-binary/gender queer person, then both you and him need to have the confidence that he’ll find someone else. 

We often think of breakups as an act of cruelty, but that’s wrong. Trusting that this individual you love has enough value to be loved again? That’s truly an act of love and compassion - and if you prolong a breakup, you may be hindering them from finding something where they can be truly happy. 

Above all else, please be kind to yourself, and respect your limited time on Earth. There are ways to break up with someone and keep their friendship. There’s no way that pretending to be happy will ever lead to being truly happy.
I will clarify too -- this does not have to be an ultimatum. This could easily be a boundary, and should be one tbh. ""I deserve to feel safe, accepted and supported in my life and especially in this relationship. When I am misgendered, it makes me feel xyz. I'm unwilling to continue to be in a relationship where my identity is not respected. This is a firm boundary for me."" And if he continues to disrespect your identity, you have made your boundary explicitly clear, and you should leave.
This 100%

My husband also doesn't really understand the whole nonbinary thing. We're both on the spectrum and for him the psychological not matching biology stuff doesn't make sense. But he does his absolute best to not misgender me. If I'm having a day were I'm feeling more masc than fem he'll use masc pet names for me cause he knows I might be more comfortable with them. He asks me what terms I'd rather him use for me instead of assuming the fem ones are right.

The point is even someone who doesn't get the whole being nonbinary thing is still capable of respecting you and your identity.

He's choosing not to, and I'm sorry to say but you likely won't be able to change that.
I was also in my first relationship! He at one point acted like I had trapped him?? Into dating a non-binary person. He didn’t want me to meet his family, I literally had to pee outside bc he didn’t wanna let me inside the house he shared w his family. He was 25 haha. Love is a powerful feeling, don’t let the fact that you feel like you should be together, make u stay with him.
This x20
The grieving of a relationship that may already be lost is temporary. 

The damage of gaslighting and disregard for one's own needs can last a lifetime.

Staying with someone you've invested feelings into who is not or no longer invested in You is self-harm. An ultimatum is necessary at this point, and so is keeping the promise to leave if things don't improve.
Much cleaner follow up
This is really good advice for communicating something that is introducing a problem in a relationship.
That is an ultimatum though...
[removed]
X30
Cut that bitch out and let them deal with their loss. Don't be afraid of cutting people out that don't deserve respect
I see what you’re saying, because offering an ultimatum seems like a kindness. It feels like the fair thing to do - especially when you feel like you “owe” your partner something. 

That said, as someone who has given this same ultimatum, and regretted it?…

If you have to threaten someone for them to respect your pronouns, that’s not true respect. 

A partner should use your proper pronouns because they want to respect you, understand you, and show their appreciation for how you’ve invited them get to know you better. 

When it comes down to it, sharing your pronouns communicates, “I trust you with these. I trust you won’t hurt me, and that you want to know me better.”

An ultimatum is like saying, “You’ve hurt me, and I’m certain you’ll hurt me again unless I give you a threat.” 

As I said, I’ve given the pronoun ultimatum before. I’m infinitely happier now that I’ve found someone who respected my pronouns since day one.
A boundary is a rule you set for yourself to keep yourself safe. An ultimatum is a rule you set for someone else. They can be similar but there are important differences.
Exactly.

Because it's more than ""just a pronoun"". It's a single crucial title for one's authentic identity. Having that ignored or deliberately abused is saying more than ""I don't acknowledge your pronouns"". It's saying ""I don't/won't acknowledge You and what's important to you as important"". 

Offering an ultimatum is less a kindness to the other person and more setting self-respecting boundaries that are non-negotiable.
My ex used my pronouns even when we were breaking up. And we live in a Spanish-speaking country, so almost all the things we say are gendered, andthe respect for others' pronouns isn't so ingrained in the culture.
We were breaking up. And she respected my pronouns. What your partner is doing there is exceedingly disrespectful, for someone who says that loves you.
Yes, and having to state ""if you do this, we are done"" is giving an ultimatum.
Boundaries should be discussed anyway, but having to remind someone like that would be giving them an ultimatum."	yqvy65	NonBinary	842	0.99	2022-11-09 21:21:33
wanted an allergy test and got my identity denied	"Tw denial of non-binary identities

Wow, didn't expect this but this time when i went allergy testing the (female) doc didn't respect my wish for not being called ""ms/mrs"". Last time, the other doc just called me by my name and it was very affirming. This time all the docs permanently called me female out loud. Very stressful.
..

Not only that. While explaining me my allergies are all psycholohical, she stated that it would be transgenerational trauma and i should come to her systemic therapy to make a systemic allergy ""test"". Then she said, that my allergies are an internalised wish to die and if i would know that.
..

Now the worst: she said ""ah and you can't quite decide what your gender is"", because i have non binary written next to my name in their computer. I told her that non binary is a valid gender identification and my gender is very decided on being non binary. ""You might think that, but we are living in a binary world and it is either this or that. Most people who feel like you have a prebirth or transgenerational trauma. You either identify with someone in your familys past or with an unborn twin. Ask your mother if there were any complications during pregnancy. I can do a systemic therapy session with you, where you can find out and learn to let that identification go. You want to live and you want to live your own life, right? Then you need to find out who you confuse yourself with. You can't be between or nothing, its he or she. Nothing between that is existing""
...

Just needed to put that out somewhere. I will check her systemic certificate and ask my own systemic therapist about her opinion, just to revalidate and reassure myself."	"Oh honey switch doctors. Please for your own mental helth.
Ok as someone who has allergies and has a child with severe food allergies: 1, find a new doctor asap because that’s not how allergies work, and 2, find out who licensed this dr and report them. 

Holy shit. 

But seriously, find someone who specializes in allergies because that “doctor” was making up some weird crap. That’s 110% not how allergies work.
What the hell kind of doctor is this? Seems like they also spew nonsense therapy stuff to me... Very unprofessional and I'd try finding a new one if you can.
“Binary world”??? This person is in the HEALTHCARE FIELD NOTHING IS BINARY THERE
> [She explained] to me [that] my allergies are all psychological […] transgenerational trauma […] Then she said that my allergies are an internalized wish to die […]

Your doctor is batshit insane. Absolutely cuckoo for coco puffs. She is not practicing medicine, she’s actively harming her patients with false understandings of how the human body functions. Report her for BOTH the gender disrespect AND her pseudoscientific nonsense about allergies.
Report that. That's bad medicine, bad science and a &!+<#

I'm sorry you went through such an awful appointment.
Report that asshole. She has no right to say that shit.
OP, that doc sounds like a massive quack. Please switch docs for your own safety
It honestly sounds like this doctor is just trying to weasel more money out of you by convincing you there’s something wrong with your identity and you need her help to fix it. Switch doctors.
Wait, so she’s an allergist? What kind of physician? Why is she pretending to be a psychologist?

This is one of the most fascinating takes I’ve heard in a while to invalidate nonbinary people. “Unborn twin” “transgenerational trauma” “pregnancy complications”… That’s new to me.

Also, fun (not fun) fact: allergy tests have lots of false negatives. Only thing you can trust in an allergy test is a *positive.* It doesn’t mean it’s in your head. Allergy testing is notorious for false negatives.
good lord.  this ""doctor"" has a whole lot to unwind.  

first off, the ""transgenerational trauma"" thing does NOT mean that your allergies are in your head.  Theres some cool studies about that topic, but that does not mean that you do not actually have physical allergies.  Run the test and dont push the hocus pocus on people who dont want it.  

Second, for someone who is in the medical field, this kind of treatment is definitely messed up, unless your doctor is a therapist or psychiatrist too (highly unlikely) then this is probably malpractice to offer those services.  

third outside of the big religions, theres PLENTY of non-binary presentations. sounds like this person has taken a spiritual approach, mixed it with limited available science, mashed in some evangelical type christianity, and packaged it up and put a bow on it and it smashing it over patients heads.  totally messed up.

I hope you find better care OP.  report that doc to your local medical/licensing board. this is hugely concerning.
What an utter quack, find another doctor immediately. Sorry you had to go through that
What the actual fuck??? ""You either identify with someone in your familys past or with an unborn twin.""   FUCKING WHAT?

Why is a therapist doing allergy tests?  Bet she's not a licensed psychiatrist OR psychologist.
Ok, i’m not an expert. But, even if we discount the transphobia, this doctor sounds like an absolute quack. Allergies are an “internalized wish to die”?? What??
Report that doctor so no one else has to go through this
That doctors comments sounded like some  conversion therapy Bullshit. If you can., try not to go to them again.
Report that doctor
wtf is she a real doctor or someone who was there and decided to make it everyone else's problem?? apart from the hate crime that was just unprofessional as hell.
This feels like something a real doctor wouldn’t say. Who goes for ALLERGY TESTS and is diagnosed as having TRAUMA? This feels like she is desperately clinging onto her other failing therapy practice or something. Or just outright crazy by upfront telling someone “you are identifying with someone from your past life and you just don’t know it”. None of it is scientifically accurate or morally right.
Fucking hell, report that doctor to their manager
You are valid.

This pseudoscience bullshit that she's spouting: absolutely not valid. She is a danger to other people and should be reported.

And all her enby hate isn't valid either.
Paid by check? Stop payment. Deny HER identity of being a  doctor. I half wish you’d tell us where this happened. Unacceptable. Pls consider writing the medical board about this, too. Doctors hate getting notices from The Board abt complaints. Keep us posted, rockstar.
This doesn’t sound like a real doctor. Either you have been bamboozled by a ‘homeopathic practitioner’ or you need to report this person
What the hell? “We live in a binary world…”? Transgenerational trauma? What even is that? So unprofessional. There’s a reason why on lots of legal forms now, non-binary is an option for gender. I would report this doctor. Biological sex is limited, but gender is up to you.
Does this doctor have feathers and a bill? Cause they sound like a goddamn quack. I hope you can find a better one
Only a transphobe would be so densely ignorant by choice that they choose to believe it’s more likely to have allergies directly from “transgenerational trauma” or an unborn twin, than it is for non-binary to be a valid gender identity.

And they say we’re insane for our non-binary identities. Yet we’ve existed for longer than the history books tell us. And we will continue to exist no matter what.
Report this ""doctor"", she deserves to be fired. Not only has she refused to give you any real help for the issue which you came in for but she's pulling up some seriously concerning pseudoscientific bullshit that she thought up or read on some dodgy article which makes me doubt that she has any place in her role.
Report the shit out of this doctor, they are extremely unprofessional and have bogus ideas about how allergies work.
 I would have just walked out and informed her that if I ever had an appointment with her again I would walk out immediately upon seeing her.
This is so not okay and I’m sorry you experienced this. This doctor sounds like they’re trying to do their own form of conversion therapy in trying to invalidate you and use their made up logic to gaslight you into believing you don’t know your own mind. Science isn’t even behind them considering intersex people exist, so no, it’s not binary. Not to mention loads of other evidence.

Please report this doctor to health authorities in your area. This is not okay what so ever and puts a lot of people’s lives in danger.

I hope you can find a doctor who respects your gender and is safe for both your physical and mental health.
Mrs nurse, this is a Wendy's
This doctor sounds like a quack, even in general. Add on the denial of your identity... You totally need to find a better doctor.
100% she uses crystals and essential oils in her ""systemic therapy"" sessions. This person is a out and out quack. Leave a review and find a new doc.
Holy fuck this is just straight up conversion therapy. You absolutely need to report her enbyphobia this is fucking sickening and unprofessional.
um, putting down your allergies as a physical manifestation of suicidal thoughts is not ok. without even getting into the ignorant nonsense transphobia, you need to look into switching doctors.
To hell with her! You are valid. WE AS A COMMUNITY ARE VALID! don't let people tear ya down. Sending love to ya my enby sibling
Lol it isn't a binary world even in the most basic physical sense. Any doctor with even a semester of medical education should know about intersex people. Sex is fluid, gender is fluid, orientation is fluid. It's all a spectrum, and if your doctor was actually paying attention in class he'd know this. 

Go find someone that actually knows what they're doing, this one's broken, throw the whole doctor out.
Ewwwww. Fire her as a health care provider and leave a review wherever you can with her name and your experience.
Solidarity with you on shitty experiences with queerphobic doctors. Last time I went to the doctor not only was I misgendered left and right, I was denied a necessary ultrasound based on my sexuality. Even had the humiliation of the technician loudly shouting to a nurse my sexuality and sexual history in the hall where other patients could hear. I ended up leaving and relied on pain killers until I could see another doctor
Sue for medical malpractice
I want to take a copy of ""Anti-Oedipus"" by Deleuze and Guattari and slap this doctors face with it as hard as I can (in Minecraft) because what in the motherfucking Freud is that bullshit...
I feel like this doctor needs their license revoked and to become a were/was.
Yeah that doctor is bullshit. I have allergies and as a kid before anything wacky trauma wise happened to me (or transition wise if the doctor is implying that, which is immediately fucked), I just thought carrots were spicy. Carrots are not spicy fun fact. That doctor sounds actually fucking insane, like Freudian everyone wanna fuck their mom type crazy. There is literally medically and genetically intersex traits which affect ~1.7% of Americans. Regardless it's not your doctor's job or place to debate your identity when you are going in for allergy testing. Doctors are professionals however the education system is still biased against marginalized identities. Many medical schools still teach that black people feel less pain than white people, which is just fucking insane and entirely inaccurate. This sounds like a fever dream of a doctor.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with this. That doctor is not only transphobic but clearly misinformed about gender identity, and it seems reality. You should report her if you can, this is NOT how patients should be treated, and clearly ignores the research backed by science that validates Non-Binary identities.

You are valid.
Sounds like a great opportunity to post negative reviews about them everywhere, make a formal complaint about them, and never, ever go back! Ever again. This is unacceptable in 2023.
You’d figure a doctor of all people would be intellect, but I guess not
I'm reasonably sure she just walked in one day and claimed she was a doctor. Absolutely no way someone that uninformed has a medical license
Please report this allergist! That was so rude and unnecessary of her to say. And your gender identity has nothing to do with your allergies, idk how she got her license to practice considering that she clearly doesn’t know how allergies work lmao. I’m so sorry this happened to you!
Yeah that’s total bullshit where the heck does she pull the dead twin twist from ? Nothint between he or she ? What about intersex wtf
I hope one day we get -medical-  -professionals- in reality
Ugh. I remember a time something similar happened to me, I was at a walk-in clinic trying to get my prescription for my meds refilled, and upon seeing that my pronouns are they/them, proceeded to ask my mom if I had dissociative identity disorder, and it felt horrible. As other comments are saying, please get a new doctor and report this one. She needs to not be in the medical field.
Omg I hate people who try to make stupid arguments like that. My personal least favourite is when people argue that its so new. Like, what? Nonbinary people and other ""less heard of"" identities - even neopronouns - have existed for ages. IIRC this kind of stuff existed when the Romans were around. THE ROMANS! And even if it was new, that wouldn't mean it's not real. You dont see people saying how the Nintendo switch isn't a real thing because its a newer console.
'binary world'

The a new version of 'life is a simulation' 💀
Email the doctor and ask them to confirm what they want you to do, that way you have it in writing and can report them with physically evidence of their prejudice and unprofessionalism. I’m sorry this happened I can’t believe they think that’s okay to think let alone say to anyone
I'm shocked to hear this person is really a doctor.  What's her letters?  Definitely a spiritualist one with no qualms about evangelizing to patients.   No judgement if you're seeking out someone like that, but don't let them promote fake medicine with a side of transphobia.  

Does she just happen to be private pay only by chance??
A lot of allergy specialists are ignorant snake-oil sales people. Sounds like this toxic practitioner is trying to prey on your vulnerability. Run, and write public reviews so others know.
Holy shit! Sounds like someone is inserting their own beliefs where they shouldn't be! Make sure you keep detailed records. Time, date, doctor's name, nurses names. 

Just for the sake of paperwork, ask for that doctor's recommendation, so you can file a report to the hospital and the state and the national level if you have to. 

This is complete crap and shouldn't be happening to anyone ever in any state. 

I get misgendered at the dentist I go to every single time and it puts me in a daze and a horrible mood the rest of the day. I can only imagine how you must have felt. I hope you're taking care of yourself and getting better help. 

All the best ✌️
Be sure to write all of this on their Yelp!
...that does not sound like a doctor at all. ""Prebirth"" or ""transgenerational"" trauma? ""Psychological"" allergies?! Nonsense.
What kind of puritan psychotic brainwashed bullshit is this.

I am so sorry you had to go through this. 

This doctor should lose her license.
Go after this doctor if you have the ability. The amount of bullshit and discrimination she put you through is... the gall of this woman. I am so sorry you went through this.
Like no need to ask anyone this doctor is legitimately WRONG, and is 100% projecting some strange internalized ideologies..........
Report her to her board, this is unacceptable
I don't think your doctor is a real doctor
PLEASE REPORT HER. someone like this should NOT have their license!!!
Run from that doctor as fast as possible. I'm so sorry that happened to you 😔
I have life threatening allergies and that’s not how they work you should get a new doctor for that reason alone but add on the transphobia drop them as soon as possible because that’s just wrong
wtf lmao I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. what unscientific bullshit
Sounds like your doc is seriously into some esotheric bullshit (aka not a real medicine). Run away until she harms you more than she already did.
jezuzfuckingchrist how absolutely horrific 🤦🏼‍😤😡 she is SO OUT OF LINE, this makes me SICK🤢 doctors should NEVERRR push their ideals onto their patients.
You should report this doctor and leave them a scathing review.
ew how could someone believe in this how as a person in the medical field do they have such disrespect for humans that are a tiny different and how does transgenerational trauma have to do with being trans i can't think of one way how they correlate
what an uneducated person! imagine when she finds out about intersex people
Have her listen to binary by The Spook School
Ew wtf?!?  I’m so sorry you went through this - I’m not sure where you’re located but I’ve been seeing an allergist/immunologist for years due to lots of autoimmune and allergy issues and have never been treated like that.  I only say that to say - there is hope!  There are good ones out there.  I think depending on your country there are lists of LGBTQ affirming providers - I know it’s always so much harder to find specialists on those lists.  Does anyone know a good list for specialists for this lovely person to help find the care they need??  

Also I am just…outraged by this dr’s GROSS unprofessionalism at acting like they have any right to your trauma history?!  What?  And also trying to sell their own shady and questionable services when you are clearly there for professional medical help.  It’s not that dr’s job to try to sell herself, it’s her job to be a damn Dr, or find a new job.  I hate people like that - I’m so sorry OP😤😣😢

Edit: also, I know LGBTQ affirming sadly doesn’t always include us Non-Binary folks.  I hope that changes more in the future😔
You just wanted an allergy test not a social and gender structure ""lesson"". 
Get a new doc that actually cares about the patient.

Non-binary human that asks for/requires allergy test. That's pretty simple in my mind (the mind of a non-binary EMT...LOL).
1. Switch doctors
2. Report this doctor. Immediately. That is in some states, an automatic termination without a warning if talking to a patient this way. Wow. I’m so sorry this happened to you.
I smell a malpractice lawsuit waiting to happen. What a quack. Sorry you had to go through that bull.
For a doctor, there should be no right or wrong, nor any good or evil, and that bleeds into political beliefs as well. A medic of any kind should not discriminate. They should help.
I am so mad on your behalf, and I'm so sorry you had to sit through being dismissed like that by someone so idiotic and hateful. I guess I'm not too surprised but I still can't believe some of these people are allowed to treat humans without better gender sensitivity training. Btw I'm cis but have a young nonbinary child and I would lose it if any medical practitioner spoke to or about him (yes this is his chosen pronoun) this way.
Your doctor was a titanic wanker, and I hope you can find one that isn't making up nonsense and passing it off as any sort of competent medical theory.  You might, if you live in a sane(-ish...) place consider reporting him for misconduct and/or malpractice.
Oh god, you need to find out who you can formally complain to about this. See, even if this doctor was speaking within the realm of fact, their entire brain seems geared to act as an authority who knows best for their patients, instead of someone who listens to their patients and tries to help. I can very easily see this same doctor receiving a patient who lays out their issues, and says what they think the cause is - with reasonable evidence - and this doctor going ""No it's 'x'. It's definitely 'x'. Stop thinking it's 'y'.  


Might be projecting a bit but I recently had a similar experience with a doctor and I just think having these kinds of people getting paid to basically impose their will on others is so fucking dangerous.
May I ask in which country did this happen? This is awful I want to cry
I wonder if that's true, all my life I felt a certain way and even before knowing I had a choice.
And physical health! This doctor will absolutely not take actual issues seriously
Thank you all, i am seeing my therapist on friday but i feel like all these comments and ranting together helped me a lot allready to wrap these things up in a package and put it in the trash. 

Also my flatmate send me reviews of this doc on google that sound the same, also with queer people being told stuff etc. I felt guilty about putting myself in that situation, because i didn't research enough.

Then i remembered, when i went to that allergology the first time, i had just had a gastroskopy and was very desperate to find an allergy test so i finally know whats happening inside of my body. Thus i looked at the first (always postitive) reviews on google and chose the doc on my way home. Next time i will do better research, but it is shitty in the first place that people who need medical support need to do a lot of research to find someone who is competent. This doc should be reported and i will do that when i have energy again, but i guess she was reported some times allready and nothing happened? 🤦

Thank you for your support. Next time stuff like this happens to me i might have the power to just leave. I tend to always listen people out and not put myself in first. So i need someone crossing my boundary before i notice it was too much. Will do my best ♡

Just happy, that i wrote this post during my stay at the doc, questioning her professionality. Otherwise her words could have harmed me more. Now i can laugh at it a little and shake it off.
♡
I second this as someone with allergies.

This so called doctor is going to get someone killed because she has no understanding of how allergies actually work.

She needs her license/certificate revoked so she can't practice medicine and kill someone.

Definitely report her for how she treated you on both accounts, the transphobia and the total lack of understanding how allergies work.
Second this. Allergies are basically immune system hypersensitivity to things that are generally harmless. Putting it down to trauma has quite literally led people to try to ""mind over matter"" an allergy and come out losing.

Allergies are annoying at best and possibly deadly at worst. They should not be treated with woo therapy.
Exactly.
Yeah, this just sounds so wild to me how they can even practice??? Sounds super weird, would definitely find a new doctor and report her for that whole mess. Sorry you had to go through such a terrible time. 😖
seriously! as a biology major, one of the first things you learn is that it’s very difficult to categorize organisms and create rules because there’s almost always exceptions
This is the funniest thing to me. It’s bad enough that non-medical assholes deny scientific and psychological consensus, but when actual medical professionals do it? Bonkers. Embarrassing.
Yes! Especially about that part, I can't imagine the harm such words could have caused a person hearing it who is or has been suicidal. So wrong!
Legit. I felt like I had a stroke trying to understand this pseudoscience bullshit.
How do i report a doctor and to whom? In general or in germany

Yes thanks i talked to my roomies and we ranted together about how shit she is.

Took a photo of her certificate for systemic coachings and appearantly the ""institute"" has the same last name. Might be her fathers/uncles/mothers or what ever relative institute and they spread bullshit or she just got it all wrong.
I agree!  This “doctor” sounds fraudulent and that they are pushing their own political agenda and weird beliefs over medicine and the well being of their patients. Very unethical and harmful!  And most likely this allergist is practicing “medicine” outside of what they are legally qualified to practice.  They need to be reported.  I’ve read about doctors like this that have just gone completely off the deep end especially over the last 4-5 years.
Biological sex isn't limited either, sex is also as complex, expansive and nuanced just like gender is. If she really got a degree, she would have learned that at some point.
Also that whole ""this is coming from trauma with you having an unborn twin"" thing sounds like bullshit pseudoscience. She should fucking lose her job and license, all you wanted was to be treated for your allergies not fucking outright deny you of your identity.
Seriously though, I think you need a new doctor, it isn't healthy to be around people who will invalidate you like this.
Germany, Leipzig.. you wouldn't think that it happens here but it's happening everywhere probably
Lol hey binary doctor person, tell me if a virus is an organism or not
Reading it I was like:Ayo, you yohoho no. That is not how it works, wtf
You can report her to the Ärztekammer for your Bundesland/Region. E.g. the Ärztekammer Nordrhein has a form that you can print and send to them.
u/KatWine is correct, I've just recently reported a doctor to the Ärtzekammer in my Bundesland myself. I was able to fill in the complaint form online and send it to them that way, and got a confirmation that it's been received and will be investigated accordingly.

You could also leave a review online (Google reviews and other services where this doctor may show up) if you feel comfortable doing so.
As I am an enby with allergies in Germany as well, would you mind telling me the general area? I want to avoid that kind of „professional“ as much as possible
Working as a speech (and therefore also trans voice) therapist in Germany, I lost count on how many Ärztekammer complaints I have written because people didn't get their Verordnung.
Btw, you can also reach out to your Krankenkasse.
seriously.  Im a pharmacist, ive also studied Peruvian Shamanism.  but I would NEVER push any of my spirituality onto a patient.  If im at work, its science based only.  If im practicing as a coach/shaman, thats the lens I work with at that time, occasionally if people want to talk theres crossover with good explanation/discussion.  but this whole situation is SO unethical and harmful on a bunch of levels.
I feel like this harkens back more like 40 years because it sounds like something right out of the Satanic Panic playbook. A lot of doctors who preached this kind of nonsense lost their licences to practice psychology for inventing false memories that tore families apart and literally sent people to prison.
Limited probably wasn’t the right choice of words. I meant to say that it’s more restrictive in terms of what you’re assigned at birth. But yes, this doctor OP interacted with sounds like they need therapy themselves.
IS FIRE ALIVE
Yes and no
Or mushrooms. What are mushrooms pray tell? Wanna put them all into neat “this or that” doc?
I love how the sentences sound with Ärztekammer and Bundesland in it ♡

Thank you, I will give it a try :)
Leipzig, Frau ""Dr."" Haferkorn
As an American jaded by our health system, I can confirm that Krankenkasse, transliterated into English as crank case, is definitely accurate for my health insurance.

[For non-native speakers, definition 2D](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crank)
Good point!  Everyone is entitled to different beliefs.  And they can be practiced in a way that is respectful and helpful to everyone. 

The doctor the OP is describing is forcing their beliefs onto others. It sounds like their are prioritizing their own beliefs over patient care or actually in spite of patient harm.  

I didn’t mean to say other beliefs in general are invalid. But the way the OP’s care was unhelpful and hurtful for them just made me livid!

Daethefancy you sound like a good pharmacist! ❤️🌈❤️🌈
So you're saying you can't fill my ayahuasca prescription?
Probably, but also, more likely, not.
Meaty plant go brrt
""mushrooms are obviously a plant! wait, no, they do eat other organisms kinda like an animal... my theory is that it's a plant with mental health issues and can't actually eat other living things it just thinks it can""
Alright, thanks. Probably won’t run into her than
Thx hun, this absolutely made my evening!! 😅😂😅 Tho I would actually be interested in how American health care works. So far I only know German and Swiss insurance policies..
Oh i didnt get that you were invalidating beliefs at all.  I agreed with what you were saying 100%.

And thanks! i got out of the retail world and am in insurance now, which is a whole other beast.  But, trying to fight the good fight for everyone. especially my enby family.  It stinks the medical community is literally at a minimium a decade behind in everything they do.
Haha, sorry. We don’t compound where I work.
hint: the question is more about the definition of life than the nature of fire.
Step 1. Sell soul


Ste...


Wait let me start over

Step 1. Insurance company sets price they believe something to be worth. Often influenced by frequency of billing for the procedure as well as by the rate our elderly and disabled federal policy pays (Medicare). This amount is typically insanely high 

Step 2. Hospital/Doctor sets pricing based on making a profit.

Step 3a. Patient buys policy or has workplace policy. I am fortunate to have relatively good coverage for a reasonable cost. I pay about $300 a month to cover me, my wife, and my son. My job pays another ~16,000 per year for my plan. This is NOT common. I am very fortunate.

3b. Patient needs care. Must select doctor who accepts their insurance.

3c. Patient receives subpar care and pays a flat rate co-pay upfront

Step 4. Hospital submits claim

Step 5. Claim goes to insurance employee whose job it is to make sure that every i is dotted and every t is crossed. Coding, pre-authorization, could cheaper tests have been done, etc. Each item on Claim is negotiated down to the ""allowable billing amount"" which is fancy talk for ""we rigged this so that cash patients are screwed but we made agreements with the providers about actually paying less"". Then a portion of the remainder is paid or denied based on insurance company profits and arbitrary rules. E.g. I had a knee injury to a tendon and needed to get a MRI. Insurance required that I have an x-ray first because it's cheaper and could show what the problem was. Not really, because it wasn't a bone problem. Then I was allowed the MRI. If my doctor hadn't known this, I would have had to pay out of pocket due to denial of claim. 

Step 6. Patient gets a bill for the remainder. Now, I had to pay $45 for the x-ray, which was billed north of $200. I then had to pay $1100 for the MRI, which was billed at around $8,000.

Step 7. Patient wonders why they pay for insurance.
Good points!  And anyone in any profession can be a flawed in some way.  Best we can all do is be open minded and respectful of others.

I know a lot of people treat doctors like they are all knowing and sometimes they act like it!  The longer I live the more I realize everyone barely knows what they are doing 😂"	10e80ri	NonBinary	711	1.0	2023-01-17 09:26:50
Was not allowed in a bar cause of a no bags for men policy	"I’m non-binary amab. I went to meet up with some friends at a barcade that was in a “sports bar” type area, not my typical scene but I didn’t think much of it.
My style is somewhat androgynous, long hair, light make up, baggy pants, crop top.
As I walk up to the bouncer he tells me
I can’t bring my bag (it’s my small purse) in. I look around a point to the nearest woman who has a huge purse and tell him that she has a bag. He then says “no bags for guys”…. Ouch
I was to embarrassed to explain my gender cause I knew he wouldn’t care so I told him it’s my purse and once again he says “idc no bags for guys”… 
I walk away in a sad defeated mood and just go home. 
Sigh. Nothing I can do about it just wanted to vent."	"I would really like to hear their reasoning for this policy. It sounds so arbitrary!
as someone who carries medication with them 24/7, that ""rule"" doesn't protect anyone. I would complain because that rule is super ableist, if they're worried about weapons just have a bag check policy.
This is like...one of my biggest fears. I'm so sorry! Being misgendered is bad enough, but being misgendered and also kept out of a public establishment specifically BECAUSE you were misgendered? I'd be absolutely gutted! And at a barcade of all places? In my city, those are usually pretty low-key venues where no one would expect violence to happen, none of them even have bouncers! I can't even wrap my head around why a barcade would have a policy like that out of fear of violence. Did you check on the barcade's website to see if that's actually a policy? It wouldn't surprise me if the bouncer was just making shit up because he's phobic.
Is there a different barcade in your area? I would just suggest you and your friends never go back, that place isnt worth y'all's time nor money
I'd be writing a negative review online. If they're worried about drugs, weapons, etc. they can just check bags. Also... do they assume that only men carry that stuff? Check bags, end of story.
Personally, I'd recommend writing online about it. Not about that bouncer bc you don't want anyone to lose their job, but if you publicise it they might be more likely to get with the times.
No bags for men? They should let them have bags and just check them. Anyway that’s bullshit sorry that happened
I've heard no bags for anyone or no bags of x size, but this is a weird rule
The idea that only folks that the bouncer perceives as men are capable of violence is fucked. There’s a music venue that used to pat me down until my presentation became femme enough. I still get pretty upset about it when I see them do it to the men.

I suppose it goes without saying, but a violent asshole could also make someone put the weapon in their purse. This establishment solved no problems with their discrimination.
My mom saw the same BS decades ago, before I was born. That ""men"" couldn't bring bags places because they might have weapons. She thought it was very sexist and knowing her she made a loud fuss about it whenever it came up. 

I'm so sorry. This nonsense is stupid. Either check bags for safety or don't. Profiling people and being bigoted is wrong. Was then is now
That's shitty. I'm sorry that happened to you.
That is such a dumb rule, and it's definitely discriminatory.
That bouncer was talking out of his ass, go complain and make a stink.

No bags for guys? In a sports bar? Nah, bouncer talking absolute shit, there's no way that's a rule. How many dudes are rocking up with gym bags? Is the bar willing to accept consequences and pay out when cars are broken into and dudes bags are stolen? DOes the bouncer, since its his policy?

What about dudes who might need to carry stuff with them from work, or for medical or personal reasons? What if someone prefers to keep their diabetic wallet in a bag rather than their pocket, like every diabetic I know? What if you had asthma inhalers in there? 

Once again, it MUST therefore be bar/bouncer policy that they accept responsibility if a customer has a medical crisis because they cant bring their fucking bag inside.

&#x200B;

WHat a fucking.....blert, this fucking bouncer, fuck. This has pissed me off. He was so fucking threatened that he just lied to you? What a coward.

&#x200B;

He can fucking check inside your bag for contraband.

Make it a thing. WOMEN are just able to carry weapons, drugs or other contraband, the bar is actually being misogynistic in that policy. 

Bullshit, make a HUGE stink of this, that bouncer let his vile, shallow, narrow minded bias show and now you get to destroy him.
Give them really bad reviews everywhere pls. So more people are aware that this isn't a save space.
I'm really sorry you went through this. I can't imagine how terrible and embarrassing that must have felt. Some people just cannot think outside of their own comfort zone, and even things that are changing are changing far too slowly.
what a shitty bar. also get better friends that take you out to better places and go home with you if you get thrown out over bullshit like this situation.  
if i was you i would make the bar public.
pure homophobia
Don't be afraid to tell us what bar it was and what the bouncer looked like, OP.
This is really frustrating, I hope the bar goes bankrupt >:'(
Honestly I've been to sports bars that have long lists of don'ts posted outside that are discriminatory but apparently it's allowed. There are bars that don't allow head coverings of any kind, caps worn backwards, etc etc. It's NOT a safety thing. It's discrimination. Same with bags for men. If it's about guns and knives they will check all bags and sometimes have metal detectors (I've been to these bars too).

The only reason to deny service to a paying customer for their appearance is discrimination! Hands down. It's only related to safety if you're a bigot and think that appearances make someone immoral or wrong or a criminal.
Wait wtf
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, I'm sorry that happened
You probably dodged a bullet in that place anyway. Any bar that has gender-specific policy is probably little more than a hook up spot.
That's infuriating to hear. I carry a bag with me to the LGBTQ bar I frequent, and if there's a new door person there, they just check the bag. They have a ""no large bags"" policy (obviously waived for the night's drag performers) and check everyone's bags on weekends - men, women, and those of us outside the binary. It's a simple process. I wish everyone did that, and I'm so sorry you had to deal with being shamed.
Hand it to a female friend. Now its her purse. Then reverse.
I'm not arguing it's OK or fair but bouncers have to deal with it when 💩 goes down and there may have been a past incident with, weapons, drugs, theft, or just dumb drunk drama that is driving the rule.  Not exactly a defence but service industry jobs can really suck.  try not to make them worse.
I'm agender AFAB and I would feel poorly about my unisex bag being designated a ""lady purse"" at a place like this. You should leave a bad review on Yelp to warn others.
That’s terrible I’m sorry 🤦 makes me shake my head at the stupidity of this world
I would look into that honestly cuz that’s discrimination
Wow that's fucking so stupid I hope you and your friends never go back there
Like the previous poster said. It’s most likely about weapons. I’ve seen this at other venues as well. However given the fact that I lean more to the femme side in gender and appearance and my purse is quite small it was upsetting
Gonna say they figure men are more likely to be carrying weapons?
Yep, my EpiPen doesn't fit in my pocket and most places serving food don't care about allergens.
There’s a barcade in New Orleans that’s been dealing with some violence. https://geekimpulse.com/sea-cave-arcade-and-bar-attacked-menacing/amp/
People losing their jobs because of transphobia is fine by me. They endangered their own livelihood by enacting violence.
Yeah, the way white women are put on a pedestal as being harmless or incapable of doing anything harmful isn't right. When transitioning (trans woman), I noticed that cops either completely ignore me, or trip over themselves to be polite.
Yea this was my first thought. Like why didn’t the friends offer to go somewhere else?
This doesn't fly at all in this case if the bouncer freely allowed women with huge bags into the bar. Women can raise just as much hell and can definitely fit contraband items in their bagss. 

There is no such thing as a 'no bags for men' policy at any bar in the history of bars, ever.

There are bag search policies. Bouncer showed his bias, cost his bar custom and money, offended a customer, its simple.
If the policy is only applied to certain people that's discrimination
In Germany it's normal that no one is allowed to bring bags (like in TV studios) or for stuff like bars and partys the bouncer just checks through, that you don't bring anything in like weapons, drugs, whatever... 🤷🏻‍♀️

Such ridiculous stuff like ""no bags for gender"" is straight discrimination.
If that's the case they could check everyone's bags that they take in instead of that rule
Thanks for sharing your rant! Obvs I share the outrage expressed in this thread 

I have an anecdote to share: My younger brother is cis but when he started carrying this tote bag around he started calling it a purse. Ofc I’m like finally someone with some sense, a bag is a purse and a purse is a bag no matter who carries it! But then he told me that it was just so he could bring an extra bag while traveling by plane (they’re often, but also arbitrarily, not counted as carry-ons.) 

My point is the arbitrary aspect, people need to carry things while they’re out, my brother simply started calling it something else and people were more inclined to allow it… I’m sorry that did not sway this bouncer. 

The size of the bag is reasonable grounds for denying entrance (I kno you said it was small tho) the fact that people gender the use of bags will always be nonsensical. The same attention is being paid to backpacks but if I carried my small backpack on my one shoulder they considered it a purse. Again nonsensical.
If there is a no bag rule, it should apply to everyone. Basing it on gender is extremely bias and discriminatory. AFABs can carry the same weapons as any AMAB and use them.

In my state this would be clear discrimination against gender orientation, but I don't know if that is the case where you live.

I'm sorry you had to go through this. I'd leave bad reviews for the place wherever I could if it were me but I'm kinda petty over stuff like this lol
It’s not about weapons. It’s homophobia. There are a lot of bars that have “anti-gay” dress codes that only apply to amab. It was very popular in my college town and my partner just ran into this issue last night at a bar in Toronto. If it was about weapons, they would look in your bag as they do for female purses. This fucking sucks that this happened to you.
Aren't bags normally checked by the bouncer?
They would be surprised by me then (well armed and usually passing trans woman).
So what though? That doesn’t mean they will only be carried by men, or that a man won’t put one in his female companion’s bag.
Yeah lol tell that to my mom who takes a pistol pretty much everywhere she goes
They may not be transphobic, they may not even like the rules themselves, but would have to enforce the rules of the business to not get fired.
Yeah, especially considering that I and many people I know have been victims of violence at the hands of white women, it's really fucked up.
Yes it's  unfair, biased and bad ploicy.  

My only argument is that Bouncers have a terrible job a main component of which is dealing with sloppy and violent drunks.   There's a good chance if they're turning people away it's based on a recent incident or incendents.  The criteria might be unfair biased and ill informed but my bet that there is something behind the Bouncers actions.
In Finland we have a coat till function at most bars. Bags and coats need to be left at the entrance to a worker run coat hanger system, it costs like 2€, you get a ticket that you exchange to get your stuff back when you leave. No one is allowed in with bags or outdoors coats.
I used to keep everyone’s dab pens in my purse in a secret pocket that I easily could put a small knife in and never got caught. They never look that hard in my experience
Didn't say it wasn't discrimination either way. Just made an assumption.
This is a set of rules that can easily be pushed against. The head bouncer typically dictates the standard, anyway.
OP is not a man, therefore the rule doesn’t even apply. Bioessentialism is inherently transphobic. You can’t look at someone and know their gender identity.
Sexual abuse in childhood by two different white cis women, one of the two nearly murdered by sister on several occasions. 

I believe cis women are every bit as capable of evil, but because it is usually domestic violence or child abuse, they don't get held accountable.
This is normally optional here, but I think it's a good rule. So you don't have all the bags and coats laying around and occupying for example seat space.
No, the manager dictates the standard. The bouncer lets people in who the manager told them not to, the bouncer gets in trouble. No matter the circumstances. Even if the rule is as stupid as this one.
And people make mistakes without full knowledge. Most people have no idea what non-binary is, and most people have never met a trans person before. People make assumptions. It’s not great, but it’s what happens.
Yep, exactly. That was the case for me and my friends as well :/
Bouncers don’t always listen to what they’re told to enforce. And, as stated before, there’s no way to tell what someone’s gender is. If they have a bag, assume they’re allowed and check it if you must. It’s really not that far fetched.
“Most people have never met a trans person before”—do you realize how many trans people exist in this world? This is absolutely false. They may believe they’ve never met one of us, but that doesn’t make it so.
There are 7.753 billion people in this world. 

Of the populations studied, one source is saying that only 0.1 to 2% of people are trans. Another source says Worldwide estimates for transwomen are 1 in every 30,000 people. Transmen are estimated at 1 in every 100,000 people. 

For the US, a source says: According to the Williams Institute, 1.4 million adults identify as transgender in the United States. About 0.7% of adults 18-24 identify as transgender, and 0.5% of adults 65 and older identify as transgender.

(Now obviously estimates will be lower as many people struggle to be out publicly, but it’s still relevant data)

So yeah, most people have never met a trans person before. We aren’t numerous. Obviously there is a few of us around, especially in places like this where we congregate, making it seem like there’s a whole lot. But in the grand scheme of the world we are minuscule. Our population is tiny. The chances of meeting a trans person is small, and many haven’t. 

I’m non-binary and I’ve never met another trans person in person. Only online. I’m part of my countries’ local trans group, a group that represents trans identities across my country, and it only has 2.5k members. Including ally’s. I’ve not seen another non-binary member in this group.
You’ve never KNOWINGLY met another trans person. There is truly no way to know how many of us there are as there is no set way of appearing trans. Also: the definition is very western and people who don’t identify as cis go by many names, and always have. This is, imo, a silly hill to die on.
Just because you don’t like the stats doesn’t mean they’re not true. We are a tiny population. 

Yes, sure, I may have met another trans person who didn’t mention it or wasn’t out yet. But that is entirely unknowable. I may also have never met another trans person at all. It’s just as likely because it’s also unknowable.

And as far as I’m aware, I’ve never met another in person. That is my lived experience as a trans person who seeks out queer spaces. Imagine a cis person.
I neither like nor dislike them. I just know how complicated statistics are to gather in the first place. The margin for error is wild and, as we’re already saying, because of how difficult it is to know, how on earth do statisticians know how often we “occur”? Which definitions of transness are included in these numbers? Excluded? These are muddy waters. Bouncers aren’t considering these numbers, they’re trying to oversimplify shit and that means we get caught in the crossfire—OP was caught in the crossfire and I don’t give a rat’s ass of the person discriminating against them gets fired; there are other jobs and hopefully they get their act together and learn if by some chance they didn’t already know about trans people.
Accusing people of transphobia when we don’t know if they are malicious or just ignorant doesn’t help. 

What OP went through was awful but again, we have no idea of the bouncers intentions. They could indeed be transphobic. They could just be following orders to not get fired, based on cisgender assumptions. “There’s other jobs” is a very ignorant thing to say tbh. 

I’m tired of you so will no longer reply. I’ve given you statistics. I’ve given you examples. Assuming everyone is maliciously out to get us all the time is exhausting. Sometimes people are just ignorant because they don’t know better.
Transphobia doesn’t imply intent. Microagressions happen constantly and often come from well-meaning people. You’re making very limited western-centric arguments. Be as tired as you like—it’s still a silly hill to die on. Nuance is lacking in all you provided.
You’re assuming I’m western. Should I accuse you of racism? Or perhaps you’re just being ignorant, and going from your own assumptions? And I shouldn’t assume you racist since you don’t know better?
“Western-centric arguments” is not “you are western”. My goodness.
I’m really not sure how this has devolved so wildly, and prefer you being “tired of” me. This is me throwing my towel in lol.
You are assuming my arguments are western centric. They are not. They are worldwide, as the stats I provided were worldwide, though I included some US stats too since there’s a bigger concentration there than other places for fairness. Assuming I’m coming from a place of western centricism is racist, according to your own perceptions. So you’re racist now, just like how that bouncer is now transphobic. Just using your logic. 

Trans people aren’t just a western idea. Trans identities aren’t inherently western. I genuinely have no idea why you seem to think my points are western-centric. Is it just because we’re speaking English, and using the English word for trans? That seems very English-centric of you :/

Accusing me of western-centricism based on nothing was ridiculous so I’m being just as ridiculous back."	wyuo7r	NonBinary	701	1.0	2022-08-27 05:33:30
Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/
If you are in the US you can report her to the state board, and if you utilize insurance you can also report her to your insurance."	11196wq	NonBinary	701	0.99	2023-02-13 14:13:29
Enby Explains Gender in Five Levels of (Emotional) Difficulty [OC]		"not only is this completely accurate, but the first panel is a very simple way of approaching gender for children that i hadnt considered at all... completely bypassing the intrinsic vagueness and confusing nature of identity and skipping straight to the functional stuff. great comic!
Ugh the “do I just want to be part of the community hits hard” 🥺😔
Damn that's hella accurate. Really felt that last panel.
The ""adult"" one is the truest shit. Especially paired with the final self doubt panel.
the going bald thing is real....32 and thinning hair.  I love makeup making me look softer but idk what ill do when I have to shave my head in likely a few years :/
This is so me... 🙀
Wow, this is is so good. Also I like that the teen has a hydro flask lol.
I'm amab androromantic bisexual gender fluid Enby with masculine-leaning gender performance and total indifference to pronoun's .... Never in all my years I read something so perfectly descriptive of myself!
As others have said. If that just is not the BIGGEST mood.
Well damn that last panel was a big oof
This is so good!!! I really love your line style
I've seen this format on YouTube and I completely love what you've done with it here. What a mood. I like your drawing style too.
This is too true.
This is amazing and painfully relatable :,)
i love that we have language to describe ourselves, but it is a little funny to see whole sentences that read like a foreign language. love micro-labels though, no hate
 I Felt the enby panel so hard.
Honestly that's pretty much the best way to approach anything for children, not just gender. Just tell them what they need to do and they'll figure out why from context in time.
Yep - for real. I’m just figuring playing around with wigs is gonna be a thing at some point.
You just gotta wear wimples everywhere.
Thank you! I'm glad somebody noticed the hydro flask :)

Magically cured	"AFAB nonbinary. I wore a dress for Christmas because I felt like it and it was cute and my whole family were excited because they said my 'mental illness' was cured. 

All day they kept telling how how girly I was, how feminine, and I hated it.

I tried to explain that clothes don't gender a person but they wouldn't listen.

My brother, who is gay and a huge ally, gifted me a subtle NB bracelet, called me by my true name and called me little sib instead of sis all day. That was a huge help.

How do I talk to my parents about this and how it makes me feel without causing a huge fight? We're a really close family but they won't acknowledge my wishes and deadname me constantly."	">We're a really close family but they won't acknowledge my wishes and deadname me constantly.

Doesn't sound like they're that close to you if they don't care how their own child feels and sees themselves. Idk how old you are or if you're dependent on them. If you're independent it makes boundaries easier. But if you are stuck with them they can play the ""my house my rules"" card.
Oh no! I'm so sorry, that sucks. Clothes do not create gender (I know you know this, but I'm saying it anyway) and you are no less non-binary in a dress than you are in a leather jacket. Also, being non-binary is not a mental illness wtf


I'd say your family did a great job of strongly discouraging you from wearing femme clothes around them ever again XD
I haven't had this issue with my parents, but my partner and I both have bad mothers, and little attachment to family in general. My partner's mom is a narcissist, among other things, and when we first met she was feeling stuck between abuse if she talked with her mom, and guilt if she didn't. I told her that she's grown and can choose how much to see her mom, and when to answer the phone. I've encouraged her to stand up to her mom, which became easier when her mom started dismissing her career goals, and wouldn't visit her in the hospital. Now they simply don't talk much and we keep visits short and holiday-related. There are some fights, but they both kinda just don't like each other, so her mom has been willing to let the relationship slide.

I know that's not gender-related, but I think it's worth asking yourself similar questions about your parents. Do you value a relationship with family in principle? With any of them in particular? Do they value you as a separate, independent person, or just as an extension of themselves or their beliefs?

I'm usually a proponent of having a big argument if it means standing up for yourself, though i saw you want to keep the peace. Consider giving them firm statements on how you feel, what you expect from them, and how you plan to reduce contact with them until they get it. A letter or email are good ways to do that, especially if they're prone to interrupting you when you talk. NPR usually suggests this statement include language like, ""I value you and want a relationship, but this is how you make me feel."" That's maybe a bit too touchy-feely for me, but I agree with the sincerity. 

Good luck, OP
your brother’s a real bro
I’m not sure if this will be helpful in your situation, but this year for Christmas I got my parents a book called nonbinary for beginners (even tho I came out 8 years ago and they’ve had plenty of time to do their own research… my therapist said unfortunately I would have to start doing the work for them if I ever wanted something to change which sucked ass) Literally the only gift I got them. And I told them the only thing I wanted was for them to accept me for who I am and actually use my pronouns or else I will have to cut them off for my own mental wellbeing. It actually worked and my mom has made a huge effort to start using my pronouns. She’s literally sitting on the sofa reading the book right now. And my dad has started correcting himself to say “child/person.” I know it’s kind of a specific situation and everyone’s parents are different, but my parents are 70 so if they can make an effort (even tho it took 8 years), there’s hope out there
It’s really hard for me to imagine how you’d have a close relationship with them if this is the situation… just thinking about how painful, invalidated, and unsafe I would feel around anyone who would treat me that way. And that’s really just thinking about the name/pronoun part, the hyper fixation  on your clothing and calling your gender a “mental illness” part is so freakin’ messed up!!! that I can’t even imagine having a relationship with anybody like that. 

I have hard boundaries around it, and I kind of hope you create some too and stop seeing them— because once you experience only being around people who honor and respect you for who you are, which is what you deserve, my experience was fully realizing my own worth and now it’s much easier to continue to enforce those boundaries, be clear about them with new relationships, and stand up for myself. 

If you feel that you’re a close family, then if they actually love you they will do the work once you communicate your boundary and stop seeing them. Your absence will make them reflect and realize how important this is, and they will either choose to do the work or decide they’d rather lose you entirely than change their mindset. It can feel scary because they might choose the latter, but that, to me, means whatever “love” they express for you is conditional. 

Because it IS important. God it is so important. And when your life is only full of people who treat you the way you deserve, that becomes so obvious that now I can’t even imagine going back to the days where I would bend for ignorance and intolerance.
I don’t have advice but I’m sorry you experienced this. I’ve been recently experimenting with more femme clothing and it’s so terrible when people assume you have realized you are cis. It’s like no, dresses are pretty and fun? So hard to present how you want when other people misgender you all the time.
You’re brother sounds amazing! 

As for your parents… take my view with a grain of salt. I’m a very confrontational person, and I’m working on that. I grew up in a rough home though and am used to duking things out physically and emotionally. Small afab here. You learn regardless of size sometimes. Not everyone will take that approach and that is totally okay. 

I’d cause the fight, but hope it doesn’t happen. Peace is ideal. Nothing relationship ending though.

Don’t try anything you aren’t willing to back up physically/emotionally though. In your case this would only be emotionally. That approach usually makes people back off from my experience.
>How do I talk to my parents about this and how it makes me feel without causing a huge fight? We're a really close family but they won't acknowledge my wishes and deadname me constantly.

IDK maybe a huge fight would get it though their skulls that if they want to have a relationship with their adult child they will have to be respectful.

They don't financially support or house you? They can pound sand.
this kind of sucks, but i used to think i was a part of a close knit family too. but after i came out they never acted the same to me ever again. it turns out it was a real conditional situation - i truly believed nothing would stand between me & my family, but....some things do, i guess. hold your ground and keep your head up, i am happy to hear you have one reliable ally on your side here at least. ❤️
In your place, I would tell them that their reaction made you reconsider having worn a dress in front of them.

I had to deal with a lot of deadnaming and misgendering from my family early on. Having fights with them helped. There is no way for them to understand your pain without fights sometimes.
How are you a close family if they treat you like that?

Sorry bud, but that sounds like denial i'm afraid.
You're not a close family. You're in a family that tell you that you're close, so that you won't rock the boat and risk 'losing' that closeness, all whilst they treat you like utter crap. Keep the brother, ditch the others.
Aw that sucks! Sorry you had this experience. Unfortunately your parents may never “get it” but if you feel safe enough (physically and emotionally) to talk to them about it and it feels important to you then I would encourage you to think about what it is that you really want or need them to know… maybe you know websites or parent groups that provide more explanation? Also, I wonder if you could ask your brother to help with this conversation or resource sharing? Outside of that I hope you consider what you need to feel okay before during and after the convo. Can you make sure you have access to emotional support in the process or at least an idea of how you might decompress after? Either way, I hope you are still able to dress in ways that feel good to you in spaces that feel safe for you to do so… Good luck with all this and take your time. Trust your own process 🌿
Sometimes, a fight is inevitable if you don't want them to continue to disrespect who you are. Im sorry you had to go through that. unfortunately, we all too often have to stand our ground, and that can end up severing ties with people we care deeply about. 
Just remember, you are important too. You need to put your well-being and health above all else, including your family.
My sibling has gone through a lot of changes with her identity and sexual preferences over the years and generally lives a life outside of the status quo. So a lot of times my mom will think she is just being rebellious, is confused, or whatever. She is very timid and tries to stand up for herself but she is basically just seen as the naive baby even though she's almost 30. I am very confident and sure of myself and have no issues with confrontation. I often fight the fight for her so that she does not have to. I will educate and pound the knowledge into our parents whether or not they like it. It sounds like your brother loves you a lot and it's possible he would also be willing to do so for you if you just asked him. You don't have to go through this alone you know!
Oh gosh I would've ripped the dress right off and gone hide in a corner to cry. I'm glad your brother had your back. He's a real one. And I hope you'll be okay
I kind of have the same situation, the only ally In my family on my mom's side masks her allyship at times but I love her still.

I rather not talk about it with your family, I've tried to talk with mine and they won't listen, I'd say just do you and have them get used to it.(unless you have a really tough time with that, I wouldn't recommend masking yourself and acting like everything's fine, that just makes things worse for yourself)
Same here, but my younger sister is helping me.
You may not be able to talk to them without a fight. But you should talk to them. 

Biggest lesson I learned is you're better off losing a mean transphobic family than keeping it.
Dont, just leave ASAP. You aren't obliged to deal with their abusive shit.
Unfortunately you can't always do anything. I just do not talk to some of my family. I don't even see them. I did however recently hear that they made up a rumor about me wanting to be a man, and that I am gonna get surgery. I just laugh it off because they know nothing. It is your decision if you want to put up with the abuse, or if you cut them out and distance yourself. But I do have to say I am in a much better place mentally.
Little sib.  <= Like.
Your brother sounds lovely at least
Your brother is so awesome for that! Also yeah a dress is just fabric, you can give it whatever gender/feeling you want. People still don’t get it
Oooh, i fear stuff like this. Thats why i dont come out as an Amab Nb to my very conservative family.
That sucks, I'm so sorry 😔
Your brother is an angel though! I've never herd the term ""little sib"" and it's so cute and accurate, I love it. Hope the rest of your holidays work out better ❤️
I'm sure other people have better advice on how to deal with your family, unfortunately I'm clueless. But, as an aside, I bet the dress was gorgeous and that you looked stellar. Merry Christmas, you're brave as hell and from one dress-up-loving NB to another please keep rocking whatever makes you feel good to wear ♡
My family is also very close to each other. My dad has all queer children (two of which are trans) and I’ll tell you what he said to me one day after I asked what made him come around. That day he said, “I either had to accept you all as you are or not have a relationship with any of my kids.” That has stuck with me and even though he slips up I know he tries. If someone really loves and appreciates you, they will try. They might not know how much it hurts you. You can decide when you feel comfortable enough to tell them and even have an accepting family member or fried with you for support. It’s ok to feel conflicted about this and it might take them a while to figure out what my dad did. They might not ever come around. But you don’t have to feel like you’re giving up on your family. You still love them and that’s ok. Either way, you will figure out how comfortable you are in making these decisions for yourself in time. I wish you the very best nonbinary friend.
Well.  Signed up for Reddit just so I could respond to this question.  Here goes.  When I was a li'l fella (I'm not non-binary, but have a GNC streak haha), people used to try to give call me by a common nickname for my actual given name.  I'd either not respond to them, or I'd say something like ""Jonny isn't my name, my name is Jonathan.""  You could try using that to get them to stop deadnaming you.  Just don't respond when they deadname you; or if you choose to respond, you can say ""Landry is my name, not Janeen.  You can call me 'Lan' if you want, but I will not respond to 'Jan' or 'Janeen' since neither of those are my name.""

Or call your mom by ""Miss *insert maiden name here*"".  When she says ""My last name is *insert last name here*, not *insert maiden name here*"" you can respond ""Point made.  Call me Landry or Lan.""  You have a leg up on her if you've legally changed your name, which may be a good step to take anyway.

Best of luck with the fam ...
Honestly I would just stop trying.  You don't have to cut them off completely but I would just ghost them
tell them to fuck off and rip their heads out of their asses, and then sever all contact
Luckily, I am 31 and live apart with my husband. We've had a few conversations about it over the years but I get the age old ""I gave birth to you blah blah"" argument which is always fun
Today's family gathering features manly af Landry in their lumberjack clothes haha
Thank you for this great advice! I definitely think I have to stand up for myself more and not just roll over and take it.

My parents are my biggest supporters in everything in life and have always been my best friends. That's why it came as such a shock when they didn't support my coming out and actively go against things I ask of them
He really is. He's amazing 😊
It's honestly super complicated. We've always been close but it's because I always compensate. My chosen name is Landry and my dead name is Janeen. My family always called me Jan so I told them to call me Lan because it was easier.

Nope. No deal.

I asked them to stop gendering me and since them they keep buying me cards and gifts that specifically say daughter or girl on it. 

Mu mum said I was confused because I spent so much time with guys (all but one of my chosen family are guys) and so bought me feminine clothes and tried to get me to do things with girls in the family that I'm not even close to. I explained to her that's not how these things worked but again, she didn't take it in.

She told me it shouldn't matter because I'm married to a man (like wtf does that even mean?) And I asked her if marrying my dad meant she wasn't a girl anymore and she told me not to be stupid.

I have depression and anxiety and my family think the people online have ""manipulated me"" into having this ""disorder of nonbinary"".

My brother, my husband and every single one of my friends and even my in laws call me the right name and pronouns and immediately did this without needing to be harassed. 

As I discovered more about myself, I wanted to share it with those I love but they didn't want to hear it. I cried and told my mum when I came put as ace and she told me I was just putting labels on something that didn't need them.

I don't feel unsafe in my family home just unhappy at times. Every time they say my name it hurts. I've told them this but I get the whole ""I had a daughter and I named her Janeen"".

I'm an author and my husband told me to use my deadname Janeen Leese-Taylor on my novels, that way I could just think of it like a fake pseudonym so it would hurt less. He hates how my parents speak to me and always stands up for me and calls them out on it. He calls me Landry in front of them and is my biggest ally. Without him and my brother, I'd be lost
It's like no, skirts go whoooooosh that's why
Have you tried the ""wish you hadn't"" response lmao that always pisses my mom off lol.
Start calling them by their names instead of mom and dad, or aunt-whoever. Just names. When they complain, say ""Since you've decided to not respect me enough to use my proper name and pronouns, and insist on defaulting to 'I gave birth to you', I'm choosing to honor your parents' choice in names by calling you by that name"". Turn it around on them. Remind them it's a matter of respect, and until they respect you for who you say you are, you won't respect who they say you are, because they aren't acting like parents. They're acting like assholes.
As someone who has given birth to two humans so far, that line baffles me. It gives you the responsibility to do your best to raise a good human, not override rights to your offspring’s personhood in perpetuity.
Let them die alone tbh. Sorry if that spunds harsh but its what they deserve. If they want to try and bully you they dont deserve your love and support imo. Of course its your choice, its just that I've witnessed first and secondhand how so many good people prioritize horrible ones due to family ties.
Is your name Landry? Thats such a cool name٫ and super unique. I love it 😮
You could also just ignore them when they use your deadname. Or ask who they are talking to or about all the time. Pretend you don’t know this deadnamed person. Coz that person doesn’t exist.
Yeah, that's weird that they wouldn't be supportive, but then maybe they'll respond better to the sincerity and threat of boundary enforcement. Have you found any educational media you could share with them?
No but that sounds fun haha

My mum tries to take me out for 'girls days' to 'cure my confusion' and we always end up in Starbucks. I always make sure to use my real name and she hates it haha I get glared at.

I have begun a campaign of bring as authentically me in her presence as possible. I just wish I could bring her around to my way of thinking
One of the commenters above gave me some ideas so I'm gonna investigate and educate!
It really sounds like they're stuck in their ways, but if you think you have a chance to educate them, I'd start with history lessons on clothing and items that have now been deemed as male or female-only. Many things we see as feminine were created by and for men, including makeup, heels, and *dresses*. In fact, pants weren't really a thing until they became necessary for horse-riding, so unless you plan on riding any horses, a dress or skirt is the most historically appropriate clothing item for anyone of any gender. 

Before the 1700s, women weren't allowed to be involved in the coffee making process at all, let alone drink it! So your mother taking you to a coffee shop is, historically, a very masculine thing to do. If you explain this to her and she still drinks coffee, start calling her confused, asking if she's no longer a woman for participating in such a manly task. A lot of transphobes (that are uneducated and not hateful) learn by having the roles reversed on them.
is she buying it for you? i mean starbucks is pretty expensive, i’ll take it lol! also why is starbucks out of all things the most feminine thing she could think of? it’s just coffee, men drink coffee too!
This sounds amazing. I'm gonna start doing research! Thank you so much for your help!
I want to add in computers. Computers used to be typically women who did calculations, you know, before THE computer was invented. But even then, in the 70's and 80's a majority of coders and programmers were women and women put men on the moon with their programs and algorithms. There are so many of these modern things that have a history totally opposite of the modern perception. Definitely research more, I know I will. I had no idea that pants were made for horse riding, I just knew heels were made for it."	zvm14i	NonBinary	668	1.0	2022-12-26 12:18:12

I identify as non-binary, my friends are very accepting. How do I explain this topic to my older generation parents? Any suggestions?		"[deleted]
My parents took it better than me being bisexual, but I think it was because I was never hyper fem/masc. I found bring up Prince helped too, my parents are in their mid 50s, so they had a relevant example to look to.
I'm in a position with my parents where I don't feel like I can come out to them because I don't think they really understand what being non-binary means.  So, there have been baby steps.  I'm amab, so it started with wearing more jewelry around them, and we just recently established the idea that I'm a ""man who like to wear fingernail polish""

My plan has been to bring up nonbinary folks as an idea, and get them more comfortable with it and establish some understanding.  Also,  making small steps towards having a more feminine presentation around them.  My idea is that eventually I'll get them to a place where I can come out to them and it won't be a big shock, or something that they don't understand.

So far so good.
I've used this before, while it's a little incorrect it's familiar for older folks: 

""You know how people dress babies in pink or blue for girls & boys? I'd be dressed in yellow!"" 

On names: parents can get very upset when you change your name. They probably spent a lot of time picking one out, plus it might have familial significance. So, try to find a way to have your new name honor them, even if it's bullshit. Example: your name is Sage and you chose it because you love cooking with your mom. Or whatever. It can be a total lie, but it makes parents feel recognized.

If they need an example of name changing being an already-established cultural norm, compare it to someone getting married and changing their last name. And that's not so hard, is it?

The trick with older people is to find familiar parallels in their own experiences. Problems can happen when you use too many ""weird new words"" and they tend to assume it's ""some dumb fad."" Explain you never knew about being non-binary when you were young, just like them! And the more you learned about it, you were amazed to discover there's finally a word to describe yourself, and how happy that makes you. 

**The worst thing you can do is make them feel stupid.** If they don't understand don't push too much hard right away. Say you didn't understand at first either. Offer to provide them with articles or literature. Especially look for things that document being NB as something that's been around forever, not a silly fad.

Make sure you stress how *happy* being (and expressing yourself as) NB makes you. How exciting and gratifying it is when your friends respect you. That your life is **better** for coming to this realization. And you want to share that happiness with them, because you love them.

All this advice is for someone who loves their parents and generally gets along with them; someone who wants to keep their parents in their life and isn't endangered should they refuse to accept/acknowledge you. Only YOU know what you're comfortable sharing. Be safe, be well, and be happy! Good luck!!
I'm almost 50. Coming out to my 75 year old mum was amazing. She's super supporting. 

My 74 year old Dad though. not so much. 

GOOD LUCK! (and you look fab!)
I've found the shoe analogy quite helpful. Some people are a size 12, so you wouldn't make them wear a size 6 and vice versa! Good luck!I hope it goes well for you!
I don’t have any advice but I wanted to say I love your outfit
First, I love your outfit. Second, what to say to your parents honestly depends on what their political opinions are. If they’re far right and it might be potentially unsafe to come out to them, I wouldn’t do it unless you don’t live with them/don’t rely on them for anything. Whatever the case, I find that using fact based language is the most effective way to explain gender to people who may be out of touch with it as a concept. My dad is Catholic and right wing. I came out to him in my therapists office and gave him packet of information written in my own words for him to read. I sincerely doubt that he even looked at it but it was worth a shot. In it, I explained the difference between sex and gender, what being trans means, what dysphoria is, what it means to be non-binary, a brief history of non-binary and “third genders”, and other things. All of the things I mentioned were objective facts and I largely left the emotional/mental aspects out of it because I knew those things would be completely lost on my dad. Overall it went okay. It didn’t make him disown me or anything, and even though he unfortunately doesn’t use my pronouns or acknowledges my identity, I’m glad I came out. At the end of the day, it left the door open for dialogue. Maybe he’ll never understand, but if I didn’t come out him, there would never be a possibly of that someday happening. 
Good luck ❤️
It depends on what type of people your parents are. My dad is pretty religious and I think it actually helped from an “all god’s children, makes no mistakes” kind of angle. There’s also an analogy people use about how dusk/dawn nor every species on earth is listed in Genesis but they are also a part of creation. 

One thing I find that helps older people understand is giving them concrete examples like “how would you feel if you were forced to wear a wig/cut your hair?” 
“What are some of the first memories you have of being told how to behave according to your gender?” 


But yeah I think it really depends what their specific attitudes and hang ups are around gender. I mostly wrote this comment because I wanted to say I really like your outfit.
I’m NC with my parents but if I wasn’t, they probably wouldn’t be open to understanding the concept of not conforming to a gender. 

As others have said, it really depends on how intelligent and open-minded your parents are. Regardless, your identity is yours- and even if you tell them and they misgender you or they get weird about it, that doesn’t invalidate who you are. 

Also, I love your outfit.
If you're AFAB, to simplify things,  I'd just use the term ""tomboy"". It's not perfect,  but it's easy enough for old folks to understand I think.
No idea my mom is 'young' she is literally 21 years older than me. But the way I broke it to her is ""congrats, You now have all the genders in your kids! You can't mess up on what gender clothes you get!""
I feel like age has less to do with it than attitude and religious beliefs. I’m in my 40s and didn’t blink when my kiddo came out. My ILs are in their 70s and while I’m sure they don’t really understand what Non-Binary is, they’ve been super accepting and work really hard to use proper pronouns and new name. My parents are in their 60s and are major bigots and would not have handled it it all (which is one of the reasons they are cut off and don’t know).  Good luck with telling your folks. I hope they are supportive.
Jonathan Van Ness’s new netflix show has an episode about being non-binary, and it’s pretty decent for an “introduction” to the topic! 

They do a great job of affirming non-binary identities across a bunch of cultures - including a discussion w/ a two spirit person (whose name escapes me!! but who i adore!!). 

(also i know it’s been said but your outfit is killer!)
I feel like gender identity is mostly lost on that generation (my parents are mid 60's). I feel like they definitely understand sexual orientation a lot better but couldn't fathom as to why I would want to shed my masculine traits for feminine ones. Completely dumbfounded. They accepted me but don't understand whatsoever which leads to being misgendered or stuff like ""but I could never call you anything but deadname!"" which is annoying/frustrating.

If you're parents love you, they'll find it within themselves to accept and understand this new you...and as their kid, every parent should have that 'Wellspring of Undending Love' for their child tbh. Have a heart to heart conversation and place importance on how much this means you.
I’ve never told anyone about my feelings and probably never will now stayed closeted all my life , but although it’s probably easier said than done I think you should tell your parents how you feel , be nice to think younger parents are more understanding, but whatever you do always be happy in yourself ❤️🫂
Maybe bring up nonbinary historical figures? (Various African leaders, artists, etc)

Or ancient societies/versions of societies that loved and accepted their trans & nb members. (The Philippines, Rome, Native American tribes, Egypt, etc)

Just remember to fact check so they can't argue without sounding dumb.
maybe bring up gnc people from in their generation? like i bring up Prince, David Bowie, Grace Jones. i know it's not strictly the same as being non-binary but if they're people you relate to then it might be helpful
Okay, your outfit is fly AF.

Moving on.

Only come out if you have a safety net or if your security isn't dependent upon their acceptance. I think you should broach the subject gradually, and maybe even do it one parentat a time. I don't think it is wise to come out all at once without first finding out how they feel about other LGBT groups. A good way to judge their existing knowledge/opinions of ""nonbinary"" and ""androgyny"" is to bring up a nonbinary celebrity you like; I think good examples would be Ziggy Stardust, Prince, Lachlan Watson, or Indya Moore. You could even use the words of a nonbinary celebrity to explain their gender identity to your parent(s). 

The way I usually explain being nonbinary, though, is this:

""Everyone has an internal sense of who they are. Most people feel either masculine or feminine; however, nonbinary people do not have the internal sense of themselves as belonging to either binary (name drop) group. Like the Muppet, Gonzo, I feel like a blue alien made out of felt and the passion of Jim Henson.""
“You’ve heard of men? You’ve heard of women? I’m neither.” or “A binary is a system made up of two things. The gender binary is made up of men and women. I am neither; I am non-binary.”
I explain that with “gender roles”, I define it as the role that gender plays in my life, rather than what role I am assuming to conform with a societally defined gender.

In defining “gender role” as such, I explain that the role that gender plays in my life is one where its conventional expression isn’t important for my happiness or sense of who I am. In fact it’s detrimental because it’s a mold I can’t fit. And trying to fit it leads to a constant sense of self-othering and disappointment even when I am an okay if not good person.

“I am happy being me, because being a good man or woman is less important to me than being a good person.”
i’m closeted and terrified to tell my parents, so can’t help with that but you are sooo gender
""when two binary genders hate each other very much, they fuck off and leave me""
i sort of explain it as i’m a “girl” but just with a little more ✨spice✨
but ofc everyones perception is diff, so depending on how androgynous you feel u can relate it to how you feel in respect to the binary eg “i feel comfortable not being forced into the label of just boy or girl etc@
Well...unfortunately I'm still trying to tell my own parents that I'm non-binary. Good thing I had my friends in high school to support me in that, good thing even my college classmates that some of them are of the LGBTQ+ Community are perfectly fine with it.
So i guess, we're on the same page with that coming out ""problem"".
I put problem in quotes because...its idk...I'm not gonna explain it, mainly cause I can't explain something so...
I wish you good luck and, I'm sure everyone here has a lot of helpful tips.
I fucking LOVE your style
Idk about the answer to your question and I hope you don't mind me asking, but that shirt/blouse you wear looks really dope, even though we dan only see a little bit of it.

Do you happen to have a better picture of it / where'd you buy it?
You don’t need to tell anything to anyone really. No one really cares anymore. Just continue dressing the way you like.
Any chance you could share more about your grandmother? She sounds cool. Like how'd she come to be doing that?
[deleted]
I'm so curious! Did your mum understand what you meant when you said nonbinary? Was she familiar with the concept before you brought it up to her?
Your description made me smile😁🙃 I'm born 69 and are in the process of shedding my masculine traits for feminine ones. I think it's very individual, perhaps depending on how open minded they are. My friends had no problem grasping the concept of being non binary but one of my cousins didn't understand at all and do instead think that I came out as gay😮  Her mother on the other hand had no problem understanding and accepting at 86 so it varies greatly.
Everything I'm wearing in this pic has been thrifted

My parents literally went “like Prince?” and I had to tell them, “I think that would be an insult to one of the greatest musicians of all time, but yeah.”
Mum wasn’t aware of the term non-binary or genderqueer, but did know about transgender as my sister works in the NHS and has some transgender patients at the surgery she works at, who mum has met. 

So I explained starting at transgender and working back from there, and Mum quickly got the idea and accepted me as enby/genderqueer straight away

Going on things mum told me about my childhood and things I’ve told her, it has turned out very likely that I am a transwoman rather than “just” genderqueer, but I would definitely describe my mum, sister and nieces as all being enby/genderqueer/trans allies 100%

"TFW ur an amab tomboy and u have to keep explaining to people that ur neither ""Tom"" nor a boy. Sigh."		"I support amab tomboys that are neither “Tom”s nor boys.
I love the response ""I'm a swarm of bees"". Then the pronouns fall right into place.
Love the look! Please can you tell me where you got the dungarees; I’ve been looking for a pair and I haven’t really found any
I admire your bravery and authenticity ✨
Glad to see I'm not the only one out there.
Neither Tom or boy, only cute!!
Discrimination and hate crime need to be prevented wherever possible but in the end we're only really responsible for our own happiness and self acceptance.

You can find them all over I think (pun intended lmao), just gotta make sure to check the men's and women's sections usually. Also Lucy and Yak (I think they're called) do really good dungos. My sis in law recommends haha."	kbpzzm	NonBinary	483	1.0	2020-12-12 14:31:53
Husband doesn’t remember my pronouns.	"My partner (36m) doesnt remember my pronouns: they/them. 

He says he makes a very big effort around coworkers, but he legit calls me “she” all the time in front of me and our kids. 

I realized im nb summer of 2021. 

We’ve been together for over 15yrs.

I’ve corrected, I’ve expressed how i feel unseen and overlooked when incorrect pronouns are used, im being patient. Our children 6+1 dont hear from him about using my pronouns.

We’ve talked, I’ve given information, I communicate… I’m at the end of my leash …

He says he really doesn’t remember. And im like — ive explained and expressed how it bothers me… and he says he just doesnt remember.

How do y’all deal with this? Im so frustrated that the person that’s supposed to be my person “doesn’t remember” yet makes an effort in the outside world? Seems really inconsistent, more about him then supporting me…"	"If he doesn't even bother to correct himself I would seek couples therapy. If he can't see it as important enough to remember and put effort into then idk, you've expressed your position at the reoccurring problem. He acknowledges that it's difficult for him to remember but it doesn't seem like he's doing anything to fix that problem.
For people that have a lot of trouble, practice seems to be key. If you have any photo albums you both could sit down and go through them, the goal being for him to describe you accurately as he goes through the album. You could ask him to pretend you're a third party unfamiliar with your history together if that helps. 

You: ""What's happening in this photo at the beach?"" Him: ""I just splashed sorry-public-346 and they threw a crab at me, we both laughed so hard we peed."" He can go as slow as he needs during these practices to get things right. ""And here it was our first child's 3rd birthday, they (pointing to you in the picture) made a pinwheel themed cake just like jr. wanted, but then they tripped over the dog and spilled their creation into the fireplace."" etc. etc. etc. 

I was occasionally getting my youngest siblings pronouns wrong despite us BOTH being non-binary and using they/them pronouns. I don't think of them as a gender other than their own but when thinking of them as a tiny, before they were able to assert their gender, I will occassionally default to how they were referred to then out of habit, since I let people refer me by what it ""looked like"" for a very long time. It's stupid. Going through their baby photos and using the correct pronouns has helped. Hope your hubby puts in some effort and fixes this asap. There are techniques to fix it, it's reasonable that it might take some time to find them, but he should be invested and willing to put in work to figure it out.
You didn’t mention if he attempts to correct himself or when he slips if he acknowledges it so I’m going to go based on that not being the case.

To me it sounds like he does not take it seriously and that is why the effort isn’t there. It’s not that he doesn’t remember, it’s that he doesn’t care to learn. My partner had to adjust to using they/them pronouns and would slip up and immediately correct himself and now doesn’t ever slip up. Adjusting pronouns is not a hefty task unless you don’t take it seriously, in my opinion. 

I hope you have others in your life who are acknowledging and referring to you the proper way. 💕
Use an airhorn every time he misgenders you
Honestly, that would be the start of a harder conversation for me. Because he has known about this for over a year and isn't making a change in a way to support his person who he married. The fact he isn't trying sounds like there may be a lot of other small ways he disregards your feelings and other boundaries.  


My partner and I had been together for 7 years when I realized I was enby and started using they/them pronouns. He got it over night. This was while we were engaged and not married yet.
Have you seen him around coworkers?  If you're just going off his word, you don't know what he's actually saying to people.  If he can't even give you respect to your face, there's a good chance he's still just completely regarding you as the wrong gender at all times.
When he uses the wrong pronouns:
-Scream
-Spray him with water and vinegar
-Ask, ""who? Who are you talking about??"" And when he says you, tell him, ""oh no, I'm not a she.""
-Ignore him entirely. He's ceased to exist.
-throw rotten tomatoes at him
-ring a bell
-leave the room
I had to cut out my favorite aunt recently because she refused to accept my gender identity and pronouns. When I asked her to respect my pronouns she replied with ""naaaahhh"". I cut contact with her and haven't spoken to her. Today she reached out and said she'd be praying for me for my top surgery tomorrow. I reinforced that I expect my gender identity and pronouns be respected and all I got was radio silence. I've resorted to cutting contact with those who refuse to respect my gender identity and pronouns,  mostly conservative Christians. I'll cut anyone out no matter how long I've known them, friends and even family.
Memory test? Sounds like some issues going on upstairs if that's genuinely the case.

Sorry you're going through this.

Edit: I am genuinely suggesting you suggest a memory test. I didn't make that clear. I don't think it's his memory, but maybe if you start taking that seriously, like he has memory issues that need medical attention, you'll find his memory suddenly working again...
He doesn't see you as non binary. He sees you as a woman and I highly doubt this will change.
Honey, he remembers, he just doesn't care.
He's not forgetting. He's not trying
Start calling him Steve or change his pronouns. It’s (probably) not his name and use it consistently for a short time to illustrate that despite how long you two have been together, one can make an effort to change. If he protests, tell him you will return to normal when he shows your the mutual respect of using your pronouns.
IME people who say they’re “trying” but keep fucking up are actually not trying.  i had a colleague who kept fucking up, we had multiple conversations, but until it got brought up to the bosses THEN they finally got it.  The day after our collective meeting she got it wrong like once every other week rather than 5x a day.  It’s like, “now you’re trying, jackass.”
I’ve heard that as a short term thing from friends of mine - that they gender me correctly in social situations I’m not in but not to my face. This only ever lasted a month or two tops tho.

One thing friends said helped them was to replace my pronouns with my name? Idk tbh I’d start physically separating. Maybe start staying some nights at your parents or friends place. Start not including him at dinner. I’m not saying divorce him right now. Mild separation.
As someone with asd, I am super bad with people I have known a while changing their pronouns. A lot of the time my brain exists off previous knowledge, which means if we have been around each other a long time...its harder. It took 3 years before I got used to pausing to ""read"" my gender fluid friends efforts before using a pronoun and...it makes for some awkward pauses every conversation. Hell same vein I was describing a friend we were gonna meet up with as short blond hair...forgetting that for the last year and a half they've grown it out and dyed it red.

15 years together, and 1 year of change... I can actually understand, to a point, someone trying harder with strangers then with their partner. You generally see people assume they have a pass and benefit of the doubt with people they are close too. And if you somehow become involved in a situation with coworkers, they will hopefully act accordingly.

Not excusing no effort, but to a point I do understand it. But if I can be trained to self remind myself to pause and check, there is hope. We won't go into how often I misread things though, as I feel i am taking a stab in the dark with hope they attempt to present at times.
He didn’t forget to [insert activity he loves to do frequently], right?

We don’t forget the things we care about.

The crudest form of this is something that can be said to shock “forgetful” young men: “You didn’t forget to jerk off today, did you?”
Maybe truly seeing you as nonbinary would also force him to acknowledge that he is now in a queer relationship, and that is a big issue for him?
I personally find changes in pronouns hard, but you keep working at it and it starts to stick.

My child came out as NB at the start of the year. I think I'm using correct pronouns about 60% of the time so there is still a way to go. 

It's the non ""they/them"" stuff that trips me up more. Are you still ""wife"" or are you ""spouse""?

I can't understand how much it must grate but you're changing 15 years of ingrained behaviour, if he's still trying then try to be patient.
Same with my partner. I get that its tough because I'm not out to everyone so there is a switch that has to happen, but he talks about me to our kid and uses she all the time. Also I've chosen to be addressed as ""mama"" to our kid but gender neutral elsewhere. I'm 30 and have been out to him and friends for 6 years. Once in a while he will use masculine descriptors in a convo (handsome, my husband, dad) to make up for it but its very hard for him to use ""they"".
I teach a workshop on this, but honestly, it sounds to me like your husband doesn't care and isn't trying. does he practice, or correct himself?
My opinion, if he doesn't remember, it's because it's not important to him 😮‍💨 I'm really sorry ❤️
I've seen what feels to me like a trend or correlation of straight men in relationships with nb people (often afab) that they then refuse to acknowledge the identity of or make very little effort to accommodate, especially behind the nb person's back (they only use she/her). It's a very sad phenomenon. Nb seems to be ""woman with extra pronouns"" to those men
I could have written parts of this! Except we have been together 20 years, and I myself often misgender and say the wrong pronouns.

We have regular family chats (usually Sunday afternoons) and I think I need to raise this as a topic with my husband and kids and just remind everyone and mention how much it makes my day when someone gets it right.

I think I’m also going to talk to him a few weeks before hand and gently explain how important it is to me, so that he has time to adjust again. And I have said it in a space where we are both calm and receptive.

I don’t know if either of those things would be helpful for you? I don’t even know if other families have regular meetings? Maybe over dinner??

I really hope things get better for you though, you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your own home! <3
Every time he uses it wrong correct him quickly. He needs to respect you. It’s been 15 years, come on man, put a little effort in for the human you literally married
That always bothers me when you tell someone that something hurts you and they're like ""oh but it doesn't really matter all that much"" no. If someone tells you that you've hurt them, you don't get to just decide that you didn't. He doesn't give a crap and its showing. I personally would probably hit the end of my rope too
First: Please feel hugged.

My DH and I are married for 2 years now and my CO was just a few months ago. He also sometimes misgenders me and also English is our second language. Our native (German) is very much gendered and it's a big political and ideological discussion to even be more sensitive towards women in our usage of speech. Not even talking about NB.

I know, you have talked to him, but if he says he always ""forgets"" it seems like he doesn't want to make an effort. I don't know him and I don't know your dynamics.

Have you tried asking him to only refer to you by your first name? Cause in German we don't have an equivalent to they/them I mostly use no pronouns at all (just first name + you) and if I talk I try to use only the generic form of words, so not gendered at all.

I wish you the best and that you guys can work it out.
Me and my twin sibling are both non-binary, and both use they/them in english, but we use different pronouns in our native language. They use our version of she/her and I use a sort of neo-pronouns version of they/them, one that's a mixture of singular and masculine-plural pronouns.

They mess up my pronouns the most often out of any of my friends, and usually don't notice or don't correct themself.

In my case, it's probably because they still have to talk about me in my old pronouns to our parents, and they still love with them, so they still have to use those pronouns to me more often. With other people, like my closest friends, the change was more prominent. My language is much more gendered than English so I have to use my pronouns literally every time I talk, and since they only heard me talk about myself in my pronouns it was a constant reminder that made them remember it after like a week and completely get used to it after about a month. my twin still struggles with my pronouns a year and a half later.

I saw someone recommend you change your contact in his phone to include your pronouns and I think it might help, having a visual change will catch his eye and remind him. Maybe having him wear something new and permanent to remind him, like a new ring or a bracelet that's there to remind him you have new pronouns.

Or you could always just wear a name tag with your pronouns and point to it and ignore him until he corrects himself, although that feels a bit passive aggressive.
It was hard for me at first even being nonbinary. It's engrained in our heads and it's not cool. What helped me was reading fanfics with nonbinary character with they/them pronouns. Seeing the pronouns used consistently in things I read everyday helped normalize it. Idk maybe you can introduce him to media with they/them characters?
Corrective air horn.
first off i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. he’s your partner, he should remember and do the bare minimum… you should set some kind of rule to enforce him to remember it. like a misgendering jar he has to put money into whenever he messes up /hj
If he apparently doesn't remember, then ask him what would help him remember and then do it excessively. And definitely correct him every time he says she. Doesn't have to be much, just say they whenever he says she
My partner found it very hard. For around two years he struggled to call me they, and struggled to notice he was doing it. I sat him down and talked him through it, and started correcting him every time he’d say she. I explained how hurtful it was for me to be misgendered, and told him that it caused me both physical and mental pain. I don’t think he understood how important pronouns were, as since this conversation he’s not really slipped up much, and this conversation was 3 years ago. He also corrects my family and all of our friends

. He’s autistic so I understand it was harder for him to adjust to this change as before I came out I’d been using she/her pronouns since we’d gotten together (7 years). He did manage it though, he’s just taken to calling everyone they/them until they tell him different, which isn’t a bad thing.

Your partner needs to make much more of an effort or admit he’s not even trying and is transphobic. I’m sorry, but you’re they/them and him misgendering you won’t change that, it’ll just teach your children that misgendering people is okay and also make you miserable. I hope you’re okay and he either pulls his finger out or you come to some sort of decision. Sending you all my best!!
Couples therapy because if he loves you he should really be making an effort. I’m almost embarrassed to suggest, but it might work, try spraying him with water every time he misgenders you and see if that helps. If he doesn’t see how it makes you uncomfortable then perhaps the discomfort of being misted with water every time he messes up might bridge the empathy gap.
I’m an enby. My best friend of 17 years is an enby. It took me an embarrassingly long time to change my usage of their pronouns to the correct one, because my brain just went on instinct while talking about my person. I changed their contact in my phone to “Name (they/them)”. It helped tremendously to see it written out every single time I messaged them, and reinforced it in my brain. Would you be able to change your contact in his phone? 

My other suggestion would be to change the pronouns you use for him. If he gets bothered by it, then he knows exactly how irritating it is to be misgendered on a regular basis. Might help.
So if he has the cognitive ability to do so in front of coworkers, to which there is face to lose by misgendering you since you’re out to them, but not in private to just you where he feels “love” will shield him from consequence… you have an answer.

Seek therapy or make peace with your husband viewing you as a woman. I don’t mean to be harsh or blunt but the meme of a delusional AFAB having a cis straight man as a partner who “acknowledges” he is in a queer relationship while being a cis straight man simply doesn’t line up when he won’t properly gender you. 

This line of thinking is only possible with great effort on their part. It is rare to be a cishet man, but able to be with a nb person without inadvertently, passively misgendering them. Usually it’s contingent on not physically transitioning in anyway since one cannot control sexual desire for certain physical traits.
I don't know how my saying this will land, and I'm sorry, but I don't deal with this. I set the expectation with people in my life that they will get it, I tell them, ""most people get the hang of it in a couple of weeks"" (if we see each other often) and people generally do not have an issue farther than that. Slip ups happen but they correct themselves or someone else does.

I have been openly nonbinary for more than 10 years.

Your husband is choosing to misgender you.

This is not your fault, and there is no work that you could put in to change his behaviour. He has made his choice.

I cannot express how sorry I am that you're being made to deal with this.
throw the whole partner out.
not to be flippant but since summer of 2021 it's been over a year. he obviously doesn't care.
This is in no way excusing his behavior but, as the spouse of a non-binary person, it can be hard to adjust to pronouns. Especially after being together for so long prior to you coming out to him. 

My partner realized they were NB after we had been together for ten years and it took a little bit of time but I got there eventually. It’s actually become harder to remember to use their assigned at birth pronouns around the people my partner doesn’t feel safe coming to. 

All that said, It’s been a year and from your post and other comments, it sounds like it could be one of two things. Your husband is either being deliberate and is ignoring your wishes, or he actually has a memory issue; the latter of which sounds far more unlikely.

It’s probably best to seek intervention in the way of couples counseling or having his memory tested by a medical professional.
Best solution I would say thearpy but possibly he could be suffering from memory lost like Alziemer's disease or maybe short term memory ................... I don't know why I'm talking , when I'm single
It’s hard sometimes. He’s met you and known you by this one name and pronouns all this time so automatically he will forget. My partner forgets all the time, but he makes up for it in using my given name that I did not originally introduce myself to him as.
This is not going to be what u want to hear, but you cannot control his behavior and if you have communicated repeatedly your needs and he hasnt shown any change then its simple that he understands he can continue to call u “she” without consequences. 
Honestly this shouldnt even be a “my needs” thing but a “this is the standard” and he can live up to it or leave. 
Misgendering you constantly is not a matter of ignorance but a fundamental lack of respect and i say that having lived through the same thing. 
You have several options. The best one id do is dont be afraid to leave him. It seems like a small thing to leave over but its a huge red flag- if he wont respect you on pronouns now i assure he wont respect you on things he perceives as more important later. You can try couples counseling if you arent prepared to walk away but feeling u need to bring in a 3rd party for him to just listen to u is also a red flag. id say to not treat your pronouns as an option first. Next time he calls you she, walk away. Ignore him, be offended, react the way you would if he insulted you bc thats what hes doing by not listening. If he wont respect you, then he can sleep on the couch or better yet. Leave for a few nights. Kids make it more complicated i know. But your pronouns arent optional.
It’s great that you have taken a step to discuss your reality and how you feel with your husband.  He cares for you and according to you is making an effort.

What you have to understand is that your reality isn’t everyone else’s. So it takes some time to adjust as he attempts to make you feel heard and important and adjust his reality and what he knows to accommodate for that.

If it’s bothering you that much and causing you that much emotional anguish. Divorce him. Better to do that than be miserable in a marriage.

At the end of the day you may need to ask yourself if him forgetting the new pronouns you have given yourself is worth ending a 15 year marriage over a man who clearly loves you and wants to be with you. Lot worse out there.

Being 100% real and honest with you, I wouldn’t stay with my partner if they came to me and told me to call them a different pronoun. I would still love them but couldn’t be in a romantic relationship with them. Right wrong or indifferent that’s the truth. He is willing to stay and love you. Whatever you decide, it’s what’s right for you, you know your boundaries.
Start using she/they for him. It works for my co workers who “can’t remember”
My mom ""forgot"" for 4 years. I gave her 4 years of time to learn. When I realized she just didn't want to. She didn't care enough or wanted to pretend she could change me ""back"" or she really is just that oblivious. 

The sad thing is, I finally gave her an ultimatum. Told her it's not ok anymore. She doesn't talk to me anymore. I've lost a mother. I'm having nightmares about it. 

It'll get better. But this isn't easy. I guess just know that you are doing what is right. Stand up for who you are. You are valid.
dump him men are trash go meet a beautiful queer love

also I can guarantee u he does NOT refer to u as ""they"" to his coworkers
My very best friend in the entire world (who I have known for many years) came out as nonbinary this summer. I have used the wrong pronoun exactly once and apologized profusely. If your husband paid a modicum of attention to his speech, he wouldn't mess up like that.
If you do (OP), make sure it’s with a truly trans-affirmative therapist who specifically has happy nb clients.
This is a great suggestion. I love that. 

It took me practice to say they/them, and practice to introduce myself as that. I know it’ll take him time, looking at pictures and telling the kids stories would be a lot of fun. Such a welcoming opportunity!
this is what i was thinking too. i hope OP sees your comment.
Yes!! I like this one the best.
I have a squirt bottle that I have thankfully only had to present and *threaten* to use with friends. For my MIL who still struggles 2 years in, I've taken to wearing a series of progressively larger and more colorful pronoun pins that come out and get conspicuously put on after she misgenders me.   


(I'm confident it's not a malicious thing on her part, but it *does* communicate a lack of care or effort, which still sucks)
i gotta start doing this
Im pretty pro these options.
This reminds me of a scene from ""Heartbreak High"" (the newer version) when someone's stepfather misgenders them and they whip out an airhorn.
You said this better than I was going to. If it's truly a memory issue (coming from someone with shit memory), remind remind remind!
I hope your surgery goes well tomorrow!
I had similar issues with my relatives, but over me being vegan 🙈 They don't even know, that I am a pansexual NB.

But if another person disrespects you, cause of whatever choice you made or what you are comfortable with (being trans isn't a choice), then this person don't deserve space and resources in your life.

I wish you best of luck for your surgery 😘
I corrected him today and he sat there looking at me not understanding why I said “they”. “No; theyyyy”. He blinks and is like — oh right, they. 

I think this is a reasonable request, except for the fact he has great memory at work. I feel like at home I get the scraps of the quality of person I get at home.
Based on op, this is how it seems to me too. Husband isn't even trying to do it right. He's not respecting it, which is a bad sign unfortunately.
If OP changed their last name after they got together then they can point out that he had no issues with completely changing their legal name but he for some reason draws the line at being a good husband when he doesn’t get anything out of it (A spouse in the last name’s case.)

He really needs someone to give him a reality check if he can remember that they no longer use their old last name but not the fact that they use different pronouns.
I agree, and I too can understand to a point. 

I showed him this thread today and said — look. Im not showing you to say “youre bad”, but from other people’s perspectives what they’re saying.

So he agreed to therapy and figuring it out.

If he is open to me exploring myself in my time, he deserves the same.

I appreciate your share. Thank you 🙏
""If he wanted to, he would."" Someone said this to me once about my own husband and it totally rocked my world. 

OP, I agree with the people who suggested counseling.
I totally get that it’s an adjustment. 1000%. 

I prefer partner or spouse. Im not a wife.

But like with me, talking to me and our kids and friends, he almost never says they/them. If he wants to use my name that’s cool. Just stop misgendering me.

I totally have peeps that make flubs and sometimes catch themselves, and sometimes not, but i see a genuine effort of inclusion.
My mom is very big on female gendered terms for me growing up. I’m 31 and out as NB for about a year. We only talk 1-2 times a month on the phone but she’s been immediately catching herself each time and says she’s still learning. 

I’m awkward about correcting people so its nice that she at least catches herself and tries. I also don’t entirely know the new names she could call me that are the cute kind of names she likes to use (like “child” doesn’t have the same level of cuteness she likes saying something like “girlie”). 

But yeah, OPs husband sounds like he just doesn’t care to put the effort in. A couple years and OP constantly reminding about pronouns there’s no excuse.
I hope you're correcting yourself the 40% of the time that you misgender your child.
Hey hey! Thanks for the share ❤️

It’s a little off putting seeing folks say “leave, he doesnt love you, he doesn’t respect you”… you know how hard it is being in a long term relationship. And how much stuff you go thru together.

Someone previously suggested to look thru old pictures and have dad tell the kid’s stories with my current pronouns. I thought this was brilliant.

Im looking for how to bridge the conversation, insight from the other side.

The other thing we’re doing is going for a couples counselling tuneup.

After it coming to a head, our oldest is doing their best to use they/them. It’s taking steps, not all or nothing.
Thanks for the love.

We’re going to go to therapy to get a tune-up.

I think he has a hard time articulating and locating where something comes from within him… so I hope this can give us the language and practice to change habits.
I like the idea of a name tag/button. I wanna find one thats like a magnet. 

Good suggestions!
Ouuu i like this suggestion! Thank you :)

Someone earlier suggested retelling stories from photos with current pronouns.

This is good too ❤️🙏
Thank you for this share 🙏

I feel that once i said to him how often he’s making the mistakes he just for whatever reason hasnt made that change in his mind. That’s definitely a him thing, so he needs to take accountability and responsibility for making those changes.

It’s finding what works. Thank you for putting this out there.
Hello hello! Thanks for the suggestion!

I will change my pronouns in his phone. Yes!!

And I will now call him they/them. Yes. See how they like being misgendered.
I think this is where we are stuck. To me our relationship is what it is, but to him… a fragile cis man…. Well….. you laid it out.

Andddd off to therapy we go! Get it out, process it, and get sorted. It’s how adults in committed relationships do things. Quitting isnt the answer here, working thru problems is.
Shiny spined comment
I can tell from experience that's not often the case. My twin almost never misgenders me when they talk about me to other people or when we're on a group call with friends or something like that, but when we're just the two of us in a room they usually revert back to my old pronouns, and I've been out for about a year and a half. All my co-workers know and make an effort, but my own twin gets it wrong and usually doesn't even correct themself, and I found comments they made on Reddit defending my pronouns in our native language (they use they/them in english but she/her in our native language, and I use a sort of neo-pronouns that are a mixture of singular and masculine-plural pronouns that isn't really popular yet but it's getting there).

Sometimes the people who know us the longest and spend the most time with us have the most trouble getting used to a new changes. When I'm not there or when it's an environment like a group call they remember my pronouns pretty well with no actual effort to trying to remember, when we're alone they forget again. Because us being alone just the two of us is something so familiar to them that the new change doesn't register even after a year and a half.

To me personally it doesn't matter when they get confused because it's them, but if that were any other person I'd just make sure there's something new physically that could remind them that hey, this situation is a bit new, so it'll remind them and get them used to it. Like how you draw something on your hand to remember to do something later.
We do have a supportive therapist, I think it’s time we go in for a tune-up and work it out. 

Many assume a lot about our relationship, but I wouldn’t have had kids with someone that I had doubts about overcoming difficulties and differences in our relationship.

He’s a good human, and we all have faults. Very seldom is grass truly greener on the other side. 

We very much so are still in a loving relationship, and I appreciate you sharing from your perspective.

Are folks here going to understand that, well they haven’t been thru what we have. And even after all this time we still discover things about ourselves and each other.
We actually do have one! Lucky to have found her.
😊
Usually, I can get away with just asking who they're talking about without having to escalate to the more extreme options. In my workplace, knowingly choosing to misgender someone is considered illegal discrimination/ harassment... So maybe also remind him of that 🤷
Honestly the spray bottle. Works when my cat misgenders me.
I think these are good, also a tshirt with a big THEY/THEM on it, non binary pride flags, etc
Your username cracked me up 😆  and thank you!
Eh, another non-binary vegan! :D I don't run into too many of us!
Do you see him at work? If not, you can't be sure that's true
And like, that's just not something you forget, right? If I expressed to my partner that something he did was really hurtful to me, that would not just be forgotten. I'm sorry you're dealing with this OP ❤
I kept my name because that’s my name. I think it’s very patriarchal to “take names”.
Yeah, I tend to word vomit my pov for this reason. Working towards change is hard for some people.

Nice to hear some therapy though. Sometimes helping someone find their own method to remind themselves is all it takes.
Have you had a conversation about how this affects your marriage?

Obviously you are not quite who either of you thought you were. It could be he's not used to the idea yet?

I'm sorry if there questions are intrusive. My spouse has recently been questioning their gender. White I'll support them being whatever they are I'm not sure how it would work for the marriage. I'm straight not pan so while I'll love then it goes to a strange place. 

If this is still unresolved with you it could be causing these issues.
Something like ""kiddo"" perhaps? It's gender neutral and still pretty cute
Yes of course.
I'm holding my thumbs that you guys are able to work through this together 😘
I really appreciate your share on this. 

This is how he’s explained it to me. 

This isnt the first time we’ve had someone that’s changed their name or identity. He’s gotten on board with them, needed practice.

You’re not booting your twin to the curb. Im not booting my partner because we have something that needs work. You know?
Rude lil kitten lol
The boobs are gone now and so is the funk!
Nice to meet you 🤗 On the /vegan are also some strolling around. You just have to ask. Or maybe start a discussion here in NB 😘
I have. So that’s why I’m frustrated.
Agreed. I just saw a repost where a doctor didn’t take their spouse’s name because their spouse wasn’t a doctor.
Hard agree. I wanted to have hyphened names but my husband didn’t like my last name, so he kept his and I made my former last, as my new middle. 3 years have passed and he is on the train now of hyphening or creating a whole new shared last name when we have kids (or before if we get around to it lol) and thats one thing in the group of things that makes me love him more and more. I regretted taking his last name this whole time cos other name loving my name and identity, his father was a piece of shit and he’s ready to take that step too of letting the name go.

In reference to this post, I admit I have a hard time with pronouns of my friend who went by she/they for a while, now goes wholly by they/them. I find myself thinking “she” in my head half the time and I correct myself mentally, but I find it easier not to mess up with my words cos I think about what I say before then. I hate it about myself and wish my brain would just do it automatically by now. 

Has he said anything about any remorse he feels when misgendering? I agree with others that the meat of the issue comes to whether he makes the effort to correct it. My husband struggles bad with my chosen name, but he corrects himself when he’s talking about me to people/introducing me. He almost always says the wrong name tho, lol. He has ADD so that hinders him. I hope that your husband begins to make an effort and engages in conversations with you about this topic in reciprocation.
His first question was how does this affect our marriage, and it’s just my gender and pronouns.

We still love each other and our family. That didn’t change.

Every situation is going to be different, communication is the most important and giving space to allow personal growth. But those things can change the fundamental things about the marriage.

Something I never really considered was him not having the language to communicate, or know how to feel or what he feels. And that’s a really big impediment. So it’s time for a tune-up and go to therapy.
Oh yeah, we’ll work thru this. This is definitely not territory of separation.

Like I said 15yrs, that’s a really long time to build a relationship. Folks that have been in long term relationships know the trials and tribulations. All relationships are messy in their own way.
Underboob funk is real.
Oh that's awful. I'm so sorry!
I dont know if i could marry a person like that…. Odd behaviour.
I'm in the middle of a bad spat right now myself. He's been distancing himself or shutting down when I affirm what I'm after in our relationship or anything to do with my gender or sexuality. I'm getting fed up with his behavior. Ten years for us. I don't want to give birth. He wants to keep his genes going so I said surrogate is fine but no it has to be me pushing out spawns even though I'm a more likely candidate of actually fucking dying from it. I bring up my sexuality (ace but I'm cupio so I love fucking) in memes to try and get a laugh and some understanding. Or NB memes for the same reason.

Me trying to describe explain my nonbinary experience to my cishet friends		"I aim for the first pic, I achieve the second.
Ayyyyyy👉👉
I want to be both at the same exact time. Imma make that possible
I'm both
The top pic is quite literally the goal tho

It's extremely annoying when people attack me for me being nonbinary, spew a ton of transphobia, then hit on me. Are these people delusional?	"I try to explain myself to people who have questions. Yet, when they start telling me there's only two genders and I'm wrong *then* say we can have different opinions and still have a relationship. 

Um. No. You're literally denying a part of me and think we can have an emotional connection? Not happening. Especially if you refuse to even listen."	"they could not possibly make it more obvious that they don't care about you at all, they just wanna fuck you
Asshole intersectionality. I see this as a cross between negging, transphobia, and patriarchal enablement of entitlement to those seen as lesser due to skewed categories that they create.
Short answer? Yes, yes they are delusional.
Yes, they are in fact delusional. You can be in a relationship, platonic or otherwise, with someone with differing opinions. The problem here is that being non-binary isn’t an opinion, it’s not a political stance, but an identity.
Oh good, a whole new breed of negging. 

I'm still amazed that people seem to think that will work. 🙄
Honestly, it is incredibly common for cis people to be attracted to trans people. But most of them like to pretend they're not, even those who are broadly supportive of trans rights. So when they do hit on a trans person or even hook up with a trans person, they can become quick to throw that transphobia/enbyphobia in our direction. And it's completely unacceptable.
> ...have an emotional connection?

They are most definitely not there for that.
Horror movie monsters are real and they are called Chasers.
Had the same thing happen to me. Deny that non binary people exist and then tell me I’m beautiful. What the fuck reaction are they expecting?
Delusional? Mostly just rude and small-minded. The second they start telling you you're wrong, politely tell them the conversation is over - they asked you purely to speak over you, with no intention of learning. They are not worth your time.
Really annoying but, really annoying
If someone asks a question about someone’s opinion/beliefs they don’t have the right to start an argument about the answer. Nobody asked for a debate.
I had a guy tell me he new I wasn’t straight or cis then proceeded to try fuck me? He’s a straight man. Wtf. In this same convo he also said I look like a 13 year old and that he sees me as his sibling… there was a lot to unpack there
Probably, yeah. Had this happen on Tinder. Something about, I am probably someone that is super unpleasant and we don't at all align but he was down to fuck me. Hatefuck, maybe?
I'd take this over radio silence.

As an AMAB as soon I put my pronouns on my profile I saw a steep downward trend in my matches and people willing to talk to me.
People put others down to boost there fragile ego.  They feel bad about themselves so they try to convince themselves they are better than u.  It's selfish.  Some people are very selfish
Right, duh
It's wild, isn't it? IME even people who are cool with binary trans people can have a really hard time wrapping their head around nonbinary identities. It's exhausting to feel like you have to educate people just to have them validate you as a human being.

My mental health really improved when I stopped trying to reach everyone. If I already have a long-standing relationship with someone (family, coworker, friendship), I make the effort--but I just don't have the emotional bandwith to deal with randos anymore.
Which is hilarious bc they would probably also tell me my views on sex and body hair are wrong. I love changing people's minds. My most recent ex didn't understand me, but he's still trying. He would constantly refer to himself as straight and I'd tell him I understand that's how he identifies, but it also makes me feel like I'm not seen by my partner. I am not my vagina.
Bang on. This kind of predatory, sexually aggressive entitlement IS delusional
I do have countless people in my daily life that I couldn't even tell I'm nonbinary. They wouldn't even know what it means. My brain has never understood the gender binary. It's never made sense to me and it's always caused huge feelings in me. I remember being a pre-treen and refusing to go into Victoria's Secret bc they didn't have male models.
It's worse when I find out they have been practically stalking me. This happened with two men recently. They added me on Facebook. Then weeks later they showed up WORKING with me! I didn't realize they were the same people I had argued with and ignored. idk it's just so weird the extent these people will go to get laid.
I feel so disrespected. It discourages me when it comes to trying to really educate people. They come off as caring and then flip to telling me I'm wrong. I get it that they see me as a woman and just want to get laid. I don't want any sort of relationship with those people.
especially since identity isn’t an opinion or a belief
a little bit of an aside here but i also looove changing people's minds. i'm so happy when people i've dated let me know that they are enby or trans bc i helped them feel it was normal and safe in order to discover that about themselves. or even something as small as showing them that it's ok to shamelessly have hairy pits lol
I completely get the straight thing. I identify as a male now, but even if I dated a girl, I wouldn't be comfortable if she identified as straight or called the relationship a straight relationship. I am, and always will be a queer queen, regardless of who I'm with.
Wooooow yeah ew kill it with fire (figuratively).

Like does this approach ever actually work, or does it just feed their frustration and make them violent? Pretty sure i know the answer there...
oh hell no, that sounds scary as fuck!
Beliefs coincide with identity. You believe you are something so you are, that’s how that works. 

Edit: How about look up the word gender identity. Literally disproved exactly what you just said, along with pretty much any other belief that defined a person as an individual. The very 3 definitions of belief are:

1) a state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing

2) something that is accepted, considered to be true, or held as an opinion

3) conviction of the truth of some statement or the reality of some being or phenomenon especially when based on examination of evidence
You're right. If they're going into my inbox and they don't even know me irl then they're having a hard time. I'm going to be vulgar, but whenever a cis-het man who's transphobic and homophobic tries to hook up with me I tell them the only way I'll do it is if I can peg them."	xmxgze	NonBinary	416	0.99	2022-09-24 16:36:44
My first pride accessory (homemade to explain the quality). Parents are transphobic so I can't get myself anything without being super discreet. The string has non-binary colours and the beads trans and rainbow pride		"Thats so cute and the quality doesnt look bad at all!!!
This is awesome I think it’s super cute- hopefully you will be in a safer environment to come out fully one day.
Hey, u/zzzonal I hope this counts :)
Very nice! Great way to be creative. Sorry you’re dealing with that situation, but you’re awesome and valid and keeping your pride alive!
YES MONARCH! Slipping in that validation on the down low <3
I love that!
That looks really good!!
This is a good idea! I might make something like this, but as a necklace.
Super cute idea! And who cares about quality... its important to you thats all you need <3 just be aware wool stretches and thins over time :) especially if it gets wet.
The home made stuff is the best stuff. I absolutely love it.
Ah! Thank you so much! It's simple but I can't stop looking at it
Thank you mate! I hope so too. It's not the most pleasant but the little things keep me going
YES, it absolutely does!  Rock on.  🤘  You are officially entry #7 in the Enby Sweater Contest.  (Apologies for the delay, had to take some time away to slowly process current events for a bit.  ❤️)  Good luck!
Yeah no I never really experienced crap for being gay but when I came out as trans (non binary) I got some but I’m still in a safe environment so I got my first pride flags. The feeling is magic and I really hope that it isn’t long before you can have that experience ❤️
That sounds so nice (that certain feeling, not the crap you got)

I can't explain why, but I feel like enby folk and bugs go together lol.		"Because bugs tend not to have plainly identifiable ""gendered"" traits. They're just cool little buddies doin their own thing, regardless of how alien we perceive them as being.

Similar to why many folkx gravitate towards mythic creatures. That's my feels at least.
i’m an enby and deathly terrified of bugs i hate them so much. am i the only one!?!?!?
From just my personal observations we come in several broad categories/flavors:

- Mysterious cryptid / 12 layer pile of genderless clothing either trying to avoid sight entirely or glaring at you angrily, because you’re standing between them and the snacks on isle 12, and that isn’t cool. You should move. Snacks are important. 

- The Beautiful, androgynous Tolkien elf. Gods but they’re hot… and fashionable too. Am I gay? Yes. 

- The Goblin. Likes all the bugs. Yes, even spiders. All the plants too. Probably related to Radagast. Eats mushrooms from their back yard. Get excited about weird yard statues. Owns all the pets, some of which are bugs. Some of the bugs ARE statues. Say hi to smiley, their bird eating face hugger tarantula. He bites. So does the goblin. Lucky you. 

- The Gender insurgent. Doesn’t give a fuck about your gender norms. Doesn’t give a fuck about your approval either. Definitely fucks. Yes, that’s a bondage collar at work. You’re just mad they wear those boots better that you do. You gotta problem normie? They’re like Che Guevara, only with better hair. Their wardrobe consists of whatever won World War Gender last week. (They’re secretly really nice, shhhh, don’t tell, it ruins the fun of fucking with normies)

- Human Person. Not given to showy displays of gender/less plumage. Looks like a person. You’re not sure what kind. Blends in. Probably a ninja. Still has a lunch pail they use at work. Their shirt went out of style with the Nixon administration. Get them behind closed doors though, and suddenly they have a deplorable excess of personality. It’s too late. You thought you were safe. Muahaha 

- The Icon: They’re fabulous. You’re fabulous. Hope you like being the center of attention, they sure do. Everyone likes them. No one knows what to make of them. They’re an experience. They always have more/better glitter and/or makeup than you. Sorry, it’s just how it’s gonna be honey. 💋
I am more a 4 legs or les enbie myself. Still mad respect for my insect loving enby siblings.
I connect v. deeply with bees. Love me some bees.
I very much agree. Same goes for toads and frogs.

But then there's my very straight very cis entomologist dad 🤷🏻‍♂️
I love bugs and so do a couple enbies I know so yeah it must be
i luv bugs !!!!
also you’re adorable 🥰
I mean, we enbies are all bugged, no strictly 0 or 1s here
As an enby with a fear of basically all bugs, you are absolutely right but also please get them away from me
I think it's a queer thing, cuz my wife and daughter also love bugs like I do, but they are both just girls lol enby bug lovers unite!
I am in love with the hardworking ants and the matriarchal honeybees!
I would absolutely agree with this. I adore bugs.
I may be an outlier here but my favorites are the spiders.  They remind me of hungry little kittens.  They eat all of my smaller bugs.  Everyone else gets evicted to the yard, especially the roaches and the beetles.  Ants!  Not in the house, guys, outside, outside!  On my very early walk a few days ago, barely light outside, a large tarantula crossed the sidewalk in front of me.  He name was Angela.  I tried to warn her not to go in the street, and to watch out for William the coyote but she didn't listen and now I worry for her safety.
Cause we are all secretly frogs in trench coats
I’m nonbinary and studying entomology! Love me some insects lol 💕
as someone who studied entomology, I stand by it. my best friend jokes about it all the time bc I love insects so much.
We do. I love bugs and spiders and bees and wasps
So it’s not just me?!!
I’ve always loved reptiles and insects! Must also be why mosquitoes love the shit outta me
I’ve received your mating call and raise you one gentle giant millipede
meanwhile my entomophobic ass who's least favorite texture is bugs...
Im envy,I love bugs however, I do have a very, very, strong fear of zoomed in insects like those macro photos.
I once had a little bee friend that loved hanging around me when I was at work. I tend to grow my nails out quite a bit sometimes and my little bee friend liked to nestle themselves under my nail. It was so cute! 🥰
That's a cicada, I found one of those recently. Very cool bug. My first instinct was to pick it up, put it on my face for size comparison, and send a picture to my family.

I also raised and released ~30 monarch butterflies this year. I think your theory is correct.
At least they don't ask ""WhAt'S IN YoUr PaNts?""
No. I’m genuinely terrified of bugs, insects…. And geese
I hate bugs but I love frogs and reptiles. My sister has a theory that enbys just like frogs, like as a rule cuz all the peeps we know in people's love frogs 😂
Nope, not alone!
Definitely not. I identify more with inanimate objects like the humble potato.
The Goblin is like.. the description of me and the way I live
Totally understandable :)
Yass! I have a good picture of a bee too xD I also love them. Especially when they're covered in pollen haha
Im legit just terrified of anything that moves 😭
Geese, understandable. Once I saw a goose like shaped shadow at night and it struck fear I ti my heart. I just knew it came for my death.
i’m honestly afraid of frogs and reptiles too😭😭just all small animals hahahaha
I like frogs. I always used to catch them and bring them home and my mom would always tell me to put it back in nature
Then may I suggest to you r/goblincore. Enjoy!
Btw love the ink.
We had a frog bucket in our garden for when they found their way over. My sister and I would just sit in the garden and watch with glee

My english teacher crossed out every single they/them pronoun in my essay and wrote he/him above it	"So we had to write an essay about parent-child relationships and how a friend's influence compares to that.

I used they/them pronouns to refer to the parent and my teacher didn't seem to like it. When she returned the essay she had crossed out all the theys and wrote he/him above it. She also left a comment at the bottom of the text saying they/them can't be used to describe a single person.

I went up to her and tried to explain why they/them in fact can be used for a single person, but she didn't want to have it."	"Webster's online even says it can be singular. Pull that up and show it to the teacher and the misgender them while talking as a power move.
Completely ignoring the nonbinary side of the conversation, They/Them is the right pronoun to use in situation were one is talking about a single person of unknown gender. IE: Someone stole my lunch. They left no clues.

I had a teacher do this in college. I just changed the gender pronoun every sentence. It got the point across that I was talking about a person whose gender I did not know.
How can she be an English teacher whilst being so ignorant about the English language? Can't tell if it was supposed to be bigoted or not, but she's wrong either way.
This day and age, take it to administration.  Not only is your teacher wrong, but shes likely alienating at least a few kids every year.  This kind of behavior can literally (ha) make a kid who is an aspiring writer lose all motivation to be creative.

I will say this though, be prepared to have a rough go.  I had a spiteful english teacher who I corrected more than once in class.  She never gave me anything more than a C on my papers, but passed me with a B knowing that she was being petty.
Ughh this sh** happened  to me in middle school... 15 years ago. Get over yourselves, crusty English teachers. 

They/them has been canonized correct in [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they) and it even specifically says NOT to do what your teacher corrected it to. I'm not as familiar with MLA style, but at first glance [it looks like they also endorse ""they"" as a singular neutral pronoun.](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/)

So sorry this happened to you. Pedants gonna pedant 🤦
almost seems like intentional transphobia, at the very least its gross ignorance. sorry you have to deal with this
Hey there,

I'm a high school English teacher and I hope you get a chance to read this. Your teacher is completely wrong, morally and grammatically. Most style guides have recently adopted the singular ""they"" into their manuals. Additionally, MLA style has as well, which is used almost universally in English classes in the United states. (If you are in the states.) 

https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/#:~:text=Specific%20Use,paper%20on%20Jane%20Austen's%20Persuasion.

Here's the link to the Modern Language Association website pertaining to the ""they"" pronoun. Good luck and I'm sorry that you had to go through this.
Fight this and make it public.
If your teacher wants more evidence, Bill Shakespeare used singular they/them 400 years ago. 

https://nyulocal.com/shakespeare-used-the-singular-they-and-so-should-you-6452240ca9e0

I'd refuse to 'fix' it.
go to the library, grab Shakespeare, throw it on her table.
Had this happening to me too on a data response home work. There was no mentioned gender so I used ""they/them"" in all of my responses and the prof just wrote: Don't use this pronoun. like is it forbidden lmao? what was one even supposed to use? I'm not gonna go assume someone's identity out of their opinions, tf?!
Hi, Nonbinary/ English Honors Major/ High School English Teacher here.

Your teacher is wrong and a jerk; regardless of whether 'they' is considered grammatically correct or not. Most important is people and respecting and validating their experiences. Literally everything in the world that humans do, all the rules, all the customs are made up and ordered by people. When systems stop working (or if they never worked) for people, it's time to dismantle and re-establish them. Weirdly...language, while often considered precise by nature...is included in this (consider how words change: what words were offensive in the past and are no longer, or words that are offensive now but weren't in the past).

Language, syntax etc. changes over time. New words are invented to describe experiences and new objects, old words are redefined or 'taken back' with intention (queer for instance) and this evolution in language is not new! If you compare 'classic' works over time written by people like Chaucer, Shakespeare, Austen, Poe, Tolkien etc, you'll notice they don't speak the same way we do, that some words seem out of place to us now because they have different contemporary meanings, and that sometimes it seems like reading a completely different language even though it's all in 'English'.

Why do people resist it? As mentioned, we already use 'they' when discussing a person of unknown gender. The easy answer is people like rules, people like systems, people don't like to question what they know. People seek comfort in he familiar, even if they familiar doesn't make sense or is maladaptive. There are terrified/or pretentious sticklers out there who are set in their ways of thinking, clinging to the idea that he world is black and white and unchanging, and who refuse to acknowledge that language evolves over time. People often violently reject things that make them question the clarity of the lens through which they see the world, and often fight back hardest against the things that hit too close to home.

In my experience, you will run into resistance with they/them at any level of writing; from hs essays to thesis defense. Id say that doesn't mean don't do it. When I was in University, I had one prof teaching a fourth year honors class that spent a whole class talking about how they could not be used to describe a singular person because GRAMMAR (he taught 18th century sentimentality...he was a really boring dude). He marked people down for it and was always a pretentious experience to be around. Literally on the other side of the hall was a prof teaching a fourth year honors class where we were actively dismantling the gender binary and writing about queer authors and characters who used 'they/them' pronouns.

Long story short...some people can't fathom that what they know isn't absolute, that things change over time, and that gender is just another construct that we created. We should use gender and language to express ourselves and make room for each other.
I had a college professor do this. He did the same thing on my paper as yours, crossing out all the they/them pronouns and writing that he/him were the ""proper"" rules. It was passed off as, ""Oh, that's just how we do it,"" as if it were just another academic writing convention. But it was one of those rules that was enforced more than the rest. For instance, a more critical fail like not citing sources was just an 'oops', but using they/them pronouns to refer to someone without gender was like committing academic treason.

That is to say, it wasn't about correcting a mistake, it was about enforcing male supremacy in academia, where men are the expected default and women and non-binary people are rare exceptions. Worse, all that is hidden under the guise of a simple academic convention. If I wanted a better grade, I had to prove that I accept this belief by only using he/him pronouns to refer to genderless entities like police, nurses, writers, and scientists. 

I'm not sure if your teacher is doing that on purpose, but either way it's extremely destructive.  It's one thing to explicitly say, ""Only men should be in academia."" It's another thing entirely to package that belief in a writing convention to make YOU feel stupid for being ""wrong."" It took me a while to unpack this and understand why I felt disempowered. If you feel the same way here, I just want you to know this is a thing, it needs to change, and you were never wrong.
Bring it to the principal. If it becomes a real problem then file a discrimination complaint.
Revise it for your teacher, switching out the they/them for whatever pronoun you want. Then put a footnote on all them.


He¹ went to the mall with her² mother. At the mall, their³ mother became very concerned because people were very close to each other. It was driving xem⁴ crazy too, but ve⁵ was pretty used to it by now.
¹ Person's gender is unknown; the pronoun he/his was used in reference.

³ Person's gender is unknown; the pronoun they/them was used in reference.
⁴ Person's gender is unknown; the pronoun xe/xem was used in reference.

Ok im sorry how did she become and english teacher????
For your teacher: https://youtu.be/imK17HQ6dy8

Many of the most celebrated authors in history have used they/them singular
Wrong. Feel free to reference merriam-webster's [definition 3d](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/they) for They, OR the definition 3c if she's close-minded. If she won't hear you out in person, you can email her the explanation and cc the head of your school's english department and a school admin. Make sure to mention how you tried to explain this before in person. It might feel extra because she'll act like it is but fuck her opinion, she's actively invalidating her enby students.
Ew. Not only a pedant, but one that does it wrong.
I’d report them to administration but I don’t think that would really do much.
That’s as bad as verbally misgendering them. Even tho they/them according to my English teacher is correct one semester. And she was accepting of gender neutral
I had an English professor in college do this. She refused to let us use gender neutral pronouns because it wasn't 'grammatically correct.' The worst part is that she would use the fact that one of her kids is non-binary as an excuse, i.e., ""I'm not being transphobic, my oldest is non-binary, it's just a language rule"" (which is a straight up lie; we used MLA format and MLA even says that they/them are *either* plural or singular gender neutral).
What a shithead....
Since Estonian doesn't have gendered pronouns I decided to ha e some fun in English class. We had to translate sentences and o e of them was something along the lines of ""they took their girlfriend to the zoo""
So obviously I translated it into ""She took her girlfriend to the zoo"" The teaches crossed out the ""she""s and corrected them to ""he""s, don't remember of she took points off for it tho..
I had a few teachers who didn't like singular they. I would just ditch pronouns all together and say use ""one"" instead. Like, ""Next, one pours the solution into two separate test tubes."" or ""When approaching this subject, one should always consider the following possibilities"". 

This worked well in lab reports.
it depends on what its for,,, on ACT prep the grading people themselves don't accept they/them but in classroom settings outside of standard tests it should be 100% acceptable especially when a patient's gender is unknown it's obviously better to just use they/them??? I have a bone to pick with this teacher >:^(
bibbity bobbity rip her limbs off
I agree with the advice. Document the exchange with your teacher. Make a copy of your paper and submit it to administration with a written explanation of what your teacher told you and how you tried to address the concern with her. It sounds like she needs some diversity and cultural sensitivity training. All administration is worried about discrimination lawsuits so it should be addressed in-house.
NGL I probably would have asked her 'but how did you know I was talking about a male? What if I was talking about a female? And what if I felt this applied to *either* parent, meaning I was actually using it to denote either of **THEM,**  because **THEY** could both do x, y or z.'

But I recognize I benefited from an extremely supportive home situation where if the teacher reached out to home (I am, of course, guessing this is not a college/uni professor in this situation, and if I'm wrong I'm even more sorry), my mom would have backed me up. I can see how, if someone didn't have that kind of situation, it would be hard to address the issue.
Your teacher’s an idiot, and I say this as a teacher. A modicum of research will demonstrate that singular *they* has been arrested for at least 600 years—i.e. the entire life of the modern English language. The attempt to strike it from the language is a recent movement by prescriptivists, and it’s not the sort of thing any proper scholar would be on board with.

This is a case of a teacher pushing a conservative political agenda and trying to hide behind the profession while doing it.
Also lay it on that biznach that singular they has documented use as early as the mid 14th century. 
So there.
WTF THATS SO UNPROFESSIONAL, WHAT A DICK
AN ENGLISH TEACHER SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT THEY/THEM CAN BE USED SINGULARLY
I'm not here to hate - I'm just trying to understand.

Did the essay mention the FATHER or MOTHER?

It would make sense if you didn't know if it was a male/female... so used ""they"" to refer to the parent... but I'm unsure if you're arguing that the FATHER or MOTHER's gender is being assumed (which is the nonbinary stance).
Also (assuming this is English class) MLA format includes they/them as grammatically correct usage for singular pronouns. This is the standard for correct usage. If she has further complaints ask her for the reason, given that it is grammatically correct.

Here ya go:  [How do I use singular they? | The MLA Style Center](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/)
> Webster's online even says it can be singular. Pull that up and show it to the teacher

Yes.

>and the[n] misgender them while talking as a power move.

No.

Hehe. Using this one if ever necessary.
Not to sound jaded but I know far too many teachers who enjoy being a big intellectual fish in a small pond. I have to put up with one at my knitting group who argues about everything like she’s infallible, I believe because she’s the be all and end all to a room of 10 year olds, day in, day out.
Yes! It's completely accepted in MLA format.
Thanks a lot. With this I finally have a solid argument I can bring up. Though I don't live in the states, I think it's still gonna be useful.
Fuck cancel culture.
To build on this, if your teacher doesn't think an article like this is a ""good enough"" source, the Oxford English Dictionary also mentions that it was used as a singular pronoun since at least 1450. It's entry 2b, ""With an antecedent referring to an individual generically or indefinitely (e.g. someone, a person, the student), used esp. so as to make a general reference to such an individual without specifying gender"" (citation: ""they, pron., adj., adv., and n."" *OED Online*, Oxford University Press, December 2020, [www.oed.com/view/Entry/200700](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200700).)
This is the best comment in the thread and I'm so furious at these teachers.

Now that I'm an adult I've come to realize what a power trip so many teachers/profs are really on
Well, the essay didn't mention the father or mother, it wasn't even stipulated whether it's a single parent or not, so I used 'they' since I didn't know the gender of the parent.
The teacher also understood this so that isn't the problem. Rather it's the usage of he/him as a 'gender neutral' pronoun and denying that they/them can be used as a singular pronoun that upset me.
I've since had a discussion with the teacher and cleared it up. I'm now allowed to use 'they' as a singular pronoun as ling as I make it clear that the text is written in gender neutral language.😁
same with APA 7th edition, in fact they encourage using they/them as opposed to gendered pronouns!!
That I did not know. Thank you.
Imagine being a person who has to lord over 10 year olds to feel smart. Must be rough tbh.
o_O huh?
It has been singular since English was Middle English
Thanks for the response. Hmm, interesting.

I'm more of a conservative on these issues, so I'm just trying to get to know them better (as there seems to be a lot of conflation online between gender/sex/male/man/he etc). 

So... as I'm understanding it:

-You didn't know if the 'parent' in this case was the MOTHER (female) or the FATHER (male) of the child.

-Because of this, you used 'they/them' as a gender neutral pronoun (rather than she/her or he/him).

-Your teacher crossed 'they/them' out, stating that 'they/them' is plural and therefore, wrong.

-Your teacher then replaced it with 'he/him', because it's singular.

-Your problem is that 'he/him' is being used as a gender neutral pronoun.

-You don't know if the parent is the MOTHER (female, she/her) or the FATHER (male, he/him) of the child.

-You're upset that, in the absence of clarity, 'he/him' somehow becomes the automatic pronoun - instead of they/them.

Did I get that right? If so, I completely agree with you and you make a lot of sense. 

Just to be clear:

You are *NOT* upset that the theoretical FATHER (male) might identity as 'they/them' and is having his pronouns assumed by your teacher... in the chance that he is non-binary?

Am I correct?
People were using ""they"" as a singular back when nobody said ""you,"" but said ""thou"" (singular) and ""ye"" (plural) instead. Then the French came to England and everything got even weirder.
Correct. 
While I would probably also be upset if the parent was written to be non-binary and my teacher assumed they were male, that isn't the case at all. 
My teacher simply didn't accept 'they' as a gender neutral singular pronoun and wanted me to use 'he', which I didn't agree with because while it is grammatically correct, everyone who reads 'he' will assume the mentioned person is male, while it was my intention not to specify the gender of the parent because that was beside the point of the essay and therefore unnessecary."	ke7n5l	NonBinary	370	0.99	2020-12-16 11:36:26
I hate it when cis women do this	"I have noticed that when I (ftnb/ftm) explain that I'm trans and non binary, and I explain why I'm transitioning all cis women have to say ""well I don't totally feel like a woman either"" 
It's frustrating because my mother for example says it as a way to disregard my gender identity like we are the same just because she likes football and the color blue (even tho I don't like ""boyish"" things). 
And my nb and trans friends, with or without dysphoria, transitioning or not, don't say these things."	"I feel this. Even when they’re not trying to invalidate nonbinary/trans identities, it often feels like they’re trying to say they get it, and it’s frustrating because you know they really don’t. Because at the end of the day, cis women with “boyish” interests or aesthetics could be as masculine or “boyish” as can be, and they would still be cis because they identify with their agab. I feel like there are two separate (though interrelated) conversations at play: one about trans identities and another about social expectations for women, and cis women who make those statements think we’re having the exact same conversation.
""Well *I* have times when I don't like my body too!""

Wishing you were skinnier and less wrinkled isn't the same as feeling distressed by your primary and secondary sexual characteristics, height, voice, etc. because they impact whether or not many people treat you as sane and deserving human dignity when you try to stand up for your identity and ask to be gendered correctly, dearest MIL.
I said this A LOT as an uncracked egg, not gonna lie.   I was very deep in denial and shame, and used the excuse ""I don't feel like a woman either"" to justify my mistreatment of non binary folk and transmen.   
""How do you identify?"" Is a good question to ask when someone says these things.  If they're cis, after putting an ounce of thought into it they come around and go ""A woman, I guess..."" And many of them realize that was a silly thing to say 

If they're like me, however, you're probably gonna piss them off by asking.   I don't ""identify"" as anything, I just am a woman""
Why?
They'll give some kind of response about biology, and if you have the energy you can explain to them that gender and sex are not the same thing.  Again, this is going to piss them off.   My gender and sex are the same!! It doesn't matter that when I think about it at all, they feel completely separate and foreign from each other!! How dare you make me think about it??
And then hopefully, hopefully they'll have a realization down the road that it's not normal to avoid thinking about your gender like the plague.   They'll learn that gender is self expression and supposed to make you happy, make you feel like you, not like a prison.
I hate it when I explain that I'm a guy to cis guys and they ask me ""wHaT'S YoUr FaVoRitE CarR?"". It's only happened twice but I've only been out for a few months. Or when a cis guy just.. ""no you're nOt. You have BewBiEs."" Aka.. I feel you, man/my friend. Here's my honest advice that I do my best to stick to, too. They don't understand your problems. It'd be amazing if they did, but they don't. It's not their fault, and it's not yours. The best things that you can do are, a, talk to them. Tell them that this bothers you. B, take a deep breath, and let it go. Talking to them is better but if that doesn't work, just don't let it bring you down. You're awesome, my friend ^^
So I like to say “that’s not a very cis thing to say … interesting” and then start asking questions about how they experience gender.
Being a man/woman is damn hard work, even if you're pretty firmly in one camp. The pressures to perform your gender within very limited parameters are significant for both men and women, and a lot of people who feel/are told they are doing it incorrectly deserve our empathy, even if they don't feel like another gender would suit them any better. I honestly feel it's all part of a spectrum like many things are. Gender is a social construct after all. It's like money, we made it up. I would take it on good faith that they are trying to relate to you, attempting (ok, and maybe failing) to understand you, not trying to invalidate you.
Ugh, call them on it. ""Would you like me to use different pronouns for you?"" ""How do you identify?"" They should scrutinize their gender. A small percentage of them may not be cis, after all.
It's like, I won't say nobody feels entirely man or woman, because that's not true many people feel absolutely ""man"" and/or ""woman"", and to say otherwise would invalidate that. But, I'm sure some cis people don't feel 'entirely' man or woman. I think its healthy for anyone to explore their gender, but that's the thing, cis people don't need to label that feeling. If more people explored their feelings they may realise something about their gender, but for people who are nonbinary, or any other gender descriptor(s) that are/is not exclusively cis woman and cis man, that feeling is why those words exist.
I mean, “well I don’t totally feel like a woman either” is an interesting remark. If men told me the equivalent of themselves, contextually it would be a pretty bold statement that may raise further questioning of the “oh, really?” variety. It may be a bigger jump for a man to admit such, and betray “egg” (yuck) yearnings. Womanhood, as it is, seems to be a lot to live up to and a performance that so many must struggle to buy into, as distinct from being NB.
Hmmm…this is really interesting, it sounds like maybe your mom is doing it specifically in a way to be dismissive of your identity (as in “I don’t always feel like a woman but you don’t see me going around calling myself non-binary”) that would be different then if she is reflecting on genuine feelings. I’ve never experienced this- when i first learned that people “felt” a sense of maleness or femaleness my mind was blown and i went around asking every cis person I could if they “felt” their agab and they all said “yes” without a doubt. They could not always articulate how or why but they all “knew” their agab was correct and “felt” right. Not once did has a cis person told me they don’t always feel their agab- well, that would make them non-binary by definition wouldn’t it? 

Not trying to be dismissive of your experience, this is just really surprising for me to hear.
Water off a ducks back man. I know it’s hard to feel invalidated but cis women will never understand. Sometimes you just gotta be like “Okay.”
Yeah, there's a lot of reasons why cis women in western society may not feel strong or positive emotions about their gender, what with all the deeply ingrained misogyny and socialized fear and whatnot. But they also don't feel an inherent wrongness or incompleteness about being labeled as a woman. Thinking that gender roles are bullshit is of course legit, but it really doesn't speak to the discomfort we experience when we're misgendered.
That whole argument is a red herring for what's really going on. They may say, ""I like blue, I like football, so I'm not totally feminine."" Yeah, those may not fit the female stereotype, but we don't openly shame women for stepping outside those gender boundaries as fiercely as we do men (except for if it has something to do with exercising power. Then the patriarchy HATES it). For me to want to wear a dress as an AMAB, the rules as they are don't let me do that. I need to create a new system that works for me.
I get that too (even more so when I tell people I have depression and they're like ""yeah I'm sad sometimes too!"") but another thing that makes it difficult is, maybe they're an egg and haven't really thought about it before. I know I went through a whole phase of being sad I was ""technically cis"" and ""not really nb enough to call myself that""... so I think the only real way to move the conversation forward in a productive way is to engage them more in thinking about their gender and also let them know how you feel. It's hard, especially if you're not really comfortable going in depth with them.
Ugh I definitely understand this. This is what happened when I tried to tell my grandma about ""a nonbinary friend I have"", basically testing the waters to see how she'd react. She asked for this friend's name, I said Charlie and despite the name being fairly androgynous she went ""Oh so I assume he's a boy nonbinary."" ...Not how it works grandma haha. 

Something similar happened with my mom too, she compared gender dysphoria to the dysmorphia she feels about being fat. Said that maybe it was just something I needed to accept about myself rather than something I needed to change, like what she did with her own body. For this one the only thing I could think of was that I know that surgeries and hormones will make me feel better, so why not do something that will make me feel better? Lots of fat people try to lose weight to feel better, so how is what I want to be doing any different than that? Then she went on to say ""well they're consequences to being trans"" and I'm like fuckin YEAH I know!! I AM trans! Believe me I know the consequences! And if at least a few of the consequences of T and top surgery make me feel better about myself then bring them on man
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I FELT THAT IT'S SO ANNOYING 
Like no Brenda your urge to cut your hair short or wear a suit is not a gender crisis:D
So true
I would like to offer some perspective but I’m not trying to invalidate your feelings or justify saying shit like that for everybody- it took me a very long time to realize that I was nonbinary and during my freshman year of high school one of my not so close friends came out as trans and I basically said the same thing except I asked them (in a very blunt and insensitive way because I didn’t understand) why they cared about their gender because I didn’t care about mine. What I now understand about my feelings was that I didn’t feel connected to my femininity because I’m not a woman and I didn’t understand how they could actively desire that because I felt so disconnected and also I really didn’t understand what it meant to be trans at the time. So I would just like to say that it’s possible these people who “don’t totally feel like a woman either” actually don’t feel like women and aren’t actually cis but because they don’t experience strong or any dysphoria they don’t even know or understand that they are also nb. That’s definitely not everyone but it definitely was me and it lead to me saying a lot more shitty stuff to trans people because I really was trying to understand and I just needed to get more in touch with myself and honestly I needed to me told I was uneducated and being rude before I figured it out. At the end of the day other people’s motivations don’t change how you feel I’m really sorry you’re being made fo feel invalidated by these people. You are 100% valid in your identity and how you feel about these people saying stuff like that to you. It is very frustrating to hear so I hope maybe being able to see where some of them COULD be coming from could help you shape a conversation with them in a way that’s productive for everyone. Or not if you’re not looking for that
I do this when I'm trying to explain how emotions feel as a person with borderline and people are unintentionally invalidating. ""Ah, so you know what I'm talking about! Great then you'll understand what I mean when I say, take that concept and expand upon it threefold. Take how you described you feel about not entirely feeling as a woman and extrapolate upon it as if it was much more of core sense of yourself and not just a idea feeling that you're able to relate to.""
I feel like gender is such a nuanced thing that if you don’t feel at odds with your assigned gender then you don’t really feel it. Like if you’re cis , I feel like it’s something you have to look into and examine to understand how it feels. 

She won’t feel like a woman probably because she hasn’t reflected much on it. Stick her in a male body and then see how she feels
Yes!!! My grandmother and basically any female i knew growing up would just casually say things like i wish i could pee stand up(when its cold), i wish i had a penis (period pains), it would be cool to write my name in the snow (random thought i guess) these saying made me question myself for years. They held me back from realizing they were just saying and that these women identified with their agab. 

Well i think all of them my grandmother is still in question. She says things that are a bit sus. And some.e part of transness can be genetic i think. Dont remember where i learned that fact. I could be wrong.
I try to explain it to them like gender is a colorwheel, and then leave it be with oppositional people. If on a color wheel man was all shades of blue: from navy to Robin's egg, and woman was all shades of red: from maroon to blush, then I am a completely different color. I personally say that I am yellow in this example, but you might say green or whatever else. I can see the color, the men experiencing manhood and the women experiencing womanhood but I dont live that experience. People like this are fairly one dimensional in the topic of gender and need a second to think on what I've just said, and in that time I change the subject.
When I came out as NB to a friend she did exactly this! I was livid!

“Oh, you don’t? Hm. Perhaps we should look into this together…”

That’d be my response lol
I love trying to turn this into a teachable moment about how gender simply isn't binary. About how we are all wonderful, unique people and no two people experience gender the same way, even if they identify with the same binary gender (or even if they both identify as non-binary)

It usually results in a bunch of glazed-over looks from the cis ppl I'm talking to but I'm the type of person who loves explaining things, so either I taught a cis person something or I totally overwhelm them and they don't want to talk about it anymore lol
I understand trying to relate with a personal experience but it feels more like when I tell someone I'm autistic so that's why I may act weird and then they say ""aren't we all a little weird sometimes"" I know it's not their intention but it feels like they are telling me to not make a big deal out of it and be quiet
Hey, I wondered if you might like to share a bit about your journey from mistreating nbinary people and trans men to cracking your egg? I often don’t hear that happening, it seems to happen more the other way around. No worries if not!
Thank you, here is the only place were I can talk about it without feeling rude. If a dude asks for your favourite car just say the Nissan cube and watch their faces 😂
HHaha I love this!!
I definitely have thought about that and I sympathize, but I can't gelp but feel uncomfortable because I have been told that my gender identity and my dysphoria is just a political ideology
This is an interesting point. I believe we made gender roles and expression up - is that what you mean? But I think gender is inherent regardless of society. I feel my gender is an innate part of who I am and it’s society that convinced me otherwise and it’s taken a lot of unlearning to reach this point. Like I feel quite strongly that if I was away from society my whole life, and had never seen a man before, I would feel uncomfortable with my body even if I didn’t know what I wanted. Maybe that’s something different though. What do you think? ( I’m transmasc btw)
I KNOW! I literally commented that I would say “Oh you do? Then maybe we should look into this together” because if you don’t fully feel like you’re a woman maybe it’s time to question your gender
I would say most cis people don’t feel entirely their gender. I think they just carry out the gender roles expected of them by society and carry on because nothing necessarily feels ‘off’ or another gender role doesn’t feel ‘better’ like it does for us trans folk. I think they just don’t scrutinise what they’re experiencing and so they’re disconnected from their identity and don’t really feel it
I mean, yeah. Who’s to say they’re as cis as they look? I assume most people here were in the closet at some point, so it really confuses me that people are so hostile towards what seems to be a good faith attempt to relate.

Like, we’re nonbinary to be honest to ourselves, not to feel special.
“I don’t always feel like a woman but you don’t see me going around calling myself non-binary” 
this is exactly what I hear. And it is qhite possible that my mom is actually nb since she has said in the past that she feel like a boy and a girl. If that's the case good for her and I will suport her, in that case it would be like ""I've been stuck being a woman all my life so you don't get to be your gender either""
>But they also don't feel an inherent wrongness or incompleteness about being labeled as a woman.

Not everyone who’s not a woman experiences that, and it’s certainly not required to be nonbinary. I’m fine with being labeled a man, I’m fine with being labeled a woman, I’m fine with being labeled whatever - none of these words mean anything to me anyways.
I totally went through that ""I'm not totally a boy, so I'm not trans"" phase. It's not my job to crack someone's shell either
They think we haven't thought of the consequences of coming out and transitioning😂
Also, I have had body dysmorphia and dysphoria and they are different feelings, sometimes they can overlap but the dysmorphia can get cured with learning self esteem and healing traumas. But dysphoria doesn't go away, it just gets worse for me. 
I just wish I could tell this to my mom but J know anything I say will be used against me.
I really appreciate your comment. 
I think that most women in today's society don't feel connected to womanhood because it has a lot of negative baggage and expectations, and outside of the trad definition of what a woman is, there is not an answer to ""what is a woman"".
Some cis women relate to the positive experiences asociated with being a woman and afab but don't feel conected to that mytical unatainable image of what a woman is suposed to be. 
This is all my opinion, I may be wrong.
How did you respond?
This user is a transphobic troll. Reported and blocking.
Yeah, that's when you realize who is actually interested in deconstructing/abolishing gender and who just wants to invalidate my experience
That analogy makes a lot of sense—it does feel very minimizing for people to say stuff like that.
Oh god i know what you mean. I told my MIL i’m getting diagnosed with autism (little by little, broke as shit) and she told me “when they made it a spectrum, it includes everyone!” like literally no but alright
I was ABOUT TO BRING UP AUTISM BUT DAMN! I feel this in my goddamn soul. ""Everyone's a little Autistic"" NO THE FUCK THEY AREN'T, SHARON!! *autisticscreeching.mp4*


~*Takes a breath*~ Sorry, I get a little passionate sometimes.


When someone says that to me, if I have the time and crayons, I try to explain to them how this sentiment is actually super harmful and invalidating. It shouldn't be our job to educate people about Autism, but honestly, who better to do it? This method isn't for everyone, and that's ok. It's what I like to do.
So I've never had these feelings about trans women, oddly enough.  Just nbs and trans men, trans women have always been ""valid"" to me, for lack of better wording. 
NBs we're dumb to me because hurr durr biology, and you can't possibly be something other than a man or a woman because that doesn't exist.  I had a very eurocentric idea of gender and gender expression and refused to educate myself. 
Trans men openly pissed me off because it felt like an escape?  Like no, noone likes being a woman, if everyone was honest wed all be trans

And then I learned from cis people that no, those feelings are not universal, it's not normal to hate being a woman, it's not normal to be grosaed out by your anatomy.  Almost all of it was routed in jealousy that they were able to be themselves, and I had too many hangups to do the things myself.
xD I usually avoid answering :P
>Maybe that’s something different though.

Yeah, that’s different. Being uncomfortable with your body because it’s male/female isn’t exactly the same as being uncomfortable with a *gender* - lots of trans people don’t experience dysphoria and are fine with never transitioning. Honestly it should be called *sex* dysphoria and not *gender* dysphoria, because bodies aren’t gendered in and of themselves.

*Sex* is somewhat inherent, and some people might have an inherent *preferred sex* which causes dysphoria, but that’s a different thing from gender, which is the social component that we made up.
Yeah it's  some human bullshit! I don't know what that dismorphia feels like. Unless we actually transition most people will only ever experience the one gender in their lifetimes so it's really hard to make a comparison! I don't feel like a quote unquote ""woman"", I don't think I'm good at the things that women are told to be good at, I don't feel comfortable with that label. But I'm also clearly not a dude. I don't think I'd be any better at performing a masculine gender. I would like to put my pronouns on things because it's kind and inclusive, but I'm not comfortable with any of them. I respect the trans experience and I want to understand it, but like, I just think gender as an idea is kind of flimsy!
I’m inclined to agree. So long as they’re not doing the “oh, I don’t feel much like my AGAB sometimes” riposte to minimise the NB experience. And even then, perhaps something can be done to relax their resistance; after all, these are unfamiliar concepts to most people. It’s indeterminate whether they’re erasing you, intend to, or aren’t currently persuadable.

There’s probably more to work on than much of what I hear from others (eg. “These days there are about 50 sexes!” from someone in my running club last night, blurted out of nowhere).
yeah, i really don't get where all the hostility is from. get mad at people who make fun of us, discriminate etc., but it's fucking hard being a woman and if they're trying to relate, it's ok imho. i'd even say all afab people will at some point in their lives have been wondering if they're doing the whole female thing right. if you perform femininity, you're shamed for being vain and emptyheaded, if you don't, the world will call you a pick me girl or a not like other girls girl. can't do it right. 

so i fail why we need to get so mad at cis women expressing they've struggled with that, it's obviously not the same as being non binary or having dysphoria, but it's still a valid feeling.
What do you think your mom would say if you said,  not in a mocking tone but compassionately, “mom, I don’t think that is the way most cis people feel, is it possible you’re nonbinary?” You could even follow it with an explanation of what Demi is or something since it sounds like she is connected to feeling female at least some of the time. 

In regards to the second argument you could say something like “most of your life the concept of a binary gender was so predominant that a lot of people didn’t have a concept of, let alone a language for, anything other than male or female. Things have changed and I’m lucky to have a language and community that supports me. I get how this might be confusing or scary to think about, but it’s no longer taboo and I don’t have to deny part of my existence or experience, it would mean a lot to me if you could try give me the support that nobody gave you.” 

Another thing that came to mind while writing this was why? Why does it make her uncomfortable? What does she fear? I know this is an insanely difficult thing to do and would take a crap ton of courage and self control (although if you’ve already been open with her about your gender you are not lacking in courage) but perhaps you could ask her to explain/share why it makes her uncomfortable. She might not know, but asking might open some doors to self reflection and progress. 

My last bit of advice is to you is to try to remember that your mom is just a human, with her own experiences who makes mistakes. Her discomfort probably comes from fear for you having a harder life as well the destruction of the future she envisioned for you. It takes a lot of practice, but you’ll both fare better if you can try  reframe from feeling invalidated and attacked and instead feel sorry for your mom who’s narrow minded thinking is likely from most of her life receiving significantly more frequent and hateful trans and homophobic messaging than you have. I’m not saying it’s ok, but it’s also not her fault, it’s more like bad programming, so you’re left trying to fix the code but it’s so dated it’s in some obscure language you never learned. Of course you’re going to get frustrated trying to figure it out, and it’s prob going to take a few tries, some guesswork and a shit ton of patience but if she’s a good person eventually you two will get there.
I kinda think that falls under feeling like being labeled a binary gender is incomplete. I don't think being called a woman is outright incorrect for me, but it definitely doesn't encompass who I am or how I feel. It's part of me, not the whole of me.
I tried to argue that it was not the same but she didn’t understand. I eventually gave up and changed the topic.
Can you tell me more about being a ""gender abolitionist""? That sounds like a label I can get around
Thanks so much for your thoughtful response. I think I was unclear as I conflated my gender with my sex so my bad. But I agree that they are two different things. I wonder where that means I fit in the community as my sex is my biggest issue and I get the sense that most people feel the way you described -i.e non sex dysphoric 

I feel that my gender, not sex, is core. I feel it is something that I was born with that was then heavily bullied out of me until this point in my life. I feel that innate feeling would exist outside of society as well, but I recognise not everyone feels that way. I think we have an innate gender identity that then either aligns or misaligns with the gender society puts on us and it’s the innate gender that tells us who we are and what we like
I really appreciate that.
For sure!

The general idea is that since gender isn’t actually real and is backed by nothing but our own prejudiced ideals of what it *should* be, we simply should stop acknowledging that it exists, with the long-term goal of erasing its influence on society. No one is *really* a man or a woman after all - there’s no essence of “man-ness” or “woman-ness” or “something-else-ness” deep down that makes us so - these are just stories we’ve managed to convince ourselves to believe. We can stop believing them.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that we should stop acknowledging or trying to fight things like sexism and transphobia - just because someone doesn’t believe in God, for example doesn’t mean they’d necessarily be blind on the impact of the *belief* in God on society - just that we need to look at them from a different angle. 

Instead of “women (as some sort of monolithic, a priori group) are oppressed by society and aren’t given the same rights/opportunities”, we’d say “people who are *labelled as ‘women’ by society* are oppressed because of this label”; similarly, instead of saying “trans people are oppressed by society for daring to live as the gender they really are”, we’d say “people who fair to conform to the expectations of the gender society assigns to them are oppressed as a result”, sidestepping the essentialism that’s sadly all too common in trans discourse."	rw347c	NonBinary	355	0.97	2022-01-04 19:55:10

No doubt all these horrible new trans bills are messed in up every way possible and I’m outraged as well but unless things have changed since this article was written [the marriage age laws you site are inaccurate](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/22/governor-signs-law-banning-tennessee-child-marriage/632925002/)
Yes they changed just a couple years ago and here's the screwed up thing, people were against it saying that government didn't have the right to impose an age of consent for sex or for marriage 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ just until a few years ago in Tennessee it was legal to ummm have intimate relations with your livestock but don't worry that did not include household pets. Tennessee still has child marriage with parental consent.
Yeah it only took until 2018 for them to ban child marriage
Oh gosh! That’s messed up.

Was completely dismissed because I'm AMAB and more Masculine presenting...	"So a quick thing about me is I enjoy films, a lot, I enjoy critique, I enjoy the writing in films and love singing a good films praises as much as I love being critical and picking apart a bad film. 

But recently in a rather tame - not heated at all - discussion at a bar I was discussing a newly released film with 3 other friends and one was providing a few counter arguments and we had a  back and forth. Two others that were outside of this argument but at the table included another friend and my partner. The other friend said to my partner ""Men and their films.."" directed at me and after my partner said how I was nonbinary - which im sure they already knew - and just passionate about films and enjoy the discussion, the friend said ""oh I thought they were just some straight man who thinks they can just explain why their opinion is right and is gonna start talking over people - yknow like how stereotypical straight men get about films"".

Hearing about this after getting in and me sitting with it for a while I just start to think, why is it just because when people look at me and immediately see *man* they dismiss and invalidate my opinions but as soon as they learn my gender identity, what i said previously suddenly has the merit it deserves. My gender and perceived gender shouldn't f*cking interfere with how seriously my argument is taken. Im fucking good at constructing points and just want to be taken as such, not have people use some weird subjective filter of whether I look gender neutral enough for them to hear me out or not. My gender and sexuality for that matter shouldnt influence how seriously I am taken, the most infuriating thing is that this person was also LGBT so its like what??? I guess I just dont look gay or nb enough..."	"I’m really mad on your behalf; even if this person had correctly gendered you, they still assumed you were straight??? Way to assume fucking *everything*, pal! 

I get this too with having dared used my uterus. So feminists have been working to untangle maternity as a requirement for womanhood for generations, but I choose to bear kids and I *have* to be a “woman”? Fuck that!
I am really sorry that happened to you, that is super frustrating. I definitely think that there is a cognitive dissonance for a lot of people around gender where they can say that they see you one way, but their socialization leads them to think and act out of step with that. Not to excuse that behavior, because jeez that’s really invalidating and hostile. I hope that you are able to have do something for self care or self affirmation after this. 🖤💜🤍💛
This person talking to your partner was out of line. This doesn't reflect on you one bit, so I wouldn't take it personally or blame yourself for not looking gay or enby enough. That person has a problem for sure
I hear your frustration, and this person was completely out of pocket for saying all this bullshit. It was presumptuous, and when corrected, they absolutely did not need to double down.

That being said, I think it’s important to acknowledge that most of society treats women, femmes, and visibly trans people like this *almost all the time.* As ~~cis-passing~~ (EDIT: cis-assumed; see comment below) enbies, we have to acknowledge the privilege we have. So while your frustration is valid, I want to put it on the table that this is not just an issue that impacts you, but also every person who is not a cis and/or cis-passing man—and it may well impact a lot of them a lot more often. So I just hope we can have compassion and solidarity for that.

All the best to you, and I hope this person learns better. They were being really gross and invalidating, and it’s such a shame that this attitude is not uncommon in the LGBTQ community.
I have this happen to me a lot (also AMAB and more masc presenting). It’s to a point that I feel obligated to use he/him in conjunction with they/them even though I don’t want to, because if I didn’t people would just be constantly misgendering me. It’s really frustrating that everyone just assumes that just because I’m AMAB that I must identify with my sex assigned to me at birth. Stay strong friend, and know you aren’t alone.
She’s an asshole. I’m sorry that you had to interact with someone who thinks that revenge misandry is acceptable. Being offensive towards whoever’s gender identity man, non binary, woman, etc is not ok. 

I thought these people only exist on Reddit and Twitter but I guess they leak over into real life and just think saying offensive shit about all men/masc people is ok because “I’m oppressed” 

To all the masc non binary people you are valid. Don’t let assholes like this create a narrative about you in your heads.
i hate that casual/joking jabs at men (and ""men"", yay for misgendering) have become so much the norm in queer communities... i thought the value of these comments was in using the reversal to show how ridiculous ANY kind of gender stereotyping is? (and in some cases, to prompt the critical examination of men's behavior in ways neglected by the patriarchy, in order to hold men accountable for any bad behaviors they've been previously not called out on *if and when they're actually happening*)

...but a disturbing number of people seem to be just... genuinely buying into it? 

and like... just glossing over all the women and nonbinary people hurt by it being misapplied to them, and all the trans men who get to enjoy their gender affirmation in the form of denigration (or who get told it doesn't apply to them, bc they're not REALLY men)... cis men don't deserve that either. they should hear these things once or twice, explicitly as a joke, just to make them think about what the experience is like for other genders who get it all the time (and obviously they should be aware of common patterns of bad behavior the patriarchy encourages in men, so they can check themself and their peers for any way they may be unwitting playing into that, and called out when others see them doing it), but no one should have to deal with that. 

how sad is it that cis men to have to choose between a misogynistic/patriarchal culture they don't believe in, and a culture free all of that, but in which they personally are denigrated/put down/othered? like where are cis men supposed to be able to have genuine connection with people other than cis men? 

but honestly more than any of that, it's just stupid. 
existing wrongness isn't going to be combatted by being wrong in the other direction. misogyny and misandry are both built on the same faulty premise, and playing into either just further legitimizes and strengthens that shared foundation of sexism.
That's what we get for rapresenting men as ""enemy"", demonizing every form of masculinity in the attempt to smash social structures.

It's very sad and i'm really sorry for you.
Ah, gotta love the combination of misandry and enbiephobia

As a fellow masc nb who shares your passion for film, I feel your frustration
I once had someone accept my enbyness… and 2 days later in a discussion accused me of “all of you   guys are like that. Sorry I know you said you’re nb, but you still have a dick”

fastest unfriend/unmatch/seeyanever ever

op, stupid people being stupiding, don’t let it get you down :)

That's messed up!
That person sounds like a jerk with a very fixed mindset and not enough compassion.
I understand your frustration, but...

>My gender and perceived gender shouldn't f*cking interfere with how seriously my argument is taken.

Is this not frequently the experience of many women?
>  talking over people

*If* this is a thing that actually happened, it's something to work on - just to be a better conversationalist, etc. 

Some people are taught, growing up, to be considerate of others and their feelings. To make sure they don't take up too much space or be too loud, and to make space and time for others' words and emotions. *Typically* that education is gendered, but it's not always; some people teach all their kids to be considerate; some teach none of their children this. 

Realizing that no one ever bothered to teach you how to be actually polite because it was assumed 1. you were a man and 2. men get to trample over everyone else in conversation really sucks. Moving into queer spaces will really help an individual mistaken for male realize how much space they've been told by society they are entitled to take up, and I mean that in conversation as well. 

So it's worth it to examine your behavior - regardless of gender stereotypes - and consider just what it that elicited that reaction. Someone being a jackass and calling you a straight man isn't the best way to let someone know that their behavior isn't cooperative, BUT statistically, it's actually quite possible that some aspect of your conversational habits might read as overconfident. You spent your life thinking that if you had something to say, it was worth being listened to, so of course there's space in any conversation for your thoughts! You bothered to have them, didn't you?  

I experienced a LOT of that (even as AFAB) due to my autism and not realizing that there *was* no space in conversation for my ideas (due to being mistaken for female), even though I expected to take up as much space in any discussion as anyone else who knew enough to participate. It was weird to get online and use a neutral name and be accused of mansplaining because I was confident and willing to hold my ground in a conversation. 

HOWEVER, there are three critical factors in mansplaining, beyond the person doing it being a dude:

1. it must be WRONG

2. it must be to someone who KNOWS that it's wrong - i.e., novice talking down to expert

3. it must be UNSOLICITED 

so if you're in a group convo talking about your opinions, instead of telling a physicist they don't know what stars are because you saw one in the sky once, it's pretty hard to actually be mansplaining - opinions are difficult to be ""wrong"" in the same way that mansplained material tends to be. 

So the specific term probably doesn't apply remotely and, rather than find an adult way to tell you she found it rude to be interrupted or talked over, she microaggressed and attacked your gender identity. I mean, what better way to cow someone into keeping quiet than to convince them their whole identity must be a lie if they don't?  

You're entitled to a whole person's worth of space! But you're only entitled to ONE person's worth of space. (like, socially/emotionally/verbally, not literally in a fatphobic way)  And which of those is more difficult for you to learn reflects a LOT about how you were raised, which in a binary culture can often involve what gender stereotypes were assigned to you as a child. 

(deep breath)

tl;dr: hard to mansplain if you're not a man and giving an opinion, buuuuuuut it might be time to consider your consideration of others in conversations.
I can understand if people have a negative reaction to something they may consider ""mansplaining"", even though you are not a man. if you spent any part of your life passing as masculine enough to be taught some of the ideals of the partriarchy theres a chance youve stumbled into it without knowing. I would say, confirm that the person you are speaking with feels that their opinion is valid even if there is a difference in your own. if thats the case then everyone else can shut it.
I can relate to this frustratingly well. I'm also amab, mostly masc presenting because any signifiers i ended up adopting would be for other folks, not for myself or how I'd like to present. This sometimes means that regardless of how long I've been out as non-binary I get accused of ""man-moding"" a lot. This usually comes from taking up space, in queer spaces.

The funny thing is, being raised as a man I was taught NOT to take up space, to be quiet and be small. It was all well meaning, but it meant i never really got to own myself or my body. I had to unlearn a lot of that behavior to actually figure out I was non-binary. I was less confrontational and annoying when I thought I was a man, so its a little funny when folks attribute that to my upbringing. You can call me insufferable, or annoying, but never call me a man for it.

I hear you and I agree with the sentiments of your post however I think that the term ""cis-assumed"" is a more intentional and accurate term instead of ""cis-passing"" because (at least to me) the term passing implies that there is a volitional intention to be seen as cis and it doesn't seem like this is what op is trying to do (indeed there are many trans folks who are trying to pass and are also valid). I agree that there is privilege in this (especially for people who are assumed male) but it's also important to hold space and accurately describe it in a way that honors the validity of their nonbinarity while still being aware of the privilege that comes from navigating society while being assumed in this context.
Thank you and yes I understand
this. all the way!
As a trans guy I'd actually disagree that society treats femme presenting and visibly trans people like this ""all the time"". There is certainly prejudice, and transphobia is extremely blatant and often violent. But I've never had my opinions, perspectives, and honestly humanity dismissed by society in the way that certain ""progressive"", LGBT+ people feel comfortable doing to me now, now that they assume I'm a straight, cis guy. There's a difference in tone and in that people feel *much* more entitled shitting on straight, cis men for the most part.

This is ofc, nothing on what transfem people go through just by being out in public. But I don't think we should lump *all* femme-presenting people and even trans people in with them. Femme cis women are not, for the most part, dismissed so blatantly and entirely where I am from at least. People might interrupt them more or respect them less, but they won't *blatantly* say ""she's a woman, she has no right to speak!"". It's not quite as violent saying that about men, ofc, as the other way round would be due to patriarchy and the power men hold in society. But it's still regressive and dehumanising. It's not something we should defend.
Its the comments like this reminding me im not the only one thats making it better. Thanks
Right there with you. I've had to constantly get on to my shift lead at my job and still he doesn't gender me properly. Constant sir's don't help because I work customer service in the south
I was at a queer event yesterday and my friends were joking that I was ""toxically masculine"" because I was drinking huel and dressed in conventionally masc attire.

I laughed. I took it. I chose to focus on the funny side and see that they are well intentioned, and that they don't *actually* believe I am a toxic person for drinking Huel or wearing sportsgear.

At the same time, it's not lost on me that every other gender expression is celebrated (in queer communities), while mine is mocked. That if I didn't have a sense of humour about it and actually voiced offence at those kinds of jokes, then I likely wouldn't have any friends. And that the masculinity which was beaten out of me (I'm AFAB) and that I've been shamed for my entire life... if I embrace it it's seen as a bit embarrassing and not something to be celebrated - even in queer spaces.
Amab enbies amongst other groups like trans men and bi men take the grunt of that. Way to smash them social structures everyone, really doing the work... /s
I appreciate the energy but let's not throw hands. Thank you for the support!
Yes but as I do not do that (so there's no element of hypocrisy) how is it relevant to this rant post? I'm not saying it only happened to me for being nonbinary (although that was a major factor), I'm just stating that it did happen.
like... yeah. everyone needs to watch out for toxic behavior in themself. 

but even if OP was definitely 100% talking over people, it's still a valid complaint that their friend decided to misgender them about it instead of just being like ""hey, stop talking over me"" 

maybe OP was in the wrong — idk, i wasn't there — but their AGAB and presentation were obviously a factor in the way they were confronted about it (to the extent that their friend lead with the misgendering, and only mentioned their actual supposed grievance as an afterthought, to underline the initial misgendering) 

i interpret your first comment as well-meaning, but i don't think it's evidence of OP not knowing how to be considerate in conversation that they were dismissive of a comment that was 80% unsoliciced Self-Examination 101 and 20% acknowledging the other person's bad behavior, with a TLDR that reads basically like ""Have you considered that they're right?""

I know how to have a fair discussion. I know how to give others room to talk and know how to watch my tone and language. Please do not assume I dont because I grew up with a male raising..
Yes, transitioning isn’t easy, and if it doesn’t come with unlearning certain behaviours then you’re just preserving privilege
[removed]
[removed]
I actually love this. It’s a much more comfortable phrase for sure, for both me and OP. Thank you for pointing it out 💖
I will add that having privilege does not at all reflect on the person who has it; what would would be what that person does with the privilege. Privilege is also based on other people’s assumptions.
Thank you for sharing your experience
I don't wanna imply that it's ""worse"" for me than it is for amab enbies or bi men, but what really bothers me in my case as a trans masc is that I was literally *abused* for my masculinity growing up, as a kid. People hated it and taught me it made me ugly, and treated me like absolute dirt cos I dared to be masculine as an afab. And now, in a community of people who should understand what that's like and want me to be me and be celebrated for it, who I am is treated as *dirty* and like something to be ashamed of. It's fucking shit.
I think the point is that when you say ""My gender and perceived gender shouldn't fcking interfere with how seriously my argument is taken.""  you're absolutely correct, but it's something you always got to take for granted when society was mistaking you for a man, and saying it to people who never got to believe the lie feels a little tone deaf. Getting to be oblivious to sexism is in and of itself a privilege that non-men do not have, so the further you move from everyone else automatically treating you like the dude they (falsely) think they see, the more you'll be *experiencing* sexism instead of simply observing it. And the new angle on toxic masculinity is *enlightening* to say the least.
There's no way to deserve transphobia.
Transitioning mtf or mtx and wanting others to recognise that has to come with unlearning certain behaviours that come from preserving privilege, it’s not disgusting to realise that
> is gonna start talking over people

This is what made me assume you might be, well. ... Talking over people. The education of being considerate is *often* gendered but not always. Every cis binary man should also learn every bit of How Not To Be A Dick In Conversation - it's not a new standard just cos you came out as enby. 

If someone felt talked over, then it's time to examine what caused that. Don't get defensive and trapped in cognitive dissonance. Anyone can interrupt, not just men. But anyone can learn to be more polite, too. Improve yourself! It's honestly never a waste, even when you think you're already perfect.

Tone isn't always a problem - I get really enthusiastic and people often mistake it for aggression. You don't have to be nice to be right OR righteous. But you do have to be nice if you want friends. Whether or not you want to be friends with some turd who talks about you like that is obviously up for debate BUT for someone who WOULDN'T speak to you so cruelly, wouldn't you want to make sure they also felt comfortable in a conversation? Consideration is about, well. Considering others, not necessarily before yourself, but at least thinking, gee, how will this affect anyone but me?
> I know how to have a fair discussion. I know how to give others room to talk and know how to watch my tone and language

But you're not. You're just denying anyone and shutting down the advice that you have something to work on. Your defensiveness is preventing you from dealing with the possibility that you were rude because you can blame it on someone calling you too masc instead. It really doesn't matter why you were rude or what upbringing convinced you that talking over someone ISN'T rude; if you treat people that way in conversation, you can say you're fair all you want and it won't change the precedent of what you actually **do**.
I'm not agreeing with the term, but I guarantee that there was a reason why people were getting annoyed. Saying that someone has habits to work on isn't misgendering them. Literally every time I've heard a trans or nonbinary person (whether AFAB or amab) complain that someone said they were mansplaining they were in fact talking in a condescending way and over others. Call me a. Asahole all you want, but when you remove the gender there is still an incredibly irritating behavior underneath that yes, constantly being reinforced by society because they are amab and masc presenting. Pointing out that there is a reason why others are bothered isn't ennyphobic. .not sure how many embys you actually know but they are just as likely to have gross behavior as cis people,and the fact that OP dismissed the criticism because of the term really confirms this.lol you can criticize behavior without criticising someone's identity and it's bullahit you think that embys are immune to this
I said ""viewed as a man"" because you did in your post. My comment is regarding how you automatically dismissed someone's criticism without even considering it.
Masculinity is rapresented as ugly from much of the last wave of feminism.

People keep saying ugly sh*t like ""men are rapist"" instead of ""those SPECIFIC men are rapist"" or even worse, they talk about patriarchy as something enforced by men, while it's a social structure enforced by women too.

The concept of privilege also points out toward this direction, rapresenting men as people without responsabilities, while they also have gender roles and such.

I notice this attitude with me too. When people finds me more feminine they act better toward me, while they are much less kind if they see the ""manly"" part first.
I live in an area where the two main demographics is religions that hate homosexuality. And unfortunately as much as I'm not gay appearing enough for other LGBT members, my dyed hair and painted nails often gets me dismissed and looked over in society, at work, or just in a social setting. Too gay for the straights, too straight-looking for the gays. Thus is the life of a amab bi enby. Dismissed by fucking everyone let's go lads.
Thank you

Much better expressed than I managed.
There is no such thing as a specific goal for transition for non-binary people. Masc-presenting non-binary people who happen to be AMAB are still non-binary. Androgyny or otherwise non-masc presentation may be a goal for some, but is not for all. No non-binary person is obligated to transition to anything, because non-binary doesn’t have a fixed presentation. 

And even if it did, unlearning something for the sake of transition implies that whatever is to be unlearned is somehow an innate trait of whatever is being transitioned from. **It behooves any and ALL genders to unlearn patriarchally-mandated attitudes, behaviors, and notions of gender.** Even cis women at all points of intersection still have to do the work to unlearn attitudes and behaviors that reinforce patriarchal structures.

This attitude that AMAB people are the only ones who have to change to dismantle the multi-dimensional systems of power is suspiciously bio-essentialist and TERFy.
This seems a little ableist to me, don’t you think? “Anyone can learn to be polite” as a neurodivergent enby with a late adhd diagnosis I’ve really really struggled with the self hate of always accidentally interrupting or talking over my friends and feeling like a piece of garbage for not being able to shut up. This resulted in me completely shutting down and only having one friend at a time. Luckily now I know I wasn’t just an asshole all the time but I had adhd which made it really hard for me not to interrupt. It seems as though you yourself are making a lot of assumptions on your end. 

I willing to bet OP is coming off as defensive to you because you sound like you’re attacking them. Readjust your approach and learn to be polite since that seems to be a thing that everyone can learn.
[removed]
I am. Youre just assuming I wasn't. Actually just you, im arguing with you, I dont mind other people's points because they haven't constructed this false narrative of me, I know I need work, everyone does. I wasn't being rude, my partner is very good at telling me when my autism makes me forget my tone and I come across as rude and he fully said to me I was fine that night. I wasn't talking over anyone. You keep creating a quote, I never said I talked over anyone, I give everyone room to speak, I enjoy discussion, its fun. Its fun to be challenged and exchange views.
None of us were there in that conversation. Yet all I hear from randoms is that ‘maybe OP should check their behavior and stop acting like a cis man’

You’re playing devils advocate of a person being intentionally offensive to OP and it just shows that you don’t give a shit and you’re just using this opportunity to shit on a masc person because you think that’s ok. If this was a fem person no one would’ve said a god damn word about OP “talking over” someone else. You assume just because OP was born with a penis that they were in the wrong and being inconsiderate in that conversation. 

You’re a transphobe.
>  gay appearing enough 

What is 'gay appearing' ? Is it supposed to signify your gender or your sexual orientation?
I Never said they’re the only ones, that’s just who we were talking about right now, I agree that everyone shares this responsibility. it’s ridiculous to pretend you weren’t socialised in some way if you spent any amount of your life being seen or forced to act as a certain gender, and its something any trans person has to come to terms with, that’s all I’m saying. I also never mentioned a specific goal but OP clearly doesn’t want to be misgendered, while feeling entitled to male-coded behaviour that’s been taught throughout our lives, and there’s nothing bio essentialist about that
It's not. Learning is different for everyone, but it's always possible. It's much more ableist to pretend that needing to be taught clearly (rather than absorb it implicitly) is the same as being unable to learn. It takes more effort and more work for those of us on the spectrum, but it's hardly impossible.
If someone literally said you were talking over others, then denying it out of ego isn't going to do a damn thing for you.
Quote came from your post, not 'created'. 

You can say that you do that all you want but you keep just denying/dismissing. Doesn't matter how fair you claim to be if you're only ""fair"" to what you haven't already decided to ignore.
I specified that I have seen this with both AFAB and amab people so you're 100% making things up when you say that I'm assuming things because someone was""born with a penis"". I'm assuming that the person who was complaining about a behavior was in favor complaining about a behavior. Weird move calling a trans person who has been hospitalized for being assaulted for being trans a transphobe and will undoubtedly face medical transphobia for the rest of their life but you do you.

the struggle of feeling that nonbinary aesthetic are for thinner bodies	"this is my first post, its gonna be all over the place

I always creep and through this subreddit I dont have any non binary friends looking at all the post on here make me feel less alone. around the time I started changing my pronouns, I developed a eating disorder, 15/16. Im 18 now I still struggling with eating but its alot better now, it's better now in the sense that im gaining some weight again, and I am scared. Scared to gain weight and people will think im a certain gender that im not. I feel that when people think of nonbinary aesthetic its always slim bodies. Before I developed a ed I was a big kid, and I lost alot of weight. Now starting to become healthy again is triggering something in me. I dont know if this will be understandable, relate to anyone. It's a hard thing to explain, it has alot of layers to it. I think I just needed to relese this frustration."	"You are right, the stereotypical look is androgynous, thin, and usually white, and very often also young.

It's important to remember however that most of us, the vast majority of us, in fact, don't look like that. I am white but other than that look the opposite of that. I have an hourglass shape, a masc haircut and I'm middle aged, so I also get the jarring feeling.  

It's important to disregard the attempts at creating a cohesive stereotype and embrace the vast diversity. All the best to you! x
I’m chubby, super busty, and extremely genderless. I get so frustrated that the nonbinary aesthetic doesn’t include people like me. But the fact that other people also feel this way gives me hope that that ideal will shift
Totally agree. I’m 50, overweight and pretty bald, grey and look better with a beard and I hate looking masculine.  Seeing people on here makes me feel part of a community where enby aesthetics are celebrated. Enbys are all beautiful. Gender is a construct. One day the world will catch up with us xxx
I don't think it's helpful to view non-binary people as a cohesive group with one aesthetic. It's about as broad of a category of person as it gets. Just anyone not on the binary. Don't let the specific subculture of skinny white alt nb kids online get to you. They are a visible segment of non-binary people, but they don't represent everyone by any means. You do you, don't fall into the trap of thinking non-binary is one gender- it isn't a third gender in a trinary. Just... whatever else. Above all else, as an identity it represents being yourself.
That's really a problem with fashion as a whole. Most advertising conveys the idea that only people who can fit into a small are the 'normal' size. There definitely needs to be a wider variety of body types in ads, and things should really move away from the ""small medium large"" frame of reference. I hate how often I come across some cute article of clothing only to find they either don't have a size that would fit me (if they even have a chart at all) or I'm 3X or something like that.
I agree... It's really gotten me down, too. It feels like it's impossible to be androgynous without being thin and it makes me want to rip my flesh off...
Enby people in real life aren't all the conventionally attractive thin androgynous young people, those are just the nonbinary influencers and TikTok famous enbies, *who are influencers* or TikTok famous *specifically because* they're attractive to a lot of people. Most influencers are skinny and white and fashionable.

You probably know that all women aren't conventionally attractive and all men aren't conventionally attractive because you know some other men and women in real life. But when nonbinary people are so unknown it begins to seem like all nonbinary people really are skinny and white and fashionably androgynous. There are a lot of real nonbinary people who aren't skinny. I don't know if this helps but it really is much better for you to be healthy, accept yourself, and present the way you feel comfortable than to fit into a restricting model of what nonbinary people ""should"" look like.
Mid 30s, overweight, long hair...I wear a mixture of ""gender"" clothes. I don't aim for this ""androgynous"" look. There is no ""look"" for being nonbinary. You just are.

Trick is to learn to not care what people think of you. That comes with age I think... one day you will see yourself in the mirror and think, yup, that's me. 

Never feel like you have to explain yourself or apologise for the way you look or want to present yourself to the world. As long as you are happy and content that's all that matters.

I hope you feel better soon and have support with recovering from your ED. You got this. We might all be strangers on the Internet, but we know you've got this! You are kick ass for getting on top of your ED, even if you have slip ups, you are still a bad ass in my eyes.
I'm 50 AFAB non-binary, I'm definitely not thin, we can all be non-binary with all body types.
Super, super relatable. I developed an ED as a result of starting puberty and having difficult and incomprehensible feelings (trans awareness was nowhere to be found at the time) about what my body was trying to do. You’re absolutely not alone.

In the interest of transparency, I am thin-ish (but have not always been) and white, so I fit the accepted idea of androgyny—and still it impacts me. It’s like people’s acceptance of my gender is always going to be conditional, and that sucks.

I have not taken hormones because so much of my own gender journey has been about accepting myself *without* changing myself to fit others’ expectations—but to this day, the biggest reason I’m seriously considering taking them is because I wonder whether I might have a healthier relationship to weight gain if it stopped happening in ways that make me appear more like my assigned gender.

Things are much easier now. I have a usually very healthy relationship with food and eating, and with myself. So with hard work and plenty of support (whatever that may look like) along the way, it can get better. I’m grateful to have built a strong foundation of self-assurance that allows me to feel very much myself, even through dysphoria—but that doesn’t mean it’s not still tough sometimes. I am just a human being, and how people treat me does impact me. It’s all about developing the resilience to pay it no mind.
Anyone can be non-binary. It sucks that most people who post are thin, it’s not representative. Maybe there is a sub for non-binary people with bigger bodies to post photos.
Curvy non-binary person here. It's for you too. Love the shell you are in. You are valid at any size. 💕
I feel like tiktok really aided with this... In general being queer seems to be about looking hot , different, edgy and hypersexualized. I like wearing my dad outfits and I'm thicc.
You are so far from alone. \*So many\* of us have felt trapped or excluded by the very narrow representation we receive: tall, white, waiflike, perfectly androgynous, and twentysomething. History with EDs is heartbreakingly common in this community.

As it stands, the wider world is not really interested in the fact that we come in every shape, size, and color, and we even *age*, too. I won't lie to you, people can be pretty awful when you don't live up to their image of nonbinariness. I've had some very insensitive things said to me by people I would've expected to be strong allies. I know that's a bummer to hear, but it's better to be prepared than blindsided, imo.

When I have to deal with any nonsense, I focus on the fact that living my truth in my body, without self-flagellation or apology, will make it easier for nonbinary kids in the future to live in their bodies without rigid and harmful expectations. Every time I stand strong in my identity in the face of aesthetic criticism, I help make 'the rest of us' a little more visible, a little more expected and mundane. On hard days, I think of myself as part of the vanguard, helping to inch our culture forward for the sake of those who come after. Sometimes it's easier to stay healthy for the sake of the kids than for myself.

I really recommend checking out r/NonBinaryOver30. This sub is great, and there's nothing inherently wrong with the kids who are able to embody the ideal. All of us deserve support, and space to do our thing. But there is substantially more body diversity over there, and it can be really refreshing and reassuring to see that we don't just disappear after 29.
i agree with and think about this often. i highly recommend reading reading Belly of the Beast by Da’Shaun Harrison! also the podcast Gender Reveal (all their episodes are so fucking good everyone should listen) with Jackson King as a guest and it altered my brain chemistry.
Some of the enbiest enbies I know are short, busty and somewhat rotund. They convey their gender through style, attitude, demeanor and occasionally pride pins.
What aesthetic is that?
I'm in the same boat. I know intellectually that anyone can be non-binary and it's not about the aesthetic or even being andro, but I recently gained some weight and it's making me a bit dysphoric.
Seek out body positive queer media and media with various queer bodies. Fuck the rest. Honestly I have found the most body positivity from drag queens, many of whom ID as non-binary
I understand exactly where you're coming from. 💛
I am so glad you said this because I was lately pining over my body when I was 21 that was much more thin and androgynous (like a Victoria’s Secret model without breasts) and now I’m 32 and thick and feeling like I don’t “deserve” to call myself non binary whilst being masculine presenting.
Fat enbies exist.

Hello 🤗
oh gosh i totally understand you, this hurt me so bad before i tailored my social media to be more body inclusive SPECIFICALLY in terms of serving me up lots of images of fat butches and fem men. its all so tangly when your only access point is seeing pictures of the nonbinary body exclusively seen as waifish and conforming to \~aesthetic\~ standards especially when you dont really have alternatives of like, seeing nb people in old movies (where hyperconformity to beauty standards was less strict i find) or even irl for some people (including my unlucky ass)
Honestly, the only reason I don’t have severe body dysphoria with my broad shoulders and hips and curvy body (I’m not even that big, I could be considered as having a small/medium chest but depending how I dress I can fill out some things more) is because long before I ever started questioning my gender, I went to therapy for some rather severe social anxiety (and general anxiety) and one of the things we worked on for the year or so I was with that therapist were some major self esteem issues and body confidence and she helped me learn to, if not love my body, be comfortable in it and dress in clothing other than baggy hoodies and big jeans.

That was early highschool, so when I started questioning my gender later and eventually realized I’m transmasc and nonbinary, I still get plenty of gender dysphoria but no body dysphoria, if that makes sense. Even still, I look at thinner androgynous and male bodies and wish I could look like that, but as a broke college kid, keeping a super healthy diet is impossible (I live off of pasta because its super cheap at my local grocery, sometimes I can splurge on produce and meat but I don’t have the money to cook all the time), and my adhd makes exercise routines hard to keep so in addition to walking everywhere I can in the city, I rollerskate and skateboard as much as I can since those are fun and my adhd brain sees them as hobbies over exercise and makes it easier to do more often. I know I’ve toed the like of overweight for a long time but my body holds onto fat like its going out of style, so I understand where you’re coming from
So sorry to hear it, it's hard enough to have a healthy relationship with weight/food without dysphoria or gender confusion entering the equation. Just remember that even if your AGAB does have some bearing on how and where your body retains fat (along with many other factors!) that's nothing at all to do with your identity or preferred presentation and doesn't make you one bit less valid.
To further this wonderful response, the idea behind the more and more prominent slogan *non-binary ≠ androgyny* is that the idea that to be non-binary you should dress in a way that distances you from either binary option is not only not true, but it is harmful and erasing to non-binary bodies that don’t fit or uphold aesthetic expressions of androgyny. The idea that there even **is** a non-binary aesthetic is inherently harmful because it creates a set of expectations to appear in a certain way, just like the binary sets expectations that we dress in a certain way if we have a penis or vagina. Being non-binary means leaning into aesthetics that make you feel more whole, that lift up and put forward the truest sense of yourself. This might be a dress even if your AGAB is female. Or masc. jeans and t-shirt even if you’re AGAB is male. Neither would make you *Less* non-binary than any other choice would.

You do you. *You are non-binary regardless of your chosen clothing on any given day*
Same, honestly. When viewed from the back I get called he/him cuz of the way I dress and my haircut, but when I turn around people are like ""oh, I mean she/her"" cuz of my boobs. I don't mind my boobs, they don't give me disphoria, but it's annoying that most people automatically associate boobs with being female. And personally I'm fine with any pronouns, but again, the automatic assumption of she/her is kinda annoying.
Totally agree, I’m not even in a position where I can bind because of health issues so I look very feminine regardless of what I do. It’s especially frustrating that I will always be seen as feminine unless I get too surgery (which I’m not sure about getting)
""Above all else, as an identity it represents being yourself"" i couldnt of said it better myself thank you
all of these help so much, im happy that i got have a discussion about this with people who do identify as nonbinary it helps alot thank you
thank you i appericate the kind words
thank you for opening up about this, in transparency also I am white, I probably fit into the accepted idea of androgyny also. I relate to you a big time, I also want to accept myself without having to change myself to fit in the binary. I'm happy to hear that things are easier for you now, you deserve and everyone deserves to feel comfortable in thier body, no matter what
I will check out both of them thank you i appericate it
A part of gaining recognition as a valid gender is having the same nonsensical gender expectations placed upon us.

Suffering from success :'(
It’s so frustrating! It’s so frustrating that people refuse to perceive me as masculine Bc I don’t bind
I feel this so much. I (also chubby and very busty) came out as non-binary in the middle of a long term relationship with a cis-hetero dude and he used to constantly correct himself when he’d call me anything verging on masculine and it would irritate me so badly. I did talk to him about it and he’s made major progress with it. And I also experience the constant assumption of female although for me it doesn’t matter if ppl see me from the front or back due to junk in the trunk as well. I’ve honestly begun to dislike my body because of this even tho if I saw it on anyone else I’d love it. 🫤"	ztqe3u	NonBinary	273	0.98	2022-12-23 19:26:47
Oh look it's my favorite combo, fatphobia and gatekeeping! (both medical and within the queer community itself) SO delightful.	"
I'm REALLY fucking tired of this. Being too fat for insurance-based transition requirements doesn't make me cis. Not explaining my entire medical history to some rando demanding an explanation of why I'm not on hormones/surgery yet if I'm ""really trans"" definitely doesn't make me cis. 

*Every* surgery and even some hormone treatments are gatekept behind weight requirements. I can't even get a consultation for hormones until I lose a hundred pounds (medicaid is ass, they won't cover anything anyway).  I've faced a lot of judgment from *within my own community* for not ""starting"" a transition yet, with a lot of subtle implications that yep, it's my fault for not getting skinny to 'earn' my transition. Obviously I must not want it bad enough if I can't lose weight to qualify just to TALK to a doctor about transition! And the way that people will tell you to your face that you're valid even if you never plan on physical transition or hormones, and then those same people talk shit behind your back because you're not transitioning/are a ""permapre""... *you can stop at any time* and yet. AND YET!

The level of harassment I've gotten from other queer folk for being a ""pre"" (one of them literally used the name ""post-op"" to send me hate speech) is fucking surreal. Attacking and blaming me for the medical gatekeeping of which I am a victim = a foul fucking look for you. Harassing anyone because they're not trans enough for your standards is transmedicalist bullshit. No one has to get surgery or go on hormones to be a trans person! But at least once a week someone is being shitty to me because I'm a trans person who hasn't yet/can't do those things. 

Boiled over because an offhand comment from some piece of shit about how the post-op photo channel is more enjoyable because it only includes bodies that are a specific ""trans aesthetic"" which includes thinness (but as she was desperate to clarify, NOT whiteness! lol. nice try, Gabby), and the fact that not a single person even seemed to notice/have a problem with her obsession with size while they were attacking her for perceived racism.  

 I'm *still* seething over my doc's refusal to refer me for assessment because of my weight, despite the length of time it'll take to go from paper referral to actual assessment, and then the years it takes to go from that to surgery. 

I have a long history of eating disorders and self-harm through calorie restriction. Every doctor I have knows this; the current one knows I use caffeine pills and nicotine patches to prevent weight gain but still won't prescribe my correct medication (bupropion, 300mg/day) instead, no matter how reasonably I try to explain that I'd much rather have my actual meds than nicotine patches. 

Medical neglect and abuse are so much more common than you'd ever expect. It's always so shocking to those of a wealth/class who actually GET medical care, who assume everyone else does too just because of that sign in the ER, to learn how much is completely inaccessible to me because I can't pay, can't get magically skinny overnight, or a combination of both. 

Anyway I'm about to spiral into ideation over weight gain leaving me even further from transition goals, and the stress of my own community getting all gleeful about it and how relieved they are to never have to see a body this size in their post-op photos. 


Any time anyone feels the need or even just the desire to judge someone else for not transitioning far enough/fast enough/at all: try SHUTTING THE FUCK UP! instead :D :D :D"	"I also want to mention that HRT and surgery is not mandatory to be transgender. Some don't have that privilege,  some don't want or need it, some don't have access,  some are physically unable to etc. Real privileged garbage to gatekeep people in a minority community like that. 

I have been binding for over 7 years and my back is so fucked. I had preexisting back problems so binding is something i only do when friends come over (basically never at this point) or i go anywhere in public. I got a WFH job that has helped my back out dramatically since i no longer have to bind for 12 hours or more on work days. Binding/back pain additionally makes working out and going out in general so difficult. I have been trying to do more mobility related things like stretching to aid in my ability to exercise. 

I am not trying to tell you to exercise, I merely am just relating to your frustration in how I am similarly experiencing the same bs.
Every time I look for support online for dysphoria or my hopelessness about transition, people give lots of advice on how to talk to a doctor or find medical care or what steps to research, informed consent and online pharmaceutical delivery and-

&#x200B;

I have no healthcare access. I have not seen a doctor for any reason in over ten years. All of my money is spent on food and bills- I don't even get birthday presents anymore. I am essentially *already a trans refugee in Canada*, and it is meaningless. I'm not angry at those who want to give advice- but damn it'd be nice if that advice wasn't always 'take advantage of the privileges you obviously have'.

&#x200B;

For the record, I also expect any doctor to tell me I need to lose weight despite the fact that I'm down more than 100 lbs. I carry so much extra skin from being overweight that everyone I see assumes that I am gaining, not losing, and defending yourself from fatphobes is pointless.
i’m so sorry you’re going through that, medical neglect and fatphobia in the medical and queer communities are absolutely abhorrent and you don’t deserve that. 💗

i’m not transitioning medically, and i don’t have the same weight experience as you, but i’ve been on the receiving end of fatphobia from other queer people who think they’re “better” just because they’re skinny/have transitioned medically/etc. And it’s literally SO fucked up. it’s disgusting that people in our own community will choose such cruelty over caring for other community members.

you deserve so much better. 💛💛💛
One fat trans person to another, I get it. Every community I'm a part of fails me in one way or another. When I first developed arthritis and went to my doctor complaining about joint pain, the first thing she said was ""you need to lose weight before your knees can get better""

...the joints that hurt were not the knees. Not the ankles either. I had pain in my fingers, toes and wrists. But I stated joint pain when the receptionist asked for reason for visit and the doctor assumed which joints were hurting and why without even bothering to talk to me about it. 

I went to a gynecologist because my periods just never stopped. I bled approximately 28 days a month. And the only thing the gyn could say to me was ""the only reason this is happening to you is your weight. Do you eat everything in front of you?""

I'm lucky I was able to afford to go to a different gyn the next week. I know many who would have had to save up for a single appointment and then give up for several more months until they could save up for another one. 

The way the system works here, I got a letter from a WPATH certified psychologist and went straight to the sexual health clinic. I'm lucky I ended up with a doctor who gave me some warnings about weight control, but still gave me my HRT. If my PCP had to refer me, I'm not sure she would have. 

Medical fatphobia is probably the worst part of being fat. I haven't really talked to many transmeds so I haven't had the same treatment from this community as you have. That doesn't mean I don't believe you or that I discount your experiences. I fully believe that all this did happen to you. And the world fucking sucks. 

Be fat, be trans, be a poc in a white majority place, be afab, be mentally ill...and no doctor knows shit about what to do with you. So for any given symptom, they'll blame one of three things: your uterus/hormones, your weight, or your mental illness. Now that I'm medically transitioning, the list also includes HRT. And then they refuse to do further testing or treatment because either ""you need to lose weight"", or ""it's all in your head"", or ""it's hormonal and you're already being treated for it"". It's fucking bullshit.
This absolutely sucks and is a part of a failing system for transgender people. 

Insurance companies are scummy, including the underfunded and poorly run medicaid/Medicare. I have seen so many necessary surgeries,  treatments, and mobility devices denied by insurance, both private and not. 

I have been morbidly obese for over 20 years. My weight has always been a problem. T has helped with muscle gain, but I am still 284 pounds. I fo home workouts and treadmill cardio. I know if I had top surgery, I would be able to go to the gym and do more as well as get out of the house more to walk and explore. My dysphoria puts me in a prison of not going out and hiding myself away. I have lost inches on my torso, but my weight remains the same due to muscle conversion and density difference between fat and muscle. It's a long, slow, painful process that I wish i did not have to go through. I wish us heavy dudes could get top surgery and that we did not get blocked off from it due to our weight. You know what keeps me fat? My tits that I need gone. It's like they expect you to 1. Not be fat, which is bs if a person is happy with their body that way and 2. Magically, get over the physical barrier that is having breasts. It's illogical bs. 

I am also sorry that queer people in your life have let you down and caused harm. Unfortunately queer people are like every other type of human in that they can be just as shitty, great, smart, stupid, prejudiced,  welcoming, etc, as anyone else.
Damn I'm not in your shoes but yeah the fatphobia sure does fucking suck, even just by being in the ""splash zone"". Doctors constantly dismiss my desire to gain more weight, gaslight me when I say gaining weight reduces my symptoms, and congratulate me for not getting weight gain side effects of medications. 

Like bitch! I've had issues with calorie restriction all my life! I have worked YEARS to gain the little I have! Skinny does not equal healthy! Shit, the majority of fat people are probably healthier than me, but the reason treatment models are less effective on fat people is because you *refuse to fucking treat them* until it's a crisis rather than catching it early!

I've carry around a binder with all my medical information in it and a notebook to my doc appts. I started just because I have memory issues, but I noticed how doctors take me more seriously with it, less questioning. Seeing the paperwork alone makes doctors sit up, but *nothing* like when I start writing notes. I know it isn't much, but every little bit to make doc appts less like the seventh circle of hell helps.
I can't upvote this enough. Transmedicalist gatekeepers are sickening. Do what you want to do when you want to do it. The doctors making weight loss a condition of operating on you is pretty gross. And it is grounded in Bryan, white supremacist notions of what constitutes a healthy and fit body. So much bullshit.

>Harassing anyone because they're not trans enough for your standards is transmedicalist bullshit. No one has to get surgery or go on hormones to be a trans person! 

Absofuckinglutely! I'm so sorry you have people like this around you trying to tear you down. 

Idealization of thin bodies is so rampant across all communities and is continually apart of trans communities about trying to be the ""model trans person"". And also like you noticed, White. It's so frustrating to see those who face oppression, try and justify oppression of people in other minority groups.
its so fucked up. nobody deserves to go through what you're going through, and the fact that it's all avoidable/literally done on purpose is just so infuriating and evil. its just layer after layer after layer...sometimes i feel like healthcare is for the opposite of health
Oh no. 

# eating disorder buff +5
The shrinks will give you that buproprion prescription based solely on you being stressed out about what life is throwing at you.

Or at least they did for me about 20 years ago.  

It took seeing a clinical social worker,  then their referral to the psychiatrist, and the primary care schmuck had nothing to do with it.
Fat phobia is horrible, especially from doctors! My aunt was overweight and every time something was wrong she was just told to loose 50 pounds (and she was trying!) turns out she had a gallbladder issue that ended in surgery which made her drop a ton of weight and only now do her doctors occasionally listen to her! And yes, high weight can lead to issues depending on where it falls (fat on your organs can be dangerous but fat thighs or arms won’t hurt you) but that’s no excuse for everyone to completely ignore the actual issue!
I was working with a fellow enby on a project and the people working in our building would come talk to us. They would misgender just me and I mentioned it to my enby colleague. Their response? “Well, if you did HRT, you wouldn’t get misgendered as often.” …huh???
What state are you in? I've never heard of bmi for hormones, was that because of the doctor or state regulation? I don't know if you're trying to get E or T but T makes it easier to lose weight so they would be a stupid reason to deny thai.
This is honestly such a good post. I honestly feel so dysphoric about my fatness because of shit like this. Like one nonbinary person a long time ago even told me ""you would pass much better if you lost weight"" which is just so much more fucked up hearing that from another nonbinary person. 

Also... *""permapre""* sounds so utterly disgusting, like a straight up transphobic slur coined by truscum. I'll be honest, even I feel like no matter how radically inclusive the majority of the trans community claims to be, theres still a serious truscum problem in a ton of areas that are still underaddressed. I'll still see it through micro aggressive behaviors that even make me feel isolated for not having medically transitioned yet even tho theres a lot of personal reasons why i havent. (Ive tried to in the past, but was in extremely unsafe environments to do so) 

I also knew a trans woman of color who was gatekept from taking HRT because of her weight. There was nothing medically wrong with her either, she took a bunch of tests and was perfectly healthy!! Medical fatphobia is an actual thing even within trans health care, it's honestly despicable. If you need access to hormones still, there's this one app I keep hearing about that might help you access that care.

I really hope this helps!!
no one is entitled to information about you!! im sorry you had to go through this you dont deserve it. you should get the same treatments as any cis/‘skinny’ person and its unbelievably unfair.
😢 hugs?
sending u 50000 fat-armed hugs, I know it probably sounds cheesy at this point but your experiences are fucking valid and anyone who thinks otherwise bc they want to cover up their medical eugenicism with truscum ideology needs to go step on an infinite hallway of legos. fucking dickwads. I'm so sorry you're going through this and I wish I could actually help-help but I just want to really assure that you are NOT alone and I'd go yell at doctors for you if I could. I'm so so sorry this is happening to you and that people decide to make it worse instead of doing the bare minimum of shutting the hell up
everything about this sucks, im sorry this is happening 

I think we as a community need to prioritize bodily autonomy in our personal philosophies and praxis. and we need to be proselytizing on this to other trans ppl. in other words, we need build a culture of mind your own dam business.
I'm sorry the system is failing you. I want to validate your anger. I've also experienced fat phobia and can't get an appt for breast reduction until I'm at a bmi of 27, eventhough bmi is bullshit and I've had 2 back surgeries. We shouldn't have to fight to make these decisions for ourselves.
Hi Laeiryn, I'm not medically transitioning yet despite being 28 and having begun to feel comfortable gender questioning as a 20 year old. I've experienced medical gatekeeping too, also not related to my transition goals. 

The NHS told me despite a manual wheelchair not being appropriate for me, they won't fund for me to get an electric wheelchair (my Dad then privately bought me one plus ramps to get in/out my house). I can't live move that far without one. I also have an eating disorder history, and the NHS diagnosed me then didn't help because they expected my boyfriend to be an appropriate substitute for actually healthcare assistance with it. 

I only started putting things in motion with medical transitioning in the past few months because I was living with the boyfriend I was dependent on for my eating disorder for 5 years. He wouldn't let me break up with him, and he wouldn't tolerate me dressing in a transmasculine way at all (I didn't realise he was a transphobe until I was already living with him, as him seemed supportive to me for over a year before we moved in together). So I had to hide my ""trans-ness"" from him until a lgbt+ group helped me get confident enough to end things with him and get him to move out my home.
Hi! I have been there with medical fatphobia. I have a consultation for top surgery on Tuesday and I’m bracing myself for them to say no. I also am having a hard time finding images to share with the surgeon (if he allows me to have this procedure) because no one posts their images due to fatphobia. I echo the sentiments of another commenter — our community lacks intersectionality in this area and it sucks. Sending lots of love to you, OP!!!!!!!
I am sorry that where you are fails you as so many other places do. You are right, the access and ability is a privilege. Having that privilege makes whatever I say ineffective and maybe sounds insensitive to those that do not have it. I can only speak from my experience, so I guess I am not helpful.  

I hope for things to change for all within our community. I will continue to fight, go to organized protests and donate whenever I am not struggling paycheck to paycheck. I don't have much else to offer, apologies.
But also - you got onto T in the first place? Is it rude to ask how? Is my dilemma 99% just Medicaid desperately trying to shirk?  They won't even *give me a referral* to **start** the entire process of just getting the *intake and the counseling* until my BMI is under 35 (which for me is around 170 lbs - I'm pretty short). They sure as hell refuse to test my own natural hormone levels, much less give me prescription hormones - and ALL of this is something that can be done regardless of a person's weight (they just have to, i dunno, do their jobs and figure the maths they paid to learn in uni and figure out how much hormone a 205lb body needs instead of a 170lb one, it's extremely fucking possible). 

Escape to a land with real healthcare if you can!
Honestly, this aspect of my experience of medical neglect as a trans person is just a symptom of a truly insidious form of systematic discrimination (fatphobia), which is just rearing its head anywhere it can. 

But the part where people in the trans community (even literally right here on my post) are going ""wELL ACKSHULLY THEY'RE RIGHT"" is honestly way more hurtful. No, I don't need to be below a certain BMI for *referrals, intake screenings, or psych evals*, and it's pretty disgusting that anyone would advocate for that.
This wasn't intended as a honeypot for exactly the kind of asshole I'm talking about, yet fruitful it has been.
*you're not wrong*    hngggggk I'm almost 40 aren't I too old for this bullshit?
(ETA: usually they do, since it's a REALLY reasonable rx, but between the last individual being fucking terrible and the pandemic, i've been off meds for several years)

I've done that a few times; last round was an 18 month waiting list that got me an intake interview aaaaaand then the shrink refusing to give me anything at all, which is why I've been off my meds the whole time it wasn't being renewed (the interim while waiting after the previous one ran out) as well as since that particular instance of malpractice (over three years now, since that was right before the pandemic took off). I'm on another list now for the only other counselor at the center that medicaid will cover/transport me to, but they have the same file from the previous one and my hopes aren't high for getting any of the care I actually need.
That's just. Infuriating.
He couldn't tell me what policy or entity had such a requirement, and so may have been lying about it. Possibly just a patent transphobe, there's really no way to know. I start fresh every appointment with a different ""PCP"". Next appointment: only seven months left!
It's not rude to ask me. I am very open about things. I have the privilege of living in  blue state (Massachusetts) and was able to get my PCP as a doctor that is in the transgender medicine center. I used to be on Medicaid when I was more poor and qualified for it. Medicaid is accepted by this clinic. I can't speak for how other states and clinics accept medicaid because, unfortunately, it varies wildly. I just had to do a lot of research seeing who accepts it out of the best options for care that I found. A whole lot of googling endocrinologists, pcps and surgeons to check their experience and history with transfolx. 

My process was incredibly easy, and I did not have to push for anything. I registered myself as a patient with the PCP, when I went in he asked me about my history of transgender care was (none) and if I was doing anything like binding (I was) or anything else for my transition. He asked me about my expectations and goals, which is a very important  questions. Some people expect they can pick and choose side effects, expect to get big/small, expect a full beard etc. The truth is you can't expect anything of your transition like how any preteen can expect anything specific about their hormonal changes. He said my openness and lack of pointed expectations is really healthy and encouraging, so it made him feel very comfortable prescribing it to me and bumping the dose up whenever I want pending labs. He then put an order for labs, which makes sense and is required for most if not all medication additions or changes. I think sometimes people can have unrealistic expectations of transition that hurt.themselves and can delay their access to hormones if the provider thinks the patient is treating the prescription like a magic lamp. I am not saying this is your situation but I see many young transmen compare themselves to others and expect to have the same outcome/progress when the entirety of biology/genetics/hormone expression is not in our control and cannot be predicted. 


I would recommend you seek out a transgender friendly clinic be it planned parent hood or a well recommended transgender friendly provider. Ask them what they know about medicaid denials and obstacles for care. You could contact Medicaid to get a defined list of requirements that you must full fill in writing. I would also review what the WPATH guidelines are for meeting your care needs. 

If you aren't in the US then I apologize for the assumption. You would be best to reach out to local transgender community to see how people deal with your situation because you are not the only one that is affected. I am short as well and weigh considerably more than you, so it's pretty bs I get HRT and you don't.
Which is supremely, infuriatingly stupid given that BMI is such a particularly malignant metric that is not useful for much more than discrimination [[Source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/#sec-2title). I’m so sorry that this is your experience
I forgot to add that it was really important during the discussion with my doctor that I had been ""living as transgender for several years and binding"".
yeah man the supposed ""inability"" to treat us fucking deep fries my brain every time. so you're saying you suck at your job so much that you can't treat half of the population? the fuck do you have that license for?
The whole ""sleep apnea "" argument is stupid. There are tests and ways to work with it if that is present as an issue in the patient. The fact that trans healthcare access is vital to life means that I should be allowed to sign off, acknowledge the risk and accept responsibility for it so I can get the damn surgery. Otherwise, I am supposed to be trapped as I am with increasing depression and back problems? How is that ethical health care. People sign off that sort of risk for other lesser import surgeries. I had two sinus surgeries at this weight that were not a critical need and nowhere near the fraction of a single percent of importance as my top surgery need is. This is really some insurance gate keeping shit with medical professionals and queer people alike regurgitating it as an excuse to deny care. As an excuse to shut us down when we lament the denial of care we need. It keeps our gender affirming care in some pseudo elective category rather than as the vital life-saving category it deserves. 

I am willing to risk my life to get these breasts off more than my stupid sinus surgeries. My life is at risk not getting the care I need.
Listen I don’t think I’ll ever recover after my obgyn told me to lose 30lbs before I even opened my legs. 

Idk if I have 30lbs of vagina
That sucks big time. 

I remember telling the counselor that I'd discovered that alcohol masked my my feeling so stressed out that I couldn't concentrate on anything. 

I described getting buzzed at a party and how fantastic not feeling the stress malaise was.
  
 It took like 2 visits to get on the short wait list for the real psychiatrist and another 2 visits with him to get the buproprion script.   The implied alcoholism danger may have been an alert condition for them. 
Or maybe the wait times are always like 3 months out,  unless it's coming from a colleague. I got another story for that suspicion. 

I also won't ever ask for a particular drug. I may ask about a drug during the psychiatrist session, but I think actually asking may throw a flag.
Are you in an informed consent state? Planned parenthood is another place you can go to get on hormones.
I mean, I know there's a very real threshold over which full anesthesia is dangerous, but that's so separate from where I am right now (nowhere near surgeries?) that insisting it matters is so obnoxious T_T
Well, you would think it might be a risk, but when it's someone who has a 5 year history of being on it at that exact dose and almost 10 years of taking it total, and that person is going, ""Uh, yes, I'd like to not be deprived of the thing that it took a long ass time to figure out worked better than the other various options,"" usually they're pretty good about keeping you on a med that's working. Especially because, to anyone who knows anything about meds and drugs, that drug at that dose is supremely reasonable for a long-term Rx. That was honestly the first time the psych DIDN'T seem relieved that a low-grade drug was sufficient.
Wait times are shittier now post pandemic because the massive back log from all the delays/cancelations during the height of covid. Even my allergist appointment made me wait a year from when I made the appointment.
Mmmmm you know they're the only place that didn't misgender the fuck out of me when I went in for testing (get tested if you're active!) and they did accept medicaid at the time. I'll look into that, thank you!
Absolutely, and I'm not saying that fat folks don't have unique health considerations (just like skinny folks do), just that 1) Goodhart's Law (when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure) is a real social phenomenon and 2) The construction of the measure of BMI, being proportional to the square of a person's height (as opposed to something more sensible like the cube of a person's height, aligning it more with a notion of body volume) introduces a bias favoring taller people.
Rule of thumb for trans care, if they don't respect your identity don't waste your time with them. I'm sorry the quack was gatekeepering you. Maybe they can help with the bupropion too.
And one that favors certain ethnic backgrounds and a LOT of other factors, too. As a measuring tool, it's pretty useless."	12lvzp2	NonBinary	274	0.94	2023-04-14 12:42:52
Had an experience at the barber shop. It was awful, but then it wasn't.	"My context: I identify as agender/nonbinary and usually present neutrally. People tend to read me as female unless I make an effort to present in a very masculine way. I live in an area with a decent queer population but not a ton of trans awareness, so most people tend to read me as a butch lesbian without thinking gender identity might be relevant to my presentation. I'm usually ok with that, since I also identify with dyke culture to some degree and I'm the sort of agender person who finds it seriously ironic that not identifying with the concept of gender means I end up explaining gender to people all the time, so I don't mind just not having the conversation. But... you will understand that this is a compromise that can lead to uncomfortable situations.

I get my hair cut at a little local barbershop. Good barber shops are among my favorite things. This is a traditional shop in many ways: no hipster stuff, no brews on tap, no fancy styling, just a trained barber who gives me a solid $10 haircut that looks exactly like I want it to every time. But it's also not the kind of shop that has Playboy mags in the waiting area. I have always experienced it as a friendly space with good banter.

So, I'm in there a couple days ago for my usual shearing, and there is a group of several guys ahead of me all getting cuts, with two guys left in line. They're just having typical bro conversation and leaving me alone while I do introvert things on my phone and wait... until the last guy in line sits down for his cut. This guy starts going off about how much he hates... well, just about everything I value, actually. There are plenty of Trumpsters on the fringes of this city, so I'm used to hearing/ignoring a lot of this. But when he starts in on trans issues, saying things like ""there's just no moral decency left in the world any more"" and ""if you're a human, you can't just up and be an airplane"" and ""they're gonna try to get rid of real men and women and take over"" and ""it's Sodom and Gomorrah out there,"" I feel the blood starting to drain from my face, my heart rate rising, that floating feeling coming on... all that fun triggery stuff. 

He's leaving no room for anyone else to speak, and I wish I could jump in, but I don't feel safe--I'm surrounded by this dude's bro friends in a small shop without a whole lot of other people nearby. I assume this is not directed at me; he has probably read me as female, as most people do; he also hasn't said anything about gay issues, which would be less socially acceptable to rant about in this city, so I think he's just an oblivious asshole rather than a deliberate troll. I know that if I say anything, I'll out myself. I physically can't make myself speak. I feel myself trying to make my body small. I'm staring at the same text message on my phone unable to read the words, angry with him for thinking it's ok to blast like this and angry with myself for being unable to do anything but keep breathing. I finally get to the point where I think I should just leave. But I need a haircut, and I've waited a while, and I don't want to let this guy chase me out of my usual barber shop.

Finally, he pauses his rant long enough to ask the barber, ""Do you know what I mean, man?"" And the barber says, ""No, I really don't know what you mean. I don't agree with anything you just said. You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think your opinion is wrong. Hey, I'm done--do you want to look at the back?""

And the guy just stops talking, pays, and leaves with his whole group. 

I then get the reliable haircut I came for. There isn't as much bantering with the barber as there usually would be, since I'm still coming down from what just happened. Again, I feel I want to say something, but I can't. I have all these conflicting feelings. I would have liked for him to step in and stop the guy from going off like that before it happened, but that's not his job any more than it is mine. He has no clue I am trans any more than the random guy, so he probably thought those words weren't hurting anyone who was actually present. But they were, and I do wish he would have taken that extra step to make his shop feel safe for everyone. 

But on the other hand, the second he replied the way he did, I felt so incredibly relieved, like the weight just lifted. I don't care what a random asshole thinks. I do care that my barber doesn't agree with him, and I give him credit for saying so, and it did shut the guy up when he did--just a little late. I'm grateful to him and a little resentful towards him all at once, which of course makes me feel greedy for wanting just a little more than I got. He could have said nothing at all, and I would still be triggered, and I might have just walked out. But instead I feel safe again and I got my hair cut.

When it's time to pay, I tip well (as always), and I say, ""This is for today's haircut. The next time I come in, that will be for what you said to that guy."" He shakes my hand and smiles, and while you can never really know from a simple gesture like that, it feels to me like he understands more than just what I said. And I go about my day.

I don't think anyone in this situation did exactly the right thing, but I also think it's rarely possible to do exactly the right thing. All I know is that I got triggered, bigtime, but I walked out of that place with the same great no-drama masculine haircut I like, and I felt good again. Maybe even a little better than I had before, because I already knew there were transphobic assholes all over, but I didn't know that my barber isn't one of them. Now I do, and I can keep coming back to this shop even though I had a nasty experience there today. That feels like a small victory, even if it's not a pure and glorious one.

I'm not feeling like I need support over this; I'm just sharing an experience others might be able to identify with, and would welcome any ideas about how others handle situations like this."	"Oh, Lord...I live in cow country, REPUBLICAN RED NECK USA....I feel for you.

Especially if this is your first time having to hear someone spout this crap in public, as if it were normal.

I had culture shock *big time* when I moved here.

In my neck of the woods, the barber would have either just nodded and smiled, or actually agreed with the asshole.

I'm glad yours didn't!
I know it was incredibly uncomfortable for you, but I actually like the way the barber handled it - he let the guy go all the way out on his hateful gangplank, gave him all the rope he wanted, and then let him dangle the moment he sought affirmation for his hate. What a deeply unsatisfying moment that must have been for him! He spent all that time speechifying, rolling out his entire spiel, breathlessly exuding the whole nasty fart of his personal belief system on everyone in the room, then tries to throw up his arms at the finish line ... and gets completely shut down in front of absolutely everyone. Devastation! And he didn't get to enjoy starting an argument or making anyone engage with the many points of his foolishness. Nope. Just a whole bag of hot air, smacked flat right in his face.

Because of my own presentation throughout life, I've had far too many interactions with those jackasses and their stupid entitlement in any particular moment. Seeing them get shut down like this has become a treasured delight, especially because it's so rare. The only other thing I find more satisfying is the more complicated and time-consuming Socratic Method applied diligently, patiently, and unrelentingly to their BS. I'm generally too internally worked up to be the one to deliver these moments for myself, so my appreciation for others is already high, but even moreso when it's someone they thought of as a potential supporter of their inanity.

Again, I'm sorry that you were uncomfortable in that lengthily painful moment, rightfully but regrettably so, not knowing how this was going to play out. Regardless of how slapped down he felt at the end, the fact that you were made to suffer through that isn't right. All in all, I'm glad you found that a modicum of trust you'd extended had proven to be worthwhile, while regretful at how it was proven.
What a great story. Thank you for sharing!
Ok this made me happy cry a bit.  I'm so glad that your barber stood up to him even if it may not have been for your sake.  It shouldn't have to be because you or any other LGBT+ person is there.  I live in a somewhat liberal town surrounded by conservatives in all the surrounding areas and I have to be careful about how I present myself when I go certain places.  I hope things are changing for the better for all of us. 🤗
I am a straight male and have absolutely no way of sympathizing with the experience you had. I find trans culture both alluring and fascinating. You touched on it when writing it out but my feeling is that you should really analyze the feeling of the barber not saying/doing enough. He is a person too and you said it yourself he isn't obligated to be the guy who tells the jerk in the chair what for, I would have but that isn't how it always works. I'm touched by this story and I want you to know there are people out here who love and appreciate you FOR YOU. It isn't always about how you wish people would act towards you and be accepting towards you its in my opinion more about cherishing the people who normalize trans issues. Who will say the things that barber said without a second thought. You are an extension of all of us and we MUST treat trans people just as they are; our sisters and our brothers. 

Love you, thanks for sharing your story. Best wishes :)
I think the end of your story touches on what a cis Irish drag queen who campaigned for marriage equality said.

Prior to the referendum, if someone made an off colour remark, he felt alone as a gay man, say, at the bus stop. He felt like the asshole, that nobody likes.

Now that the country has voted for eqiality, if someone says something, he knows that the rest of the country accepts him and disagrees. Bigots will still be bigots, but they can only be openly bigoted if everyone else goes along with it. When they are called out, they keep it to themselves next time.

What your Barber did didn't help you in this situation. It did help to stop the bigot next time, so props to him. Baby steps get us all the way, just slowly.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Thank you for sharing your story. Also, you’re a really strong writer. Do you write professionally? (Cheers to no-drama, masculine haircuts. I love my velvety buzzcut.)
Thanks. It's not the first time, as I grew up in redneck cow country, but it's the first time since trans issues hit the mainstream as a topic of conversation, and the first time since my trans egg cracked. I have lived in the warm, safe bubble of probably the queer/trans-friendliest area in the world for the past several years, and the move to my current city has been worth it but still hard. 

I have heard everything he said before--in fact, it was all so familiar that I'm pretty sure he got his talking points from the Internet--but not out loud, in public, in person, and in my face, at least not since I have understood that those words were about me. It felt so different from seeing those same things online, when I am safely far away from the person who wrote them and can easily retreat to a safer community like this one.

Side note: I'm usually afraid to post to Reddit, as I have had the usual ""Experiences(TM)"" with that in the past. This is actually my first day on r/nonbinary. I just didn't know it existed before now. I'm glad I found you all here!
Thank you so much for every sentence of this reply.

I like what the barber did too, even more after having talked about the situation with some other locals who have lived here longer than I have. It's worth noting also that this guy's friends were clearly not on the same page, but were saying nothing. I would be willing to bet that what the barber said led to a conversation after they left, and at least one of those guys might have felt empowered to disagree when he might not have without that little seed of ""nope"" being planted. That's powerful stuff.

I too long for the Socratic Method takedown. That's what I aim for when I meet people in safe environments whom I believe can be reasoned with. This simply did not feel like one of those instances, but of course I fantasize that if I were a perfect person, I could have created the opportunity for that. 

The situation as it played out did remind me of how important it is to emphasize to my straight/cis friends who are allies that their voices matter too--and we need them so much, because we can't always be the standard bearers for things that matter to us, and because some people simply won't listen to us because of who we are, but might listen to them. A couple of this guy's friends were giving him disapproving looks the whole time he was ranting; if just one of them had given him a little verbal pushback, I think it might have shut him down. He wasn't exactly showing any evidence that he had thought through his opinions; people like that tend to respond to peer pressure, in my experience.

Your point about your own presentation leading to these experiences made me think. I just started testosterone, and I think this experience hit me harder because I realized that I am about to surrender the privilege of being invisible in situations like this one. I'm not interested in passing as male, so starting a few months from now, I will probably register as ""other"" to this guy and people like him for the rest of my life. That's where I feel most comfortable within myself, but I won't deny that it hurts to give up the small bit of privilege I have enjoyed by passing as female when that has been convenient for the past 30 years. I won't lie: I am a little afraid of how the world will react to this change. But I am so certain that it is right for me that I don't really care. Bring on the next challenge and I'll do my best with it as exactly who I am.
Also, it's nice to think about how he likely didn't get the nice haircut - he got an angry haircut.
I think things are changing for the better, all in all, in the long-term sense. People are self-segregating ideologically in ways that make me worry, but I still truly believe that the march of history is with us. It sounds like we are in similar places right now; I wish you luck and strength. I know I need it!
I appreciate the way you chose your words, for starters, and want to add my two cents. 

We can agree that the barber handled the situation still. I think it's also fine to feel like you want more out of an interaction without necessarily placing blame on anyone for not bringing that. When we feel threatened I think it's only reasonable to wish people could stand up for us. I'm very familiar with the simultaneous gratitude and feeling it's nor enough in this situation that the op describes. I don't consider it a reflection on anyone else so much as an observation that their good reaction doesn't fully solve the problem. It's a recognition that someone else has a lot more power in that situation that they chose not to use, for any number of good reasons we aren't privy to, but not a judgment necessarily. 
Thank you for your reply. I appreciate it! I responded to neurophilos' reply to your comment in a way that was mostly intended for you, if you are interested.
I agree! And that's a great anecdote/reference to keep on file. Thank you.
Actually, I have never heard of /r/nonbinary...I have no idea how your post made it to my front page. 

But I'm glad it did, if I was in any way able to help.
Thank you for replying in a helpful way before I came back to this comment.

For the person you replied to: I do appreciate your thoughts, truly. It's worth stating that I recently moved to this area from a place where the kind of ranting this guy was doing would have been shut down immediately by SOMEONE in the room. It was a bubble, and the experiences I enjoyed there that played out like that were not the kind of thing that trans people experience in 99% of the world. We got to enjoy a certain kind of privilege and safety that trans people almost never get, and it's unreasonable to expect that of the rest of the world as it is. I know this. But it was also a beautiful thing to feel normal and supported there, and it's very hard to adjust to a more typical environment, with less awareness of trans issues, and less of a default consensus that trans people should be accepted and it's not cool to go off the way he did.

I do think the way the barber responded was a big deal, and I am happy it went down that way. He could have taken the easy route and simply given a noncommittal ""yeah"" when asked ""do you know what I mean?"" That implicit confirmation means something, although people give it all the time when they don't really agree without realizing that failing to challenge bigotry only emboldens it. That's what I expected him to say, just to avoid confrontation, and I wouldn't have blamed him. That's why what he actually said gave me such relief. But... I have lived in a place where this guy's rant never would have gotten to that point at all, and that was undeniably better and safer for me as a trans person. So there is an adjustment that comes with moving to a less accepting environment, and the disappointment I felt was part of that, as was the guilt for feeling that disappointment at all. 

I am willing to take the discomfort and the occasional triggers that result from living here in exchange for the other reasons I have for being here, and I feel that in a way my presence here is more important than it was in the more accepting place I lived before, if only because I can be the person to shake the barber's hand and tell him that what he said mattered, and if I had not been there, maybe nobody would have been able to give that feedback. 
No, I totally understand where you are coming from. I agree whole-heartedly that your presence in that environment is absolutely a benefit to those who don't have the same ideologies as unempathetic meatheads. What is so interesting to me is the unwavering abhorrence to anything different from what we the 40's and 50's taught us. A bullshit; unrealistic ideal of what community, family, love, and happiness is. I wish the best for you just as easily as I would wish the best for a family member. Hate is a lack of empathy and humanism. I identify as straight, and I lean that way 85% of the time but I'll be damned if I don't see a trans person and say ""fuck yeah, they have got it going on."" That's what makes humans so funny, we cling on to conformity so much that we often times rob ourselves of new experiences, some that very well could be more meaningful than the ones we planned. 

As always, with love

I finally got this flag for my room. My mom asked me what it was about and seemed to understand it when i explained it which made me happy		"How did you explain it? Because for some reason my family does not understand it, no matter what I say and wont accept me as non-binary.
So cool !it is really big :)  
I am actually considering getting one for myself too one day !
I've been wanting to get one, but with skull and crossbones on it, a combination of the enby flag and a jolly roger
Not sure if this is how you did it but i said ""Non binary means that you dont identify as strictly male or strictly female. Its a gender neutral term and people who identify as this usually want to appear androgynous""

On it / its / itself pronouns.	"I saw some questions about this in another subreddit and thought I'd take my comment and expand on it here for anyone who is curious about this.  Note that these are my personal feelings on using ""it"" pronouns, and other peoples' opinions may differ.

**""It / its / itself"" is only for non-living objects, right?**

Not necessarily.  Most animals are referred to as ""it"" in every day speech - even animals that are sentient, self-aware, and can even communicate (such as parrots or monkeys).  Plants are also referred to as ""it"", even though they are alive.  Furthermore, in ancient texts such as the Bible, angels, demons, and talking animals (such as The Four Living Creatures) are also often referred to as ""it"", despite being unquestionably alive and sentient.

Further, this argument bears resemblance to ""he is only for boys"" and ""she is only for girls"" - language is always changing and does not remain static.  Plus, pronouns are special in that they can be used for many types of people; plenty of nonbinary people use gendered pronouns.

This argument also bears resemblance to ""they is only for multiple people"".  Not only has this been incorrect for a long time (just like ""'it' is only for inanimate objects"" has been incorrect for a long time), even if it *was* a correct sentiment, words can change.  Language is not concrete - it is always evolving and adapting to new changes in society.

**Isn't ""it"" demeaning and dehumanizing?**

Not for me.  I see people refer to animals and plants as ""it"" - the Earth and planets as ""it"" - the universe as ""it"".  She/he/they are ""for humans"", but why?  Is the line dividing animals, nature, and humans that strict?  I like the idea of being another entity in the world - not above or below other things, but with them.  ""It"" makes me feel closer to nature in a gender-neutral way.

Yes, objects are referred to as ""it"", but many other things are too, particularly in mythology.  [Here is an example](https://books.google.com/books?id=8QZLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=%22it+spoke%22+myth&source=bl&ots=7FoCz75Bg3&sig=ACfU3U1Ry7LY2JlGR585Q4nqq2fAV2iZWw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0ttXqmcPgAhVxUd8KHWLgBqYQ6AEwB3oECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22it%20spoke%22%20myth&f=false) of a Scandinavian myth in which Odin and Loki encounter a ""human-headed eagle"".  *""Give me my share of the feast,"" it said, ""and the meat shall presently be done"".*  The creature is alive, sentient, and shares the appearance of a human - but it is referred to as ""it"" to indicate a lack of gender.  To me, that sentence sounds natural still - the creature is undoubtedly alive and important and real, but simply genderless and another entity in the world.

**Even if you don't think it's dehumanizing, most people do.**

Maybe.  But most people don't think there are more than 2 genders.  That doesn't mean that they are correct, or that people should live their lives according to what most people think and do.  

Pronouns are a personal choice intrinsic to you and you alone.  Many men would never want to be called ""she"" - it feels wrong to them, it removes the legitimacy of their identity in their eyes.  That doesn't mean that someone else can't use ""she"", and it doesn't mean that ""she"" is a bad, dehumanizing pronoun.  Pronouns are about what you want to be called, and how you see yourself.  If you don't see your pronouns as dehumanizing, then they are not dehumanizing for you.

**Couldn't you just use ""they""?**

Yes.  It doesn't feel as right to me, though.  Personally, ""they"" always struck me as too ambiguous, not concrete enough.  To me, ""they"" seems more like you're referring to an abstract concept or placeholder (""one should always make sure they wash the dishes after eating"") or someone you don't really know (""I met someone today."" ""Oh, who are they?"").  Personally, to me, it's too general - I like ""it"" because it's concrete and definite - you are talking about something specific.  And as I explained above, ""it"" does not feel demeaning or dehumanizing to me.  I am a human still, I am alive and my thoughts are real, regardless of the pronouns used for me.

**But ""it"" has been used to dehumanize trans people.**

This is true, and it's horrible.  I myself have actually been subject to the derogatory use of ""it"" to indicate non-humanness in the past - it surprised me when I realized I don't mind it now, even though I did back then.  It's important to remember that *all* pronouns have been used to dehumanize and delegitimize trans people.  Calling a trans woman ""he"" is belittling, horrible, and delegitimizing.  However, ""he"" is still a valid pronoun to use if it suits you, because it is not the pronoun itself that is bad, but the way the person is using it and the intentions they are using it with.

**You can't expect people to call you ""it"", and you shouldn't call other people ""it"".**

I would never, ever call someone ""it"" unless they specifically requested it.  Similarly, I understand that very few, if any, people will call me ""it"".  What other people do and think, however, does not invalidate what I feel and what I think my truth is.  The point is not for everyone to respect my pronouns - although that would be nice - but for me to understand who I am and what feels right to me.

I'd also like to say that **I do understand that this word can be hurtful** to many NB and trans people; I don't really ask people to call me these pronouns because I understand the connotations that many people have.  I liken it to the word ""queer"" - many people hate it because they were called that in the past, but many people identify with it because they find the word freeing and accurate to who they are.  I find this set of pronouns accurate to who I am, and while I'd like people to accept and use them, I accept other pronouns because it makes so many uncomfortable."	"I’m sorry you were banned for speaking on *your* pronouns that *you* feel comfortable with using for *you*. That’s ridiculous. 
I find this interesting since I've never seen anyone explain why they use it pronouns, but I do find some of your points a bit strange! 'It' is not for inanimate things, it's for non-human things? And most people use he/she/they pronouns for their pets or other non-random animals precisely because they personify them to some degree. I would find it really weird if someone called their own dog an it. But that might just be my culture. 

Of course, I'm cool with language evolving when people need/want it to. But I think it's a difficult one because 'it' can be so genuinely triggering to trabs/nb/gnc folk so it will probably be a long time before many people feel comfortable using it, even for other people. I've been called an it before and yeah..... it stung. I think it's pretty common, sadly. 

How do you feel about your pronouns potentially making other people uncomfortable because of their own bad experiences? 
I have a hard time with it/its pronouns myself but I find it absolutely outrageous that you would be banned for speaking sincerely on *your own* preferred pronouns for *yourself*.  That's just...wild.
I also like 'it' as a pronoun, but it makes most people uncomfortable and 'they' is just as good to me, so I just tell people to use 'they'. I might even like 'it' more if it caught on more, but I feel I can't use it because people will find it too weird.

I think the only reason 'it' seems dehumanizing is because we're so used to the gender binary that to most people, to imply something has no gender is to imply it's not human.

We've adapted 'singular they' instead of 'it'. Singular they works well because it doesn't have the dehumanizing connotation that 'it' does. But before 'they' started being used for non-binary people, it was used in cases where the subject was hypothetical like ""If someone comes to the door, tell *them* we're closed and *they* can come back on Monday."" or when the gender of the subject is unknown, like ""I did not reply to *their* message right away because *they* sent it at 4 in the morning.""

This makes it sometimes feel to me like using 'they' is implying the person's gender is unknown, but my gender is known\*. 

I don't see why 'they' is better than 'it', and if your post to /r/genderqueer was the same as here, I don't understand why you were banned.

\*^(actually I'm still a little unsure about it but that's a discussion for another time)

&#x200B;
I find it disgusting that you were banned for speaking about your pronouns. I would also like to add another point in favour of it/its pronouns:   


**Not all languages have an equivalent to they/them pronouns.**  


Some people use it/its pronouns in the other language(s) they speak and especially if that language is their native, it makes sense that they might prefer the direct translation since that is what they are accustomed to and that is the way they view themselves.
We're opening this thread back up for regular discussion. A couple things:

1. In its behavior with users and r/nonbinary mods, greyrust has given us no reason to believe its actions have been in bad faith. We do not interpret greyrust's OP nor its subsequent behavior here as calling for brigading or instituting a witch hunt. 

2. It's normal to want to vent if you believe you've been treated unfairly and normal to want to sympathize if you agree with the person venting. However, in some comments below, a mod from r/genderqueer says that r/genderqueer's modbox has been getting hatemail. If true, this isn't an appropriate response. Neither is brigading. Either of those things will get you banned from r/nonbinary. 

3. The topic of this post is definitely controversial. The actual discussion content of this thread has been, in my opinion, really thoughtful. Thanks to all you who participated. 

Edit:

javatimes said this below, but since this comment is sticked I'll place it here as well: ""[We] ask that all parties refrain from continuing arguments.""
I've been pronoun agnostic for a while with minor aversion to it/its and this post is persuading me to include that in my ""any pronouns"". I know several people that use it/its for themselves but all of them include it in a multiple-pronouns-are-equally-OK deal and I admit that I usually default to one of their other options. I should revisit why I do that. 

Super disappointed about the controversy over this very reasonable post. 

To elaborate a little 

I think the most novel and convincing part of this discussion for me is the bit about ""ambiguous subject"" vs ""known subject"". That's sort of the reverse of why i *don't* use ""enby""-- i find that word is too concrete for a variable and fluid experience in many cases. It gets used in a way that looks like a stand-in for ""Third Gender"". So I choose the less-personified ""nonbinary"" and usually only as an adjective. It's interesting how not only gender connotations but ""specificity"" is at play in choosing what words are appropriate for us.

This is a really cool post and I appreciate you taking the time to write it! I feel like I understand much better why some people actually like “it” as a personal pronoun. 

I especially loved reading your point about nature and human beings not actually being separate, and that “it” as a personal pronoun can communicate that concept of universality amongst living things. 

I feel that same way about “they” as my pronoun—on the one hand, it’s most comfortable for me personally, but on the other hand it also resonates with my view that people of different genders are not actually that different, and language that keeps us strictly categorized prevents us from seeing each other as members of one human in-group. 

Thanks again for sharing!
Why would this be banned? Even if someone doesn’t agree, you have a well-thought-out opinion on this that deserves to be heard and respected.
Huh.  This is a really great post. I use they/them for exactly the reason you don't: I love that it's vague and amorphous and says very little about me. And now that you phrase it/its as the other side to the same coin, I feel so much more comfortable using it/its for other people. I don't think it's for me, but I *get it* now. 

I also love the very radical aspect of using it/its to help break down the divide between humans and the rest of the planet. I use genderqueer for similar reasons that are equally personal and political. 

Thanks for posting this! (Unexpectedly, this also takes some of the sting out of the times I've been referred to as it with an intent to harm. Basically having another way to frame it/its pronouns makes it hurt less.)
r/linguistics

Hi, what is your first language?

My first language has only one word for she/he/they(singular)/it.
I also found this interesting since, like others here, I haven't seen anyone explain their preference for it pronouns in such detail. I especially connected to the bit about  being another entity in the world - not above or below other things, but with them. I still don't know if I'd use it pronouns for myself (maybe one day after some thought, who knows?), but they're valid if they make you comfortable! That's definitely ridiculous you were banned for talking about your own pronouns, wtf. 
The [dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/it) seems to agree with your use of it

> a person or animal whose sex is unknown or disregarded
~~Well honestly I'm glad that mod commented because I know I should unsubscribe from r/genderqueer now.~~

It pronouns are still weird for me, because I get that pang of ""I'm saying something bad!"" In my chest. That feeling doesn't seem to get overridden by the fact that 'it"" is how you *want* to be referred to. Maybe it's because these pronouns are so uncommon?
kind of sad that i missed out on reading the original post,

is there any way i could see the text of it?
I know this post is ancient, but to me this post was very enlightening! I've been struggling with finding my own identity and what it is I am comfortable with. Whilst thinking about this for the 100th time I suddenly had the revelation of it/its, decided to look it up to see if it was a thing, and therefore stumbled upon this post.

Thanks to you, I have finally gotten a satisfying answer to a problem I've had my entire life, thank you!
THIS!!! THIS SO SO SO MUCH!

Edit:  
ADKFVALFW I just realized I'm very late but still!  
This applies and is absolutely the base of my reasoning.

Apart from that, I also know many people around me think of me as a respectable person, so when I tell them I use it/its pronouns, I hope they have a moment of realization, and/or gain just a little more respect for beings labelled ""it"" simply by connotation :)
Outsider of the community, would the correct thing to put in the bio not be ""it/it""? she/her, she talks, I talk with her, he/him, he talks, I talk with him, it talks, I talk with it. Just grammatically, it would not make sense to write ""it/its"" would it?
I think it is very insensitive and discriminatory to compare people who identify as ""it"" to animals. When some one says ""my pronouns are it/its,"" do you think you yourself, ""They are just like animals."" What you are essentially doing here is looking at a *human* and saying that they are nothing more than a dirty rat. And what if the person were African-American? Why do you think that black people are animals?
The comments are getting closed for now. If they are reopened, I ask that all parties refrain from continuing arguments.
I would rebut that your argument against “they” pronouns is equally as baseless as you argue the common stance against “it” pronouns to be. 

If language is always changing, and *many many people verifiably prefer they/them pronouns,* then to say it’s wrong because “they” refers to an ambiguous entity is just as prescriptivist as “it pronouns are always wrong because it usually refers to things in generic or which are considered low on the animacy hierarchy of our language.”

Source: Linguist, wrote my final paper on the origins and validity of singular “they”. 
Question: would saying 'it' cause ambiguity? Like, the word 'it' can also be used to refer to ideas or subjects which could cause ambiguity. 

Imagine if you're talking about a non-binary person building a DIY bookshelf.  
""It's probably a good idea for it to double-check its measurements before cutting it. It might not end itself up with the right length if it doesn't have its proportions right.""

This could cause ambiguity and confusion, right? Not tryna sound offensive or dehumanizing, it's just a legit question.
>**Even if you don't think it's dehumanizing, most people do.**
>
>Maybe. But most people don't think there are more than 2 genders. That doesn't mean that they are correct, or that people should live their lives according to what most people think and do. 

Humans are also a highly social species, and the social aspects of not only language, but one's own psychology, doesn't really work that way.

>Pronouns are a personal choice intrinsic to you and you alone. 

Not really. That's not the purpose of pronouns in any given language. The city of Toledo, Ohio, has no choice in how one refers to her, and under certain animistic beliefs, she's not only just as sentient as you or I or even the cows on the old dairy farm where my step-by-step grew up, but the nature of her existence makes her of either Sapient (human-like) or Supersapient intelligence. I don't refer to that city as ""she,"" for her sake, but both to convey to my audience a broadly-accurate idea of how I relate to her (after establishing she's the subject of my statement), and also so that I don't have to instead type out:

>*The city of Toledo, Ohio, has no choice in how one refers to the city of Toledo, Ohio, and under certain animistic beliefs, the city of Toledo, Ohio, is not only just as sentient as you or I or even the cows on the old dairy farm where my step-by-step grew up, but the nature of the city of Toledo, Ohio's, existence makes the city of Toledo, Ohio, of either Sapient (human-like) or Supersapient intelligence. I don't refer to that city as ""she,"" for the sake of city of Toledo, Ohio's intelligence, but both to convey to my audience a broadly-accurate idea of how I relate to the city of Toledo, Ohio (after establishing the city of Toledo, Ohio, as the subject of my statement), and also so I won't have to type out or speak ""the city of Toledo, Ohio,"" over-and-over-again, like I just did.*

The reason that interpersonal pronoun preferences are usually honoured by others is cultural: Anglophonic society —especially in the United States— has an especial reverence for the individual, even, if not moreso, as a cultural concept (which, even under the principles of Chaos magic, doesn't even have true sentience, much less Sapience) than necessarily *just* individual human beings. This cultural reality thus illustrates further issues with ""it"" being applied to individual humans with established or forming personalities (as there's an arguably antiquated habit of referring to infants and toddlers as ""it,"" but this habit gradually phased out when Western rates of infant mortality began to plummet, with the introduction of vaccination to replace immunisation):

When one EFL human refers to another as ""it,"" in English, this is typically a slur. It's an act of verbal violence —typically motivated by racism or transphobia— that is being committed to deny the target any basic dignity of individual personhood. When such is one's individual preference, that's an action typically coming from an unconscious train of thought that removes oneself from an experience of individual personhood.

A living language may grow and evolve with use, but it's FAR more nuanced and happening from the psychology of a particular society —not merely the preference of an individual member of that society— than you're willing to acknowledge. Your understanding of how languages, and their social constructions work is simplistic to the point of absurd. 

Language is the penultimate social construct, and it exists for such fundamentally social purposes, that to ignore that completely, in favour of ***a language's any one individual speaker, and that person's preference in how others speak of oneself,*** to the point that one refers to such a preference as being ""intrinsic"" to one's sense of personhood, is so patently nonsensical that it directly contradicts *literally everything* that you said in your post!

This isn't even taking into account the fact that many languages have a linguistic gender. Furthermore, within that group, there are many languages that also have no separate word between an equivalent for the English ""she"" or ""he,"" and the definite article (such as the pronouns of ""it"" and ""that"") for words that are linguistically ""feminine"" or ""masculine,"" respectively. If I were to have a conversation *about you* with someone who, like myself, speaks Welsh —which in ""ef"" has no distinction between between the English ""he"" and the English ""it"" for a linguistically masculine article, and in ""hi"" lacks any distinction between the English ""she"" and ""it"" for when speaking of a linguistically feminine article— which form of ""it"" do you want my hypothetical companion and I to refer to you with? As **you clearly don't speak anything but English,** it's also not your place to put in your own 2¢ on how other languages — *especially* not historically and *actively colonised and marginalised* languages— ought to grow and evolve. 

Sorry, but without an adequate alternative gender-neutral pronoun option from *actual speakers of Welsh,* those are your choices in how you'd prefer those seeking to honour your preferences, **but** who are *speaking about you* in a language that is neither one you speak, nor one that distinguishes between ""he or it"" or ""she or it"" —are you to be ""ef"" or ""hi""? If neither are acceptable to you, and assuming that actual speakers of Welsh (which clearly doesn't include yourself) haven't devised an alternative to your liking, then that ultimately proves that **the only thing that pronouns are ""intrinsic"" to, is the language that they're a part of.** That's how literally all languages work —and they're each far bigger than any individual speaker.

While the existence of languages that both a) have linguistic genders, and b) don't distinguish between (for example) a human who is generally referred to by an equivalent to the English ""she"" versus a non-human definite ""feminine article,"" that would typically be translated to the English ""it,"" *does* support your apparent argument that... 

>>""distinct pronouns for human versus non-human life is a social construct, thus one *should* honour the preference of those who prefer to be referred to as 'it',"" 

...well, this **also** means that... 

>>""distinct pronouns for human versus non-human life is a social construct, meaning that the nuanced social implications of languages that *do* typically distinguish between 'he/she' and 'it,' carry **a social statement about personhood and individuality that extends beyond the preferences of any one individual speaker of that particular language,** as much as *lacking that distinction* between 'she/he' and 'it,' carries a nuance about the culture and society that coexists with that language, which likewise extends beyond the preferences of any individual speaker of that particular language.""

To so staunchly fight against the fundamentally social nuance of English —or any other language— as your post advocates doing, is —to pick up on the nuanced meaning of a word— *intrinsically anti-social,* which suggests a psychological origin to your preference to be called ""it.""
Head mod of /r/genderqueer here. OP wasn't banned because of their pronouns, OP was banned for making a post that looked like the sort of troll posts we get on /r/genderqueer fairly regularly, and behaving similarly, so our mod in question took them for just another troll.

Instead of appealing their ban, OP then went to two other non-binary subreddits to complain about it and stir up more trouble, leaving both up for several hours before PMing me to override our mod's ban.

I'm currently looking into the issue and am waiting to see how OP will respond before making a decision on the matter.

**It's not about the pronouns, it's about the behavior.**

-----

**Edit:** Alright, here's how this looks on our end:

We attract a fair amount of trolls who do things like post things they know will be inflammatory, just to cause a ruckus. It's a form of trolling called 'Just Asking Questions' or 'Sealioning.'

How it works is they go in, post something that looks legit, but they know will be inflammatory, and then go start an argument in the comments. Then, when they get banned for it, or when anyone gives them any grief about it, they throw their hands up and say 'hey, I was just asking questions!' or 'it's just my opinion!'

And then their target looks bad because it looks like you've banned them for their opinion, and they can run to other subreddits and be like 'I totally had a legit question and they banned me for it! Those people are scum!'

(This is a favorite tactic of online trolls; you can see it in action several times a week on /r/subredditcancer, for example.)

So what happened here is the poster got their post flagged by AutoMod because they have no posting history on our sub and little posting history in general. They looked like a JAQ troll, so our mod banned them.

OP then messaged our modmail, insulting our community, and asking why they were banned. Our mod explained why they were banned, and OP didn't like that. OP sent back another insult, exactly as any troll would do, and our mod muted them for it.

OP then ran off into two other subreddits and tried to get a witch hunt going. Again, trying to damage our community. They lied about our mods, saying we had banned them over their pronouns, which is utterly ridiculous; we would *never* ban someone over their pronouns.

But we *do* ban people over poor behavior. We've told OP that, but it isn't listening. I've offered to lift the ban and chalk it up to miscommunication, but OP doesn't want that, either.

I went to check out this issue for the OP, at their request, and I explained exactly what the previous mod did. 'Hey, your post looks like a troll post, we get these things kinda often, so it's possible that your post got pulled by mistake.' OP didn't want to hear that, and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say, preferring to insult me and continue to slander our community for trying to help sort this out for them.

I've asked it to stop attacking our community and agree to follow our subreddit's rules in the future, which is a reasonable request, but it refuses to even do that.

I've offered this user a second chance several times, but every time I extend an olive branch, it swats my hand away. Apparently, it doesn't want to resolve this, it looks like it just wants a target to be angry at because hey, everyone loves a good witch-hunt, right?

So when OP cools off, and after I've had some sleep, then I'll try messaging them again and see if we can sort this out peacefully.

But until then, we're not going to sit around and wait on someone who has insulted our community, lied about our mods, lied to our community members, successfully created a witch hunt on two separate communities, gone out of their way to hurt other people, broken the rules of three different subreddits, and broken the site wide rules.

We would *never* ban someone over their pronouns. That is utterly ridiculous. But we *do* ban people who are disrespectful, antagonistic, and who break the rules.

I don't want to have to bother the admins about this, because I know *exactly* what they will do if I do, and that won't really help anyone. But if folks keep attacking our community, messaging our modmail, sending nastygrams to our mods, and continuing to propagate this witch hunt, then I will have to get the admins involved.

I also use ‘they’ as a secondary choice because it’s hard enough telling people I’m non-binary and want them to use neutral pronouns without having to give a grammar/vocab lesson and explain a set of neopronouns they’ve never heard of.

I think a couple years ago I was more uncomfortable with the idea of being an ‘it’, but nowadays as long as it was coming from a place of someone recognizing my gender and respecting that I’m not a he or she, I’d be ok. I think I would be really upset if someone used ‘it’ in a negative way, but that could happen no matter what pronouns I use and the kind of person willing to demean me like that over gender isn’t going to be respectful whatever I say.
That's a valid point too. 

My language (Norwegian) hasn't had an equivalent for a long time. There's one that's now starting to be used, but it's rare to see, and the time I used it in a text, it was labeled a typo... 

Most people use ""he"" for unknown gender for some reason, along with ""it"" (but ""he"" is still more common) 
>""It / its / itself"" is only for non-living objects, right?  
>  
>Not necessarily.  Most animals are referred to as ""it"" in every day speech - even animals that are sentient, self-aware, and can even communicate (such as parrots or monkeys).  Plants are also referred to as ""it"", even though they are alive.  Furthermore, in ancient texts such as the Bible, angels, demons, and talking animals (such as The Four Living Creatures) are also often referred to as ""it"", despite being unquestionably alive and sentient.

We do not go ahead and check the animals gender to have a conversation about IT
I think it's definitely the jerk-reaction of those specific pronouns, I think.  It makes sense because when you view something as an insult, you'll still get that ""flinch"" moment when someone says it, even if everyone's okay with it.  Just the culture, I think!
This is the original post, I had just copied / pasted it across two different subs.  Unless you mean you can't see this post's contents?
she/her includes a possessive form too, since ""her"" has 2 meanings

some people write all 3 ""they/them/their(s),"" etc., but more often than not it's just shortened to they/them, she/her, he/him

since ""it"" would be the same thing for the first 2, i think they just skip to the possessive form when listing the pronoun since ""it/it"" would be redundant and pointless in comparison to putting its

^(not commenting in support of ""it"" pronouns, but i stumbled upon this post and just wanted to respond to this comment since nobody else has lol)
I'm definitely not saying that ""they"" is wrong to use at all - I just personally don't prefer them for the reasons I wrote above.  Those are just my personal perceptions of the word when it's used to refer to me.
I'm just here to say that OP is not the first nb person I've talked to who uses ""it"" pronouns - it's rare but not unheard of, and isn't just trolling.

Fair enough, I can see that argument! I do feel like it's still using a bit of a different working definition for the pronoun to most people though, so it is sort of asking them to redefine the word. I just associate 'it' so much with non-thinking, non-feeling things. Biblical references to angels don't feel super relevant to daily usage (and indeed sound like a literary effect to say they are beyond human comprehension). I guess we do use it for babies too, but usually when they're still at a point where they lack identity. 

I'm curious, does anyone use 'it' pronouns for you IRL? Not to suggest that affects legitimacy either way of course, I'm just wondering what your experiences are like getting other people to actually use them. 
> Ultimately, I think it’s a bit strange that someone would be hurt or offended by someone calling themself something.

I wanted to sit with this for a second because it’s actually a pretty common thing in my own experience as someone with a learning disorder as well as in the mental illness community. It is actually very hurtful to hear someone using language like “oh I’m so bipolar,” “oops I’m retarded” etc. The difference to me is that the usage that is offensive is clearly glib and insincere. It seems clear from the interactions in this thread that you’re running into problems with people assuming that your usage is one of these insincere ones, but I don’t see any reason to doubt your sincerity personally. It sucks that the climate for these conversations is so volatile and vulnerable now that having unusual pronouns gets you pumped in with the “attack helicopter” crowd.
Yeah, I definitely think that's it. It's like when people reclaim slurs. If I hear them I get alarm bells, but then it's like ""oh wait no he's allowed to say it"" lol
yeah, i can see the title, but the actual post just says \[removed\].

Wow. OP, your anger is totally justified. And the mods calling your behavior problematic just seems like gaslighting to me. Anyone would feel hurt and upset to get a post about their pronouns removed in an nb sub, it's invalidating, and there's nothing at all wrong with letting other nb subs know. It's not ""stirring the pot,"" this is absolutely ridiculous. Seems like a toxic community to me too.
I went to go find the messages you sent our modmail. Your messages are both accusatory and insulting. You have *repeatedly* insulted our community and our modteam, even while I've been spending my time, trying to help you, and you only sought my help *after* you had already gone to two other communities to try and stir up a witch-hunt against our sub and our mods.

I've asked you directly if you would agree to adhere to our rules in the future so I can unban you, and you refused, preferring instead to continue to insult me and our community.

So on my end, I'm trying to help you, you refuse to be helped, have refused multiple times to even agree to follow our rules, keep right on insulting our community, and seem happy to keep right on causing trouble.

[deleted]
Ah, yes, that makes sense - I also get irritated when people say things like that.  I think the main difference is that those kinds of people are using it as a description - they think ""bipolar"" is just ""moody"", ""depressed"" is ""sad"", ""OCD"" is ""kinda neurotic sometimes"", etc. and use it as a description for their behavior or mood at the time.

However, someone who calls themself something as a form of identity is different, I think.  You can't really self-identify into a mental disorder, but you can see this sometimes within the trans and NB community, where sometimes an NB person will identify as trans, and sometimes they won't.  However, if a person who was cis said ""I'm acting so trans right now"" when they wore gender non-conforming clothes, that'd be offensive because they're using it as a descriptor rather than an identity.
That's too bad!  I sent the mods a PM.  Meanwhile, [here is a Google Document of it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nen90xySORr-n8Tx5oOmOS7g2xHz9j-5yKsMAarBHZg/edit?usp=sharing).

You keep characterizing OP's venting as attacks... I just don't see it that way and it's clear that several others don't either. Why does OP need to agree to anything? What rules did OP's original post break? From what I can see, your mod team was 100% in the wrong for removing the original post and OP was completely justified in being upset about it. Your mod team did something extremely invalidating then muted and banned OP for responding with valid anger, called it a troll, and are now demanding some measure of civility from it when it did nothing wrong with it's original post. I hope you can see how hurtful this is. This whole ""I can't help it if it won't help me"" thing is extremely manipulative. You should apologize and unban OP without any conditions, full stop.

Thanks for explaining so much! I think they'll still sound strange to me unless I hear them more commonly used this way (heck, so did 'they' for a while, and I use that myself now) but if I'll definitely understand things more if I meet anyone else who uses the same pronouns. Good luck! 
I think the equivalent — and what people are thinking of when they accuse you of trolling — are the cis people who make jokes like “did you just assume my gender?” or “I identify as [whatever].” Which is clearly not what you’re doing. 
thanks!

Yeah this honestly has me shaking with anger. I'm really sorry you're going through this. Being tone-policed, called a troll, and muted by someone who you're trying to call out for invalidating behavior is SO hurtful. Like, they said they ""suspected you were an elaborate troll"" for using it pronouns? That's just fucked. I myself thought about using it pronouns for a good while but now mostly just use my name. Again I am SO sorry you are going through this. You, your pronouns, and your anger are all 100% valid.
You messaged me directly, wanting me to go review your case and lift your ban. Okay, I go to do that. I find you've spent several hours prior to your appeal lying about our subreddit and our modteam.

You were never banned because of your pronouns, you were banned because your post got pulled and you were disrespectful about it in modmail.

You looked like a troll, you acted like a troll, and you were treated as one, and then you went and lied about our community and tried to get a witch-hunt going over here.

You have insulted me to my face, you have insulted and lied about a community I care about, and despite that, I've offered to lift your ban on two conditions: one, you agree to follow our rules in the future, and two, stop attacking our community.

You refuse to do either. So tell me, if you were in my position, how would you respond to someone who actively attacks your community and refuses to stop doing so?
Ah, yeah, I can see that.  Unfortunate, but what can you do.

You made a post that looked like a troll post. You got banned for it. The *very first message* you sent our modmail, you called our subreddit 'discriminatory.'

So you were already on the attack.

Our mod explained why you were banned. You doubled down and were disrespectful to our mod, so she muted you.

You then went to two other subreddits to complain and make a witch hunt, leaving them up for several hours before messaging me to check things out for you.

I went to go try to help you. I have offered to review this, you've lied about me and you've insulted me directly. You've attacked and lied about /r/genderqueer and our modteam.

I've offered to lift your ban and I've offered to chalk this up to miscommunication if you would simply agree to follow our rules in the future and stop attacking our community, and you have refused to do either.

Instead, you continue to lie about us, continue to assert that we banned you over your pronouns, which is utterly ridiculous, and you keep replying to my comments despite refusing my help.

So, again, here's the offer: You quit attacking our community, you pull the attack posts to end this witch-hunt you've started, and you agree to follow our subreddit's rules when you're on it in the future, and I'll go lift your ban.

If this can't be resolved peacefully and constructively, then I'll go take this to the admins and let them sort it out.

>I'm trying to encourage folks to listen to me and understand what happened and why.

Why won't you listen to anyone else? This is just sad at this point. Your mod team harmed OP initially and should be apologizing. OP didn't respond like a troll, OP responded like someone who is hurt and pissed off which was valid due to the circumstances. Your ""extending an olive branch"" etc is just such obvious fake empathy and super manipulative. This is just sad at this point. I'm done.

Edit: Please just read up on [tone policing](https://everydayfeminism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tone-policing1.png) before you hurt someone else.

Came out to my wife today	"I came out to my wife as non-binary tonight, explaining my preferences, and dysphoria.

She said I could put my dresses in her closet, she might have a button down shirt for me, and would keep an eye out.

She asked about my work shirts, and we talked about how I adopt stuff as femme, and why they work for me.

She also offered to do a pedicure with me.

I’m a total wreck, in the best possible way. 😭💖😭💖"	"I'm so happy for you. Your wife sounds like a lovely person 😊
Good God I love to see supportive partners. My ex was NOT supportive in the slightest when I came out to her, and despite being 110% over that relationship, that part still fucks me up. Someone I loved and trusted saying the things she did... Still makes me sick to my stomach and I'm starting to cry thinking about it. Shit hurts.

Sorry to bring it down haha. I'm I'm the best place I've been in my life now, and I'm super happy for you, friend! Hold onto her tightly.
Aww! That's amazing! I recently came out to my husband as NB and he was awesome too!! Makes such a huge difference! 🥰
Wholesome af 😭
I did the same with my husband, scared the shit out of him coming home from work in floods to tears. He just hugged me and now let's me pinch any shirts that are too small!
Awwwwwww
It's so wonderful to be with those who see and accept who you are! Be you! 💙
This world needs more women like your wife! Gratz on the coming out going well friend!
My wife helps paint my nails and has lots of suggestions for skincare. Supportive partners make a world of difference and I will never be able to adequately express my gratitude. 💙
Nice! I'm so happy for you :3 that's the best thing ever. You are not alone. You've got a beautiful partner on your side. Jeep that in mind if you feel alone.
My Partner proposed to me two weeks ago and transitioning like get a flat chest will happen in the future.
High fives all around!
Hugs
High five!

I come out to a friend at school, tells me that he’ll use He/Him anyway	I came out to a few of my other friends the other day and most were supporting, but one of them immediately goes “Oh you go by They/Them uh that’s wierd I’m gonna use He/Him anyway”. Our school is very progressive so you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting someone who’s LGBTQ+ and I’ve explained what being Non-Binary is to him multiple times but all he ever says is “Thats wierd I’m not gonna call you that”.	"Sounds like you need a new friend.
You don't get to control the behavior of other people, but you do get to choose who you spend your time with and include in your life. It sounds like having this person be a part of your life is damaging to you. If he understands that his behavior harms you, and he does it anyway, that's not much of a friend. You deserve to have a life full of people who appreciate who you truly are and can be respectful.
When I came out to my SO, I told them that I wasn’t a women and I objected to them calling me that (it “beautiful women” - they saw it as a compliment). They didn’t understand, I asked how would they feel if I called them “man” all they time (I usually just use their name). They said they wouldn’t mind. So, I started deliberately calling them “man” instead of using their name. That shut down the “woman” thing real quick!
If he would rather be an edgelord than support your feelings, then he's probably not a friend.   


I say ditch the jerk. You can definitely do better.
Just start calling him a totally different name. Don’t even draw attention to it. If he brings it up tell him his name is stupid so you won’t be using it
Lol its not about him. Just call him she/her constantly until he gets annoyed, then maybe he will get it.
Bye-ee.
“You’re not a good friend. How would you like it if I call you she? Since apparently it’s my choice what pronouns you get.”

Also…

swing a dead cat? 

Where are you from that this is a saying?
First, {{caring vibes or hugs if welcome}} and I'm sorry you got this response. I'm glad you got support from other friends.

I have a son who is autistic and would not do this now, but I could have imagined him doing this to the first friend who came out NB IF the friend never told him that continuing to use he/him would hurt your feelings and make you think he didn't respect you or care about you. At a certain point in his life, he would have needed to be explicitly told that you expect your friends to make an effort to use your new pronouns (and name, if you've changed that). You'll try to be understanding if it's uncomfortable and remind your friends who forget, but you expect them to try. You could also ask a mutual friend to have this conversation. 

If your friend totally intuits feelings and social mores and has no problem with change and is more likely a conservative jerk, then I take all this back. I just wanted to bring up that possibility. If this friend were like my son, it may not have occurred to him that he was hurting you or showing you disrespect yet, he'd just be at, ""I don't think I can get used to making that change very easily, so I'd rather keep doing it the way I've been doing it.""
you mean ex friend
>You can't swing a dead cat without hitting someone who's LGBTQ+

That's a weird expression
""Hey this new thing you're doing, it makes me uncomfortable and challenges my comfortable world view. I'll just ignore your feelings because it's easier for me to do that rather than be a good person and friend. Sorry but like, not sorry"".

Ditch this loser.
Idk how close you are with this person, but I couldn't be friends with someone who refuses to acknowledge who I am like this. It's incredibly disrespectful.
yeet the whole damn friend
Okay, well, ""his"" pronouns are now she/her. Hope she enjoys constantly being referred to with pronouns she doesn't identify with.

/srs Drop them. Clearly he doesn't have enough respect for you to use the right pronouns, and there's no sense dealing with that. He isn't worth it.
Sounds like he's not interested in being your friend 🤷🏻‍♀️
Wtf that sucks, I understand if it’s difficult at first but to blatantly engage in enby phobia is NOT OK
You're not in control of the way people behave. You can always give them a chance, and you did. But you are, to some extend ar least, in control of the people you surround yourself with
Learn fast that they are no longer your friend. If they grow up and figure out their mistake then they can mend the relationship but for now it should be considered dead.
That's not a true friend you need a new friend
When my kid calls me a thing I’ve told them not to call me, they just get a blank look and a ‘who’re you taking to?’ on repeat until they knock it off.
I'm sorry about that, do some stuff that makes you feel good and perfect the way you are, it's their loss. You're probably great!🥰
Just misgender them back.
A lil bap with the non-binary flag on the daily might annoy him enough to use your actual pronouns, I'm so sorry people are like that sometimes-
Can't swing a dead cat without hitting someone lgbt

That’s a new sentence for me
Dear fucking god that's just fucked up
You need to get a new friend. but. I understand that not all people are so easily separated. I understand having a friend who doesn't have a similar belief as you, while his thoughts are damaging you, if you two are really good friends then you need to do something. do a demonstration with him or take a stand next time he brushes you off. examples for both: Make him wear his shoes on the wrong feet, after a while ask him if that made him uncomfortable, if he says yes, then tell him that's how you feel every time he calls you 'he'. or next time you tell him or correct him and he brushes you off, start using a traditionally feminine name and she/her pronouns. when he tells you to cut it out, tell him that you can make a truce where you both use the right name/prns for each other. You can also embarrass him by telling a story using only they/them for the protag. then at the end say ""and that's how you can use they/them pronouns."" EX: The other day I was outside and saw a car that had the owners wallet and phone on top, and the items fell of in front of my house, so I went over, picked the belongings off the road and waved my hand for the driver to see. they stopped, drove back to my house and they thanked me for flagging them down. They even gave me some ca- and thats how you use my they/them pronouns. respect them from now on please"". Just remember that while these are ideas that seem witty/funny/or whatnot, please remember to be safe, make sure your friend is calm and you have a way out of the situation in case it gets too unsafe. :)
if you wanna go full petty, start using the wrong pronouns for him.see how he likes it. an eye for an eye n shit.
Time to ex-friend this person real quick
Also a very happy they/them to you fellow enby <3
It trully sucks. I get it. Most of my friends told me ""i doesn't change who you are, so im okay with it"" and some even asked about my pronouns or asked for some explanation. Although one of my ""friends"" had a really disappointing behaviour. Let me be clear: HE'S GAY, AND LGBTPHOBIC. When i realised that i just took my path away from his ""friendship"". That's it. DON'T EVER BE NEAR TOXIC PEOPLE, mainly when you're in a place of self-knowledge.
Yeah I’ve started cutting them off but he asked one of my friends to tell me to “stop being an attention whore” which he gave to one of my good friends who refused to send the message on his behalf and just told me he was being problematic
🥇
This is a good plan too, I imagine it’ll work well in conjunction with another commenters plan to use she/her pronouns with them
Also, I'm sorry that people suck. I hope you find some more supportive people at your school. It can be really hard to trust people with stuff like that.
I think it's an older rural US saying. It's almost never used anymore , where I'm from at least
Was wondering the same thing about the swing the dead cat lol
Actually, I made the speech overlong. You might only need to say. ""It's important to me that you try to use they/them. It's right for me, and I'm asking this of all my friends. Please. I'll help.""
That’s a really good idea, things like this are setting me back coming out to my parents because I’ve overheard some talk of them with my grandparents about how they don’t understand pronouns, I didn’t hear enough to judge but they’re supporting of my being Pan so I hope that when I work up the courage they’ll be supportive and willing to learn
Yeah I wish people could just be accepting, I might try that idea it sounds fun
Yeah I swear I've heard it at least once
It's used in Australia, I've heard it enough that I'd say it's a well- known and active idiom
I'm glad your parents were supportive of you being pan! I hope they're just as supportive when or if you come out to them as non-binary. I wish you good luck and its not bad to take your time with your identity and you may even get comfortable with it very soon! Again, good luck and I hope the person that wouldn't use your pronouns get them baps wit dah enby power if you do try it
It's still pretty common in the UK too"	snjsxb	NonBinary	243	0.99	2022-02-08 13:07:19
I really can't explain it, but having blue hair gave me dysphoria for some reason?? All I know is that I feel 10000% more like myself now that I'm back to purple. First selfies I haven't hated in a long time. :)		"I dislike the blue hair on myself too. I feel better with green and purple (and the pink-ish when it fades)
Heeey - I know the feeling - I love dying my hair, but ONLY red. It's weird.
Society often connects the colour blue and the male gender.


Society
This is so damn wholesome! It's awesome to see you seem so happy in these photos 😁💜
Ain't gender weird? And ain't you gorgeous :D :D
Nice hair, sweet piercings, and nice pronouns cause I'm bias asf. All in all, 15/10. Here, have a snail 🐌
Love the purple...beautiful! It goes great with the colour of your top as well!
Im so happy for you! You look amazing
You look absolutely fabulous, I need purple hair again.
love it 💜
That’s how I feel having hair that’s light at all no matter the color, even if they look good aesthetically they make me feel like shit. You look great!
Purple lyf 😜
My friend is the same haha. They say they’re a red head at heart. They just feel like they’re supposed to have red hair.
Honestly I think it might have been that, at least partially. It did feel too masculine in a way."	smvaje	NonBinary	230	0.99	2022-02-07 17:12:03
Fuck the DMV	"I got my driver's license recently (I'm 21 btw and should have gotten it sooner) and asked the DMV greeter if I can change my sex to ""X"" since I am able to do that in my state. The DMV greeter said I could and was sweet about it. When it was my turn to get my license however, the lady serving me was an absolute bitch. I asked if I could change my sex to ""X"", this bitch rolled her eyes, sighed, and asked me ""My god, why would you want to do that!?"" I explained I'm not a man or a woman and this lady just kept sighing to herself.  ""It will cause issues for you in the long run!"" I had enough at that point and decided fuck it, I don't want to be here longer, I just wanted to cry. ""Nevermind then since it's such an inconvenience for you to type one fucking letter."" I said as I paid for my license and got my photo taken. My photo makes me look like I was there for a mugshot, I was pissed to say the least. If you cannot serve people without giving attitude because someone is LGBTQ+, don't serve the public then.

Yes, I filed a complaint."	"That's absolutely fucked. Government employees are public servants and that definitely goes against nondiscrimination law. Make sure that your complaint goes thru.

I'm so sorry that happened
That sucks. In my state I was able to do this by mail, which took some time but meant no trip to the DMV and having to deal with people like this.
wtf
By a funny coincidence, today is exactly two years since I first changed my driver's license to have an X gender marker. Here is a list of all the problems it's caused me in that time:

&#x200B;

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's all of them. 

I just got my X passport a couple weeks ago, not sure if I'll be making it up to Canada this year or not, but I'll report back if I have any problems with it.
Hey, I’m so sorry you had such an awful experience. In the future, you can actually do this online! Like tomorrow! Lots of love Mx. godoge899🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
I’m so sorry this happened to you! The dmv and it’s workers like more government workers can go fuck themselves. They don’t understand the process people go through to just be themselves. Who cares if you want that accurately displayed on your license it’s your life. That person was rude , good for you on following up and filing a complaint. 

I was able to change my license by mail to x but I had legally change it to male and name updated the year prior or so before reliving non-binary was a better feel/fit for me. and when I travel to other states and get new licenses, certain dmv will allow x and other force me to choose a gender, I choose m. Only one state tried to force me to part f online and stuff but I went to the dmv and the dude said there’s no way he was doing that to me since he couldn’t tell I was trans in the first place lol perks of passing as a cis person I guess
Wanted to get mine changed to X.  Went in, did the paperwork and I guess when the lady was entering it in she never looked at what I actually wrote and I got a license with an M on it.  Called the DMV and they td me I'd have to pay for another license which I don't have the money for.
Right now, it absolutely will make it harder for you in the long term in SOME cases. For example, if you want to travel the world, there some countries that won’t let you in similar because you have X down as your gender.

What the lady did is disrespectful and it 100000000% should not matter what you put down for gender.
I’m so glad you filed a complaint, fuck thst lady. It’s the fucking LAW if she doesn’t like it she can find a new job.
I would have done it by mail, but I had to get my photo taken was the issue.
That's a pain. I'm really sorry it didn't work out because of that person. I hope you can get it updated :)"	xhzus5	NonBinary	191	0.99	2022-09-19 02:51:00
Do you identify as trans?	"Just curious to see peoples answers, no judgment!!

Personally i don't, and i'll explain why.
I identify as agender, and i feel as if thats always been the case. Like i didn't change genders, as i've always felt as if i wasn't any specified gender in the first place.

 Although on the other hand, i am amab, and i didn't come to the realization of being agender until a bit over a year ago (i never even realized that was a possibility in the midst of the confusion lol).
Looking back i realized that i felt agender all along, i just didn't know how to explain/perceive that until i learned more.

Either way, it's personal opinion. We do fall under the transgender umbrella, but using the label is completely up to you.

Happy Thursday! :D

edit: these replies have been amazing, i wasnt expecting to learn so much. now im reconsidering lol. thank you all for interacting!!!

edit #2: a lot of people are continuing to comment on parts i either wrote poorly, or was just plain wrong about. i appreciate this, and i've learned a lot since posting this.

im not going to respond to any more as im very busy and simply dont have time (and i dont want to sound like a broken record), but i do read most of them when i get the chance. hope thats okay, and again thank you all :)"	"Absolutely. No one held me up at birth and said, ""It's a disaster!"" so I was definitely not correctly assigned.
It depends who asks. I’m also agender but I’m in my mid-30s and in a fairly socially conservative area, and often one of the first not-associating-with-my-gender-assigned-at-birth people someone might meet and know about. To those people I call myself trans to dissociate myself from cis, and help them understand it’s “not just rainbow-haired snowflake teens”. Around binary trans folks and people experiencing strong dysphoria / on HRT, though, I just call myself genderless, as my dysphoria is solely social and I don’t want to center myself in that conversation.
I do. Very often when I meet a nonbinary person who doesn't, it ultimately stems from some form of guilt or fear of ""stolen valor"" in regard to binary trans people. There is a nagging demon at the back of the minds of many nonbinary people that we're ""not trans enough,"" or not enough in some other way. It's totally fine to be nonbinary and not label yourself as trans, but if you don't, I'd challenge you to examine whether the reasoning stems from some form of guilt around the idea of doing so.
When someone would ask ""are you trans"", I would answer ""yes"", because technically, by definition, non-binary is trans. But I've always had this ""I'm not trans enough"" mentality about myself. I have a ""non-binary version of myself"" persona that I created, and ignored the cognitive dissonance about why I would need a different version of me to be valid. Once I started hormones, I actively started calling myself ""trans"" to other people. 

It was completely a self-identity issue that I didn't know how to categorize properly and generally just ignored.
I define transgender as an internal experience of gender that doesn't solely and completely align with one's AGAB. I define non-binary as an internal experience of gender that doesn't fit solely and completely within either of Western culture's rigid gender binary boxes: man and woman. Since people aren't typically assigned non-binary at birth, non-binary by definition falls under the transgender label umbrella.

Trans isn't short for transition, it doesn't mean change. It means *across from*, as in a location that is across from another location.

But like you say, the individual is free to choose their own labels, including choosing to identify as non-binary and not trans. The individual's choice to identify supersedes any definitional relationships.
I don't identify as trans. Don't know, it just... doesn't fit me. And that's okay! Everybody is different, it works for others and that's fine, too.
I define myself as trans-masculine nonbinary. I consider myself trans because I don’t identify with the gender I was assigned at birth. (AFAB, in case trans-masculine wasn’t a clue). I’m more masculine leaning than femme (though I still love my makeup), but I’m fully neither and therefore beyond the binary. If that makes ANY sense, I’m still in the process of discovering myself 🤷🏻
When my egg cracked and I knew I wasn't cis, I considered myself trans (because technically non-binary is) and identified as a part of the broad trans community, but I didn't actively claim/use the label other than respecting and occasionally flashing the trans pride colors. A few months later though, I accepted that I'm transfem so now it's a part of my non-binary transfem label I use whenever I'm describing my gender to someone.
I don’t! I just don’t feel trans. My gender is complicated, but I feel closer to my AGAB (I still use the pronouns I always have and don’t come out unless it’s with trans/nb people) then most other non-binary people, so I feel weird saying I’m trans.
Oh yeah I'm def trans, but I don't often say that to cis people inherently because they immediately think of the binary trans ""always knew I was a boy/girl"" narrative which is just not really it.
Yes, I’m hoping to start HRT within the next few months
Yes, I do. But I identify as many things. I think it kinda goes like this, from macro to micro: 

queer -> trans -> non-binary -> gender fluid

My favorite flags and the ones I feel most represented by are the NB and the Bi flags. However, lately I have fully embraced the trans flag and I feel compelled to call myself trans because of the horrific global campaign against trans rights specifically that we're seeing at the moment. The political violence against trans people makes want to show my trans identity more than ever, to fight for our rights and out of solidarity.
Yes nonbinary is trans
Personally I do.
My situation: I have socially and medically transitioned and pass as a man in my daily life and only those who know me personally know I’m non-binary. I ID as a nonbinary trans man (afab).

But none of my experience should have any impact on anyone else choosing to use the label trans or not. No physical or social transition is required of any trans and/or non-binary person to use any label they want.
Absolutely. My gender does not align with the sex I was assigned at birth. Also, I experience gender dysphoria, got top surgery, etc. Those are requirements for being trans, but it definitely makes me feel even more solid in my label
You say you didn’t change genders but… most trans people didn’t. Many of them always felt they were what they are. It’s not change, but rather difference between your gender and your AGAB.
Yes and no. I have a lot of the similar reasoning that you do (I’m also Agender AMAB), but I feel somewhat connected to the idea. It’s weird and I haven’t really decided yet.
14 year old non binary kid here, I identify as trans to my friends and close ones as they are aware of my identity,
But for new people/having to remind people/official, it's non binary.
Yes
Yes.
Yes. I don’t identify as the gender I was assigned at birth, and I’ve had a gender surgery and I was on hrt for a year. But I think even if I hadn’t taken any steps to physically transition, I would still identify as trans
Yes i’m trans
Yes
You can be transgender in the literal sense of not identifying with your assigned gender at birth, but you don't necessarily have to participate in the LGBT+ community. I think that's where people get caught up. You're a part of the LGBT+ community because of your marginalized identity, but everyone within the community has different struggles, privileges, lifestyles, etc. and whether or not you choose to actively seek out the company of other LGBT+ folks is entirely up to you. 

I definitely consider myself trans even though I haven't changed my name or gender marker, I don't bind or pack, I don't plan on getting medical transition, but I have changed my pronouns and I don't connect with any experiences relating to gender.
Trans mean I'm not my AGAB so yes. 

No one change genders. We have all born this way. Sex is the one that can be fixed.
Nah, while I do enjoy more feminine appearances and am on HRT, no matter how much I ponder it, I just don't feel like I'm MtF. The way I put it is I'm more about androgyny and being the ultimate they/them, like I joke that when you walk into a store and an employee greets you as sir or ma'am, I want them to be genuinely confused on what to say.
I know on the more technical side Non-binary falls under the trans umbrella and yada yada, but honestly no.

It's just my identity, i just thought about it and was like ""hey I'm non binary"". 

I don't really know how to articulate it but i definitely don't feel like I'm part of the transgender community nor would I call myself transgender.
It took me some time to accept it, because I don't really feel much dysphoria nor want to transition. So.. that made me feel like I was 'not a real trans person', lol. 

But after some time of telling others that you know it doesn't matter how you look or present, you're still equally trans I was like 'you know what? nobody identified my gender as confusion and if I can't accept myself being a gnc trans person when I feel like I actually might how can I fully accept gnc trans people in general?' and i totally get that 'trans' doesn't fit the lived experience of a good deal of enby folks, and that is definitely real and valid! but I realized the main reason I wasn't using the label was because I was... afraid of being judged as not a real trans person. And... that's not a good reason. I have *many* other ways I could describe my gender that would probably be more accurate, and I usually use those more, but that doesn't make me *less trans.* 

Also, if there's one great benefit, it's that I feel I can better stand up with my trans and enby sisters, brothers, and siblings against people trying to take our rights. There's really a need for that right now, I feel.
I identify as trans, but that's just me.
I am not trans. It's something that has never fit me due to vary personal reasons. But this is ok! Everyone is unique and different.
well considering i want top surgery if/when it is financially feasible yes
It took me a while to accept that I do identity with the label. I used to think I wasn’t ‘trans enough’ to call myself transgender. But now I realize how much that word means to me in defining and expressing my experience. I want to be seen as trans. It gives me gender Euphoria in a way. I guess it feels validating to me now.
I kinda identify as both trans AND cis, because I still identify with my AGAB, I just identify with another gender as well. 

I also believe that I benefit from a certain degree of cis privilege because of this. Still, I choose to strongly identify with the trans community for political reasons.

In order of importance, my identity will always be queer first, then bigender, then woman, then man, then nonbinary, then trans.
No, maybe I've just spent too much time gaslighting myself on transmed subs but I feel like by doing that I'm appropriating and doing a disservice to those who have medically transitioned and suffer crippling dysphoria.  All I really care about is the internal freedom to be myself.

I've heard the term isogender thrown around to mean ""neither cis nor trans"" and I think I like that one.  Isopod genders unite 🤘👍
I don't understand what you mean by ""change genders"". Transgender means not identifying with what you were assigned at birth. Trans people were always trans people. I'm agender as well and as a little kid I was even convinced that I wasn't human (a changling or alien, were my favorites lol), because, I didn't relate to either gender. Most trans people have very similar stories and feelings I do, so, I do consider myself trans. At some point, I even hope to surgically remove certain parts of my body as well. I have looked into micro-dosing hrt, but, it would cause health issues for me to worsen. 🤷🏻
Yes? And no? I don't intend to transition, but I do like to associate under the umbrella term, it feels welcoming
I don’t identify as trans because I don’t plan on going on T or making any big changes to my body, other than maybe a hysterectomy some day. I’m quite comfortable in my femininity though and don’t really have any major gender dysphoria right now
It took me a while to accept that I do identity with the label. I used to think I wasn’t ‘trans enough’ to call myself transgender. But now I realize how much that word means to me in defining and expressing my experience. I want to be seen as trans. It gives me gender Euphoria in a way. I guess it feels validating to me now.
No, I’m still essentially my agab, just a less strong version of it. Like yeah I’m a girl but I’m not really anything, I’m not trans because I don’t identify as a different gender I literally identify with my assigned one but I’m still nonbinary if that makes sense? I definitely don’t consider myself cis either though.

Edit: who downvoted me did I say something wrong or offensive? 😅
Yea sure i prefer the trans flag and i still fall under the trans umbrella
I don't personally connect with trans. Because to me I'm more outside of gender if that makes sense.
I'm both/neither whatever you wanna call it. 

That being said I know I'm not cis. Because how I feel inside doesn't match my physical body (in many ways, I also have a physical disability). So if someone forced me to give a one-word answer I would say yes.

When I can I would rather explain to the person asking what I just said, so here we are 🙂
I used not to, since I, as an AMAB, was still pretty masculine, and never really ""transitioned"", just continued my regular being-of-self. However recently I've felt more dysphoric and took steps to appear more feminine, and after a lot of debates with myself, I do feel like I could consider myself trans now.
I do not identify with the gender I was assigned st birth, and consider myself a femme (I’m AMAB) so yes. I consider myself a trans person; just not a trans woman. More specifically I identify as a transfemme.
I identify as trans because my gender doesnt match the one I was assigned at birth ive always been nonbinary but a trans guy was always a guy he just didnt always know it so yeah
yes because i have socially transitioned and plan to medically
I don't align with what I was assigned at birth, so I do see myself as trans.
I personally feel like trans non-binary fits for me because I am def not cis and am very distant from my agab. But I think it makes a great deal of sense that not all non-binary people would consider them selves trans.
Yup
I’ve been debating this a lot recently. I think I would for myself, as by definition, being non binary IS trans.
Yep. For reasons people already posted here. For me trans means you identify differently from your agab. Ergo, I am trans!
Yup!
Yes because I am not cis gendered. I dont identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. Here is a picture of the Trans Umbrella

[the Trans Umbrella](https://images.app.goo.gl/swbWL9DUxtTTneyD8)
Under the umbrella
Yes, I don’t identify with my AGAB at all, which makes me transgender. Nonbinaryness is basically a subset of that for me.

Didn’t really know about either of those umbrella labels for a long time but knew my brain was very much not computing trying to associate/fit in with my AGAB by around 5th grade and found the word “agender”, which I liked and resonated with but kept it private and sorta stuffed it down. Eventually as dysphoria from staying closeted got worse and I was trying to figure out what was going on I thought I fit into transmed/truscum concepts of medicalized binary transness for a few years, but it turns out that’s reductive bs anyway (there’s many binary trans folk who don’t do any medical transition or don’t experience dysphoria, and many non-binary folk who do do some or many aspects of medical transition or do experience dysphoria, like me) and I’m still very much non-binary, somewhere between agender and genderqueer and femme, and definitely happier and more comfortable being able to be open about both these facets of myself finally instead of pretending to be part of either side of the binary.

Plenty of welcome room for all you nb’s under the trans umbrella if you want. Still trans, still enby ^_^
I actually consider myself demigirl. I'm part girl part genderless. I like my feminine side and prefer to talk and be with AFAB people. But bodilywise I want nothing more than to have no gender. No boobs (luckily mine are small I don't need a reduction), no uterus (getting a hysterectomy later this year), but also do not want to be on hormones. Because I still associate myself as party with my AGAB and I don't consider myself trans. The only dysphoria I feel is with my periods. So hopefully after the hysterectomy I shouldn't have that any more!! But i'm also comfortable with she/her pronouns or they/them
I like the way you think and it’s made me look at my own journey in the same light. I feel this big time. I don’t identify as trans because I feel like I’m stealing it, and it’s hard enough for society to catch up anyways. But now that you’ve put it this way, yeah, ever since I can remember I’ve always felt “non binary”, I just didn’t know it. I haven’t changed, I’ve just grown, have a better understanding now, and feel proud to be who I am versus confused and fighting it. I’m still growing and learning, and I always will be. And if I figure out and start to understand more of who I am, it doesn’t mean it’s a new part of me. It’s just a part I hadn’t unlocked yet.
I identify as trans but I deal with the occasional internalized transphobia which halts me from being able to confidently say I am so. Being called a trans-trender (because I am fem-presenting AFAB) has put a huge obstacle in my way from being able to be confident with who I know I am. I think about top surgery and T sometimes but I feel like I have to be 100% at peace with myself before I do anything like that--if that makes sense.
i didnt think about it that way but i feel in the wrong 'body' sometimes but i wont say I'm trans i even use he/they pronouns so i can pass as my agab
Yes.
Yes I identify as trans and I hate the assigned at birth genders
I get what you’re saying! Personally, I don’t identify as trans because - in my own personal experiences - when talking to other trans folk, my experiences with gender don’t follow suit (term of phrase - follow the norm) so it doesn’t feel right that I claim this identity when I don’t experience certain feelings. I don’t know if that makes sense, but know that you’re not alone! 💛💜
Personally I don't since I just don't really identify with that label plus, if I were to say that I'm trans most people would assume that I'm actually transgender, like FtM or MtF, which I'm not and you would have annoying conservatives trying to misgender me depending on which they think I am and I really wouldn't feel like trying to explain that I'm not transgender, I'm just a genderfluid demigirl and that just happens to fall under the transgender umbrella.

If I was trans masc, like if I was a genderfluid demiboy instead of a genderfluid demigirl, I probably would identify as trans alongside the other labels but since part of my non-binary identity includes my AGAB I just don't identify with the label of transgender.
personally i identify as trans because i am afab and i was so happy and content being a girl when i was younger, i didn't feel like a girl as i got older and so i went from one gender (girl) to another (disaster). it took me a while of fighting some people who said being nonbinary isnt really trans or even a real identity as well
Genderqueer Transmaculine
Yes, absolutely! I've been IDing as non-binary for probably 8-10 years now but probably didn't consider myself trans until about 2017 I guess.
yes
I say I'm trans almost to simplify it. That can be easier to grasp for a lot of people and I personally consider myself trans masc just the label nonbinary felt better to me. Coming out to people, since im not out to some of my family and friends still, I normally just day I'm trans and use he/they pronouns and if it's someone I feel comfortable talking more about it to i'll go into detail. I'm autistic and have kind of a weird relationship with my gender so I'm not sure if that made any sense, sorry.
I kind of identify as trans, but I like the term nonbinary transmasc better since I am pretty much a demiboy but still nonbinary but not like 100% trans yknow?
i haven’t decided yet honestly. i feel the same way a lot of other people mentioned in that i don’t think i’m “trans enough” to use the label. i’m nonbinary, which for me really just feels like i don’t have a gender at all. but i’m afab and still present very femme. i go by they/them and she/her but most people use she/her out of habit and it doesn’t bother me. i don’t really know where i’m going with this tbh, i just appreciate you starting this thread because i’ve thought about it a lot and i’m still very unsure. i do know that by definition i fall under the trans umbrella, and honestly that thought makes me very happy, but i’ve never experienced dysphoria and i’m very lucky in that coming to terms with my identity wasn’t a struggle at all- i just remember thinking one day “hey wait do i even *have* a gender? i don’t think i do…” and i’ve identified as enby ever since. i don’t want to take away from other trans’ peoples experiences or struggles at all and i worry that using the label would do so. sorry for my long rambling thoughts, i’m not sure if any of this made sense tbh.
I’m also AMAB agender but I still identify as trans. I say that because I, despite being born male, am not a boy. I feel like that makes me trans
I feel trans. Because even though I’m afab, I feel very masc and have had some ftm surgeries and I’m on T, but I’m nonbinary
Yeah. I was not assigned agender at birth. And I have done social and medical transition.
Generally, no, I got a bad case of the ""not trans enough."" I'm some flavor of genderfluid so like occasionally, I feel like my agab. So I've mental gymnastics myself into ""transjacent"" or something.
As noted above “trans” is related to across. As an agender person, it doesn’t quite vibe for me, because I just don’t have a gender at all. I do vibe with “cisn’t”, “isogender” and “absgender” though. See: https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Gender_Modality
Yes, I mostly identify as transmasculine, but not as a trans man really.
i do because im afab and want to get top surgery and go on hormones, I also experience very similar if not the same issues as mtf/ftm transgender people do
yes and no? 
for technical reasons I say I'm transmasc because to me it describes that I'm medically transitioning by masculinizing a bit so I can be somewhat androgynous.  At the same time I do kinda feel that the cis/trans is another binary I don't want to involve myself in and even I think it can be just as restrictive as man/woman. in an ideal world we could all just mod our bodies to whatever and just respect each other on what we say we are without question and without having to categorize it as cis: binary man/woman only or trans: binary man/woman, nonbinary, etc. I would say I'm agender but don't inherently conceptualize it as my gender identity. I dunno man 🤷‍♂️
When I first started to identify as non-binary, I didn’t call myself trans because I didn’t drastically change my appearance or start hormones. Now days I very much identify as trans. I believe it’s simple, if you’re not cis, you’re trans.
Yeah
yes
Well, I don’t identify as my agab, so by definition I’m trans. Easy.
i do because i feel like i’m currently transitioning, and also i just identify with the term. it describes me. but your explanation makes sense too! that’s a cool way to see it :)
I identify as trans, as I wasn't assigned enby at birth so I changed how I express my gender from what I've been taught to be. I use trans and enby interchangeably. If someone is gender queer, but doesn't like to use the trans label that is still absolutely valid. I like to use the enby flag more too
Nope, i don't. I feel like in my case it's because i only feel nonbinary sometimes. And thats pretty rare so i feel like i'm almost always just a girl. That's why i feel pretty cisgender (although i'm not), cause the feeling of being nonbinary is definitely rarer for me, than the feeling of being a girl. Cause most of the time i have no problem being called a girl etc.
Yes
I am xenogender and trans.
I feel a clear way to describe me is girl brain, boy body, happy about both. I just don’t have a lot of body dysphoria (I’m just skinny tall.  Plenty of flat chested women are shaped like me), and I spent an extremely long time getting this body in shape for my physical hobbies. Plus my current genitalia (all of it) works great for whoever I’m dating. 

All that said, I’ve started to lean more into “trans feminine” than non-binary. As much as I’m ok with my current body, it’s a girl typing this. The cool part is the girl has access to testosterone. 

I would never change this about me. Just because science put me here doesn’t mean it’s not a fun way to live. But yes, I am a transgender person.
For a while, I remember I didn’t identify as trans. My ex-friend tried to tell me then, “but how’s that possible? Non-binary people are under trans umbrella!” But somehow this didn’t sit right with me. I didn’t associate myself with the term.

But right now, seeing how my things inside my head have gone, I identify as trans AND nb. I’m nb but leaning into transmasc (or, in other words, a demiboy). I guess it makes sense LMAO
Well, For Me It's Pretty Simple. The Way I See It, I Was AMAB, And I'm A Girl, Therefore I'm Trans, However I'm Also A Boy, Which In Combination With Being A Girl Makes Me Non-Binary.
Yes
I do but I understand why others don't; I've been on hormones for like five years which has definitely impacted how I view it. 

I define myself as ""straight down the middle"" non-binary but not in a typically androgynous way so if I'm misgendered it tends not to be as my agab. 

I do have a looser definition of transgender - like it's just your gender not lining up with your agab; but that's not really what I judge it by for myself, I guess? Like I'll describe myself as non-binary transgender if I feel the context requires it.
Hi ! I am AMAB and agender too. I do identify as trans but I don't publicly claim the label especially around cis people. I prefer to say to people that I am non-binary. 

I do that because I feel like people in my country only associate ""trans"" with binary trans people that change their passing to align with their gender, and I don't have the energy to fight over definitions with them. 

And with other trans people I rarely claim the label too because I don't want to center my experience when we are having conversations about us, as I am aware that I don't have physical dysphoria, don't need HRT, and can still navigate any spaces by passing as my AGAB without it threatening my mental health.
i identify as nothing
I consider myself trans
Yes!! It's easier to explain to cis people too, with other trans and enby people though I prefer stating my actual identity which is agender, simply bc they can grasp it better. 
I tend to use trans/nonbinary/agender interchangeably for the most part though since they're all true!!
I don’t know honestly, I don’t think so. Mainly because I don’t feel trans and I don’t feel cis I’m just me? I don’t really care for labels in the first place, I consider myself non binary because that’s the term for how I feel but if u ask me I’m not a boy or a girl or anything I’m just me and the same goes for my sexuality I think everything is just so fluid for me that I don’t feel the need to label stuff.
I do, personally. I identify as a gender other than my assigned gender, and get dysphoria because of it
I'm still tentative about being gender queer. I know I'm def not cis cuz I have days I wish I had different parts or no parts I'm afab and like being a woman most of the time but there are days where having just a penis and chilling would be so much better than all these hormones. The thing is most of the time I love my body and I'm 18 weeks pregnant so I'm definitely fine with my uterus most days. I've always wanted bio kids...but idk when I'm done using it I'm not sure I want to keep the heavy milk bags and pain causing organ. I think I just worry about labels. I'm a straight passing bisexual too...so no one really looks at me and goes ""Ah a member of the LGBTQ+ community"" even when I present more manly....I'll steal my husband's clothes...often and I have Deadpool boxers I'll wear around the house. My husband know this and even he doesn't treat me any different. No one uses they pronouns even though I'm a she/they....what I'm saying is I don't see the point in being out if no one is gonna care or take me seriously.
I view myself as Trans, as I feel under the umbrella  of being  Trans  & Genderfluid Fem
I like to explain myself like this  "" I'm fifty shades of fucked up ""
But to answer your question .I identify as Trans
I count myself trans, but its partly because of the technically definition of trans

>denoting or relating to a person whose gender identity does not correspond with the sex registered for them at birth; transgender.

I have somewhat high dysphoria chest wise, and do plan to transition and go on T so that my voice and fat distribution can get more 'masculine'. But I identify as Agender as well (or as a demon but thats more of a funny 'that has no gender' joke with myself).
Well, trans by definition is identifying with a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth.. but I completely reject gender as a concept.  I have no gender, and therefore, I'm not trans by definition.
No, and that's mostly a matter of semantics for me I suppose. 

I identify as genderfluid and non-binary.

I label myself non-binary by process of elimination because I do not identify as a binary gender. I don't consider non-binary to be automatically a gender in and of itself, for the same reason I don't consider ""not green or blue""  to be a color. A color like red or pink fits that description. However, a turkey sandwich also fits that description. A turkey sandwich and 

I label myself as genderfluid because gender is something I experience in a fluid manner.

I generally don't explicitly identify as transgender because I don't (quoting my own definition) ""identify as a gender other than the one correlating to my birth sex assignment"". I don't identify as any gender because of the fluidity. I don't fit the definitions I use for cisgender or transgender because to do is predicated on the premise that I identify as a gender in the first place. The reason I sometimes will is because I fit the definition many other people use for transgender and experience a great deal of overlap with my experience relative to theirs.

There can absolutely be non-binary people who identify as a specific gender and/or as trans, but this explains my respective reasons for not doing the former and only sometimes doing the latter.
I don't really identify as trans. But my friend calls me non-binary trans when I told him that non-binary is under the trans umbrella. Then said ""I knew it! Your trans""
I do, but not often, and I describe myself as non-binary first because it's what's closer to me. I think of non-binary as the poetry of gender, and trans as the prose.
Yep. My gender differs from the one I was assigned at birth, so I’m trans :D

(obv though not everyone has to identify with that; non-binary falls under the trans umbrella but individuals don’t have to identify with the term if they’re not comfortable doing so)
i personally do not!
No. If there was a word to specify the mtf & ftm experience exclusively I would feel more comfortable using it, but to me it feels inappropriate for me to share that same space when my experience is grotesquely different, because I present as my AGAB, and largely fit that gender norm in many aspects.
Yes. I’m transmasc and I share most of the same transition-related experiences as trans men in general, plus it’s easier to explain “I’m trans” to cis people than it is to explain “I’m non-binary” (unfortunately).
Yes

I am inherently trans because I'm not cis.
i dont identify as trans regularly, but ill dust off the label for pride!
i feel like i generally identify as ‘queer’ or ‘a silly little guy’
my gender doesnt matter too much to me as long as people use they/them pronouns for me!
i do because I've done HRT for a short period and want top surgery. though i think if i didnt do/want those things, I would still identify with it since I'm not cis.
yes. I'm non-binary and trans masc and I'm medically transitioning (hormones and surgery), so I'm trans
To me personally trans means any identity that isn't cis, although obviously that's just me personally and if someone doesn't want me to call them trans I won't. Although I have to say that I've been identifying and transmasc non-binary for over a year now and now I'm like ""am I tho"" in the sense than I dont think the trans man label fits me anymore. I dont say I'm trans so people dont assume I'm a man but I consider myself under the trans umbrella
I don’t identify as trans (I actually place myself outside of gender entirely) but I do acknowledge that my identity falls under the trans umbrella and recognize that I’m part of the group regardless if I identify as it or not
You be you! That’s what matters. Im a transgender women and that makes me feel amazing even though I look like a transgender women most people get it right. I hope you are happy.
Actually yes. But I think it has less to do with being nonbinary. And more with the constant feeling of; I hate my dick and want to chop it of! Lel
I don't mind using the label, mostly because it's easier to type sometimes and it's kind of all encompassing lol. 
I would prefer to use like NB or Enby, but sometimes people don't know what you are talking about lol.
I do, but I also have a sense of gender, it’s just somewhere in between male and female. So I think it is personally appropriate to identify as trans.
personally i do identify as trans because i want to transition like name pronouns possibly top surgery etc i’m just not in the binary
I didn't for a long time, but a friend explained it to me in a way that kinda clicked.

He said that his wife (a NB person who mainly uses she/they and AFAB) considers themself trans because they experience gender outside the hetero normative 2 gender construct. They see transness as moving in any direction away from their AGAB, even if someone doesn't ""fully transition"" to the other side of the typical gender binary.

I don't know why that got me, but it clicked. Like I consider myself a trans person, but I don't openly advertise that to people cause it can spark debate and make others feel invalidated or uncomfortable.
Yes, simply, as I'm sure many others have said, I don't identify with the Gender I was assigned at birth. I understand this as the definition but also respect that many enbies don't consider themselves trans and that's completely valid and not my place to deny.
Sorta, I’m non-binary and don’t feel as though I “am” a man or woman, but I am trans-feminine in the sense that I’m AMAB and present in a more traditionally feminine way. So while my gender is not exactly trans, trans-femininity is a part of my identity and gender expression. I hope that makes sense lol
I'm trans, cis, intrafeminine and intergragender
hahaha good point
Oh man- I would identify as a ""Hot Mess"" if some bigots wouldn't take it as a sign of me being transphobic...
So I am not the only one who refers to themselves as a disaster
Hey if we lived in a world where everyone was treated as gender chaos from birth until they figured themselves out, would that make what we think of as cis people trans, and the only cis people would be those enbies who just really are gender chaos? 

My head hurts 😳🤔😂
this is an amazing answer imo. that makes a lot of sense, and i feel the same way!
This is such a great way of putting it. To binary trans people I am just non-binary, but to others I am trans because that’s the language they understand. If I say I’m non-binary and my pronouns are she/they, they’ll only ever use she (I’m afab). But if I say I’m trans, they understand more and are more respectful of my preferred pronouns.
>it’s “not just rainbow-haired snowflake teens”

True, but those ""snowflake teens"" still belong to the community and I would lay down my life for them. 

(Not saying that you specifically are trying to devalue their experiences, but a lot of people do and it can be very draining at times.)
this was very well written and i agree completely. its something a lot of us need to look inward to figure out if we want to ultimately decide. i made this post purely out of curiosity, but the replies i've gotten are a lot better than i expected, so now im reconsidering. its actually been really helpful haha.

thank you for the awesome response :)
> Trans isn't short for transition, it doesn't mean change. It means across from, as in a location that is across from another location.

this is where my personal back and forth with the label comes in, because objectively that means i would be trans, and in some cases i would consider myself trans.
most people use 'trans' (as a label) as short for transition(ed) though (ie: trans man/woman or trans fem/masc), which is totally fair. 

so i guess overall i would say im not trans because i feel that takes away from the struggles and experience of fully transitioning (hrt and the like).

this gives me plenty to think about haha, awesome response thank you!!
Same here.
Exactly this!
Have you considered intrafeminine or intramasculine?
that makes sense, i can see where that confusion could come in, i guess it just depends on who you're talking to.
with some it might be harder to explain that you arent a binary gender, but you also arent trans, and vice versa. thank you for the response !!
i think you're awesome. lately i've been contemplating identifying with trans more because of whats been going on, but you just decided for me. being agender makes me trans by definition, and although i dont identify with trans a lot, its more important to stand with it right now.
i never said i didnt change genders, i just mentioned my AGAB and that i didnt realize i was agender until about a year ago. so objectively i am trans, because i dont identify with my AGAB. i see where the confusion came in tho
Thank you for this, I was going to comment the same thing. If you could change gender conversion therapy would work but we all know it doesn’t, this is an innate part of us. Instead we change what elements of our sex that are mutable to get our bodies more into alignment with who we really are
the question wasn’t whether one is mtf or ftm, but whether one is trans :)
> Also, if there's one great benefit, it's that I feel I can better stand up with my trans and enby sisters, brothers, and siblings against people trying to take our rights. There's really a need for that right now, I feel.

this. this right here.
someone mentioned this in another reply, and that, along with a few other things, has made me reconsider.
im actually really happy this got brought up in this thread, because even something as small as choosing to identify as trans could make a huge difference right now.
i get exactly what you mean. i feel like using the label takes away from the struggles and experience of fully transitioning on hrt and the like, but at the same time, those of us who arent on hrt or anything, often experience the same social struggles by identifying with a gender that is different from our AGAB.

again, its personal opinion and either way it is valid. thank you for the response!!
You should look into the term demigirl! It's what I use :)
that makes a lot of sense! i feel very similar, being agender makes using the label seem off to me personally, but i am AMAB so the one word answer would technically be yes.

thank you for the response :)
I Mean Mister Bruce Made A Whole Song Called ""I Am Disaster"", So Presumably He Does!

~~I Think I've Heard It Once I Don't Actually Remember What It's Like, I Just Felt Like Referencing It Here Because Of The Name.~~
my ideal world IS in fact one in which I could have been ""correctly assigned"" at birth, i.e., not assigned at all
Fair, but I put it in quotes to make it clear that it’s not MY thought.
> most people use 

No, they really don't. The people who do are transmedicalists, aka truscum, and they cause real harm to the trans community. They deny the validity of trans identities that don't conform to a medical essentialist viewpoint, that is, they believe that gender dysphoria is a requirement to be trans and that anyone who doesn't pursue trans*ition* isn't really trans*gender*. It is most certainly not ""totally fair.""

Sorry to be so blunt about it. This isn't a two-sides thing. Please be considerate with your language usage. <3
People arent using trans as a to mean “transitioned” though? Most people are just using it to mean “transgender”. “Trans man” is short for “transgender man”, not “transitioned man”

I do get what you mean though, and its totally valid to not identify with the label
It doesn't take away from others to use the label. Even if you just look at binary trans people, there is so much variation and not just 1 way to be trans. Not everyone has the same struggles and experiences, and that doesn't make anyone lesser or greater.
Woah, thank you!! You are awesome too. I really hope that things get better sooner than later. I try to have hope, and right now this feels like the moral choice for me. It's not a lot, but it feels right at the moment.
Fam, you literally did in your OP, lmao. “I didn’t change genders…” I’m not mad, I’m just saying that I think your experience is not unlike most trans people’s
That’s what I use too :)) it just doesn’t quite encompass my identity but I like it 🤷‍♀️
you're right, i see where i went wrong with that. thank you for pointing that out and especially for being to the point about it. looks like i still have a lot to learn.

so, my takeaway: a trans person is still trans whether they are transitioning or not. there is no requirement for being trans other than identifying with a gender that isnt your AGAB, and using the trans label is a personal choice.

also, if anyone asks, im not going to edit it out. i made a mistake and you explained why i was wrong, so i'll leave it there as an example.
yes you're right, someone pointed that out already and i apologized. it was a poorly written explanation on my part lol

edit: not apologized, the right words arent coming to mind right now but my reply is above so you can go read that. im very brain dead at the moment lol
OH LMAO im sorry i must be blind, i mean i feel as if i didnt since im agender, so its like changing to no gender, not another? idk its confusing but yes you are right
>so, my takeaway: a trans person is still trans whether they are transitioning or not. there is no requirement for being trans other than identifying with a gender that isnt your AGAB, and using the trans label is a personal choice.

Excellent takeaway.

Here's a more concrete example, in case it helps: there are folks in parts of the world where coming out as trans is a literal death sentence. Some people in those places (hell, even in places where they won't be killed) never come out, never openly identify as trans, etc. 

Making choices to protect themselves doesn't invalidate their gender, ya?

Hope that helps

"A guy messaged me on an app solely because I'm NB/pansexual and he assumed I'd be down with his ""kinks"""	"I use the term ""kink"" loosely here because this guy was more like a chaser.

A couple days ago a dude matches with me on a dating app (Hinge for anyone interested). We start chatting and pretty quickly he makes it clear he's looking for something casual, that's fine me too. But then he gets cryptic and says he's nervous about being honest. I was like oh great he's about to say something awful. Instead he explains he's bisexual and nervous about coming out. I was like ah OK no worries I get it, I didn't realize I was pansexual until last year.

But then I also mention that since I'm not a guy, I can't help him out with exploring his bisexuality. And he proceeds to say ""well I'm not really bi, im not into boys or men. I'm into trans and pegging""

He also told me he saw I was NB and pan on my profile so that's why he messaged me. He assumed that 1) because I'm NB/pan I would want to hear about his pegging kink and trans chasing fetish, and 2) he also assumed I would be down to help him out with these things. I blocked and reported him immediately.

But the encounter left me bothered. I felt like he had preyed upon me solely because of my gender identify and sexuality. I'm an androgynous, muscular woman and I take T so I look more masculine these days than I used to, and I felt like maybe he judged my appearance and made assumptions about my body. Moreso, I was upset knowing that trans people and other NB people are experiencing this same thing, and I guess it just irritates me that some men will view trans woman and androgynous AFAB NB people as nothing more than a fetish, like we only exist to get their dicks hard.

Just needed to get this off my chest. Dating has gotten much harder as I've gotten older, and now that I'm fully sterile men tend to view me as nothing more than something to try and use for unprotected sex. I'm starting to feel really uncomfortable dating men, because I'll always be wondering if the dude is just trying to use me in some way. I live in a rural conservative area so I don't meet many queer people unfortunately.

Anyone else ever run into this type of issue with dating?"	"Ha, yeah. When I still dated men I found many like this. Either on social media apps, getting sexual out of nowhere and without my consent. Or just being plain weird on dating apps. It really sucked. I'm sorry you went through that, it always made me feel icky. Sadly it's quite the norm.
A lot, _a lot_ of guys on Grindr think that I'm a trans woman. My profile literally says non-binary, but they just don't read it. I've had plenty of people insult me directly just because I'm stating some obvious facts about my androgyny, like I have no breasts, I have my chest hair, I have a voice that can make your sub woofer look like a baby camel in a thrift shop. They just react like I'm spraying lemon juice into their eyes and be extremely rude, and they're just looking for a fetish. It's a strange experience but it just happens, so I just embrace the absurd, forget them and move on.
As a trans masc, I would have cussed him out ngl

Edit: also, I've noticed people like that love to ignore non binary genders and just assume which way a person is trans and act like the victim when theyre corrected
I have started my gender journey with in the past year and so far I haven't tried dating yet. It feels like being a non-binary transmasculine humanoid makes dating so much more complicated. 

Is this person willing to accept me for me or are they trying to just get their rocks off?

Also I resonate with being sterile. I really want to be sterile. I am AFAB and the idea of getting pregnant has always sickened me and terrified me. I could never understand why until I started my gender journey. Turns out I am not a woman at all. I am not a person that resonates with having something grow inside me and change my body completely. I have worked to hard to connect with my body. So no thanks. No babies for me.
I've definitely had very similar issues. I stopped online dating a while back because I was feeling it was too much like online shopping, especially how men treated me. It's like they picked out a pair of shoes they though looked nice and would fit, and then the shoes had their own opinions and expected to have agency. No random man, you don't get to be mad that I'm an actual person.
This issue is why I became strictly t4t with a strong preference toward NB4NB or even agender4agender when I can find it. The more gay the easier it is on me.
“I’ve never slept with someone nonbinary before, want to help me mark it off my list?” x1000 🙄
I have had an issue in the past with predatory people thinking that because of the difficulty dating as Trans that I would be down for whatever they wanted. There's an assumption that we're desperate for love and attention. This is why predators often go after underage people, also oppressed groups in general. They prey on humans they presume have weak self respect and boundaries. Stay safe out there ✨
chasers are cringe
Omg that's so fucking godamn awful! I'm so sorry you had to go through that horrible interaction. He treats you as some sex object that exists purely for his enjoyment. I've noticed that a lot of cishet/cis men act this way. It's so bizarre to be so blatantly inappropriate. Like they have no shame nor accountability for their actions. They should be ashamed for the inconsiderate disrespectful dismissive things they say and hold themselves more accountable. More people should be aware of how others treat them. I'm glad you were aware that you were being mistreated by some disgusting pervert who wanted to get his dick wet.

In my expirience, as a fellow AFAB, cishet men only see me as being female, which I'm not by any means. I don't feel any sense of femineity only masculinity and agenderedness. I asked how I should get back into the dating game on r/datingadvice only for some cishet men to say I was invalid about my own god damn gender identity. I'm fortunate that no one really seemed to view me a some useless sex object but I have some doubts about my previous cishet ex bf. At this point I've come across too many indifferent bigots for dating men to be worth it to me. I'm done dating. Also I'm like demisexual and not too thrilled about sex. I'm also a virgin. I personally think it's overrated and people abuse it sometimes. I don't view it completely as a way of showing love and affection but rather a form of getting off and getting some free dopamine. ya know the whole ""love"" vs ""lust"" thing. I wish I was asexual.
See, there’s nothing wrong with preferring trans people or wanting to get pegged, but he went about it in all the wrong ways. These guys forget they’re talking to real people who have a say in what they want to do or don’t do. Did he even ask you what YOU wanted???
ew.
I’m goth AFAB, NB, childfree, and sterilized. Online dating friggin sucks men and women expect me to be down with their kids (not what CF means!) and they expect me to be hard into kink like drink their blood level kink they all want to immediately use dirty talk that revolts me. Not to mention the “don’t have to use a condom” bs. In person dating is hard because I’ve got such anxiety about connecting with humans that it’s difficult to achieve more than a “so….. wanna make out?” Which don’t get me wrong if I’m wanting that it’s fine but anything more long term is just not happening because of my emotional trauma even if I want a relationship but that’s my crap to deal with my point is online people don’t expect a real person they expect a dom/switch situation which absolutely *HAS* to be founded on mutual trust which I cannot establish at this time.  Also the minute someone says “pussy” I’m out I hate that word especially in a sexual context I also hate the word “fuck” in a sexual context for some reason.
Should we all like. . .I don't know maybe try not online dating for a while? or date other NB's? Like maybe we all collectively should like go to some LGBTQ+ social gatherings and find some fellow NB's or transgendered people and try to really connect with them and get to know them as actual people.
Truth be told I am nonbinary and afab- Maybe I'm scummy- but I'm equally as forward. 

1. Ask if you can talk about kinks. 

2. I think honesty is best policy. 

3. We can't help what we are attracted to or what we are into. 

I'm sorry about your painful dating experiences. It is hard out there but considering you're also looking for casual relationships perhaps this is why you have these encounters. Maybe seek something with more sustenance. There are some cool cis folx out there and some really uncool enby trans folx too who've done similar to me.

Also- I never know if that cis person may be questioning and actually apart of the community. I've matched with men and then um met very lovely women.
I'm sorry you've experienced the same. It's frustrating that so many cishet men view femme people as less than human. It's maddening that I can't find a single man who will treat me with respect.
Sorry you've been through all that. I've gotten much better at not letting this stuff get to me (I periodically have men tell me that they can't tell if I'm a man or woman and they don't understand its actually a compliment lol). I'm more so annoyed with the fact that it's become nearly impossible to form respectful connections with cishet guys. But I guess I'll just stop dating cishet men 🤷
or just assume which way they're assigned gender at birth is and then invalidate their transness. I feel so called out and invalidated when people assume my AGAB.
That's what will always be in the back of my mind now: does this person really like me, or am something they want to use to fulfill a sexual perversion? (I really detest trans chasers, I think it's dehumanizing. And when this guy proposed pegging and trans so quickly, I felt like I had been reduced to a sex object used to fulfill his perversions; because fetishisizing certain bodies or body parts is not a kink, it's disrespectful to the people being reduced to a sex object.)

I also wanted to say, I really resonate with your last paragraph. I didn't understand why I dealt with so much dysphoria centered around my period until I got on this journey too. I also unluckily wound up with endometriosis and PMDD, but I guess the silver lining is that I was able to get a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy thanks to those diseases, and that surgery alleviated a substantial amount of my gender-related dysphoria. Getting on a higher dose testosterone in combo with my other HRT also helped, but I also had to do a lot of mental work too. And I don't think there's a ""destination"" anyways, I see all this as just part of my journey through life and that we are always in flux and changing. Anyways, I very much feel like I wasn't meant to be born with those organs, that I wasn't meant to be a mother or nurturer in any capacity, and that a lot of experiences tied to womanhood and femininity just aren't for me. For this next part of my journey, I want to lift weights, get buffer and more masculine, and keep finding out what feels right and comfortable to me. 

But it's nice to know I'm not alone in how I feel, and you aren't alone either. I think there's probably a fair few AFAB people who feel similarly. And, life without periods, a cycle, or any of that crap is SO LIBERATING. Do not miss it one bit.
This took me ages to put together: why I was so uncomfortable with the concept of pregnancy. I assumed I was immature. Well, I'm 28, have worked in healthcare including obstetrics, and I haven't grown out of it. It only clicked a year or two ago that am not woman lol. Bebe no comin' outta me.


It was a hard conversation to have with my partner, for whom wanting a biological child was a condition of forming a long-term relationship. Surrogacy is difficult, and legally arduous in Canada.


*sigh* idk what I'm getting at. Thanks for letting me vent.
Its so affirming to see other AFAB NBs feel the same way about having children. The idea of being pregnant has always inspired a special kind of terror in me. I can't wait until I can be sterile and no longer have the ""you'll change your mind"" conversation with anyone who thinks it's their business. 

Anyone else get really pissed when people assume you're pregnant everytime you feel like throwing up?
OMG same for me too! I would have frequent pregnancy scare nightmares growing up and I could never quite wrap my head around it. Then in my high school anatomy class we learned about how the fetus is more like a parasite that feeds on the nutrients and blood of the mother and fucks with their body and brain and causes bodily transformations and I couldn't help but have a mini panic attack and hurl. 😖

No joke idk how women do it but pregnancy scares the literal shit out of me. Like who would want to venture on a 9 month body transformation and illness?! not thanks not me I'm good. It wasn't until I was 21/22 years old that I realized like ""hey, ya know maybe I can relate to this NB/transgender stuff a little"" then I explored some trans reddit subs and could learn and relate to other people's experiences of being trans and their personal gender journeys and it resonated with me and then I officially came out to my parents, friends and relatives as trans.

My dad is a super sweet guy but he casually mentions stuff like ""your kids will love these activities"" and I always find myself having to awkwardly cut him off and be like ""heheheh what kids?!"" and I feel wanting to go sterile. I'm so overly paranoid about accidentally getting pregnant even though I'm strictly a virgin that I'd just like to go ahead and get that surgery over with. Because like rapists exist and in some countries, the U.S. included it's fucking illegal to have a fucking abortion and idk I'm just paranoid.
That's exactly what it feels like!!! I feel like I'm an object that men just want to use. Cishet men have not been making me feel like I'm person based solely on how they treat me. The last guy I dated (for less than 2 weeks) was mad that I had my own opinions and got angry when I expressed them. He literally wanted to treat me like a doll, just wanted to use and show me off.
Holly fucking shit mate! you've literally nailed it! online dating really IS like shopping for a new style on Amazon! you try it out, decided it's not a good fit for you and then toss it aside like it meant literally nothing to you. Online dating is so dehumanizing and people aren't really looking to fall in love, they're looking to gain some item to please them. This one cis guy (he said he was bi but only dated women and one femboy so I thought he'd be down to be in a relationship with an NB) I dated over the summer just made out with me on our first date and never scheduled another date with me. I thought it could lead to something more and that he liked me as a person. Well maybe he did idk it just felt a little too dismissive to break things off like that. Like he didn't even seem to want to get to know me. Imagine that. Getting to know a person rather than smashing for a change. Another cis/het bloke I dated, met up with me on one date, decided that enough was enough and called things off. I suspect he just wanted to get with me during that date but I don't do the whole sex thing really.
Also trans people seem to validate others and get to know them for them and not just expect certain things or gratification from the opposite gender.
I'm sorry you've had bad experiences too. I'm about ready to give up on dating. I'm very sexual and really do love sex, but being degraded and treated like an object isn't worth a man using my body for a couple of minutes while never attending to my needs. Lately I wish I didn't like sex, and I wish I could be happy being a hermit without any need for intimacy.
He asked me if I was interested in what he was saying lol. And ya people can have preferences, but this felt like a fetish. He wasn't open about his sexuality, he had shame, he didn't want anything serious so basically means he wouldn't bring a trans/NB partner to meet his friends or family, etc. It was all wrong and felt icky.

I've met guys like this before; they're usually openly transphobic or homophobic but behind closed doors they obsess over ""trap porn"". They're ashamed of their sexuality and have internalized toxic masculinity. They don't view trans people as people, they view them as things. Things they can use for their perverted sexual fantasies. It has nothing to do with loving or respecting trans people, it's not the same as having a preference. For these types of guys their ultimate preference is domination and degradation.

This type of thing has bothered me for a long time, but I guess this is the first time I had this type of thing kind of directed at me, so I admit it got under my skin a little bit.
I wish there was a larger queer community near me so I could do this... but I'm about ready to call it quits on dating apps for good. Seems like no one enjoys it anymore.
Yeah they do! Honestly even if I wasn't a lesbo I probably wouldn't date men ever again because of this reason.
I experienced the same, unfortunately :c

Very frustrating, indeed
Well yeah cishet men are complicated like that. It's almost like they're afraid to feel the attraction and when they do they reject it violently so they don't need to think about it themselves. Not all of them of course but it sure happens a lot
Seriously, like it's not that hard to just ask someone their preferred pronouns and not worry past that but people love assuming
So an interesting part of my personal gender journey is, so far body wise I get body disphoria around my breasts and the possibility of pregnancy. I actually enjoy my menstrual cycle. So far, for now, I don't plan on taking any hormones and I don't seem to want bottem surgery either. That may change as I continue to heal and I go deeper into my own self. But so far I want top surgery and to be sterile in a way that I can never get pregnant but I am not bothered by my menstrual cycle. I prefer he/him pronouns and like being referred to in most masculine terms. I do want to work out and gain more muscle definition. This is why I feel non-binary and not a binary trans man. I am a boy with a valva and I love my valva. I do feel like I have a metaphorical penis but so far I don't feel the want to have surgery to make it a physical part of my body. I am a person living a shamanic and animistic life. I believe in the energy body and I feel that I have a penis energetically but seem to be okay with not having it physically.
>I very much feel like I wasn't meant to be born with those organs, that I wasn't meant to be a mother or nurturer in any capacity, and that a lot of experiences tied to womanhood and femininity just aren't for me. For this next part of my journey, I want to lift weights, get buffer and more masculine, and keep finding out what feels right and comfortable to me.

OMG SAME!! :D like I always felt a little weird having certain parts that I didn't really know what to do with. When I first heard about puberty in 5th grade during some sort of health class in elementary school that also felt weird that my thighs would gradually get bigger which felt even weirder as it was happening. Now I see that I don't want to deal with any female primary or secondary sex characteristics what so ever. I want to be agender and gut out all of my remaining feminine parts especially my uterus which is the single most fowl and disgusting organ I've ever had to deal with. I want to take a small amount of T. I want to feel lighter but also stronger and have more energy.  I want to feel more like an energetic care free male but without any reproductive parts. I guess that's why I recently came out as libramasculine which is a mix of agender and demiboy.

Also regarding hysterectomy, I'd want one but after telling my mom this she said that you need the hormones to keep you younger and healthier, which is why AFAB people live longer. Idk how hormones work but I don't want any long term consequences from hormonal deficits either. Regardless I'd still want that thing out of me.
No problem. I find sharing my story and experience has Immense value. Reading other people's story and experiences have been immensely helpful for me in understanding myself more fully.

I honestly don't understand why having a biological child is so important to some people. There are plenty of people already on this planet. A lot of children who already exist who could have a home. Though I know adoption is not an easier road either. 

I hope the path leads where ever is needed for you🙏.
Feeeweaakkking yes! I despise that everytime! There are so many reasons to feel like throwing up! In my personal experience that was one of the majory ways my anxiety manifested was Nausea. But oh no, growing up my mom always asked me if I was pregnant. Like no mom my home life is so abusive I want to throw up all the time thanks for that! 

P.s. F**** OFF!! Mom!

Wow I had not thought about that in years. I guess that's another reason to look back and realize that I was feeling disphoria. 

Also the ""you change your mind"" stuff! Yeah I am an adult capable of making my own decisions and deciding what is right for me! There are so many ways to live a fulfilled life without children. I am the only person who can decide what is right for me. No one gets any say so over that. 

The idea of being sterile is so gender afferming!
Yes! 

I personally am going to get a IUD when I am able to. It seems the best option for me personally. I would rather be sterilized but I think I could get an IUD sooner and easier than get sterilized. I think it would be very gender a firming for me to get sterilized but I know getting to that point will probably take time for me. So the IUD seems like a good place to start. I believe I have ADHD and remembering to take birth control consistently is very challenging and I could not handle the stress of an unwanted pregnancy. The IUD just seems like the closest I could get to being sterile without actually having surgery. Right now I am not sexually active and not actively seeking sexual contact with anyone. But the IUD is on my list of get done this year for personal radical responsibility!

I also want to stab someone in the eye when they pull the whole ""when you have kids."" Shtick. No thank you. There are so many other ways to have a fulfilling life without having children.
You deserve better, and good job for recognizing that
Yeah, I totally get it. All of those things taken in isolation (being closeted, wanting casual stuff, kinks, etc.) wouldn’t be alarming if he showed any interest in you as a person. That’s how you know it’s a fetish and your instincts were right. 

I’m sorry that happened. I don’t date men, so my experiences are different (which isn’t to stay it never/won’t happen to me or others, it just hasn’t so far). I hope you found some support in this thread ❤️
omg yays go off!

\[Okay devils advocate time\]: So throughout history, the traditional male x female heterosexual relationship is the foundational basis in many cultures around the world. The stereotypical family has a man, a woman, and their biological kids. Because this is such a deep-rooted systemic culture that has been conditioned into all of our core beliefs since we were very young, everyone just assumes this is normal and to be expected. Some parents are very good at raising kids and genuinely enjoy it and want their kids to feel the enjoyment they do and have their own kids.

This however is not the case. Every person is different. Just because the majority of people throughout history and different civilizations had kids in the traditional sense, it holds no weight nor baring over people in the present nor should it. People want different things out of life, they want to have different life styles and that's a good thing. There's already a high population and a lot of parentless kids who need to be adopted. Hell, the idea that we live in a grand age of technological and biological innovation means that we can look however we want with whatever primary and secondary sex characteristics we want. I just love hearing about people's stories and how they've really come into their own uniqueness and it's really wholesome. These people have effectively set the stage for generations to come of people truly being themselves. People should be free to look how they want and have the life style that they want and they should be respected and accepted for it especially by their families and significant others. <3
Yaaays! you should definitely get one! from what I hear it's a simple process. My roommate had bad period cramps and liked to fuck so she got one. She said that sometimes it can even stop periods but I think that's the one that comes with hormones? Like I hate having periods and I'm also OCD about the birth control pills so being steril and not having a period would be pretty gender affirming. My mother had a hysterectomy after menopause because my family apparently has some reproductive genetic medical problems so I might at some point have to get a hysterectomy which I don't look forwards to because surgery makes me queeasy. And I don't want to rely on sex for dopamine. I think it's stupid. I just want to be asexual and be content with my life as a loner. Asexual people know where it's at. And I will never have sex until I'm like super sterile or maybe not even ever?? It's just not worth the pregnancy risk man. Condoms or no condoms I refuse to have sex in case something goes wrong.
Yes! We live in such a different world than people in the past. Our lives can look pretty much however we want and it's amazing! I am excited to see where my journey takes me in life. One day at a time, one step at a time. I am grateful that I don't have to live the preprogrammed life. That's just not for me. So many seem to be finding that the preprogrammed life doesn't bring them true happiness. I know it did not for me. Now I know there are some people in which that life does being happiness and that's okay. But it makes sense to me that not everyone is built the same and there for would want to live a a different kind of life.
Right! no one is expected to live how they had to live in the goddamn 1800's. People should be free to live however they want to and it's no body's business how they live their life. Life tends to be better when people dump societal norms and just do whatever they wished, like whatever their true deepest desires are but they never let float to the surface in fear of not fitting in. Love is love and people are people. As long as they're happy that's all that matters! :D
Agreed! I have been doing a lot of personal healing myself so I have been learning what my authentic heart path is! It's wonderful and I am so happy I chose to heal!

Thanks for the conversation. It's been really lovely. Sometimes I don't get all that much social interaction. Ha ha."	y3s934	NonBinary	186	0.98	2022-10-14 12:11:11
"Ms. ""YOU CANT BUY MENS BOXER BRIEFS"" is at it again..."	"So my sister has a few trans and non-binary friends how she has managed to keep them as friends idk but today she was saying that one of her friends changing their name and pronouns around every now and then was a ""red flag"". Of course I tried to pipe in with the fact that it takes a few tries sometimes to find ones that are right and viewing that as a toxic trait is messed up. Of course my sister took ofense to this. She expressed that she doesn't agree with me on a lot of my ""opinions"" when it comes to trans and non-binary people but she wouldn't elaborate on that. So I tried to move on from the convo note TRIED. She continued talking crap about her non-binary friend and so I pointed out that we had young kids in the room with us and speaking so hatefully and negatively about trans and non-binary people could cause mental health challenges for them if they ever discovered similar things about themselves so we needed to be way more respectful and accepting in our language. Of course she pulled the ""I have trans friends I can't be transphobic"" card. So then I said how about we change the topic. This made her go on and on about all the ways she wasn't transphobic explaining how she doesn't hate trans people or non-binary people she just doesn't agree with everything they do. (Once again refusing to elaborate) I finally had to leave the room and I decided to let the kids know later that her behavior was not acceptable and that I would try my best to defend them if any of them ever discovered that they were trans or non-binary how ever that entire interaction left a bad taste in my mouth."	"from a trans nonbinary person, that person is hella transphobic and hella toxic and they need to work on themselves instead of judging better people to try and drag them town to their level.
She keeps those friends because A) she knows better and doesn’t say that transphobic shit in front of them and/or B) they aren’t real friends (possibly not real people) and/or C) her friends are all masochists whose kink is transphobia. Leaning towards A and B.
First and foremost, kudos to you for following up with those kids. You did the right thing to help counteract the general sentiment of distrust your sister is putting out there.

As for your sister, she sounds very much like the sort of “liberal” thinking person who thinks their progressive simply because they don’t actively advocate for violence against an oppressed group. In turn, she immediately feels attacked as soon as a person in that group does something that makes her a little uncomfortable or that she’s unwilling to critically analyze. I’m sorry you have to take the brunt of that - you deserve better than having to take the intentional aggressions of a family member head on.
You dealt with this so well! What a great role model for the kids
>she doesn't hate trans people or non-binary people she just doesn't agree with everything they do.

She doesn't hate us, she just hates the things we do to survive...
> ""changing their name a few times is a red flag""

Boy would she hate me, I changed it over a hundred times in like the last 2 fucking years. Hopefully the one I got now is here to stay! It's been a week, so far I like it still.
""I'm saying transphobic bs about my trans friend but I have trans friends, so I can't be transphobic""

Its trial and error i think ive changed my name 3 times in a week because i want something with a nice ring to it and more suits me so she would hate me equally asmuch 😂

So, would you like to hear about how cephalopods will one day rule?

And, as many here have mentioned, this is very cozy feeling
Nudibranchs they're just so groovy
We have the same cardi!!
As I was saying, the orca is badass
Does my Lord and Savior Cthulhu count?
I’d say jellyfish. Or maybe a Manatee.
ummm hiiiii so anyways manatees are endangered and so if you see one while swimming you aren’t supposed to touch it but if it comes to you and touches your hand you can touch it but only with one hand
I mean, dragonfish must be the best option yeah, translucent creatures are just better
Oh you look bored when I talk about squid lol
I love love love cuttlefish! The first most obvious fact is it's well know that smaller males will 'cosplay' as females by tucking their extra arms in and changing their colors.💛🤍💜🖤 Not only is this a tactic to sneak past and get close to females, but females seem to prefer the smart and cunning smaller males as aposed to the bigger more aggressive males🥹🥹. The small males disguised as females seemed to have no issue with the other males seeking their attention/affection/mating advances. NOW their light display?? We all know that octopuses use their chromatophors to hide, intimidate, imitate, and display themselves, but only cuttlefish ✨️strobe out✨️ to use as a hypnotic ploy to confuse and stun their prey! They look like adorable underwater ufos!! And noting their camouflage abilities: Cuttlefish are SO adept to their color changing AND texture changing abilities, they've been shown to do fairly good job tackling never seen before and man-made patterns like checkerboards! They can even change to blend their background in complete darkness (so it's not solely based on visual input!). Not only that- they engage in play! They will entertain themselves when bored, which only a handful of highly intelligent species have shown to exhibit. 
Okay- special interest rant over 😅😅
Oh my god. You look like me, but so much more androgynous!!!! This just made me incredibly
happy agahshaha
The octopus is my all time favourite and I could talk about them for hours but syphonophores are so insane I'll never get over than they're so fascinating I'll always try to bring them up
Yes
Octopus as well here! I have a full octopus half sleeve I love those little guys !!

I made my mother cry, does anyone know how to comfort her?	"I am Non binary and I told my mother as such a few days ago. She did not take it well and the past days have been icy. We were in the car and she asked if I was mad at her. I told her yes, and explained that I felt disrespected and was angry at how she had responded. We argued for a bit but finally got to a place of understanding, and she asked me if there was anything else. I asked her to stop calling me her daughter and I think that was the last straw. She started to tear up but composed herself quickly. I gave her a hug but it doesn’t look like she feels any better.

I feel awful and want to comfort her. I wrote her a little love note and plan to make some little origami flowers and bake her favorite cookies. But I feel like I would be buying her off if I did that. Am I overthinking it or should I do something different? I hate that I hurt her, but what’s done is done, and I’m in disaster relief mode.

Any help appreciated <33"	"If you didn't say it already, you may want to be sure you're clear that you're still her _child_ even if you don't want to use the title ""daughter"" anymore.

Try to focus on the word while making sure she understands that the parent/child relationship is still there. As you phrased it here, ""stop calling me your daughter"", _could_ be interpreted as a breaking of the relationship, not as a changing of the terminology. Especially in a conversation that's already charged, and where you've already admitted you're mad at her.

Other than that, give her time, but be strict with boundaries. It's not your job to comfort her, but she's your mom and you sound like you want to help. Just don't be guilty about it, as her pain isn't anyone's ""fault"". It's something she's got to go through, and you can empathize and help her as her child, but it's no one's _fault_ that she's hurt right now.
Sometimes it just takes some time.  I know it’s not necessarily the same, but when I first came out to my mom she started crying because she has this notion that I wasn’t going to have the pretty white wedding dress she always imagined for me.  I told her that even if I hadn’t come out, I was more likely to wear a suit to my own wedding.
If you want to make her feel better you can do those things, I think that's thoughtful, but don't feel like you need to comfort her if she's the one that doesn't understand, but expecially respect you. 
For example, if she's just shocked and worried about you and your relationship, your letter, cookies and origami will make her understand that you are still the same person (but more aware of yourself) and you love her. I she's sad because you are not cis and she feels like she failed in parenting you for that, or something similar... I wouldn't do it in that case
I don't know what you should do, but I can tell you that I think that your mom loves you and she just needs some time. And I think that in time things will turn out alright for both of you in your relationship. That's just my guess based on what you wrote. I don't know what you're feeling, but have faith in each other!! Never goes wrong.
Gift giving is a valid love language and along as you don't go overboard with opulence. It's not buying her off! It is a sign of care love and affection!
Everyone is different, and feelings are complicated, so sadly there's no easy answer.

One thing to keep in mind is that this is big news for her, and that for your whole life, she has seen you as her daughter. This spans far back to well before you have any memories, and she has monyhs and years of memories with her baby girl that she likely now feels are tainted. She is going to be mourning that loss, even though she still has you. That's likely something only time will heal.

Patience is one of the biggest things you can give, and that goes both ways. Hopefully she has that same patience with you as you discover yourself more. I really hope you find your balance with your mom. All my love to you.
Not all tears are necessarily tears of sadness, sometimes just an overload of feelings and thoughts just result in crying.

Let your mother know you love her, and that you know she loves you. Keep it up with the hugs and other signs of affection.

Something that might be comforting to her could be telling her you've always been and always will be her kid, just not her daughter.
When you come out to someone like a spouse or parent, they are having to deal with a lot of complicated thoughts and emotions around how they see you. Processing that stuff takes time and it's not fair to expect that they're gonna be fully on board in a few days. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a little peace offering and acknowledging that this is a scary and confusing thing for her. It's OK to assert your identity and your needs, but it's also important to recognize that the ""mother daughter"" relationship as a concept is very important to some mothers and has a lot of stuff bound up in it. Telling her you didn't want to be called her daughter any more was a moment that was very significant in terms of what it meant (or she imagined it meant) to her as a mother. She can't yet look forward to what she's gaining in your relationship because she still had to understand and grieve what she's lost.

All of this applies even IF the person you are coming out to is very accepting in general of queer identities and concepts.
If she doesn't respect you then it is not your job to comfort her.  She is crying because you do not conform to her cisheteronormative view of the world and she sees that as a bad thing.  Why is that deserving of comfort?
If you have come to a place of understanding and you all just feel a little rocky with the whole interaction I think doing something nice for her to show and tell her you still love her is okay and isn’t buying her off!  

Hard situation I can imagine the weird feelings in the air about the whole argument and information sharing. It actually sounds like you did a really good job. You were clear, firm, and I think loving with your note and feelings. Can’t ask for anything more it’s just hard for some people to hear and process.
I feel this with my parents I had to break it down that I’m still their child. That no love is lost I’ll always be their baby. But I found out the gender that I’ve been told to present as doesn’t feel right anymore. That the only thing that changed was how I see myself and how I want them to view me. So that could help, while also given the gifts so she understands.
I think those gestures are great and aren't buying her off. You are showing that you still love her and that you care about the relationship you have with her.

I also want to +1 the point of making sure she still knows you're her child and not wanting her to use the word daughter is about that word (presumably) and not about you feeling like she's no longer you mom or something like that. Explaining that it's about your gender identity and not your relationship may help her understand and make it easier.
In your mom's mind, her relationship with you is tied up with what she perceived as your gender. She's lost the ""gender"" part of it, and it probably feels to her like she's losing the relationship along with it. It may help to explain that you're not her daughter only because ""daughter"" implies ""girl"". Ask her to think of how she feels when she thinks of ""my daughter"". All the warm feelings of love and care and memories, and ask her to put all those feelings into the word ""child"" instead. You are still her child, she is still your mother. The only thing that's changed is a word.

I'm working through a similar issue with my dad. He was always proud of his two little girls (I have a twin sister), and I've explained to him that I'm still his little girl, I'm just his little girl who isn't a girl. If that makes sense.
It's weird that she puts you in a situation where you need to comfort her.
Sending you love 💕 you are not responsible for her pain nor is it your responsibility to comfort her. Please do not feel guilty or regretful for sharing something so important with your mom. Humans need time more than anything, both of you do. Do not feel burdened or charged with the duty of being her therapist. It would be much more worth your time to focus on what you are feeling now, independent of her reaction and emotions! You did a big thing, and you are further asking in your path! Focus on what that feels like. 💜
Try to educate her on what Non-binary means WITH FACTS and how you fall into it. Sometimes it is just a lack of understanding and we shouldn't lash out at those for not fully understanding.
From the story as you told it, it doesn’t sound like you did anything wrong. You just told your mom your gender and she had a confused reaction to it which made you feel angry. Then you explained how that made you feel. That sounds like emotional maturity. Without knowing any other details it sounds like your mom has beliefs and emotions of her own that she needs to sort out on her own time, and there isn’t much you can do about that. My mom is going through sort of the same thing.
There is NEVER anything wrong with cookies and origami flowers omg. Go for it, it's absolutely darling. You don't owe her an apology and I hope you don't dream of making one, but acts of love are always good!

It's okay that your mom feels like crying. It doesn't mean you did anything wrong. It just means she's taking you seriously! I bet she has a lot of feelings attached to the idea of your mother/daughter relationship. I bet she doesn't even HAVE an idea about what a mother/nonbinary child relationship could feel like. She always thought she knew what was going on with your gender, and now she realizes she didn't. Loss of certainty hurts. There's no getting around that. There's just recovering from the surprise, reaffirming the relationship, and moving forward into a bright future where you both get to know who you are.
Your parents job at this point is to love and support you. 
She should look to people who are not you to process her feelings about gender. 
You are not obligated to comfort her in this time.
Get her some T and an aromatase inhibitor. That'll make her not cry as much ([/s](https://toneindicators.carrd.co/#masterlist))
If she's the type to stress over crap like this, she's probably the type to be bought off like that. Just tell her you're still her oldest/youngest/middle/whatever you are child and she's still your mum all the same
Never comfort transphobe. They are not worth it and it's about our existence not their feelings. You didn't hurt her. You told her something important about you and every good parent would have be there for you. Supporting you. Not making it about herself and her feelings. People who react like that don't love you. They only love the idea of having daughter. People who need time ask it. Don't tantrum like a toddler.

If she comes to you and want to ask questions to understand it's different thing. I would answer her. After she apologized without you asking it.
Hey, you don't owe her anything. You are not responsible for her happiness, you are responsible for yours. She needs to understand how you feel and know that person she thought you were, is not who you really are.
Oh, she needs more time. As a parent myself, it would feel like I missed out on something, that I should’ve known/guessed already somehow, that I wasn’t there for you while you were going through something, that you’re moving somewhere I can’t reach/don’t fully understand - there are so many things I can imagine relating to. I think crying is a genuine gut reaction and one that would be normal for any parent at first. I hope you both figure it out together x
Coming from personal experience, reassuring her that whilst you’re not her ‘daughter’ you’ll always be her child and that you do still love her even though it can take some adjusting on her end, can do wonders!! 
As others have stated she likely just needs some time to process this, congrats on coming out as well btw it’s an incredibly brave thing to do from your end and I have mad respect 🫂
Oh I never thought of that! Yeah I think she might have interpreted it that way too :/
I’ll try my best to reassure her. Thanks for the advice <33
Adding on here, this was really hard for my mom too when I came out. We wound up sitting down and googled something along the lines of ""what to call your nonbinary child. We found the term Sprague, still not entirely sure what it means but it made both of us laugh and so that's what we go with now! 
 
While I'm sure the initial loss of a ""daughter"" is hard, no one is really losing anything here and it's a moment for you two to build together. 
Best wishes OP
Such good advice. I wish I’d known this when I was going through it!
This is actually really good advice. OP were here for you regardless of the outcome.
Thanks for the advice! Yeah I think she’s just confused right now :/
Thanks so much!! 💕💕
Thank you so much <33 I’ll try my best with the patience :]
Even my mom, who is pretty supportive and has always been a queer ally, had some hard moments when I first came out. She always wanted a girly daughter (I tried) and she had to let go of some of her dreams for me when I came out. She never really blamed me for it though and now has new dreams for me. Coming out can be rocky for everyone even though it’s not anybody’s fault. Hopefully over time things get better :)
I think she is just shocked more than anything. It’s really big news for her. Though you are right about the conforming things. That’s what we were fighting about before she started crying
Yeah that makes sense. If you have any tips on how to show her that, that would be great! Also good luck with your dad <33
She’s my mom though, and we’ve always had a rocky relationship. I just don’t want to kill something so new :/
Thanks so much : ] <33
Thanks. Good luck with your mom <3
Oh she loves tea! That’s a good idea thanks 💕
Thanks <33
Thanks so much! 💕💕
I hope so! Good luck <3
When we get scared our hearts can close down. Always helpful to have someone help you keep connection!
I understand. My mother and I also were having trouble with each other after I came out. 
In my situation she had a ""griefing process"" but she came around while I stayed with my girlfriend. Maybe your mom is doing the same. 
Make sure to let her know that you're still her child. But you're not her therapist, if the situation gets too much for either of you, spend some time apart from each other. It helped my situation at least
Thanks friend
Are you being goofy back or did you not get the joke?
Yeah we’ve kinda been “coexisting” in a sense. We don’t hang out as much but she will still play cards with me and stuff
Omg I get that now! It totally went over my head 🤦😂"	10r0v19	NonBinary	158	0.99	2023-02-01 17:44:40
Im not the only one who feels uncomfortable at people trying to have divisions in the nonbinary community by their agab, right??	"I get it if your afab and want to ask someone with experience chest binding, or if your amab asking about how to tuck. Or if you want to talk to a group of people who use the same label as you (like agender or genderfluid people) but like. I saw a comment on a different sub and it was like ""does anyone know a discord for amab enbys?"" And I felt. I dunno. Uncomfy? I'm not amab myself but id feel the same if someone said so for afab, too.

And I've seen it, a lot? For enby agab in general. I really don't like the idea of there being a division in the community because of people's agab. Yes, different people have different experiences but why is agab the center of that? It feels a bit invalidating. Because does that mean some people will only see that im afab-? And disregard the fact that dispite being afab, im still enby?

I dunno. It.. it makes me feel uncomfortable. Unless there are specific questions that have to do with being afab or amab things then it shouldn't have to be relevant. Am I overthinking this..?

Edit: thank you to the people in the comments. I'm not alone on this one but some also explained different viewpoints and I am thankful for that. I'm a bit more understanding but I still feel a little uneasy. I'll have to work on that"	"While I ultimately agree with you, as a counterpoint I could see why someone in the beginning of their NB/trans acceptance would seek out other people with similar bodies and experiences (like looking for an AMAB discord). This is because the very little amount of visibility we (NBs) have in media is overwhelmingly white able-bodied thin AFAB folks, and this even frustratingly bleeds over into things like fashion and marketing. Don't get me started on how I've been excited about a gender neutral brand before only to discover that their ""neutral"" clothing basically treats us as woman-lite and has fits made for curvy bodies. Big oof. That lack of representation compounds trans imposter syndrome exponentially! And I think some AMAB folks need extra support before they accept their gender and feel ready to let go of the AGAB.

But yes, I don't think that ghettoizing enbies by AGAB in the long run is a good thing. At the same time, if it doesn't hurt anyone then why be bothered? NB is a huge umbrella. I just assume it's coming more from the outside and internalized NBphobia. Does that make sense?
exactly, we're non-binary, we're not focused on agab/sex we're focused on gender, it makes me uncomfy/dysphoric
I think you’re spot on. It too makes me uncomfortable.  I have actually been asked by people what my agab is and it feels so invalidating. Also it makes me hella bothered how concerned anyone is by what parts I have in my pants.
I agree with that. Alongside the Pride groups at my university, there are also Women and Men specific mental health groups. They are very closely tied to the Pride groups and are always welcoming to NB's but it feels weird to try and join either group based on my agab. I can't really relate to either group obviously, and it feels weird when people are encouraged to join one of the two groups based on their agab. I'd rather just avoid both.
Off topic, meant to lighten the mood as I'm commiserating and agree with your points, not trying to be an ass.... 

I'm just going to start telling people I'm ANOYDBAB. assigned none of your damn business at birth😝 which it spelling annoyed is hilarious lmao.🥴
First off: I love how respectful and kind everyone is! It warms my little heart. 
Secondly: I can see why groups or divisions in enby community by agab would be uncomfortable or triggering for some people.
Thirdly: as an amab enby myself it would be lovely to find a place where the proportion of representation for people who look more like me is higher. It is often hard to feel welcomed and real in some parts of the enby and trans communities. 

I am very ""masculine"" presenting. I am 6'2"", over 220lbs, have a very deep voice, and wear a beard. If I walk into a space meant for and peopled by afab enbys, I stick out like a sore thumb. I also understand that due to my appearance/ presence I can be triggering for some people. That's OK and I try not to be hurt or take it personally, buts it can  be hard. So, finding a place where I visually fit in better would be nice. 🙂🙂🙂❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
This.

...having to explain to people on trans subs how fucking cooked it is to call somebody a “male to non binary” or “female to non binary” 🙄
I see exactly where you're coming from, and I see why you'd avoid it, but for me (trans guy) a lot of posts made for trans fem people would make me dysphoric in a weird way? for that reason I did gravitate towards places for trans masculine people, because it can actually help me, with ways to help dysphoria, transition planning, and support in general
While I don't think I would be uncomfortable like you say, I personally don't see any use or benefit to such a distinction being made. If amab or afab non-binary folks want to have their own little spaces, that's fine with me, but I don't think it should be at the expense of the non-binary community as a whole. We have a lot more in common than we have to separate us, and there's safety in numbers.
I totally understand your uncomfortableness with it, but I also think you are being a bit too critical of folks who do seek out those spaces. There are a lot of reasons someone may want the space, say a group chat or discord or post, dedicated to an exclusive agab or transmasc/transfem experience. I can also agree that general posts could/should be worded to be inclusive for everyone for discussion, but someone should still be allowed to ask for specifics too. If you are feeling left out from a group, you should know that group is not intended for you, so there is nothing to be left out of. If someone makes a transfem discord its not to put down cis or transmasc people, its to support and lift transfem folks. The communities exist so that folks can share their lived experiences without having to defend, explain, or sensor them as much.
for me, i mostly seek out non-binary community to talk about medical transition, and it can feel weird among my amab friends  for me to talk about hating my hips, wanting more body hair, etc because they want the opposite. for me, it’s not that i just want community who identifies as non-binary, i want community in the form of gender nonconforming/medically transitioning afab people, whether that’s butch women, transmen, or non binary afab people. hence my desire for “afab groups”.
Yea I definitely feel dysphoric being separated from groups based on my agab, for me it feels similar to trans-women being excluded from women only spaces. 

I understand if people wanna talk about transition goals, binding, etc. with similar bodied individuals, but it kinda feels like takes away the point of being non-binary in the first place.

In the example of trans-women being excluded from women only spaces you could use the same point that the cis women want to talk about things that are specific to their bodies, and I would personally see that as a similar justification. You could also argue that non-passing trans-women could trigger traumatized cis women in these spaces, but I still think that it would be awful to exclude trans-women from these spaces.

That's just my take on the issue, if anyone can enlighten me as to why this issue isn't the same I'd be happy to listen to your perspective!
God, a sex-specific discord would make me so damn dysphoric, since it's everything I want to avoid. I guess if it works for them then I'm happy to space is there, but that's definitely not for me.
I don’t think we should discourage anyone from creating afab/amab non-binary spaces because we all still have this space to use to talk about all of our similarities. I see it less as dividing the community and more as just sub-communities within the larger community. We’re all still non-binary
Some NB people also reinforces the binary. These people can feel unconnected to their enbyhood and they'll use ""simplest"" ways to ""fit"" in the nonbinary term. 
That's our problem, we need to discuss about nb identities even more. I'll do my part.
Yeah- i 100% get that. I understand that some people have different bodies and people would want to talk to others similar to themself, but some of it is.. weird? I guess. Like an enby saying ""show me your afab pixie haircuts!!"" When- agab should not be a factor?? I agree that it can be harder for amab people to come out because it isn't as socially acceptable nor do amab have as much representation(not that enbys as a whole have all that much, anyways). But I guess it's more case by case-? But I'd feel pretty bad if I was excluded from a group or discussion because of my agab when we're all enby? I dunno if that makes any sense. I'm just rambling aa
Isn’t it reasonable though for an afab person to want a space to talk about their afab-specific experiences?
I love that! Lmao
♥️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍

Thank you and thank you and sending all the love.

I don't have the words for why I needed this today but it resonates.
I understand that. Maybe im be a little too sensitive? Its something I'm gonna have to work on.

I also wanted to add that I understand that its more socially acceptable for someone that afab to come out as enby compared to someone that is amab. Not only that but amab suicide rates is staggering, because of the kind of world we live in. And I really admire people that are able to live as their authentic self openly dispite how messed up things are. So don't forget that you are so valid💛🤍💜🖤

But also thank you for taking the time to tell me a bit more so I can understand better. It means a lot!
I get that too. But it feels like my agab shouldn't determine if I should or shouldn't at least be in the room to give support, y'know? I dunno. Itd probably be a little dysphoria triggering because someone is then only seeing my agab, and not that I'm enby too. To me- it almost feels similar to misgendering? 

I dunno. But.. I get your point. Thank you.
Can you clarify what you mean by using the simplest ways to fit in the nonbinary term?
Is it though? I'm not sure how to suggest this gently, so forgive me if I'm clumsy about it, but I know that personally I've projected a lot of my own feelings and took someone else's trans needs personally because I was feeling my own imposter syndrome. Some folks might just need a space to rant and talk about being NB with people who understand feminization needs, or talk about how they don't know if they're demiboy or agender, or being black and NB, etc. Etc. It doesn't invalidate you or anyone else.
i get that but at the same time i feel like amab/afab specific discord servers just separate us further idk, it's hard to decide on how i feel about this. i get what you mean tho
Thank you for being so understanding, and voicing your questions. That takes a lot of courage!
the person who needs support can ask who they get it from. sometimes there is a lot of safety in knowing something like “the selfie channel in this discord will only have transfem individuals like me.” of course you can give support too, but someone may need to hear it from someone in shoes more like theirs. 

sometimes, even within community, we have incompatible needs. your dysphoria is understandably triggered by your agab, but that’s not true for everyone. and someone’s dysphoria may be triggered from hearing about or seeing something from someone of another agab. both of these experiences are valid, we luckily have the resources to create communities to help with both, they just can’t always be the same ones.
I mean, these ""simplest ways to fit in the non binary term"" is about the stereotypical and archetypal of enbiehood.
I get that but I'm mostly talking about the agab part. I guess I'm still pretty insecure about my agab and thats no one else's fault but my own. It might be good for some others but its not my thing. I don't want to be seen as my agab, I want to be seen as me.
Thats true, too. Thank you for the reminder!
That's why some enbies use binary terms to ""find themselves"", they can't fit in those stereotypes and archetypes of enbiehood. So they'll use these ways to try to find themselves, it can helps, but not enough.
Stop seeking out the existence of spaces that make you feel invalidated? Most of these online spaces are cesspools and full of trolls. If you’re in a space and most of the posts are triggering you should consider that may be the point and gtfo.
Awesome, thank you!
What? Did I say something wrong?
Just looking out for you. These spaces don’t hurt you by existing, and their point isn’t to single you out or hurt you. So stop focusing on them or you’re discriminating. Which is ironic because you feel like they’re discriminating, but they aren’t.
Wow- ok. You do you. You apparently haven't read any of my other replies on this post, and thats ok. But please don't put words in my mouth. All I said was that it makes me feel uncomfortable, but others have explained the other side and I understand it. It just isn't for me and that's ok. Just be cause I feel uncomfortable about my agab doesn't mean everyone else is, too. I'm not seeking out anything, I was just voicing what I felt in the moment but I understand about more now.

How I accidentally came out to my entire gym class, 4chan style	"- Be me
- Be agender
- they/them pronouns
- only ones who know are my friends 
- they call me my preferred name
- some popular girl hears and asks why they call me Ardyn
- i tell her why
- later in the locker room she asks if she can tell about my name
- thinks she means only her friends
- says yes
- she stands up on the locker room seats and announces that I'd like to be called Ardyn
- SHIT.jpeg
- people start asking questions about name changes and pronouns and stuff
- best friend pitches in to help explain
- popular girl says she supports me all the way
- other people call me Ardyn
- smiles big
- changes out of gym clothes and leaves
- mind blown"	"> popular girl says she supports me all the way

That's very heartening. Glad this turned out well for you!

Fucking kids these days lol, being all accepting and shit.
They already knew. They were just giving you the push you needed to get out there. :-) 
Congrats!! Even though I'm sure it was nerve-wracking to accidentally come out, it'll probably benefit you in the long run, and it sounds like people were really good about it.

"""Why are you a girl?"""	"I was at the dog park with a friend and her 3 year old, when he asked me this question.

Kid: ""Why ah you a gworl?""    
Me: [confused face because I didn't quite understand his toddler-speak]    
Friend: ""Are you asking if youcanseemyface is a boy or a girl?""    
Kid: ""Sh mommy I'm talking to *him*. Why are you a girl?""    
Me: ""I have no idea. Cosmic mistake, most likely.""   

We then explained that some people aren't boys or girls and that I was somewhere in between. He accepted this fact then went back to playing with the dogs."	"Wish all adults could take things for fact and go play with the dogs too.

Gotta love kids :)
Adults have a lot to learn from kids!
Looking amazing ! Love your hair
Very gender. Much wow. Love it!
It would be a great name for a band, also. 😄

As a Father.	My child (11 years old) came to my wife today after school ad said that they don't feel like they associate with either boys or girls. My wife explained what it means to be NonBinary and they're eyes lit up. She asked them if they preferred to be called they/them over he/him and they said yes. I love my child with all my heart and only want them to be happy no matter what. That being said I want to show my support in whatever way I can. My question is this, what are things that your parents either did or maybe you wished they did to show they're support? I'm not looking for any grandiose things but little things that I can do in this adjustment period. Any advice is greatly appreciated.	"Taking them to buy some more gender neutral clothes might interest them. Spending time learning about nonbinary people with them as an activity could be fun. Most important is validating their identity, so finding ways to incorporate nonbinary-ness into stuff they already enjoy is a great way to start.
Explain to other people what non-binary is if your child does not feel comfortable explaining
'Quiet' support and acceptance goes a long way. Essentially, just treating the things they want as normal. The clothes they want, the hobbies and interests they have, the people they'll eventually like, etc. It doesn't have to be big declarations of, ""I support you!!"" to be meaningful. How would you be supporting them if they hadn't come out? Do that. 

As a parent of a maybe-trans kid myself, I also recommend doing some reading to help understand more deeply what your child is going through, and may go through in the future. I read [this book](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-transgender-child-a-handbook-for-families-and-professionals_stephanie-a-brill/528166/item/4192395/?gclid=CjwKCAjwo8-SBhAlEiwAopc9W_UvhrAiDdrk0uvqKI2SyGFA1sZ_5gX-tMAMmryR-qjIfWqVCHFrcBoCouYQAvD_BwE#idiq=4192395&edition=5687377) and found it helpful (it also helped me realize I'm trans but that's another story). [The Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) is also a great resource.
My big thing is this: If your kid experiences gender dysphoria, just be there for them, all you can do is ask how to support them on particular days. Your kid will know what is going on in their body but may not understand or know how to communicate it, which is going to make things hard. Patience is key. You’re already do a great job by reaching out on here, keep trying to educate yourself. Thank you for being a supportive parent <3
I wish my parents would have let me experiment and try things out. It's extremely important to have a positive space to try out new things and see what works. Otherwise you end up repressing things that pop up later in chaotic ways and you become a mess... I'm sure many people can relate.

Just give them a confidence boost, make sure they never change who they are for anyone, that's really all I could ever dream for :)
First of all: Love your child the way they is.
Support them.
Maybe they wish a nonbinary name? Maybe you can help with that. Finding a new name is a big challenge for many NB.


I would suggest to find films and books you can read / watch together.
Examples are listed in this wiki article:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_non-binary_characters

Btw i love Star Trek Discovery, they managed to display queerness in general as NORMAL. You see gay, bisexual, trans, etc. The change in referring to Adira with they them their is done within Seconds and has no discussion. Everyone just takes this as normal. 


And on this page you will find books:
https://perpich.mn.gov/books-with-transgender-non-binary-characters/

There are a couple of good collections with links, like this one:
https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Support-Resources-for-Families-of-Gender-Diverse-Youth.aspx
Great suggestions here. I'd add help them find community (if they want it). If you have queer friends, ask them and your child if they'd like to have lunch together and talk. Google around to see if there's a kid-friendly LGBTQ+ meet-up or group in your area. If they're having struggles, see if you can find them a therapist who is also nonbinary. It sounds like you are doing an AWESOME job being a supportive parent for your child, but you can't do it all on your own! Bringing other queer role models into their life can make a big difference.
Call them by their correct name and pronouns, and of you slip up don’t make it into a big deal and just coreect yourself and keep going with the conversation. 

Ask your kid what they would like to be called, for example ‘your kid’ over ‘your son’ and ‘grandkid’ over ‘grandson’ etc. 

Don’t assume anything other non-binary people say to be your kids thing. One person may like to be called they/them, another person might not. Basically don’t assume anything and ask your kid what _they_ prefer, instead of looking online at general advice. 

If your kid wants to change things in school, like their name or pronouns etc, fight for them and make sure they change it. If they don’t, and you are able to, get your kid to a school that will. But fight for them whenever you can.

The little like correcting other people when they misgender your kid is one of the most important ones, especially in the beginning as your kid might be too scared to correct people themselves. (For example, my partner is the one who corrects her parents, even though I know I can too, but I am too nervous myself, whereas if they misgendered someone else I would totally stand up for them, etc).

Don’t tell them ‘I still love you regardless’ as it’s pretty condescending and makes non-binary seem like a bad thing that even though that, you still love them. Instead say things like ‘I will always love you’ and ‘nothing would ever change my love for you’ etc. Not everyone interprets it in a bad way, but for me and my friends it definitely came over hurtful, even if not meant in that way. 

And just talk to your kid. Tell them if anything ever changes they can always come to you, and just be there for them and support them in what they need. They will come to you when they need to!
It sounds like you have a trusting relationship if they felt comfortable to come out to you, so you are already smashing it as parents! If you have the money offer to take them out to do some clothes shopping if they'd like a more diverse or gender neutral wardrobe. Don't out them to anyone without their agreement
If they decide to go by a different name than their birth name, making the effort to respect that and use it is huge. I was once on a Zoom call with someone who had ignored my display name and told everybody my legal name (and this person has a trans daughter, so I have no idea why they did that apart from maybe pure cluelessness?), and my mother made a point of using my preferred name without making a big deal out of it or explicitly correcting the person. That meant a lot to me.
Okay this post made me sob a bit because wow I wish my parents were like that- 
Be there for your child, use their preferred pronouns, let them experiment with their clothes or how they present in general, just love them as who they are- because even if they'll start to dress different or if they change their name or whatever - they're still your kid. Just be there for them and accept them, love them as who they are.
I just wanted my parents to accept me and see me as I am. I never wanted to be their ""little girl,"" and it hurt when they encouraged one side but not the other. Their love was conditional. I guess what I'm saying is, love your child unconditionally, and stay in a space of getting to know and love them.
The most important thing, which my parents actually did (i love them they're very good parents) is to give them agency in how to proceed.

You can suggest things like going shopping for new clothes if they want them, but don't just do it, even if you bring them along to pick.

Don't put pressure on them, and simply do your best to respect their pronouns, that seems like very little but it goes a long way.

&#x200B;

A sneaky way to find out what they want is to let them research the topic themself, and then ask questions about it. Not about them personally, but about the general topic.

This will not put pressure on them to answer anything personal, or something they haven't quite figured out for themself.

But it *does* give them the opportunity to talk about things they want personally, as well as showing to them that you care and support them, at the same time.
Let them experiment, learn on the subject so they dont have to always explain,dont out them to prople even if they are close the your kid or the family if they dont want. Qsk your kid what would make them happy too!
First of all, you are doing a great job! Just accepting and being nonjudgmental is a huge improvement over how many of us were raised.

Some things that would have helped me as a young person: knowing queer, trans, and nonbinary adults!going to Pride, seeing media (books, tv, whatever) with LGBTQ representation, finally, puberty blockers.

I really want to emphasize that you should talk with your child about how they feel about puberty. Some nonbinary people don't experience body dysphoria, but for those of us who do, going through the wrong puberty is awful. I felt so much fear and dread before puberty that I stopped eating to stunt my growth. That only worked for so long and then I went through the wrong puberty. I'm finally taking HRT now in my 30s  but you can spare your child a lot of grief by helping them access medical transition young, if that is what they need.

Thanks for being better than my parents were. Your child is so lucky to have you.
Depending on how your kid wants to proceed, perhaps you can get them on hormone blockers. My understanding (but please, do your own research) is that they delay/prevent puberty which can be very disphoric for some people. It is reversible (just stop taking pills) if your child later decides they are okay with their agab.
I would have appreciated if the clothing I felt confident in was praised, just like the clothing my dad liked to see me in. Clothing isn't always the same as gender expression. I learned that from r/feminineboys. So maybe some days they'll like skirts, or to dress up maybe they'll want to wear a suit. If they like it, and they're confident in it, give them some credit for style.
Oh, I also wanted to add if your looking specifically for ways to support them and make them feel happy, you're on the right path. You're already doing better then at least 60% of our fathers, so I wouldn't worry too too much about specifics. Just let your kid know that you love and support them, no matter how they feel about their gender. 

Also, try asking your kid too. It'll let them know you support them, and they'll let you know what they need. Win win!
I came out later in life. I have other queer siblings so I wasn't really worried about being rejected. I am, however, the only trans child in my family.

One thing I wish my parents were better at is gender neutral language when talking about me. That's really about it though.

Small things like making an effort to get pronouns right will go a long way to make your child feel seen. It's a hard thing to explain, but just getting referred to the right way makes me feel like I'm actually involved and not just a shadow in the conversation.
If you feel like you are going to slip up a lot, practice with a friend or with your wife AWAY from your kid, as in not even in the same building.

Have a random conversation and everytime you slip up you do a small punishment, like a shot of lemon juice or doing a push up, something small. 

My parents always say they are “trying” but it isn’t noticable enough to counter the mistakes and hearing them in the other room, and as somone who is contemplating getting a new name I can’t exactly have them help me try one on if they can’t even get the pronoun part semi-consistently.
Listen to your kid, and trust what they tell you. Talk to them about their feelings. Provide a safe space for them to explore their identity.
I have looked back on my childhood and there were signs that I was trans and gender non-confirming. But my parents didn’t talk to me about it at all. It was just ignored.
Ask if they would like a codeword for you to correct others misgendering them.

Sometimes it can be awkward or even unsafe to correct people and as a cis person it can be hard to tell the difference and not immediately jump to defend your kid.

By having a code word, your child can subtly indicate whether or not they want you to help correct someone without putting themselves at risk.
I follow this page for this exact reason, as well. My afab child, same age, has never been feminine. When they were 5, they told me they felt like a he and wanted a short haircut and only felt comfortable in “boys” clothes. Around 9 they started dressing in “girl” clothes again and grew their hair out. So everyone just thought it was phase, but I know that they do not identify with being strictly female. I am absolutely supportive, but try not to be pushy about anything either. We are just discovering this journey together. I try my best, but I’m not perfect. If you’re here, you’re off to a good start. The people here are great humans. I honestly get excited thinking about what my kid will be like in the future… because I just don’t know! Watching the character shine over the assigned gender is amazing imo.

How do you answer “how do you know you’re non-binary?”	I’m confidently non-binary but every time someone asks me how I know, it makes me doubt myself. I feel like I can never properly explain what it feels like to not fit in the gender binary and I feel like I am a symbol of the community to people around me. I want to do everyone justice by explaining it well but I don’t know how to. Does anyone know an article that explains the concept well that I could lead people to? Also, do other people experience this feeling of being a fraud when you can’t explain it?	"How does anyone /know/ their gender? It’s complicated. 

Don’t feel like you need to be a perfect representative for the community, ok? You can just be you and be here. That’s enough. If you find a way to explain your experience with gender to others? Awesome. If you never do? Still awesome.

Edit: that’s just so much pressure to put on yourself
I knew I wasn't a woman, but I knew I wasn't a man either. Thus, I'm outside the binary. Just like being hungry or left-handed or in love, it's an internal experience that the person just kinda... knows. Even if they don't have the words to describe it.
You just know

I've always known since I was little but never had the language for it. 

it's an internal feeling and sense of self.
[deleted]
>Does anyone know an article that explains the concept well that I could lead people to?

No sorry

>Also, do other people experience this feeling of being a fraud when you can’t explain it?

Yes sometimes depends on who I'm talking to.

>How do you answer “how do you know you’re non-binary?”

I like being my assigned gender at birth but also like being the opposite gender as well which ends up being this fun mix of genders which isn't really a gender so that's basically what non binary is. I basically say to people ""I'm just Casey there's no guidelines or rules I just be me""
Personally?

I don't but neither do you know I'm binary. It's *my* gender identity and I may well continue exploring it my entire life. If you want to live in Plato's cave of ignorance that's your choice but I'm going to search for the sun.
I'm a cis binary woman, but I did identify as non binary and try out a different name and pronouns for a while, so... I can say how I knew I wasn't non binary, and maybe that could help those people reflect on their own experiences, or maybe it resonates with you but with other pronouns?

When I tried out they/he pronouns, it kind of felt like I was playing a role rather than being myself? It felt like I was trying to act or feel like how I thought a man or agender person would act or feel. Not being able to just be myself and feel like I naturally fit into one of those categories. I decided to go back to she/her pronouns until I felt like changing back and I just never wanted to change back.
I've always explained it to people as, ""you know how you feel like a \[man/woman\]? and you don't feel like a \[woman/man\]?"" and when they inevitably say yes, I tell them to take that and make it so you don't feel like either, you don't understand what it means to be a man or woman, you don't feel inherently masculine or feminine, and that's how I know I'm nonbinary, because I don't feel like a man or woman. 

So, in the way one knows they're a man or woman, you know you're nonbinary. It doesn't have to have a life-long list of 'symptoms' and 'signs'. It's enough to just be. 🥰
Here’s one way I’ve explained it before to family and friends that are genuinely curious. Please keep in mind this is my personal experience so it may not match your own.

Imagine you’ve spent your whole life with your go to drink being jack and coke. That’s what you started drinking and it’s never really bothered you, but there’s something off about you don’t quite understand. Everyone else seems to like them though, so you keep drinking them because it’s what you know.

One day you make some new friends and one of them makes you a Manhattan. Wow it’s so good, it’s still whiskey but the mixer makes so much difference. You spend some time hanging getting used to these new flavors and realize that you definitely prefer your whiskey served this way. You had no idea you could do this with your whiskey but now that you do, it makes so much sense.

Eventually you go home to see your family, they take you out and someone orders you a jack and coke. At first you don’t mind it. This is what you used to drink and it never bothered you before. Once you take your first drink of it though, you realize that you don’t really like it that much. In fact, the more you think about how much you prefer Manhattan’s, the more the taste of the Jack and Coke seems to get worse and worse. You’re scared to say anything now though. You’ve already had half the drink and you don’t want to upset anyone by telling them what they ordered you was wrong. Then they order you a second round. It’s at this moment you realize you seriously never want to drink another Jack and Coke again.
How do cis gender people know they are not NB/Trans? They just... know.
Like religion, you *know* what you believe, but cannot ever fully *prove* it. That's why there are an uncountable number of religions variations out there. 

You are what you are, you believe what you believe just because.

One reason I bring this argument, is that it's often religious people that push against any non binary or non conforming gender identity or presentation.
""I don't know, how do you know you're not?""
I just ask them how they know they're THEIR gender. And it usually makes them quiet or they go shrug and say, ""I just am?"" and I just say, ""There you have it, then."" Mostly this if it's said in a snarky way. But if it's somebody who wants to learn then I usually give them a brief summary of my own discovery. Don't feel like you have to explain yourself to anybody or be a community spokesperson, okay?
these comments are all awesome cuz they feel so relatable to me, i also have doubts occasionally and then i remember how much i thought about gender as a kid and i think “okay damn even then i knew something was up”. its just whatever feels right for you, and even if you try out new pronouns and they dont feel like they’re “you”, you tried it and you should be proud of yourself! its all part of the process.
Well discovering it was really too complicated and personal to explain.

But now that I know who I am, for the first time in my life I feel real. Everything adds up and I'm *actually* confident in myself. I used to be scared and confused all the time. I'm not scared anymore.

That's how I know.
How do you know which is your dominant hand? One of your hands just is, right? And we know that you can't force someone to be right handed if they're a lefty, or left handed if they're a righty, and some people are ambidextrous. Gender is similar. You just know.
A simple metaphor I've used:

I was given size 6 shoes to wear. They never fit right. I tried and tried to walk around wearing them, but they always hurt my feet. Yet every shoe store I went to only had size 6 or size 10. Everybody else I knew could fit into those sizes. Some were even given the wrong size, like me, but switched to other and then they were finally comfortable in their shoes. Not me though. I struggled for years walking in the wrong shoes. Until finally one day I found a different shoe store. And for the very first time, I got a pair of shoes that fit me perfectly. It turns out I was a size 8 all along. 

I know I am non-binary in the very same way I know when the wrong shoes do not fit me.
I'm just ME. When I look at what traits society says distinguish a man from a woman , I see that many of each apply to me, and many do not. I dont desire to be either one. I desire to be my ""authentic self"".
You don’t owe anyone an explanation of the entire history of your life experiences that led you to knowing who you are. That is for you, not them. 

So I suggest asking them: “How do you know you’re binary?” Prompt that sweet, sweet introspection. They may not process it immediately, but they might think on it later.
Origin story Lmaoo, I honestly never wanted to identify as either or especially with how I was treated growing up and how I looked at my body. So finding out that there are agender people, I was very much intrigued and knew that would be best for me. I know that she/her and he/him pronouns were not at all for me and it upsets me when people who are close to me don’t see me as who I really am.

Depends on your story. You don’t have to share it with anyone though
“Male and female are such limited concepts, they fail to encompass my entire experience of gender.”
Short answer, you just know. Its a feeling kinda thing
i have this exact same problem. i try to explain it in ways others could imagine, like having an itch and scratching it by identifying as nonbinary, or identifying as nonbinary being like putting on a shoe that fits. it doesn't normally work but hey, on the off chance that someone gets it that's a win

I'd answer ""how do you know you're *insert gender*""

And then go from their answer

For example:
""Cause I have *insert genetalia*"" -> ""so you wouldn't be *gender* if you lost your *genetalia*?""

Etc.
I understand this. It throws me too. But I guess I would ask them ""how do you know you're a man/woman/gender they ID as?"" Because they either probably ""just know"" or they are questioning themselves if they are gender non conforming.
If you're interacting directly with people you know, trying to explain to them is almost certainly better than pointing to an article even if you don't have the perfect answer.  

For me, I have all these points in my life where I didn't fit the gender norms and didn't understand why, missing the language of why I was so different. Non-binary as a label fits so nicely into the narrative of my life to answer so many of those questions and confusions. When talking to someone, I'll grab one or two of these that they know about me and talk about it.
I'm currently questioning. I don't know...I'm not always offended by feminine remarks but sometimes it just feels better to not have the stigma. Button up shirts and men's boxers are kinda euphoric because it's comfy and doesn't feel constricting. It's not that I hate being a woman it's that I'm veiwed as female and not as person.
‘How do you know you’re not’ and end it there
I ask them ""How do you feel when you say 'I am a woman'?"" (If they are a woman) Does that statement feel true to you? For me, when I say ""I am a woman"" it feels...off, like there is something untrue about the statement when i say it. Thats how i know im nonbinary.
Ask literally any cis person how they know they’re the gender they are. Watch them squirm.
With binary trans people, there's an initial ""model"" that one can go off of, since society provides a clear distinction between traditionally masculine/feminine roles and traits. There are prominent male and female figures for people to aspire towards being similar to. There are roles that, while harmful, can be adopted to help define one as a man or a woman in the eyes of society. There are obvious ""templates"" for what defines a man or woman in mainstream society.

However, there are very few examples of enbies in media and public life-- you generally have to go looking, and for many of us, especially those of us over 20, there were absolutely no enby figures in the mainstream during our childhoods. Our identities are by definition defined entirely by our own self-perception-- while we still are expected to follow the ""rules"" of our AGAB's societal roles, we're drawn to our identities entirely by our own self-perception. And, because our identities can vary so wildly, very few of us have definitive examples of our ideal selves in the mainstream.

I can't speak for everyone, but in my case this manifested in a deep discomfort that appeared in puberty and became the norm for me-- for years I just accepted the despair I was mired in as a part of my personality. I didn't think it was at all notable that I felt a disconnect between myself and the identity of ""man"". Once I realized/accepted I wasn't cis, it became incredibly confusing since I felt like I had to be either a man or a woman. The dysphoria was still there, but my true self didn't fall comfortably on a purely masculine or feminine axis, and it absolutely destroyed me and led to feelings that I simply didn't belong. When I accepted that I didn't have to be one or the other and I started living authentically, it hit me that I'd finally realized who I was.

In short, my experience has been a combination of dysphoria and confusion that led to a lot of self-discovery. I can't really describe what exactly I feel like, but I know I feel *something*, and I know what feels right for me. I think this indescribable ""vibe"" is common, and from what little I know about xenogenders I get the sense that they may be a way, at least in part, of attempting to more concretely describe that feeling.

Sorry for the essay, but I've spent way too much time thinking about this stuff.
I also hate that statement. I just know that I'm NB because it's my body and I live in this flesh machine.
But I also feel it a question closeted NB ask because they might also feel the same but can't comprehend NB, maybe they were forced into thinking their are 2 genders. 
But it's your own body, your own mentality that nobody needs to understand because they aren't living in your body. 
Keep up the NB pride and give no f*cks about those who doubt you.
You don't owe people an explanation if you don't want to give one. Tell them to use google. 

&#x200B;

I usually just say that it feels wrong to consider myself a woman and it feels equally wrong to consider myself a man. They usually either get it or roll their eyes.
As someone with no sense of gender, *trust me* no one can explain their gender well. Ive asked.  Even binary people have no idea how to do that. I dont think its something that *can* rlly be explained easily? Like its so personal and even two people with the same gender label probably experience that gender differently.
I always just respond with “well how do you know you’re XYZ gender”
Via a process of elimination i know im neither man nor woman so i just use nonbinary 

Or when im tired of answering questions i ask well how do you know YOU'RE male/female
I'm sort of questioning my gender at the moment. I can't really describe it either. I'm afab.

 I can't tell if I just don't ascribe to the definition of female I got from my strict religious upbringing, or if I *really* just don't feel quite female? I know I don't feel male, but I definitely like feeling masculine at times. 

I can only use metaphor, I am a fairy tree nymph, but not like a pretty willow tree, but a heavy, round oak or even a sycomore. Not male, sort of female, but mostly just *else*.
Well for starters, there's no pressure to be an icon of enbies everywhere! If it feels like there is, at least rationally know that you don't have to represent an entire community.

If you're looking for a way to explain it, you can snag my line if you think it fits you: ""I didn't like/hated being a \[girl/guy\], but I don't want to be a \[opposite\] either.""   
Do you know anything specific about yourself that makes you certain you're nonbinary? If not, that's okay! But if you think there might be and you're not sure, maybe some self reflection would help too! Of course, you don't owe anyone an answer to questions like that.
I usually think of it as a multitude of reasons. If you take any one reason it might not be clear how it makes me non-binary and not just gnc or binary trans, but when you combine them all into the experience that is my life it becomes the reason.
“How do you know you’re a man/woman?” 
“Idk it just happened” 
“It feels right in a way that being a man/woman can’t make me feel”, or “this feels right and being a man/woman feels wrong” 
“It’s just like how I know everything else about myself I guess, I know what gender I am the same way I know how I like to swim or that my favorite color is purple.” (Replace these with your traits)
The fullest explanation I can actually give involves my specific feelings and experience of dysphoria around the idea of becoming pregnant or giving birth, up to and including my (long past) suicidal ideation around the topic. I don't give that explanation to everyone who asks for obvious reasons - it's a weighty, personal topic. I'll explain it to someone I care about who's genuinely asking from a place of caring, or to other non-binary or trans people when we're connecting over or comparing our experiences. Anyone else, I tell them it feels right and always has, or I ask them about their own experience of gender to see where they're at. 

One analogy I've used is this: imagine there's a word for a complicated concept, like a word that describes the feeling of being under a rainbow umbrella when it's raining, and there's soft piano music playing, and you just ate a perfectly ripe cherry. It's a very specific feeling, so you use that whole string of words to describe it to people, but you're sure somewhere you heard a word that means exactly that feeling. Today, someone reminded you what that word was. That's what the word ""non-binary"" feels like to me: a word I knew must exist to perfectly describe an experience I've had my whole life.

I've also written a couple of poems about my specific relationship to womanhood as an AFAB non-binary woman, but no one wants a poem as an answer to a question even if the poem *is* my best, most complete answer. 😅
I don't know of any singular articles, but the key for me was realizing that I not only felt uncomfortable among groups composed solely of guys or girls, I also referred to myself as ""we"" naturally. Add some mild dysphoria to that, and I was able to figure it out (after 2 and a half decades).  


Btw, that fraudulent feeling is called Impostor Syndrome, and it's something that many people experience, but especially by those of a marginalized group or who experience regular social anxiety.
I tell people that it's the best approximation of my feelings and my experience of gender. I'm transfeminine so, I say I'm like a woman but not quite, and the few masculine features I do retain like my beard just represents the nonbinary aspects of my nonbinary Identity
I don’t have to have a specific internal experience to be non-binary (although I do have a pretty typical one). I want to smash the binary. I welcome anyone who’s gonna help, no matter how they experience their gender.
""If I imagine myself without a physical body, I cannot tell if I am male or female whatsoever.""
I just kinda sat down and thought about it for a while. I never liked being a girl, it didn't fit for me, and I never wanted to be a boy.
I'm agender, and even among other agender ppl my experience won't be universal, but for me, I fundamentally do not understand the construct of gender. I don't get why people will take a look at certain characteristic and say masculine/feminine/androgynous. I don't think of my gender as relating to ideas of any of those. Honestly my gender feels much more aligned with robots, demons and gods, so I often joke with my friends that I'm basically Unicron (from Transformers). Honestly even as I type this I cannot properly convey just how much gender as presented by binary ppl or even non-xenogender NBs genuinely confuses me
For me, it's quite easy. I always had this vague feeling of something not being right about the way I presented, the way I looked, the way I felt. I considered the idea that maybe I was a trans boy during my childhood, but since that didn't feel right either, I gave up on exploring that train of thought. I didn't know there were other options than ""accept that you're a girl"" or ""come out as a boy"".

As soon as I learned what nonbinary actually was (for a long time, I didn't know there was a distinction between nonbinary and intersex - one of the many ways in which sex education has failed me), and I realised that this was a label that I could claim for myself, I knew that was me. 

Basically, I can't go back to ""convincing"" myself I'm a woman.
Ask how they know if they're a boy/girl. It's just a feeling since gender is beyond genitalia and far more complex then assigned sex
I am agender, my response would be along the lines of ""Thats none of your goddamn business. What in the everloving fuck gave you the idea that was an appropriate question to ask someone? Please go fuckyourself with a traffic cone""
Just say that you know you aren't male or female. You don't owe anyone an explanation.
The only reason I identified as male was because I had dysphoria around being viewed as a female. I settled for male because I wasn't aware I could be neither.
It is too broad for you to be a symbol for all of us. Instead you are a part of all of us. 

I love being a man, I love being a woman.  I don't have issues with how I look or who I love. I tend to be more masculine in real life and really feminine when I'm online and playing video games. 

I don't keep them exclusive, but just find it works for me. I wouldn't expect you to represent me or understand me. Just accept me. That makes me happy.

And the only problem I've experienced is pronouns. I don't need either but don't mind any. It varies for people.
I don't, I just assume I am because I physically don't feel any gender. I'm heavily masculine, though, so I say demimale rather than agender. It's the only terms I really have that even remotely make sense.
Basically I just say ""I just exist. There's no need for me to fit any sort of male.or female gender archetypes. Lemme vibe as myself, and I won't ruin your vibe, 'kay?""
Thank you 🥺🥺
Thank you, I love the way you've worded this.
Thank you! Good words to use in the future :)
That is how I also feel!
Good points! I used to go by she/they but over time I realized it made me happiest when people used they so that’s why I made the full switch. That’s a good one to use. Something I’ve tried to use to explain is that I get major dysphoria when I get my period but people who don’t get it are always just like “but everyone hates their period!” So maybe just saying I don’t align with my genitals will make more sense to them.
It’s so nice to know that others can feel like a fraud too. And I love your response! “There are no guidelines or rules, I’m just me!” Is a beautiful way of explaining it.
I like that you used the Plato’s cave allegory :)
I love hearing the perspective of someone who explored it but decided it wasn’t for them!
Thank you for sharing this! I'm nonbinary, and I often felt that I was ""playing a role"" when I went by the pronouns assigned to me at birth. I described it as feeling like a clown, or like I was putting on drag - presenting a certain way, but not being able to be ""in-character"" forever.
“It doesn’t have to be a life-long list of ‘symptoms’ and ‘signs’. It’s enough to just be” is a very consoling statement. ❤️❤️
This is the best explanation/simile I've ever seen. Amazing.
Wow, this actually may be my favorite explanation here. Sorry to the others 😋😋
Yes so put it back on them!  Ask them how they know they are cis,  then when they stumble around a bit just say “yeah that’s how I know my gender too”
Very true!
A lot of them don’t tbh, in my experience. People just stumble around with their assigned gender in life, and as long as it doesn’t make them too *uncomfortable*, they just don’t think about it too much. It’s less “I know I’m cis” and more apathy and taking the route of least social resistance.
I really like that point. Especially because religious people are often the ones not really trying to understand it.
The ol’ switcheroo
I do need to learn to differentiate between people who actually want to learn vs those who are being snarky. Putting less energy into those who don’t truly care is wise. 
And thank you, I’ll try not to feel so much pressure. ❤️❤️
I almost wish I had the confusion growing up, it would make me feel more validated. But I do accept that it is just what feels right for you :)
So true! I felt whole when I embraced being non binary :)
I really like that example, I’m definitely using it.
I like this a lot! And it leaves room for more than 3 options :)
This is my favorite response so far in the comments the way they are now. I'm gonna award. This is so creative and I literally train on this subject and will use this analogy. Thank you for being a resource to our community!
I like that! I have no category, I’m just me :)
Thank you, I do feel a need to explain myself fully but that’s such a simple way to explain it.
I think that’s something that makes me feel like a fraud being femme leaning non binary. I was perfectly content as a female as a child and didn’t feel discomfort with my gender until I learned about non-binary people. I wish I could say I’ve felt this way forever, it would make me feel more validated. But I definitely feel you on it hurting when people close to you don’t see you as you truly are.
The only words I’ve been able to consistently come up with, too!
I like those!! Especially it being like putting on a shoe that fits.
I like that!
So true!
That’s a good point. Hearing it from the mouth of someone you know would be much more compelling than a random article :)
I wish you luck on your journey of discovery, whatever conclusion you come to ❤️❤️
Sweet and simple
Very true!
I desire seeing the discomfort.
Thank you for sharing!! I really do agree that it’s often just a “vibe” one gets.
That’s such a good point, I need to remember some of the people asking could be closeted and it would honestly just be lying to them if I said anything other than “I just knew it made me happy”
Trying to learn this!
This is reassuring!
Got ‘em!
I like that. Simple math.
Aww, I really like that analogy!
You’re doing just great, I’m proud of you. ☺️

Nice is an interesting way to describe it.
Thank you! I think it's probably getting more common as awareness of trans people increases, my sister went through the same thing too. For me, I was really uncomfortable with the changes puberty brought. I was much more comfortable with my body pre puberty (flat chest in particular) because society views that kind of body as being neutral, and views bodies with breasts and hips as sexualised. I kind of felt like I was turning into a sex object and hated the idea of people perceiving me as inherently sexual. That feeling of discomfort with my developing body, and the way people could perceive it, had a lot of surface similarities with gender dysphoria, so it was easy to think maybe that was what I was dealing with. But in the end after that period of exploration I came to feel I just wasn't a guy or an enby. No regrets though, it was a great time of self discovery that I remember fondly.
I often describe myself as feeling like I'm in drag but idk what else to do. I don't like a lot of nonbinary clothing I have access to financially and makeup is necessary, I feel, for my career as I literally look like I'm albino and super red and puffy without it. If I ever go out dressed in a gender neutral way with no makeup people are super rude and avoid making eye contact. It's super disturbing. I want to explain this to people as well and will probably just save and reference this post in the future. (Thank you OP!!!)
Yes, I have heard a few trans people describe their experiences this way :) glad you've found pronouns that feel more comfortable for you!
Hehe thank you 😊
Lol thank you 🙏
Putting it back on them may be the move for sure
I brought up that I'm nonbinary to a couple about 10 years older than me. They both asked a few questions about what I meant and how I knew. The next time we hung out they both said they wished they had grown up with different language and acceptance of trans identities, because they would rather not be their assigned genders.

I think it's good to make people question their assumptions about their experience with gender. I'm glad kids these days get to have more of those conversations.
Of course, it took me a while to figure out too. I think one way of telling is if they genuinely want to learn they'll listen, but if they're just being snarky they'll keep asking questions and trying to get you to ""slip up"" on something.
I was definitely content with being a girl too, I loved feminism and girl power shit and independent woman stuff and I was soo boy crazy, hated pink, all the things young girls do really. I’m still a feminist lmao, but when I learned about being agender, that definitely helped me. Before I knew about that, I was bisexual, then I was asexual but liked everybody, now I’m queer and agender, definitely learned new things, had body dysmorphia when it came to my boobs or imagining having sex with women with a penis instead. 

Lmao, it’s all just growing and learning and it’s okay to be content in your body, you were/are young and okay with what you knew/know ! I use to wonder what life would have been like if I knew I was into girls in elementary school and intermediate pffft

And yeah :,,/ had to learn that those people weren’t really my friends
True. Maybe I'm a bit aggressive in responding to the people that doubt my NB. But it mostly comes from older people. Again, maybe they are closeted or ashamed NB cause NB has been around since forever.
I have confidence that you'll get there!
Thank you!
For me, I don’t have bottom dysphoria about my genitals, but I do for my reproductive organs and my top. I try to explain being nonbinary to my coworkers and family, and usually the retort is “you’re either a boy or a girl, there’s not another option”. In my humble option, that’s bs. They try to rationalize my thoughts “everyone hates having periods” or try to downplay my feelings “you’re too young to make that choice”. It’s frustrating trying time and time again to explain my internal thoughts to someone who can’t bother seeing anything beyond themselves.
Uuuuuuugh yes!!!!! When I try to explain the way I felt going into puberty and thereafter “everyone feels that way during puberty” no they don’t most of my peers were so excited about it that they tried to fake it early because they *wanted* it they were *excited about it*
Yes, definitely! I hate the mess but the bigger issue is the anatomy that is causing it. I don’t want to be a baby machine.
You just explained exactly how I feel. Thank you!! 🙂
Poor choice of word, should have said relieving.
Thank you so much for sharing! It’s sad that the female anatomy is so sexualized that you were forced into that journey of discovery.

Amen to that.
Thank you for your support and kind comment. It’s nice to see that some people understand this stuff, even if my family doesn’t."	vc2ext	NonBinary	156	0.99	2022-06-14 12:29:50
Envious of the cool androgynous looking people on here	"I pass as cis. I am fine with it, because it's the most comfortable for me. It's not ideal, but it's the best arrangement. However, it seems that nonbinary is actually treated as a third binary by most people in the queer community as well. So basically I ended up feeling like I don't belong anywhere both when it comes to cishets who will never respect who I am, and when it's in the queer community, where I get imposter syndrome.

I don't have anyone to tell me stuff like ""you're valid"", ""do what makes you the most comfortable and know that I will respect and understand who you are regardless""

And I think I'm coming close to my breaking point because I've been living like this for years and it hurts.

I don't want to change how I look just to please people who feel like nonbinary should be its own binary. I don't think I look good trying to look androgynous, i have tried when I was younger and it made me feel unattractive (not that androgynous people are unactractive, it's the opposite for me, but because of how I'm naturally built and my face, and my BDD i have a very complicated relationship with my body so I NEED to look good for myself and myself mostly)

So yeah, stuck in between. Rejected by society.

Cishet guys never wanting to be just friends and never acknowledging my pronouns. Sick of the disappointments. Cishet girls eventually noticing I'm acting ""odd"" because I'm not really one of them, also misgendering all the time. All this despite coming out to these people. But they have no idea or care for what I'm talking about when I come out to them.
Growing up all of my friends turned out to be lesbians. Only one of them ever respected my gender identity. So it's a queer people problem too. At least those around me.

""You don't need to fit in"" yeah, I do. Because the loneliness becomes unbarable and the depressive episodes are becoming darker. And I'm alone because I don't fit in anywhere and can't trust anybody to be my friend.

My gender identity is more complicated than just they/them pronouns, but it's more convinient to only ask people to respect that instead of explaining myself to them all the time, which is also a huge risk. And yet, yet these assholes can't even respect one simple thing such as pronouns and using neutral terminology with me. Fuck everyone.
I used to love people, now I'm sick of everyone.

Can't have friends, can't have a pleasing social life. Let alone partners. Or sexual encounters. Because I can't trust anybody.
Everything is just so sad and frustrating.
And when I go into details with therapists all they can do is say ""yeah, that's understandable"". So yeah. No solution. I'm stuck being ""the weird one that could easily have a normal life but chooses to seek attention by wanting to be different so badly"" (my parents and possibly most people I came out to)

EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing with me your experiences and for taking the time to write such kind words. I feel easily overwhelmed by this issue lately and I definitely felt overwhelmed also by the kindness of you all and the simple interaction with other nonbinary people, who finally understand me. I will go through all your comments as soon as I feel like I can handle it. Thank you again, despite the anonymity provided by Reddit, I still felt the warmth of your words and I don't feel so alone anymore."	"nonbinary doesn't look like anything, you ARE valid, people just lack empathy and the ability to try and understand. YOU are a gorgeous nonbinary person and YOU are so so so valid.
As an amab masc presenting enby I feel this so hard
If you can handle some dark periods of time then everything will work out, when I came out as nb but started to social transition as a man (being very masculine and accepting he/him pronouns from strangers) yeah I lost like all my friends and certain people around me distanced themselves from me, but I found my people (they kinda found me) yeah most of them are younger kids that look up to me but I still love being a parental figure in their lives. I had only one friend that stayed with me through it all, you can have people you hang out with but they aren't your friends if they don't accept how things are. The real ones will stay, the the real ones will come. With confidence people will see it and let you truly be you. I have basically replaced everyone around me. And with my confidence and feel good attitude because I'm living my life and not worried about people, I have friends, I have acquaintances, I have school buddies, people look at me and think I got my shit together. It works out in the end, it just takes time, you will have a period of time when you have no friends, you have no one to turn to. You become a hermit. But in that time you become the most YOU. You find hobbies, you find your true personality, you find what makes you happy. Find you before finding other people.
I’m neither him nor her. A French composer once said, “music is the space between the notes.”
I feel the same
You don't need to look a certain way to be NB!!!!
I also find myself jealous towards more androgynous people sometimes. 
But I'm AMAB and present very masc. The only times people were confused about my gender was on the phone and because of my name which is gender neutral but socially leaning femme. 
What I'm trying to say is, you can look like you pass without a question of a doubt and still not fit in the gender binary, and like others said. You are valid and accepted here!!!
Sending all the love your way and I know you can endure the hard times, you have so far💛🤍💜🖤
I’m so sorry you feel this way. It is so painful socially, sexually, emotionally, intimately to present a way that is not expected as “THE LOOK” for enby folk, and be excluded, even shamed for it. Please know that, like you, we are out here, a whole spectrum of gender fluidity inside and out—many of us don’t fit “THE LOOK” for the same reasons you don’t. Gender, and it’s expression, is more than appearance. Recently, many have often felt like the non-binary identity is being pigeon holed as a third gender with its own celebrities leading the charge and building media hype and social expectations of what we should all look like—defying the vast and varied spectrum of what we ACTUALLY look like, and ignoring that gender is far, far more than just looks. It’s very shallow to assume otherwise. Please keep the faith.  It won’t be easy, but you will find those that will get you for who YOU are.
I wrestle with this daily and then throw my hands up at the patriarchy for putting me in this damn box where I'm only 'safe' when I'm still performing for them, whether that be sticking to my gender assigned at birth, or going full on in the opposite binary's displays of gender, or being androgynous enough to signal to people I'm non-binary based on looks alone.

Fuck their furrowed brows at how we show up, that's the conditioning leaving their bodies. It's okay to care what they think, that's how we stay safe in our society. I think what's more affirming for me is working on winning myself over for my choices and caring what I think about myself more.
honestly, were on a similar boat, for one part I really don't present as NB, but I also don't really feel very identified with the nb community since sometimes I like some aspects of both genders and I like to present as both, but if I say someting like that I automatically get boxed in ""gender fluid"" even if that doesn't really feel correct. 

labels are inventions of society since we need to identify with something as to feel we're not alone nor too much different. some people really take it to heart since they formed such a strong connection with the label as their identity that's they can't just think of another way. 

so, in reality you really shouldn't worry so much about not fitting in the mold. if that's the case maybe something else is the problem, like, we know that it's important for us that people recognize our identity. but my question is, why is it for you? is it just the validation or maybe something else? 

as por people and your identity, maybe you should try to run in different circles. since we have a tendency to rotate to people in witch we recognize certain patterns, and the people you decided to mix with, simply weren't so considerate, after all, everyone is different and you can't say you have meet all of the planet population
Have you tried seeking out a group of friends that is also nonbinary/queer? Cishet people are not going to understand you in the same way that other nonbinary people will.
You’re valid :)
I am also an enby passing as cis, but I look very good androgynous but I don’t dare to dress that way in public.
Non binary does not necessarily equal androgynous. Androgyny is in between. We are other than. That’s how I think of myself.
as others have said u don’t need to look a certain way, the way how i see it bc i have days where i prefer to look more “feminine” presenting or “masculine” presenting, i jus’ want ppl to see me as me, and if they don’t see me for how i’m comfortable expressing on any given day i usually don’t spend too much time w them. anyway u choose to look is valid and i promise u u’ll find a community that makes u feel safe, i’m always here if u wanna talk ♡
You are not alone. I have the same struggle with body image and the androgynous look just doesn't always suit me. It sucks cause I have to push a lot to get the correct pronouns used for myself and that makes people uncomfortable (but that's very much a them problem, as my therapist reminds me frequently).

Many hugs for you. We don't owe anyone androgyny. You're still valid no matter how you present ❤
Hey. Wear the clothes that make you feel good. Do it. I do. You don’t owe anyone an outfit, except yourself. You’re nonbinary? Neat. Anything you wear that makes you feel good is a valid nonbinary outfit. Because it is your outfit. 

Don’t change anything about yourself to please people who are not interested in who you are. You don’t owe anyone any way of being other than the one that’s truest to you. 

I really get what you’re saying about fitting in, and I think that what you are actually looking for is your community, the people who fit in with you as much as you fit in with them, rather than to actually fit in with people who have mental walls up that don’t allow them to see the awesomeness of *you*. I also get that ‘find your community’ isn’t on its face helpful advice, because ok, that’s nice, now tell me how and who. I’m saying it here more because I hope that it may help change your focus, because I think that being unable to be yourself surrounded by people who don’t get you is just as lonely as being alone, and I want you to know that you 100% deserve to be able to be you and seen and liked and loved. Unaccepting people don’t mean there’s something wrong with you, it is entirely a reflection of them.
So, I'm probably not the best for talking about this (I'm a 14 year old demiboy who doesn't have his shit together by any means and still isn't able to help himself), but here's what I think. 

Yeah, I'm part of the enby spectrum, as I don't completely identify with my AMAB, but I'm still masc-presenting and that makes me comfortable. I haven't tried looking androgynous though, but I'm pretty sure that, even if I don't completely feel like a man, I like how I look in the sense as of what gender I look like (I think I'm ugly and I'd want to change that, but that doesn't have anything to do with the gender thingy). You can be an enby and not be androgynous. Non-binary IS NOT a third binary, it is an umbrella term for ANYTHING that doesn't fit into the gender binary of men and women, and if there's anyone who says it's not like that, just say ""who asked?"" And move on. There's a lot of people who can relate, so just know that the people that will accompany you for all your live are there somewhere, and they're looking for you as much as you're doing with them. 


So, as a summary of what I just said: YOU. ARE. FRICKING. VALID. There's a lot of people like you out there, and they will be the ones to help you truly be yourself. You do have to accept what we're saying in this comment section; after all, I recognize that I have the problem with not applying the advice that I'm given and denying that it is even true, so I do not want to be like that, it is hurtful, and I don't want my enby pals to be hurt.
I understand what you mean...before I even knew I was nonbinary this was my understanding of it, a gender outside of male and female...only when I came to truly understand nonbinary as a spectrum did I understand that I myself was nonbinary too. For some enby people, it IS a third gender to them, and for some it is not, it exists outside the binary. So please know you're not alone in feeling this way. 💖 I often hear the same struggle in my head and gaslight myself into thinking I'm still cis and making this shit up. No, I am nonbinary and always will be. As are you 💛🤍💜🖤
I can relate. ""Passing"" as cis, and feeling like an imposter bc I can ""hide"" behind the appearance I'm mostly fine with, and my hetero appearing marriage. All I can think of is to try and find a friend group, even if that has to be online. No matter what you look like or your presentation, it's about how you feel about yourself that matters. I wish I had something better for you, just know that many other NB's feel like you do, at least we're suffering together.
i feel you and am in a similar boat from what i gather. almost all people assume i'm cis from what i look like, even if i tell them my pronoun, people don't use it, apart from the few close friends i have. even my therapist lowkey does not understand anything about gender, even after multiple explanations. the will is not there.

so this is probably a bad idea, but since cis people overwhelmingly are a lost cause, i decided to completely reject any opinion on the topic from them outright. they never had any authority or knowledge of me, my inner workings, so any attribution they try to pin on me is false from the get go. at least it's mentally freeing, but it does not magically make patriarchal gender norms vanish
Not sure if this will really help, but non-binary is an umbrella term. Under that falls agender (genderless), and androgyne (a state of gender between the two binaries), polygender (melting pot of gender expression). It seems like you’ve had trouble with people conflating these identities with non-binary. You don’t need to be in a state of androgyny/genderlessness to be non-binary. Non-binary is existing outside of the gender binary. There’s a ton of other identities in the non-binary umbrella (demi-girl/boy/non-binary, gender-fluid) which have people identifying with a certain gender expression. They are just as valid. But yeah, it’s silly Bc non-binary is to exist out of the binary so to create a box of rules that you need to satisfy just negates the point of being non-binary. No single non-binary person identifies the same, and that’s what is so cool. It’s unique to you. It doesn’t and shouldn’t look the same for everyone. You don’t need to identify with a certain micro label to be valid, just express yourself and your identity and be comfortable. That’s all you can do. <3
It sounds like you've had an unlucky draw as far as the people around you. Or maybe I've just been lucky. I'm a fem-presenting AFAB masc-aligned enby. Only once have I had an issue with someone I've come out to not respecting my identity. I live in an extremely conservative area and I cannot be out openly for my own safety. 

Most of my inner circle is trans and/or non-binary. That could be a factor. Are you able to find better social circles? I mean, even if you were a woman, having cishet guys who can't just be friends is an example of bad people around you, so clearly at least on that front this goes deeper than the transphobia issue?
I am a masc-presenting amab enby and doomed to be misgendered by everyone until the end of my days.
Another one of us here as well. You are valid, OP. You are valid, tisjustbrandon.
That is a lovely way of putting it. Going along the music analogy line, I’ve also heard that, to properly appreciate jazz music, you’re supposed to listen to where the notes AREN’T being played. Or something like that.

In other words: defy convention. Embrace individuality.
Anyhoo, hi, I’m nothanks, I’m thirty…six?, Canadian, a fab two gender, adhd, anxiety, two small children, actor and student on hiatus from both, i like playing with words and would like to someday do it for money. Books are my friends. Nice to meet you. Feel free to dm me if you ever need to vent or just wanna chat with a random internet friend.
I discovered how to maneuver between the notes when I first stepped onto an EDM dance floor. A queer friendly place where you fall in love, dance, befriend, sweat, and shed away the pain. I also discovered radical empathy.
It is amazing what music can do. And what affirming, friendly spaces can do too.
It’s been nearly eight years since I put everything in my rearview. I never fully assessed the damage that place had done to my self-esteem, my mental state and all the whatevers too. 

THAT place embraced authoritarian conformity. THOSE people took it upon themselves to mow down the first blade of grass that grew taller than the rest. 

I used to dance in my room listening to my dad’s vinyl album of Pearl Jam VS. 

I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings... made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive...

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface... most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things

My boyfriend started using my new name	"So, I loosely came out to my boyfriend a while ago and briefly suggested new pronouns. He's trans so he had no reason to NOT support me. We never actually had a formal conversation about my gender, pronouns, and new name however. Last night I was very dysphoric and was venting about it. I mentioned how hearing my birth name was starting to hurt me in general. 
He proceeded to actually initiate a conversation about it, and I can't explain how incredibly he handled it. He asked what name I wanted for him to call me, and I originally said I didn't care. It was a lie, but I just didn't want to ask my boyfriend of two years to change what he calls me. Of course, he didn't accept this. He went on to talk about how he understood what I am feeling and how he never wants to make me uncomfortable. With this, I suggested that he calls me Eddie. 
 My boyfriend called the name adorable, helped me decide on my middle name (I've been contemplating it for a while), and was already coming up with stupid nicknames. This morning he texted me ""good morning, Eddie"". I can't even express how happy this made me. I'm finally starting to feel comfortable socially. I know no one will read this, but I wanted to share this huge euphoric moment."	"That's so sweet! Im glad you have someone so supportive and positive in your life. Thats a really invaluable thing to have when you start to make big changes like this in your life. Good luck with everything, Eddie!
I""m so happy for you ♥️ Also Eddie is a great name, I love it! C: Feel Hugged and loved, alright? :)
This is so wholesome and heartwarming and just in time for the holidays. Thanks for sharing, Eddie!
Congratulations Eddie 🎉
I like your new name, Eddie :) Congrats on telling your boyfriend, I'm glad it went well :)
Aww, Eddie, I’m so happy for you! Both you and your boyfriend have truly great partners :)
Thank you so much! I can't stop smiling over this!
Thank you :)
Thank you! You're so sweet!"	edqlhe	NonBinary	154	0.99	2019-12-21 14:37:48
I wish I wasn’t non-binary	"Honestly, I wish so much I could “just” be a trans man

I know it wouldn’t be easier, but holy shit I feel like it would be so much SIMPLER to be a trans man. I’m so sick of feeling way too trans to be cis and simultaneous not trans enough to have confidence in myself and just come out already. I’m so sick of feeling dysphoria every single day and knowing that even if I receive every medical intervention I want and get perfect results that solve all of my physical dysphoria, people are *never* just going to assume I’m non-binary, people are *never* going to gender me correctly, there is no option to “pass” for me. 

I want so badly to just squeeze my eyes shut and force my stupid brain to just go “all the way” to male. Why did it have to get stuck halfway there? After transition I’ll probably be seen as male for the majority of my life anyway, it’d be SO much simpler if I could just embrace that and let that be who I am. But it’s not who I am, because I’m not a man. And I’m not a woman either, clearly, because this whole being in a woman’s body thing is NOT fucking working out. 

I don’t want to come out to my workplace and have to explain to these mildly homophobic people that not only am I trans, I’m *different* trans, *special* trans (🤢), and you need to make even *more* effort to accommodate me. My boss is 73 years old, does he even know what being non-binary is? He’s a good man and I’m sure he’s down with trans rights, but non-binary people?? 

I don’t want to come out to my extended family and face not only their religious views but also their terf views with yet *another* complication. I don’t want to live the rest of my life picking between two bathrooms, two ID boxes, two standard pronouns, two sets of social norms and two sets of expectations, NEITHER of which feel right to me. 

I’m so sick of being deeply injured by transphobia, turning to trans spaces for comfort and seeing the new UltraWokeNess^TM “being trans is a choice!1! Gender doesn’t even really exist!!” like I would *ever* choose this, and bitch if my gender didn’t exist, why does it cause me so much pain then??? Or telling me I just want to feel special, I’m just appropriating intersex issues, I’m just confused, I’m just making things up, they’re just “not sure” if non-binary people are real, they’re just “not sure” if non-binary people can be dysphoric, they’re just “not sure” if I deserve a single *crumb* of human dignity. 

I’m so fucking sick of this life and being in this body, I’m SO sick of being afraid and uncertain all the time, I’m so goddamn tired of having to defend myself and my existence and my experiences over and over and *over* and knowing the attacks will never stop, I’m so fucking *done* with hearing she and her every single day like a slap to the face and knowing it’ll  be *ages* before I can correct them, *ages* before my body starts to feel like mine, *ages* before things will start being the normal I’ve never had. 

I just wish so much I could “just” be a trans man."	"[deleted]
I relate a lot to this. I'm a demiguy (at least I've taken on the label for convenience, because I'm trans masc and usually a guy to some extent), so I'm in this weird place where I'm not man enough to be a trans man and not nonbinary enough to ""really"" be nonbinary. I feel like I need to choose a side all the time, like I can't just be me. I've tried leaning into just being nonbinary and it's gone okay, but I just found out a big step in my transition is coming and that veered me right back to demiboy territory. I think I'm some vague kind of genderfluid, I don't even know. My gender is just plain fucked up and it makes no sense, changing all the freaking time but always being nonbinary. I just want different anatomy and I want to not be gendered by people. But I can't have that. In order to get the medical transition I want I need to totally be a man. In order to be seen the way I want to, I need to be totally nonbinary (and even then it's unlikely people will ever gender me correctly). I'm just... so tired of this.
It's rough always having to explain yourself, especially when it's well-meaning people with the exact same questions over and over. But, somebody's got to be the one to slowly educate the population on these topics so that future enbies don't have to deal with this struggle. At least we live in a time where after an explanation, most people will go ""okay, sounds reasonable""
I know how you feel, I identify as gender fluid for convince but I never feel like a man, it's only ever nonbinary or transfemme it's weird, and confusing and I hate my own gender, I want to look in the mirror most of the time and just have boobs, I hate my awkward skinny male body, but at the same time I'm not fully female either and I just want to scream.
I’m sobbing
I hate to say it but I honestly wish I wasn't nonbinary, or LGBTQ sometimes. I wish I could just fit into the mold that was prescribed to me since birth and just be the person my parents wanted me to be: Cis straight feminine girl that loves dancing is super responsible and has the same interests as my mom. But I just ended up the complete opposite. I have tried and I sometimes consider trying just pretending that I am that person they want me to be but it just feels so wrong and it hurts so much. I'm tired of being a constant disappointment to my family, but at the same time, I'm tired of living someone else's life. I have no experiences that are my own, and when I do it's riddled with so much shame, fear, and self-hatred, that I can't even enjoy them. I wish I could just do whatever I wanted without the constant shame and internalized transphobia/homophobia associated with it. 

TLDR: I relate lol.
I have had the struggle finding others that can relate to me.  I am notmsure of my labels.  I have thought I was demigirl, at first and then nonbinary, but honestly I am not sure. For years,  years! I felt that, that something was missing from me.  Recently, I had gotten up the nerve to wear a packer (socks) and see if it would help.  It did. I saw myself in the mirror, body hair, bulge, full beat of makeup, and I felt A LOT better.  I started crying! It hit me like a wave. Just looking at myself, it felt like a relief. I too don't feel specifically like a man, or like woman. I'm just me, it's all I know how to be.  I am still trying to figure myself out as well. Its a start.
Just want to say I relate and it's hard but also I think you're awesome and it's cool that there's other non-binary people like me out there
Tbh same :"")
This. So much of this. I'm fuxking tired, i don't even explain anything now, I just say I'm fucking queer.(both context😭)
i feel this. i feel like we’re at a point now where there is more binary trans visibility and understanding (including enormous pushback and violence), but that at least people generally get that there are trans men and women and that binary is more accepted. trying to explain being enby to my parents, who want to support and understand me, but clearly do not understand, is so hard! and i know it’s going to be hard forever, and i will have to either CONSTANTLY come out, or accept being misgendered all the time, which makes me want to crawl out of my skin. the world is so damn binary and it sucks. but i agree, i also don’t think it would actually be easier to be a trans man, i think no matter what being trans is not easy. sometimes i am so filled with self-doubt and loneliness i think about just being closeted and pretending i’m a cis woman so i don’t have to deal with the world. but i’ve done that my whole life and it made me miserable, and i know i can’t anymore. i can’t un-know my gender now. and i don’t even know what it is, i just know what it’s not. but i also think that we are showing the world that we exist and we’re valid and unless we do it no one else will. and it’s good to know i’m not alone in this struggle. ❤️
I feel those feels bro
Idk what I am
It's like you reached into my brain and pulled out exactly the thoughts I've been trying to put into words. It would be so much easier to just be able to pass as either male or female. It sucks that we not only get shit on by the transphobes, but also by the *""rEaL tRaNsGeNdErEd PeOpLe""* who still think gender is a binary system. I wish I could offer a solution or some advice but I can't. People are starting to become more accepting but it's still a dangerous world out there for us. Hopefully someday we'll be accepted into what's considered *""normal""* in our society, but until then we just have to keep doing what we can, being out to who we can, and coping as best we can. I can't offer a solution, but I can offer solidarity. You're not alone in feeling this way. I hope you're doing alright 💕
I'm struggling with something similar too  
Sometimes I wish I could just convince myself I'm cis so I don't have to worry and stress over all the obstacles that come with being nonbinary
I googled “I wish I wasn’t non-binary” and found your post. At the very least, thanks for making me feel less alone <3

>I can’t un-know my gender now 

This, right here. In the past couple months I’ve been making an effort to “put being trans back in the bottle” so to speak, because I’m not ready to come out but not having a transition on the horizon is starting to seriously eat away at me. 

It was so easy not to realize I was trans for 23 years, but now that I *have* realized there’s no going back, as much as I might want to.

Eight year olds think gender is like the weather and they are TOTALLY RIGHT	"So the eight-year-old I take care of has been thinking about gender.  She asked me the other day if I felt like more of a boy or a girl when I did boy or girl stuff, and then she back tracks (because she is kind and awesome and she is learning) and says ""I know there isn't just boy or girl stuff ,there's just stuff, I'm just asking.""
I panicked but I also told her the truth, that sometimes I feel like one and sometimes the other and sometimes nothing in particular. She said ""yeah, I think it's like the equator."" Huh?

So she goes on to describe how some people are north and some people are South and some people are in the middle of the two hemispheres, temperature wise, and then there's all these weird weather phenomenons where some places are warmer or colder even though they're in the same position because that's just how they are, and then hurricanes have male names if they're turning one way and female names if they're turning another way even though it's the same exact storm that does the same things, and I realize that she is exactly right and I don't need to explain a goddamn thing to her. 

Also she identifies as ""meow"" as her gender. I was told that she/her is also very much fine but she says meow is more special when we are alone/with family.  SHE GETS THAT PART TOO.
 
This kid. So much hope.

Edit: hurricane stuff is nonsense, it turns out. She's eight. I shoulda checked. 
Turns out they have certain male names and certain female names and they use those over and over unless one of them is so awful that they can't use it again. If they go over those names (21 total) in a year they use random word/letters from the Greek alphabet. I think this is also somehow appropriate.  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/storm-names.html&ved=2ahUKEwidwKnftoXkAhXDdN8KHaPoBl8QFjAGegQIDxAU&usg=AOvVaw23TN0U5dQ2X2gmAYmExdJj"	"That's seriously so beautiful.

I asked my physiotherapist how to wear a binder, and she gave me tips that relieved a lot of pain	"I've been going to a physiotherapist because I have very stiff muscles in my shoulders and back (keep that in mind, because that might carry weight in this situation).

I started wearing a binder two months ago, and got increasingly more pain under my armpits and beneath my shoulder blades when I did. Sometimes my ribs would ache as well. Since I've started practicing my posture accorting to how my physiotherapist recommended, all of that is gone!

I gathered my courage and told my physiotherapist about my issues, and where they stem from (luckily, she was totally great about everything!)

She explained what was happening as follows:

when there is pressure on the front side of the chest (which is true for binders), the back muscles pull your shoulder blades down (aka, your lower back is more arched, and your shoulders also pull back as a result). Which involves all of the muscles that were painful for me: the ones beneath my shoulderblades, the ones below my armpits, and even the muscles across my ribs (flanks) that ached.

What she told me to do was this: when wearing your binder, feel the pressure on the front side. Your first instinct will be to push back against that, and start breathing high in your chest. Don't do that, because it'll make everything even more painful.

Instead, try to feel the band beneath your shoulderblades on your back (I guess where the bra strap would've been). And while breathing, focus on that area. Feel it, and feel that part of your chest expand. So instead of breathing high in your chest and fighting against the pressure, seek the room in the back. I personally wear gc2b binders, and those are stretchy in the back, so I have lots of room to breathe there! It made perfect sense once I started breathing like that.

Then continue to check in every once in a while to see if you're still breathing correctly.

Doing this for just one week has helped me tremendously, and has me wearing my binder happily for 8 hours a day, while I had trouble wearing it for more than 3 hours before that.

I hope this helps some transfolk out there, and please share this with anyone who might benefit!

disclaimer: I do already have problems with my shoulder/back muscles, so YMMV. And I'm of course not a physiotherapist myself. But this is just my very positive experience :)"	"Mtf here so I wear Bras/Sports Bras rather than binders but I have a lot of similar issues with neck pain. I've been doing exactly what your physiotherapist told you not to do so thanks for relaying what she said. Hopefully it will help relieve some of my neck/shoulder pain.
Thank you! I have EDS so my back and neck muscles, shoulders, joints, and ribs are messed up to hell and back. I ordered my first binder and I've been nervous about what it'll do to me so I'll keep this in mind!
I’m so glad you talked to her about it! I’ve been nervous to start binding for these reasons too especially since I tend to carry stress pain in my shoulder blades and neck already. My friend who is ftm has been using kt tape instead of a binder for his relatively small chest and has some chafing and discomfort from that but has said it’s been way better for him than binding was so I’m considering trying it. Best of luck OP 🤗
I hope so too! Good luck :) 
Glad I could help! I hope it works out for you :) 
> since I tend to carry stress pain in my shoulder blades and neck already

It me. 

I'm personally hesitant about using tape, but you do you! Just listen to your body :) 
Haha I totally am hesitant about using tape too! I’ve been using it most days for a month or so on my weak wrists and have found really rubbing in a little coconut oil first to be really helpful for not tearing skin or hair but I still don’t know if I want to apply kt tape directly to my nipples cause that seems like a whole other level. 
Jup. 2scary4me. I'm going to stick to binders, since that works for me :) 
My partner says a small square of toilet paper or a bandaid saved his nipples and his piercings. 
Ooooh interesting! Thanks for the tip I’ll try that if I ever get the gumption to start!

Fellow nonbinary siblings, how do you handle misgendering in a customer service setting?	I work at a bistro where I'm often at the cash register. I'm amab, and hear sir/brother/other term for a man constantly. I do wear a pronoun pin, but i don't think anybody bothers to read it. I'd be lying if I said it didn't get annoying and tiresome to hear it all the time, but I never bother to explain my pronouns (mostly out of fear that I'll get some ignorant and hateful response).  For other nonbinary folk who are misgendered by customers, do you ever correct them, especially if you'll be interacting with them more? Or do you let it slide?	"honestly i just let it slide unless it's like a coworker doing it, or a customer that i tend to get along with otherwise and talk to often. it's just not worth the hassle most of the time.
I don’t work in customer service but I do work with the general public. It’s annoying for sure, but being misgendered by people who don’t know me just doesn’t get to me anymore. Im at the point where I’m like, “cool, that’s none of my business.” Lol. 
I don’t bother to correct random people or strangers I cross paths with. My best advice is to put tons of effort and energy into fostering self-love and internal validation. It’s hard work, but when you feel secure in yourself and in your identity, you come to realize that the way strangers perceive you doesn’t have anything to do with you! You’ll need that external validation less and less. I don’t mean to diminish the issue - I know those gendered terms will always sting. Especially on a bad day. Especially hearing them multiple times. But you’ll just exhaust yourself trying to correct strangers all day. Of course, it’s different for people who KNOW you and are in your life…it’s important that we feel seen and known by the people we love. But strangers??? Not worth the energy and effort trying to get something from them if you can learn how to give it to yourself instead.
Maybe an unpopular opinion but at work with customers who may or may not tip me based on our interactions is not the hill I want to die on when it comes to pronouns. I’d rather take their tip money and commit gay crimes with it than risk the consequences of a negative customer experience.
Waiters introduce their name at the start of the meal every time and most diners would never remember it if asked. Even when they wear name tags. It’s the curse of the uniform that makes you invisible, try not to take it too personally.
This is me, and I offer this as like…positive advice, not an admonishment, I do get the annoyance, AND I get the importance of visibility, but….


I don’t give a fuck what strangers who I will see once in my life think of me or know about my gender identity. They don’t matter to me. 

I want their money, maybe a tip if it’s that kinda work, they can think I’m male, female or nothing, it doesn’t matter. They’re vapour. 

For my own happiness, I’ve learned not to care about that. The people who matter, know. 

Plus, I’d rather not deal with the shitty people who will make it A Thing and create stress at my work place.


Again, I will not, absolutely will not, raise my blood pressure pressure for people I will probably never see again. 

I am not Enby for them. My identity is mine. The people I need to know, know, they respect that, randoms on the street can eat grass because I won’t even remember their faces in 5 minutes, I’m busy.
Just curious, what does your pin say? EDIT: didn't mean that to sound weird, just like to know ideas.
Honestly there’s not much you can do about it. Not everyone sees or cares about pronoun pins unfortunately. If it’s a situation where you’re introducing yourself you can add your pronouns but if it’s just a passing interaction you just have to ignore it. If it makes you feel any better, even before I started transitioning and was still living as a woman presenting very femininely I was misgendered for a man several times. What other people perceive has more to do with them than it does you and what people call you doesn’t change your identity and how you feel.
I just…let it happen. It’s always jarring and always awkward for me, but…idk I guess the hassle and potential escalation is just simply not worth it.
i don’t correct anyone. it used to cause a lot of dysphoria and fucked with my mental health but i started to realize how little people’s perception of me has to actually do with me. and i got tired of explaining lol. i genuinely despise talking about my gender now it’s the least interesting part about me
Well it might be different for me I'm fairly androgynous so I get misgenderd as he or she fairly  often.
Customers kind of suck. I work the register at my job and have my pronouns on my name tag, but alas I’m misgendered all day long. As long as you’re coworkers are nice about it that’s what matters(luckily I have a few enby siblings at work who get it)
I don't work in customer service, but I came out to my friends about 2 months ago, and they are CoNstInTlY misgendering me. Most of them time, I'll pretend to cough, hoping they'll look over at me and realize that they've misgendered me, but lets be honest, that never works. I do have one friend who's ALWAYS correcting them and calling them out and that just feels amazing. So, pro tip: try to have one friend/coworker who will always butt in and say: ""Hey, their pronouns are actually \*insert pronouns here\*, not \*wrong pronouns\*. Thank you so much for your understanding!"" if you're comfortable with that. Stay safe, you're always valid, try to drink some water if you haven't already, and I love you my fellow enby siblings. <3333
I talk on the phone all day and hear ""yes sir, no sir"" all fricking day. I tune it out with the knowledge of who I really am, and the enlightenment that comes from being non-binary. Our world is festering in the traditions of the patriarch and people don't even think twice about gendering others based on the visual or audible symbols that have been forced on them. I focus on ME doing the right thing and choosing the right path because that's what I have the ability to control.
Im afab enby and work as a bookseller. ALL my coworkers know I’m enby and are super great as we have several other trans employees - in fact a majority of the employees are lgbt+ in some way. We all have pronouns on our name tags (cis and trans employees alike). 

However, I still get misgendered by customers and I recognize it’s not from a place of maliciousness so I usually let it go. If it’s a regular who I see often I’ll let them know a few times after I’ve seen them and so far I haven’t had any issues. The only real time I’ll correct people is if they’re rude to me because you don’t get to be rude AND misgender me.
sometimes i think there are assholes who *do* see the pronoun pins and deliberately use incorrect gendered terms when they wouldn't have usually
Not a customer service provider, but as a customer I often get ""ma'am"" from the employees and it grates on my nerves.  I don't give a fuck about pronouns but overly gendered addresses like that bother me.  I usually just let it slide because I know they're TRYING to be polite, and I just don't want to try and give sexuality and gender 101 every time I'm trying to get a cup of coffee or something to eat lol.  Especially as it's often people who clearly don't speak English as a first language, so that makes it even harder.  I only bother saying something or trying to explain my gender to people I interact with regularly on a fairly close basis (and even then it depends), or in specifically queer spaces.  Every once in a while I might say something like ""please don't call me ma'am"" and then carry on with my order or whatever lol no further explanation given.
I take deep breaths for the remainder of the convo and keep it moving
Personally I don’t always have this issue because I’m Afab and identify as she/they. Although when someone calls me something really feminine i get uncomfortable. I never really say anything but my attitude changes. I had a trans coworker as well once who would laugh it off and quickly say not a dude with finger guns. No one seemed to ever say much. And if they did harass us they were asked to never come back and refused to be served.
Give it to them straight ""Hi, my name is x my pronouns are x. How can i help you today?"" So they can make an informed decision to be a decent person or an asshole

That being said i agree that it mostly isnt worth the hassle. It is not your job to educate the masses. If you have a pronoun pin, you are already doing more than enough. That tip is when you feel down and feel inspired to lift yourself up. Get the higher ground! I feel like being misgendered hurts so much because we feel like we haven't expressed ourself correctly. We are misunderstood. So expressing yourself correctly to the next customer can help with that.
I've made the decision only to correct those I frequently interact with

I did bar work for quite a while, but I'm lucky to live in s country where we rarely use honorifics like sir/mam

It sucks, but idk a solution for you :(
I work in a super market and start just before the shop closes, so I do from time to time yes. I have a boss that's amazing and just tells me to correct them when they do and if that doesn't work to ignore them, by no stretch of the imagination am I saying ignore them but maybe ask you're boss and see what they say?
I honestly had to come to terms with the fact that customers are usually gonna gender me. No matter what gender they assume, it's gonna be wrong. It sucks but customers are just *like that*. That's a big part of why I started hrt honestly. At least now when I get gendered, it's usually the one that doesn't make me want to rip my skin off
I'm trying vocal practice so pitch my voice higher but I dont think it's working T~T
I let it slide - even back when I didn't ""pass"" (I've transitioned to more or less ""male"" and don't mind the sir/brother/etc., but when I used to get ""miss/ma'am"" etc. it was different).  It sucks but I just never wanted to incite anger, bigotry, etc. from people.  The main thing is making sure your coworkers all respect your pronouns/gendered terms/etc.  Having some coworkers do the right thing  increases chances that customers will too.  Back when I worked at parks & rec there was one coworker who often did rounds cleaning bathrooms with me and would go out of his way to call me ""they"" - like someone would ask a question and he would point to me and say ""they can show you!"" or something.  Feels really nice to have someone who has your back like that.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have super supportive coworkers but if you can find someone like that, they'll be worth their weight in gold.
This may help
https://hunterthelion.medium.com/you-could-never-misgender-me-d5e9687d8523
I've personally just come to accept whatever the other person says. Some say ""sir"" others ""miss"". Either way I just get on with the task and don't let it bother me.

My kids call me both Mom *and* Dad and I just respond to both. I don't try to make a correction. But maybe I'm more gender fluid than a pure enby.
Honestly, you're gonna have to let it slide, or you'll end up with some entitled customer flipping their lid and screaming hateful shit at you.
Here’s the way I feel about it - I am non binary and female presenting, and even tho I feel androgynous AF and have been using they/them socially and professionally for almost two years…the reality is that unless I tell somebody my pronouns, they’re gonna assume she. 

At first this made me super sad, but now I’ve sort of thought about my pronouns as a secret I share with some people. 

I’m a corporate leadership trainer, and say my pronouns when I introduce myself. 
Then, if the chance comes up, I see some people struggle (trying) some people experience muscle memory and say she and then get mortified (trying) some people avoid using pronouns at all and call me by my name (trying) and then some people avoid me or simply don’t try at all (they either don’t get it or are dicks, and I don’t have to let them have power over me. Now I know who they are) 

I have conducted trainings where I forgot to say my pronouns, and I got she’d, and I practice grace and try to remember that if I didn’t share the secret with them, it’s not an expectation I can hold. 

That’s just my own thoughts around it - might not be the right way but it has helped me feel less fucked up when I’m she’d all over the place.
Ignore the customers, unless it's a regular. Correct the co-workers, if spoons are available to do so. Wear a pronoun pin, and feel free to write off anyone who ignores it. That's about all I got.
I wear a pin as well and am always misgendered by patrons. I don’t worry about it. I agree that it gets annoying by the end of the day, but it is what is. My coworkers get it right and apologize if they slip up, so that’s what matters to me.
I just let it slide unless I know I’m going to be interacting with them repeatedly. Hell, I forget people’s names all the time and have definitely misgendered cis people because I’m in the “flow” of work
I let it slide for customers. I correct coworkers.
I just plain ignore it until they stop using a gendered term at all. I won't answer to ma'am or sir at all. Just 'excuse me' is 100% sufficient. 


Especially when it's the doorchaser. I just spent an absurd amount of money on your garbage, walmart, I'm not about to respond to someone haranguing me over my receipt who is also calling for a woman/man. I'm not a man or woman. Therefore, they must be speaking to someone else if they are saying sir or ma'am. It's as simple as that.
I know this doesnt apply to amab, but hoping some afabs might find this useful. When a customer says “excuse me Miss…” my brain will finish “Miss…ter” or when customers say “thank you Ma’am” i pretend they said “man”
It just helps lift the burden of gender correctness off me a little bit. I know its hard constantly getting misgendered but i just remind myself I’m an NPC to them.
Unfortunately, when it comes to customers you kind of have to let it slide. I know it sucks! Especially when you're getting misgendered 100x a day but it's usually not worth the battle. While some folks are probably totally onboard with calling you the correct pronouns, correcting certain people will just be an invitation to unnecessary confrontation.
If it's the first time I let it slide but a regular customer I make mention I have preferred pronouns. However there's some people who don't care so pick your battles
So, in my native language there is no such things as a gender neutral pronoun, so I mostly let it slide. In English speaking contexts I am a bit more active to remind people, but as I understand it,  a nonbinary gender is a concept sometimes hard to grab for people, so I am not very keen of confrontation because of that. (It's not possible to change people's minds, confrontation will just alienate us further)
I mean I let it slide , yeah it does get to me but like you're never gonna see them fuckers again ,like I kinda believe pronouns are a personal thing that is introduced when you're meeting someone. But these people don't care about your existence as a human being they just have to interact with you to pay for their meal
[deleted]
Yeah, this too. I'd probably be correcting 15 customers a day!! Luckily my coworkers and management are all super respectful, so that definitely evens things out
same here. i’ll correct a coworker. but i don’t correct customers. i don’t want to deal with the awkwardness or put myself in a dangerous situation
This answer is phenom
I absolutely adore your answer. Self love and acceptance is definitely a long fought journey, and definitely more sustainable than trying to take on the words of every passerby. Thankyou so much for this insight.
Gay crimes are the best crimes, muahahaha! And definitely spot on about the tip money, especially where my fellow employees rely on how I do on the register to get good tips at my place of work.
Gay crimes is the hill I want to die on!
It says they/them 😊😊
same, and tbh personally I couldnt care less. We are making stuff more complicated, so it cannot be expected that everybody just knows. Especially if it is based internal feelings.
You're not wrong. I absolutely got more of the pointed misgendering-based-on-perceived-AGAB when I was wearing a they/them pin. People who'd never spoken to me before were suddenly tripping over themselves to use gendered terms at me, with smug smirks on their faces. It's fucking surreal how quickly grown adults will turn into sneering playground brats if they think it's time to bully someone.
Yeah, this happened when I added my pronouns to my work email signature.
the customers aren’t there to be about OP, and OP already knows that. i would even hazard to say EVERYONE who’s ever worked in any form of customer service does?

but there’s still a chance, line or no line, that they’re reading their pin. i say this because i used to wear a pronoun pin while working a customer service job and, even on busy days, people (however annoyed they were to see it) would ask me about it or comment on it. very, VERY few people actually used the information on it, and that’s their issue. but, between the people getting upset and people telling me what a great ally i was 🫠, people were absolutely reading the pin.

i guess this is to say, don’t discourage OP. them wearing a pin doesn’t mean they think customer service is “all about them” or whatever, it’s a quick way to communicate important information - and whether people actually read or RESPECT that important information is on the people themselves, and says more about the customers than the pin or OP.
if anything this is just a more potent argument that the average entitled customer shouldn't notice an employee's gender at ALL, which would actually be amazing
Gay Crime Hill!
Thanks, what's your preference for an alternative to sir/ma'am/miss? I hate all of those but I also hated when people would read my name for some reason--it always sounded creepy!
in person, not getting mistaken for female cause I'm 5'4"" and curvy is pretty hopeless (my asthma won't let me bind, but it wouldn't solve the hips and height anyway). but in text, my chosen name is sufficiently ambiguous that they don't know which to use to intentionally misgender me, hah! or they guess NOT my assigned gender, since I purposely picked a name that's like 80/20 male/female instead of a 50/50 one... even though I'm definitely not a guy, it hurts less to be misgendered that direction, because it isn't what I'm used to getting, and counteracts the too-femme body. And it at least forces people to recalculate their assumptions between the name and the body.

and if I made someone actually notice their gender assumptions and think about them for a split second, that's a bit of a win in itself, right? I'm in ur head, queering ur brainz!


and of course, there's not actually any truly non gendered option for the Sir/Ma'am/Miss issue. I always hated ma'am/miss even when I still thought I was female, because it forces them to guess age/marital status, too - there's no Ms. equivalent either. So those words are just terrible all around! We really need to come up with a better solution....
The gender neutral alternative is Mixter, which is abbreviated as Mx.
For Mr. etc yes, but not so much for Sir/Ma'am/Miss.
Mixter is the non-binary alternative to Sir etc.
It's really not though.

For starters, many people who don't know anyone who uses Mx. have never heard it said, even though they might have seen it in writing. Even for those who are familiar with it or use it, some instead say ""mix"" (by analogy with ""Ms.""/""miz"")... which is my own preference as well. Both because I just feel more comfortable with it personally, and because I strongly suspect the Miss/Mrs/Ms. distinction means people are more likely to ask for clarification if they can't figure out which someone said, instead of assuming it was ""Mr."".

And at least in my area, addressing someone as ""mister"" (without last name) is more akin to ""buster"" than ""sir"", and ""missus"" isn't used at all.... ""mistress"", of course, suggesting something else entirely. So using ""mixter"" wouldn't come across as polite or friendly, either. Worse, people would again likely hear it as ""mister"", and take it as downright rude, making it a terrible default choice. Maybe in some places it works... but not here.
Did you mean Mx. or Mix or Mx? WHich are not short for mixter, LOL.
My understanding is that Mx. is short for Mixter. Which came first I'm not really sure, but I've seen other people suggest that is the proper alternative to Sir, Ma'am etc."	12e47ba	NonBinary	137	0.99	2023-04-07 00:56:18
Hi so I’ve seen a lot of hate towards xeno’s mainly for people who don’t understand them so I decided to make an introduction explaining xeno’s and other things related/similar/that they get confused with		"That was very educational. I did fall into the trap of thinking noungender = kinning. This does make more sense now.
It often occurs with neurodivergent people (but can neurotypicals can also relate to it)
Like sometimes autistic people don't really understand the concepts of gender so they use different things that they feel associated with
Like their favourite texture or sound.
WAIT DOES THAT MEAN IM XENOGENDER - i have no other way to accurately describe my gender other than “plant”
Wow! I learned something new today! I have an aesthetic xenogender, specifically a colorgender. Whenever I try to describe my gender, all I can think of is ""yellow"". :) No clue if it's related to me being autistic or not. Thank you for sharing this!!
This was very informative. I am a few decades old and in queer philosophy time that's like 1000 years. Thank you for helping me to understand.
I mean, personally I think that the concept of gender is obsolete in the modern world. It's kinda dumb that it plays such an important role in our lives. I propose that we instead move to a more fluid vibes-based system of identity and social roles, which is much cooler and makes a lot more sense in most instances.
Such a great post!!
So, could I theoretically fall under xenogender if I occasionally literally describe my gender as Spider-Man? I typically phrase it as a joke but mean it seriously.
I think this is pretty helpful. I do a lot of lgbtq education especially to older physicians and stuff and it’s hard to explain xenogenders. Generally I just say people want to use different words to describe gender, kind of like a metaphor. I’m not xeno tho so it’s good to hear explanations from that part of the community ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think this is dumb, but also I respect everyone's right to identify with whatever they want, and I hope that anyone who feels that this describes them is happy and safe
I love this! Very well done :3
Most of this makes sense! A question about Emoji pronouns though. How do you say them in your head when you're reading them? Do you just say the name of the Emoji? I hear things in my head when I'm reading and I don't know how to process it when I read the Emoji pronouns so I end up just substituting what the Emoji looks like
Oh this is great! Thank you for making this. While I use other umbrella labels for the ease of others, my true preferred gender label is Marfluid.
Oh, well, I guess I am this.😨
Guilty as charged, except for me, it's my favorite color :)
I had the same experience with this post! Also I love that! ""Plant"" sounds like a fun gender. :) I describe mine as ""yellow""
I mean, that's kinda what this is in practice to a lot of people? Describing gender by ""vibes"" and frequently having a lot of different ""vibes"" in place of whatever gender is supposed to be.
i really can't tell if this is a shitty comment or a good one
Precisely! What I names was an example as most other would be explained by the post itself
Oh wow, this was interesting. It’s weird to think about because I describe one of my genders with “bee”
How about hungry? because that's how I describe my gender.
I really like how you articulated this, because I didn't even realize that was what I was doing until I saw your comment :)
Someone once asked me to describe my gender while I was drunk and I responded with ""I dunno how to explain this but like... Bog.""
Mood. It’s just so hard to explain to people sometimes. Like “So sometimes, my gender is fancy cheeses and fancy dresses and light fingers and enjoying very specific things and acting a very specific way, but other times it’s bee.”  It’s just so hard to explain to people without similar experiences, especially without sounding like I’m crazy."	qoefe7	NonBinary	140	0.93	2021-11-07 01:43:48
Amab enby's first introduction to mansplaining in the office.	"Just got off an hour call with my infuriating news manager and wanted to rant about this a bit! I'm sure the afab enbies in the room are used to this, but it's a new thing for me and I'm LIVID.

Plus side my new manager isn't transphobic (he doesn't speak to the men in my department like this), downside my new manager is like the king of mansplaning

My favourite ""oh I see you have that as a separate line"" after demanding that I include something in a document I sent him. 

""Yeah, it's almost like i KNOW MY FUCKING JOB.

Also fun, not letting me finish any sentences or explain why he was wrong and also popusly telling me how stuff I had built worked. 

Wow these people suck. 

Rant done thanks for listening y'all 💜"	"Amab engineer here. Before explaining anything technical, I always ask the recipient what their understanding of the subject matter is.

""We need to apply for a csep in this instance, have you done that before? Is there anything you need me to go over or are you all good? I know you are a busy person so I'd hate to waste your time with waffle.""

It's not hard.
Amab here - was on a conference call and had someone explain how email servers work to me (in great detail for quite a long time). I'm a digital marketing specialist and have too many years of experience so I know how it all works. My boss (cis-woman) and me were shooting glances at each other.

After the call I was like ""have I just been mansplaned to?"" she was like ""... Yea that's what that was""

Plot twist is that the reason for a problem existing was in fact not what he was saying so he was in fact wrong 😜.

It's one of those fem world experiences where it's like ""shittt that's what that is like""
I am very sorry in advance to make this long comment about myself. I absolutely wish you to have gender affirming experiences that are positive for you.

.....

afab here, mansplaining is one of the things I absolutely totally hate. even reading about it makes me furious, because it reminds me of some of my experiences.

I just came out to myself days ago. I always thought that me hating mansplaining and basically every minute when men treated me differrently than others based on my perceived gender meant I was ""very feminist"". after I found out about existence of non-binary people (I didn't know non-binary people existed before I befriended a truns guy who normalized it for me), it took me few months to realize it could also mean I am an enby.

I still feel like an impostor thought, like someone who just tries to escape some past demons and I should rather be fighting them then saying I am not a woman. saying that makes me feel so good though...

please tell me if I'm valid. is hating that people treat me like women are treated in my country (eastern europe) dysphoria? can it be the only reason to call myself enby? (or maybe one of two, I hope once I get to have very small or non-existen boobs).
The other day someone felt it was necessary to explain to me how to open a car door. There was nothing remotely special or unusual about it. It was infuriating.
Damn right it's infuriating. Stay mad.
Sadly in this case it was with my manager and he was not really letting me finish sentences so I didn't make it to that point😅.
Even when not transphobic I guess patriarchy gonna patriarch.

Like in your case I'd mind less if he'd been right, but I had to shout over him in the end (after 50mins of him explaiing stuff wrong to me) which made me feel like a dick😅

Yay for getting fem experience, but let's try get rid of that one!
Hey no worries, sounds like your having a rough time of it. I was more annoyed than validated! 

Couple of things you have here. 
1) dysphoria isn't the best marker for being NB - for me it was the euphoria at not seeing myself as a man
2) you can be femanist and nonbinary :)
3) very very few people with imposter syndrome are actually imposters, and it's a spectrum anyway so your experiences not matching up entirely makes more sense than otherwise. 
4) Honestly from the way you are talking I'd be surprised if the reason you gave is ultimately the only reason, you just might be unaware of others (as I mentioned above euphoria is a good one) 

That said, hating being treated like your assigned was the first thing that I noticed about myself (I was aggressivly anti-toxic masculinity which is a good parallel to what your saying) and then as I accepted and tried to figure out if I was a trans women and looked at sources like the dysphoria Bible and stuff a LOT of small things about myself slotted together as symptoms of euphoria and dysphoria. 

Either way you're valid, but I think you might feel a bit less imposter syndrome if you figure out the type of nonbinary you are :) 
(I'm genderfluid between demi-girl and demi-guy for example)
Another afab NB here! You're absolutely valid. 

I grew up in a heavily Christian/religious area and as a very young child received several comments like ""You can't do *X* because boys don't like that"" - ""If you do *Y* then you'll never get married"" - ""You should be more ladylike, so boys will like you"" 

Comments like these absolutely played into my perception of gender and my perception of self, I'll never know whether or not I would have grown up to be female or not if I hadn't been treated like a female(badly) when I was growing up and going through puberty. 

Distancing yourself from gender as a way of coping with gender related trauma is absolutely valid and creates a mental safe space for you to be yourself and to heal the damage caused by hating how you are treated when you are perceived as female.

So long as you feel good about being non-binary, and being something else doesn't feel right. That's all it takes to be NB, is your perception and comfort in your own concept of self. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, I had business cards printed that tell say 'Don't be a mansplainer' and tips for not mansplaining in the future on the backs, it's a very effective and mostly passive aggressive way to shut a dude up when he's mansplaining at you :)
Gender, though very personal, does not exist in a vacuum. It has societal implications. One's gender impacts and is impacted by society. This is true for everyone, cis and trans alike, and societies with more ridgid gender roles will have a greater impact on the individual. 

Gender dysphoria can present as physical dysphoria and/or social dysphoria. It sounds to me like you have a touch of both. 

Non-binary is a large umbrella. Trust me, you fit under it.
Alright, I actually have no idea what the term ""mansplaining"" means, not a native speaker and I've never heard (of) it before. Could anyone explain?
Yea getting that space to question and not feeling like it's offensive is a goal for sure.

Oh yes it's a fem experience I'd rather not have but I suspect it will happen more.
thanks for your reply! you are right that it's not all, this societal dysphoria (found that term on dysphoria bible, I hope it's right) I described was the first thing, then I realized that reading transfem memes in egg_irl made me go ""why would anyone want to be a woman if they don't have to?"" and that was the biggest dealbreaker.
then after I did something that's in my head masculine (firm handshake, starting conversation with a neighbour), I made myself not to feel ashamed as I usually was, and then when I fought that shame, I had a good feeling - maybe that was euphoria. so that's the whole story. it still doesn't make me feel like less of an impostor. but your and others' replies here does <3
Where can I get some of those anti-mansplaining business cards? They sound awesome and handy!
Thanks for the reply! <3 you calmed me down. I was fighting hard with that feeling of ""it's because of trauma, so it's not true/valid"". it's nice to know that I can just choose based on my feelings, even if they are there because of trauma.

btw I love the idea of those business cards
thanks! actually, more than a year ago (when I didn't know non-binary people existed), I met a trans person who told me he knew he was a man. I was puzzled, because I never felt like I was a woman and till then I just kinda thought ""society told me I am a woman, so I am and I have to deal with that"" (I think I thought trans people were kind of magical unicorns who were just born like that or something 🤦). so for thirty years I thought gender was only about how society treats you and what is expected of you. I couldn't get that concept that people have gender inside their heads.
one thing I will never understand is why my (usually very smart and analytical) brain let me simultaneously think that shit and also accept that trans guy for who he is.
I am lucky though, we started to speak a lot more eight months after that first talk, and he was talking a lot about lgbt+ stuff and non-binary people in his life. only then my brain started to question that shit I thought and accept that I should really start to question MY gender identity.
Maybe that's why I am still so puzzled by my feelings, a year ago I didn't know gender identity was a thing...
A man explains something to a non-man but the non-man in question is either as knowledgeable in the subject area or is more knowledgeable. The man assumes because the non-man is not a man that they would have no knowledge of the subject but doesn't bother to ask before explaining.

Does that make sense?
It’s when a man condescendingly explains something to a woman (generally), often while knowing less about the subject.
It’s when a man assumes he knows so much more about a subject than you that he feels compelled to talk to you like he’s teaching you something you don’t know, even though there is either 1) zero evidence that you don’t already know this or 2) obvious evidence that of course you know this, in fact you know more than he does in the subject because it’s literally your job/favorite movie/favorite video game/area of expertise etc… It is a common frustration among people who exhibit feminine traits as for some reason those traits tend to trigger men into thinking they are the smarter/more knowledgeable adult that knows more and he’s just helping/educating the other person. 
It’s 100% based on assumption that the other person needs to be told this information. Asking if someone would like advice or tips before helping is the way to avoid this boring and awkward situation. It’s actually an incredibly strong urge in some men, they will talk for like 10 mins straight just at you like that are giving a Ted talk. To me personally it always feels like the person is trying to establish that they are more intelligent but it just makes you want to walk out of the room.
100%, at least now I'm aware he might do it so I can be prepared! 

Honestly currently I still prefer it to the halariously inaccurate ""your one of the boys let's talk about manly manness"" thing that that kinda person used to do to me. It that'll probably fade as it happens more though I expect.
Aw I understand that, I've had so many affirming experiences since accepting my NB self. You are awesome and this man is a tool. ♥"	qhjwo3	NonBinary	140	0.97	2021-10-28 10:23:29
Struggles being nonbianary but feminine.	"Um, I'm bad at phrasing things so bare with me please.

After a lot of experimentation, and research, I know for a fact that I'm just non-bianary, and only comfortable with they/them pronouns.

However I know I look/dress in a more traditionally feminine nature, which obviously can cause a lotta misgendering.

While this itself isn't a problem, since I already know that nobody will automatically know my pronouns, but its afterwards when people look at me weird, or just downright refuse to use them and just refer to me as she/her.

I've explained it, but a lot of people I'm friends, and even are part of the lgbt themselves just don't really either """"believe"""" me, or just don't yse them altogether.

How I dress doesn't define my gender.
How long my hair is doesn't define my gender.

I like skirts, because I like how they look.
I like Ponytails, because I like how they look.


I just sometimes feel like these are the people who are supposed to know what this stuff feels like, yet most of the people who use my prefered pronouns are other trans people, so idk anymore. I'm grateful to have close friends who do respect my identity, but I just feel a bit betrayed (if thats the right word?) on people who I've explained it to a few times, Idk though, maybe I'm just being dramatic.

Thank you if you read this far, I just had to get this off my chest.


Edit:
I highly doubt anyone will see this old post again, but after a weird day, I was just looking back on all the positivity and support yall commented and just- MY HEART!!!-

Thank you so much for literally everything! <333
<Insert that meme of kermit holding a phone with heart emojis, lol>


And after a lot of time, communication, and a hell of a lotta thinking, I followed yall's advise and thought how my real friends are the ones that are understanding, and actually respect me too.

And while it sucks to have lost wuite a few people I used to really like, its better to nip the bud now, before it just grows into something more toxic.


And to retrack my statement earlier, a lot of people im close with (some became closer since cutting off others) are indeed cis, and have no hesitation or problems using my prefered name and pronouns!!!


While I know a good chunk of people aint gonna try to understand me, or want to, ah well, I've still got a miniture army of weirdos I hang out with :)))))"	"Oh, it broke my heart. People who I thought cared for me in actuality didn’t care for me that much. And it hurt so bad. I lost people I thought I wouldn’t because despite begging them to get my pronouns right, they refused to stating it was too hard or too confusing.

It’s awful and I’m sorry you have to experience it.
Always remember: You don't owe anyone androgyny. If other people don't like it, they can go home and cry about it.
I get this too. I'm agendered AFAB, but I present as feminine because I like dresses. Generally I don't expect people to know or use my preferred pronouns, so I'm always pleasantly surprised when I make/have a friend who respects them. But I'm older, so maybe it's just that these things don't bother me so much anymore. Respect given is respect earned, misgendering mistakes happen, and no one can ruffle your feathers without your consent.

I see you, you glorious person. You got this.
I don't really have advice but am in the same boat. I commend you for being brave enough to tell people your pronouns, I generally haven't been and am only out with family and even then only my fiancés family because mine isn't as accepting. 
I try to surround myself with that part of the family that is accepting and it helps my mental health a lot. Just be around the people who get you it's worth it.
i’m gonna say it, it feels like the only ones who respect  pronouns despite a certain presentation are trans people. i mean my own friend group didn’t want to call me a different name, my female best friend is bisexual and didn’t want too. my male best friend, who is cishet, kept saying how he thought it was just a phase because i dress feminine. i’ve explained it all to them and they got it eventually and have now stopped doing that, but still it feels like the only people who don’t question are other trans folk
I feel you, I don't dress feminine but still get misgendered a lot since I'm short/large chested. All I can say is that my friends who care about me respect my pronouns. All I had to say is that it mattered a lot to me and they did it. Sometimes they make mistakes but they correct and apologize, in one case a friend kept messing up and all my friends at the same time corrected them. They later reached out to apologize, they were having a bad brain day and felt awful.   


What I'm trying to say is, the people who care about you should do what makes you happy and when they mess up they should apologize. Your pronouns being respected is the bare minimum. Them not believing you is bullshit, they aren't the gender police. Like I know you can't make them respect your pronouns but I certainly would start questioning if someone really respected and cared about me if they kept disrespecting me that way and would be very hurt. I'm sorry your friends act that way, it's one thing if it's a stranger or an acquaintance but these are your FRIENDS. You aren't questioning their identity, they should reciprocate.
Gender =/= gender presentation.
I feel for you, I am afab and present feminine about 50% of the time (rest is jeans and hoodies) and I am too heavy to hide my boobs and hips anyway. It's frustrating. And folks not taking being nonbinary serious if you don't present way x or y... they suck. I am sorry you were hurt by those suckers.
I can relate to this. So very much. As an AFAB femme presenting NB, I feel like an imposter saying I am a part of the lgbtqia+ community. I am in a heteronormative presenting relationship (cis-gendered male husband) and it’s hard for me because I know I am also pan-sexual (I wouldn’t care what is or anyone’s gender or sexuality is, I understand that now that I am comfortable with myself I do not have the ability to explore that side of me). 

It’s seems like while at work, I can have my pronouns, and perhaps people respect them they don’t understand. I get misgendered because I like makeup sometimes (I worked really hard to become good at it and amass a decent collection dangit)! And it sucks. 

But I know who I am and how I feel inside. I know that there is a fluid nature and if asked I will explain but otherwise I don’t owe that to anyone.

It’s weird and my empathy extends to you. You aren’t alone and I wish people understood and respected that how we identify internally is how we wish to be identified externally, regardless of their expectations and judgments. I hope things improve for you and for all of us in this position as well
Any friends who dont respect you arent actually friends. 

I'm so sorry the people arouns you are making things so difficult. You're nonbinary as hell in those skirts n ponytails though! Those people just dont know how to not shove people in boxes based off of their idea of How x Type of Person Looks. 

Im really glad youre so secure in who you are and aren't letting their nonsense change hoe you view yourself!
I feel you. I have big boobs, wide hips, ass, and long hair. My voice is in the higher register. 

Hair is not gendered. Body features are not gendered. Clothing is not gendered. Make-up is not gendered. Anyone can look any way and be any gender. I’m non-binary but unless I try to hide my body, alter my voice, and cut my hair, some people will aways see me as a “woman.” I don’t experience my features as gendered, my body is just my body. 

I can’t make other people see me for who I am inside, but I can try. After a good reasonable effort, and someone still doesn’t get it, it’s okay to leave them behind or be upset if they are close to you. You get to decide who you are, not them. You don’t owe it to anyone to change how you like to dress or do your hair just so if fits into THEIR idea of what non-binary is supposed to look like. Fuck that. It’s transphobic as fuck.
Some people are cunts, unfortunately.
I feel that! Some days I’m wearing a dress which to most people is considered “feminine” some days I have the aesthetic of a plant loving vintage boy, but I always remember my gender and everyone’s gender is NOT how we look, it’s how we feel about ourselves and how we personally identify. Gender cannot be seen, it can be expressed, but that is not a definitive way to visually identify someone’s gender. The gender you tell others and the pronouns you use are to be taken at face value without question. No one ever has the right to try to poke holes in who you know you are! Be you and be queer. It’s easier said then done to say f them, but those who question you aren’t worth your time and energy. Keep those who respect your identity close and those who don’t at more of a distance. You deserve to be seen as who you are! Which is a lovely non binary person. Keep on keeping on :)
absolutely gross you experience this, but i get it :(. i was out about being NB years before deciding to take hrt, and if i’m being completely transparent, the social aspect was legitimately a part of it. and hrt did make a difference in how people treated me. i almost wish i could turn it on and off now (the changes i’ve got), to be able to tell who would be respectful even if i didn’t fit their standards of being “trans enough”. 

fuck anyone who claims to support us but then treats people who aren’t on hrt or who dress non-conformingly as “lesser” trans people. they are not allies, and honestly now that i am on hrt one of my favorite things to do is shut other people down on that real quick (when they’re trying to be all “well they don’t do enough” or “don’t you think they’re *different* than your case though?”)

sorry for the tired rant, but hope it makes sense. tldr fuck those people, and i’m sorry you have to put up with all their bs. you’re not being dramatic, you’re having a human reaction to everyone around you being dicks
This post was honestly kinda comforting for me to read today. I’m AFAB and present differently day to day on the entire spectrum of gender presentations.

Today I presented feminine…very feminine. I got dressed this morning and spent time putting a nice braid in my hair, wearing a sweater I really like, putting cute leg warmers under my boots…before I left the house I felt really cute.

But the second I got into public, I suddenly started imagining myself through everyone else’s eyes, and all I saw was a girl.

Queue dysphoria wooo!
I completely relate. I'm actually wearing a skirt right now. I'm non-binary and use they/them but most people just don't understand since I look so feminine. My hair is on the longer side and I dress in skirts and other traditionally feminine clothes. Some people refuse to use my pronouns all together. I understand slip ups but straight up refusal is different. I assume you've already tried this but maybe respond a bit more intense. I don't quite know how else to deal with it since it's a reoccurring problem for me as well. I hope people learn to respect you and your pronouns.
You’re not being dramatic, people are blatantly disrespecting you and that’s not cool and transphobic. I’m AFAB (demiboy) and I get so frustrated when people who know my pronouns refuse to correct themselves or tell me it’s not a big deal because it IS. I give folks leeway because I use all pronouns except she/her but when they deliberately use those pronouns, it’s just disrespectful.
I'm a masc NB and I get the same issues, for me it's not so much how I look on the outside but how I feel on the inside but, some don't understand that...
I totally understand your situation. I'm in a very similar spot. It's such a disheartening thing to think that if you do what makes you happy, the world will see you as female. 😔
I know how this feels dear! I'm a bigenderflux nonbinary trans woman and while I appreciate being gendered female when I feel that way, its tough when I feel more nonbinary and others don't understand my preferred pronouns and gender shifts :(
People usually equate gender presentation and gender identity... so i'd usually assume that they got that mixed up and start from there  


So for me, i'd show them a pic of the genderbread person, and then explain how my gender identity is different from my gender presentation, and use analogies that they understand like, when a man puts on a dress, he is still a man in a dress, so you are still a nonbinary person in a dress. and also I'd tell them that the perception of gender change so in other times or culture dresses and long hair wouldnt be considered feminine, like how ancient china everyone wears robes and have long hair  


if they still don't agree well... it's probably down to whether they respect you or truly care about you or not  


hope that helps!
Same. 

I discovered that you have a ""feminine face"" then I will change the pronoun that I've been using all along with you! 

:/ Don't be that person.
>they refused to stating it was too hard or too confusing

Honestly this is such a ridiculous excuse, it's just code for they don't care to try.
Agreed from my experience!!!
I respectfully disagree. I know a LOT of non trans people who would never in a million years question someone’s preferred pronouns. I hope more of these people come your way in the near future.
I've also just have people say I have a lot of sisters and I'm only used to saying she since you're basically a girl. I was definitely upset but I told them it's ok to mess up. They then said they would just call me she/her. Youre definitely not being dramatic btw."	yr3xau	NonBinary	137	0.97	2022-11-10 03:20:14
Why do people hate us so much?!	"I'm planning on coming out to part of my family that I know is not familiar with Nonbinary folks, so I decided to search for YouTube videos that explained the concept better than I could.

I knew that those topics always attract haters, but I swear that 9 out of 10 comments on those videos are from people saying all kinds of nasty stuff about inclusive language and non binary people! That sucks so much!

I feel like it's even worse when I'm looking for Brazilian content. Portuguese is a very gendered language and it makes people foam at the mouth just for considering the use of inclusive language. That whole experience ruined my day, all the confidence I had gathered to come out to my family vanished completely...

Anyways, just needed to vent somewhere. Stay safe everyone, take good care of your mental health 'cause the world is definitely out to get us..."	"Don't lose heart, YouTube comments have always been a cesspool of bigotry, It's just a bunch of sad losers, Alt-right bots, and 10 year old tate fans, not representative at all of the world at large.

Gendered language can be difficult, but it's the reality of the situation, any change takes time and we're unfortunately very much at the forefront of Non-Binary and Trans acceptance. But, that is our lot, we can't give up or give an inch now, or NB people will always feel as we do.  


And as far as coming out, make sure you're ready, and make sure you have a plan if it doesn't go well. If either of these are not true, It can wait. better to be safe.
i usually just stay away from comments unless i know the creator's community is very friendly/accepting. same goes for other subreddits (or other places online). unless they specifically state they're inclusive, i assume they're not.
É foda, né, xuxu? : /
We show people that there is a different way than the binary. But people don’t like this because their worldview is that men are better than women and so we show them that this is inherently wrong. Same goes for trans people.
Hi friend! I’m a native English speaker so I’ve not had to deal with gendered language very much, but I just wanted to reach out and let you know that you have support here. You are a valuable person who has lots of talent and knowledge to share with and receive from the world. Those commenters are coming from a place of ignorance and it’s sad that they would rather be fearful than curious of those who are different from them.

Maybe you could try to talk to a trusted friend and see what it’s like to explain your experience of gender with them and see what kind of questions they have before you try talking to your family. I don’t know about you, but I personally have an easier time speaking one-on-one with someone around my age than speaking to a group of people older than me. 

It is not our job to teach others to be kind and understanding, but if you are having trouble finding resources in your native language, you could always try to create a resource for others based on your experience. Also, if there’s a resource you like that isn’t in your native language, you might be able to contact the creator or author and ask if they can have it translated officially. Just some thoughts. I hope your day gets much better.
The society is built on gender roles. Patriarcal values is at the core of so much of how we are meant to live: heterosexuality, marriage, monogamy, sexism… the list just goes on. So whenever someone doesn’t fit into that ideal, people who benefit from that system, are used to it or were brainwashed into believing it’s the only functional system loose their absolute shit. This is what happened to feminists, this is what happened to gay people, this is what is happening to trans people whenever these groups started fighting for rights. 

Yes it sucks, but keep in mind: in the end, we will win :) so for now, just focus on your immediate surroundings understanding and accepting you; get yourself a reliable group of friends or family you can rely on, and you’ll be okay, I promise
YouTube comments are horrible. If you want to be sad/mad/disappointed, go there first (go to Reddit second, I’ve found, but there are some good places on both sites.) 

I tried the same thing, all I got was news articles about trans people trying to brainwash kids, getting people of different political parties to state their opinion on trans people, people explaining why transness is a pandemic, and then finally, way down at the end, like two videos from Jammidodger and an OT video (I recommend both Jammidodger and One Topic for some restored faith in humanity). 

It sucks. It feels like it’s everyone. It’s not. Two days ago I had to do the whole “introduce with your pronouns” thing because class started. The professor had misgendered me before introductions (I didn’t even notice). I had to talk to him after class about something unrelated. After that issue was resolved, he apologized for misgendering me and said “it will not happen again.” It’s not everyone. There are accepting or at least understanding people.
É foda, eu prefiro usar they/them como pronomes mas as opções no BR nem me agradam e menis gente ainda aceita...
hi! im sorry for the people that wont understand my post, i just felt like speaking to op more personally as a fellow brazilian, hope u understand...

como ume brasileire enby, eu quero dizer que o cenário realmente é difícil... mas em relação à família, normalização is the way to go 👍 nosso país passou por uma hiper criminalização e linchamento social sobre a gente por politização ferrada de transfobia. é difícil, mas não perca a fé! tem pessoas que nunca vão nos respeitar, mas comece pequeno e apresente a ideia pros seus familiares se possível de uma maneira suave, lenta e simples de entender jfndjdnenr às vezes usar metáforas ajuda bastante

eu juro q mesmo se eles tiverem uma reação ruim de início, tem a chance de eles ""amolecerem"" no futuro enquanto vc vai lentamente apresentando a ideia
tenta falar de celebridades famosas com essa identidade! amigues! colegas! enfim vai dar certo linde, #pas
Even though I knew my family would be supportive it took months to work through the anxiety to tell them.  It’s hard!

I also tried to find a YouTube video but it was kinda hard because everyone has their own spin. I almost wonder if it would be better to send a simply dry paragraph definition. And just let that be it. It will take them time to really understand it and what it means for you. 

Good luck!

If gender doesn't all fit into nice little boxes, then the world is a lot more complicated than some people have been taught. If people are allowed to choose their gender for themselves, then the power structures that used to have the power to enforce gender norms are losing their hegemony. They don't have any good argument for why we should go back, so the only tool they've got is violence.
I can only speck about what I see in my country but we are just an easy outsider to target, when our government needs to hide away from something or attack something they use us as a vehicle for that attack. They whip up the population with the media (or the media whips up the government etc) to achieve their aims for the day, over time these views get entrenched in peoples minds, if it wasn’t us it would be some other group, all we can do is love each other and build a strong community that can withstand the hate
It’s the same with Instagram, most social media has become so toxic and hateful. The classic “nobody cares” comment is just the tip of the iceberg and yet it makes me so angry. That’s why I deleted Instagram.
brazilian person here. DAMN YOURE SO RIGHT. PORTUGUESE IS SUCH A GENDERED LANGUAGE. I can’t imagine how much of a struggle it is to find the content to help out, from someone who never really tried but yk. good luck in your search!
Cis f here to say I love my nonbinary partner ❤️ there’s good people out there. Stay positive friend
Keep in mind that the internet is overrun with people who literally spend all day online criticizing everything. New music comes out by someone? Bunch of laugh/angry reactions. Someone comes out as queer? Laugh/angry reactions. Someone wants to provide educational material on gender? Laugh/angry reactions.

The people who are the loudest in these comment sections are doing it because in real life, they feel rejected by everyone and everything. They’re bitter, lonely, and frustrated. It helps them feel powerful to join the ranks of others like them and publicly attempt to humiliate people online, because in real life, they feel weak and insecure and don’t know how to address those feelings. And with all that being said, as upsetting it is to see people just bash people like us so much, a part of me feels bad for these people and wants to help them. They clearly need help, they clearly need good emotional support networks, and they clearly have trouble with their critical reading/research abilities/finding accurate sources of information. I wonder what it would be like if all these people got the emotional support they needed… :/
I think people are resentful of being jammed into their own rigid gender roles and are thus uncomfortable thinking about their own issues with gender, which they're forced to do when we're so free about ours. Also it's part of that ""we had it worse so you should too"" boomery mentality. So i mean on both accounts, projection. That's just one theory I have and not the only reason.
Thanks for that!

I live in a different country from my family, and I realized that coming out to some people have helped me figured thing out (I guess saying those things out loud and having people that know me react to them helps me understand how I feel).

I'm 99% sure that they'll accept me, but I want to make sure they truly understand what I mean. I'm not making any drastic changes right now, so I figure it would be easy for them to pretend they accept/understand without actually changing how they perceive me, so that's why I wanted videos, etc, to help them understand.
Terrível!! E o pior é que só de começar a pensar em pronome neutro já desvirtua a discussão, as pessoas vem com ódio!!
Thanks for that!

I've come out to a few friends/family that I was sure would be understanding (and they were!!), and with that I realized that coming out to people have helped me understand more about myself, so I wanted to try to talk to more people. I'm 99% sure that my family would accept me, just wanted to make sure that they truly understand what I mean.

Good idea about resources and all, I guess I'll try to save everything and share with others in the same position I am right now!
Yes, we unsettle their settler colonial patriarchal identities and normality 💛🤍💜🖤
Pois é!! O pior é que sei que não gosto das opções BR por falta de costume, e sem usar nunca vou me acostumar, mas ainda assim é difícil...
da pra tentar ser neutro sem usar ê/elu/e ou outros conjuntos no português, só da mais trabalho eu acho

Any other Bi Enbies feel this way?	I have no clue how to explain this but I feel so incredibly non-heterosexual. Like I feel like my attraction is gay despite gender or my AGAB. I really have no other way to explain it, I was just curious if this was a common thing lol.	"yes! im attracted to women in a lesbian way, attracted to men in a gay way and attracted to nonbinary people in a nonbinary way lol i hate when i can feel a person is trying to emulate a cishet dynamic with me
I feel the exact same as someone else stated. I'm attracted to women in a lesbian way and men in a gay way, and it feels like my relationship is gonna be queer no matter what because of my gender identity. Nothing is in a striaght way for me
Sometimes? I'm genderfluid and genderflux and maybe kinda bigendered so it's weird for me but that happens sometimes, you aren't alone.

That the queer intimacy I engage in with others can be genderfucky in lots of multifaceted and complex ways.
I mean, gay and lesbian are terms inclusive of enbies on both ends. So it kinda makes sense.
I definitely relate to this, I feel like my gender tends to go towards the gayest option in attraction scenarios
I’ve heard other people express this before but I’ve never really understood what they meant, to be honest. I don’t really get what makes a relationship or attraction *feel* gay vs. straight. To me, it kind of just is, if that makes sense. I don’t attribute an orientation to it. Whether I’m in a relationship with a guy or a girl or an enby, it’s all the same to me. The only difference is how society sees it.
I’m amab and I like women but I feel like I love them in a lesbian way. And when I like nonbinary people I feel queer. I don’t like men (maybe in very specific situation but no). If I did though I wouldn’t feel straight either. There’s a meme I see that I relate to. Whoever likes me isn’t straight and whoever I like make me non-straight as well
Yeah, I have a cis man partner and I hate when people treat us like a straight couple??  He doesn't really treat me like that but when we're together around other people they treat me like the woman. 

With women they treat us like a lesbian couple.

I never really had a word for like, why I never liked that.
Yeah same! I identify as unlabeled, and I feel like I'm just gay in every way possible
Kinda yeah. There really isnt a cis way to feel with being an enby.
Yes Im bi and Agender all the time
I feel like I need elaboration on this! You mean everything except cis people?
Sometimes my attraction to someone feels very gay, especially when it’s another non-binary person but I also feel very straight with my wife, and also felt straight with a previous boyfriend.
Yes I definitely feel that!

Honestly in simplified terms of my entire identity and attraction I usually just think of myself as gay.

Like my identity is so not cishet that any attraction I have to any kind of person just feels gay.
Yes but from a trans man’s pov? Cuz like I have an nb partner and it doesn’t feel “straight” nor do I feel like my attraction to women is straight. And of course with other men I’m just gay. (I identify as pan in case that matters lol) but yeah I just don’t see any of my relation ships as hetero normative. Even before, it didn’t quite feel like I was in straight relationships with guys 🤷‍♂️
I feel like I like women and other nb people in a gay way, but men in a bi way specifically
i totally get this lol it’s really weird
You’re non-binary. Any attraction you have is automatically gay lol.
Totally understand. The way I see it, if you date me you're at least a little gay, regardless of anyone's genitals.
I'm pansexual and AFAB presurgery and hormones in a relationship with a cis male, but it's so far from a straight relationship it's unreal. His boyfriend just has built in pillows.

I'm so gay I sneeze glitter
i'm nonbinary and transfem myself, and yeah. All my attraction is *gay*, including to my nonbinary partner :)
Thank you for putting into words something that I didn’t even realise I was feeling.
I have a very hard time describing my sexuality. I only date other queers because people have to some kind of gay to want to be with me, if that makes sense?
Lolol yeah my dude. Imo if you’re enby everything you do is gay anyway
Though I do only like women I see it like this: if you're in a relationship with me it's a queer relationship as there's no opposite gender/sex to non binary. If I were to date a man (I'm AFAB) and he saw it as a straight relationship I would be uncomfortable because that would mean that he sees me as a girl, which is wrong
Yeeeeeeees! I realized that no matter who I’m attracted to, it’s gay and that’s really neat to me. I am attracted to everyone way more also since I accepted myself as nonbinary🤣
Yes I with my last partner sometimes I would think this feels gay for context I’m AFAB and he was AMAB and that relationship at times felt gay
I'm really mad at you because this is my favorite comment of 2023 and now I have to log off the internet for the year on 6 Jan. I need to be online for my job and I'm probably going to get fired now and it's all your fault 😂
Same
Yup - when people try to flirt with me in an ""opposite gender"" kinda way im just totally turned of. It just feels wrong to me.
this
O. M. fucking. G. I never knew how to exactly pinpoint this feeling but you put it into words. I totally feel this, thank you!
This describes me perfectly as well.
You are perfectly describing a feeling that I am completely unable to grasp. Wtf does this even mean???
Thats interesting, I feel the exact opposite way. I feel hetero towards men but also hetero towards women as I consider myself more fem around the average guy, but more masc around the average girl. Its cool to see how everyone experience differs :)
I'm bi ace and a cis woman (I'm lurking because you all are cool and I find gender and how people experience their gender identity intriguing -- hope that's okay!) So I don't understand sexual attraction at all, but beyond that, I'm really curious what you mean about ""attracted to women in a lesbian way and men in a gay way"". Can you describe that in more depth?

Different types of attraction are super interesting to me. Probably the asexuality. And the brain that never calms down.
For me feeling attracted to someone in a queer way includes that it's free of gender expectations. I do not want my partner to project gender roles onto me and I don't want others to think we live a life according to gender roles. 

I'm married to a man and many people read our relationship as straight. (That's wrong on two levels: Neither of us is straight and we are a man and a nonbinary person.) They will then put a lot of sexist expectations on me, that they would normally load onto women. (They expect that I'm the person, who does the cooking and cleaning. They assume that certain items in our home like my husbands sewing machine are mine. They assume that we fulfill certain roles in our lives such as that my husband was the one who first proposed marriage. The list goes on.) Having all the this sexism directed at me sucks. It would probably also suck, if I was a women. As a nonbinary person it's invalidating in regards of gender too.

I wouldn't necessary phrase this as I'm attracted to people of all genders in a gay way. I would personally use the word queer, but I guess this is close to what OP described. Some nonbinary people call themselves gay or lesbian and many binary people, who are attracted to their own gender and nonbinary people, use the label gay or lesbian.
to me, it's actually more about how the other person treats and sees me. you can FEEL when a cishet person is treating you as if you were one too.
No I just feel like bisexual but not as a “combination” of hetero and homo but as a combination of gay and lesbian. I really don’t know how to explain srry
it’s like the idea of a typical “straight” relationship just grosses me out. i’m transfem and i am attracted to men, but like i wanna be gay in a relationship with a guy lol. same thing when i thought i was a NB guy, like i thought a relationship with a woman would be great but like not a straight relationship with a woman lol
You are totally okay! 

For me, what it means is that with women, I see myself in a more feminine way. Like, I have the 'female gaze' in mind and I appreciate women/femme people in the ways a lesbian would, different than how a man would. 

Same with men. I picture myself more masculine, and view men the way gay men do as opposed to straight women. 

It's fluid, because I can see myself more masculine or feminine depending on the others gender. If I am imagining myself with a cute guy, I am more masculine in my way. With a girl, my more feminine side.

It is a very odd way to feel things and even harder to explain!
Nah I get u. It’s super relatable lol
I get this but kinda opposite (but also not) so I’m a mostly binary transman. But I feel very butch gay for women, almost like I’m a man who is a lesbian although I know that doesn’t really make sense 😅. And then femme gay for men, like im mostly in the more feminine role with guys. And then mostly neutral with nonbinary folk depending on how they act and where they want to “stand” in the relationship. It’s just very confusing when I really think about it all 😱
Aw, that sounds really sweet! And it actually does make a lot of sense. It's like different friends might bring out different sides to you and you'll come to appreciate yourself in new ways due to your interactions with them, but generalized to gender. 

Now that I'm thinking about this, I realize that my best relationships, especially those with romantic elements, are those that make me feel more like a woman. I think I feel more aligned with the label of ""woman"" even than most cis women (based on the limited number of conversations I've had with other cis women and femme-presenting enbies on this topic) despite not necessarily aligning with a lot of feminine stereotypes. The best relationships I have not only allow me the space to experience my femininity fully, but encourage it and bring that out of me. 

This is really interesting to think about. Thanks for explaining!
a little late but i’m also a bi ace person who is also confused by this idea hahaha :) would you mind explaining what exactly being attracted to women in the same way a lesbian would be and being attracted to men in the way a gay man would be are? i don’t think i understand how someone liking a man or a woman would be in a different “way” depending on if it’s gay or straight
Interesting. Almost like you want to contrast their gender expression but still see yourself as experiencing your gender identity similarly? Man, it really is hard to explain. I feel like I intuitively understand it by the way you've explained it but summarizing it is impossible. Geez, language is so limited sometimes!
This is how I feel 🥳 yay transmasculine non-binary person here. Just got into a serious relationship with a woman when I imagined myself as a gay man. But really I just feel masculine and always queer. She is helping heal my relationship with femininity. Gay men are able to express femininity without losing their identity as a man. This is what I felt connected to.

After years of living as a woman, mother, wife and daughter, I came out to my family last weekend as Non Binary. My 3 siblings, their spouses, my dad, my Mom and I discussed it at great length. I had to explain a lot to some of them, like how I feel depends everyday, how I wake up in the morning.		"im happy for you and i hope it went well! 
I love stories like yours. You look great, and it's so nice that your family is supportive. Have fun being yourself!
You look badass, I'm glad to hear that you kids were accepting. (Thank you social growth). Also, nice deathly hallows necklace. XD
Much appreciation for this as a person who has lived under similar identifiers and is now exploring what changing those means and looks like in my life.  

I'm interested in knowing how your children interact with your identity and expression?  I've got a 4 & 6 year old and they certainly ask questions when I modify my expression beyond a certain point. 
It went really well. My family is just simply amazing! And my kids are even more understanding than i could have wished for. Thank you! 
Thank you!! 
Thank you!! Big fan of potter! 
My Children are 30 and 26...and have always been very supportive of me as a lesbian after divorcing their dad. They are extremely open and wonderful about my new discovery.

I came out to them as lesbian when they were 8 and 4. They were at first confused, but as years went by, they were very supportive. And today they are advocates and allies!

Parental Pronoun Police	"My child is 9 and came out as NB 3 months ago. I (31F) was already fluid in using gender affirming pronouns, but it is very much so a new concept for my husband (39M). 

I am seeking advice on when/how to help that improve. I feel it important to say that I try to not make my child's pronouns about me, but I feel defensive as I've struggled with a lack of effort from him in our relationship. I don't want our child to feel like they have to accept bare minimum effort as well. He called me a pronoun police (not infront of our child) but I feel like I'm trying to advocate for them since they're so young/unlikely to stand up to him (they didn't come out to him and wanted me to explain the situation). I don't want this to be another situation in my life where he is supportive in his words (he says he wants to get it right but its hard to unlearn old pronouns) but not in his actions.

Can I get some advice on where to draw the line? Should I correct him every time, once a day, only when my child asks? Is there anything I can do to help they/them pronouns to stick?"	"You sound like a wonderful parent! I don’t think it should be your responsibility to remind your husband to use your kid’s pronouns; that’s on him. Perhaps you could suggest that he read up on why using the correct pronouns is important? It might be a matter of understanding rather than forgetfulness.
First off, I'm sorry you've been put in this position. You sound like a great mom.

Your husband calling you ""the pronoun police"" because you continue to advocate for your child sets off alarm bells for me. That kind of behaviour doesn't sound like it's from someone willing to unlearn anything.

I'm afraid I can't offer much more advice beyond doing what you're already doing: the more you and your child continue to use they/them pronouns, the more normalized it becomes and also (hopefully) creates an environment where using those pronouns comes more naturally. If your husband continues to ""slip up"" then I'm afraid that's a sign he's not willing to learn.

I want to finish off by saying this is purely my opinion and I will admit to a bias against adults who aren't willing to do any introspection and change their behaviour when it negatively affects others. I'll apologise now if I've interpreted your situation wrong.

In any case I'd like you to know that I think you're doing the right thing for your child and I hope your situation improves <3
Honestly, your husband doesn't sound like a great person. You should correct him as often as he fucks up. He doesn't sound like he's supportive of your child or you. He isn't making the effort and you can bring the horse to water but drinking is, in fact, on him.
Policing, to me, that's a very specific term which has a specific meaning. I know this sounds like semantics, and in some ways it is, I think its important however to contextualize it in this situation. Defending the people you love from harm, imo, doesn't include ""policing."" Policing harms people you love. How is seeing your child for who they want to be harmful? It is not.

So maybe if you explain it to him in a way of ""not respecting our childs wishes to be seen for who they are can be harmful"" perhaps he would understand? 

I think framing it from the perspective that there is no harm in respecting your child's wishes to be seen for who they are, and also pointing out how detrimental it is to be lax on that, is a good start. 

Then explain that by correcting him, you arent doing it to show that you are ""better than"" him, say you are doing it for the health and safety of the kid. 

The fact that your child didn't come out to him-- perhaps they do not feel he is a safe person to divulge to, and sadly I think they were correct. I dont know if you are in a safe position to point this out, but it is something that can be changed with effort on his part. 

Luckily your kid has you in their life. I'm so glad you are their advocate! 😊 

this must be very difficult and I'm sorry you are having this struggle 💖
Alright, so here’s the deal:

As a parent you’re demonstrating to your kid, in words and actions, how they *can* be treated and ideally how they *should* be treated. When it comes to that-there’s really no such thing as being too defensive because we go to bat for those we love. Your kids nine now, but when they’re a teen, an adult-you want them to know that they *can* find people in this world that will go to bat for them, and that they should do that for those they love too. Right now, you’re doing that in a big way that matters. Don’t let anyone make you second guess that, because this shit is life changing. It’s the least dramatic way possible-you set your kid up so fucking well by showing them what support and love looks like especially when it’s in difficult situations. 

I’m in my thirties and non-binary. I cut contact with the relatives that verbally were supportive but could not get pronouns/names of me and my partner right. Why? Bc talk is cheap. And rarely, is it only messing up pronouns. Case and point my relative that did that constantly commented/assumed things about my partner based on there agab, that are not true and then argued with me about it. She constantly reminded me about my “body” that just amounted to inaccurate bullshit again that was assumed based off my agab and was inaccurate. It may take time, but it leaks. If you can’t get pronouns right you more than likely don’t view the person as they’re sharing with you. It’s the root core of why people care about pronouns. So it’s easy to say “sure fine wear what you want have your friends call you what you want” while also silently thinking “but to *me* you’re actually xyz” and we know that. We know when that disconnect is there

Also, pronoun police is a right wing dog whistle. I don’t know how closely your husband watches Matt Walsh and Joe Rogan but he’s mimicking their language. Specifically Joe Rogan-more so than Matt Walsh he’s a fan of “trans people can do what they want but they shouldn’t ask us to be apart of it!” rhetoric which commonly depicts anyone correcting pronouns as being a “pronoun police” or “pronoun nazi”. It’s the “progressive” form of transphobia bc it’s positioning “the trans issue” as one of biology and being purely opinion. So, it’s their “opinion” that there’s a strict inherent gender binary and you asking them to see different (or pointing out that they’re scientifically wrong), is asking them to be wrong too. You should be comfortable with them deadnaming and misgendering you, because that’s their opinion and you should respect it, just like they “respect” your opinion. <- that’s the tldr on the joe Rogan flavor of transphobia. At first it seems more benign than Matt Walsh bc they’re not talking morals or attempting to criminalize trans ness, but it dove tails nicely with the Matt Walsh flavor. 

When your kid isn’t around I would ask your husband what kinda relationship he envisions with your kid as they grow and become an adult. Your kids gonna remember this shit and it’s going to influence what they feel comfortable sharing with him/how close they want to be with him. Even if this is a “phase” and they decide to id with their agab and use agab associated pronouns they’re gonna remember moms support and encouragement and dads blasé attitude/unwillingness to learn/adjust. 

Both of you are demonstrating the terms and conditions of your relationship with your kid right now-so, I’d ask your husband, is this what he wants to demonstrate? Is he currently communicating what he wants to communicate through his actions? 

If you have this talk he might say, “ I told them I support them” or “they know I love them”, but I’d point out that these actions don’t communicate that. I’d also ask if he wants to teach your kid to value words over feelings and actions. If someone’s actions make you feel shitty but they say they love you, do you believe how they make you feel or what they say? Which would you want for your kid? If a friend made your kid uncomfortable but told them they really liked them, would he want your kid to go off the verbal or the action? 

This shit isn’t easy and it sucks, but it’s important to do and trudge through. 

Final last unpopular opinion: if it comes to it, don’t defend your husband to your kid. Be honest with them. “Your dad and I are talking things through with right now, and we’re ok, however im not very happy with how he didn’t say your right pronouns.” Rather than, “your father is trying his best, he’s from a different time”. It’ll deepen your kids trust with you, because they’ll know you’re being honest and sincere. And if your husband comes around it demonstrates that sometimes things take time but can be talked through. If your husband doesn’t come around, it still demonstrates the correct approach to interpersonal conflict resolution (on your behalf). 

This shit sucks and I’m sorry y’all are going through it. I hope your husband comes around asap.
Your kid already knows dad can't be trusted to bother; they see the effort made to respect you (none) and understand that the same sincerity & compassion will be applied to them (none). 

If a nine year old can tell he's not a safe person to rely on, what's preventing you from seeing or reacting to his disrespect of you?  Cognitive dissonance? Sunk cost fallacy?

Others have given very good concerns about why his terminology is its own warning, but overall, if you have to fight with someone you love to be treated with basic human decency, why are you doing it?   

If you'll put up with him gaslighting you, he probably expects it to be the same with your kiddo. What abusers don't often realize is that the most timid target can turn into a hurricane of defense for anyone but themselves. I don't think he anticipated that you'd fight harder for your child than you do for yourself.
Hi! My kid is now 11, but they came out at the same age. My husband and I struggled with this too. I was never called the ""pronoun police"" but it did take more effort on his part than mine. I think it was important that my husband really understood how misgendering truly invalidates someone and diminishes the very core of who they are and who they are becoming. Once he understood that he put in more effort because he would never want to make his child feel that way. I think it is hard for cis to really understand how demoralizing misgendering can be, especially on a daily basis and from those you love-but we have to get the message through for our babies. Good luck to you! Us enby moms have the best kids ever and we still have a lot of fighting left to do for them!  🤜💪🖤💜
Even If He is honestly trying correct him every time. You dont need to make a big fuss or argue just correct him casually every time he misses. He will only use it correctly when he uses the pronouns even when your kid is not there. Nonbinary people do realise If our pronouns are used when we are not there.
A Quick & Easy Guide to They/Them... https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620104997?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share idk if he would read this but i think it is good to have
If cis people correct on people about pronouns and gender then trans people and other folks should be able to. Do it for their happiness and mental health
I’m only going to comment on ways to help learn the correct pronouns. Others have already said a lot about his completely unsupportive behavior.  Only you can decide what is best for you and your kids and whether you should end the relationship. 

Don’t correct him every time. No one likes to be pointed fingers at every time they make a mistake.  Doing so will make you into a perceived bag, which it already has considering his comment about bring pronoun police. For a lot of people pointing out when they made a mistake every time will make them angry and less able to learn. 

Try to have a conversation with him to find out why he is slipping.  Is he trying, but really struggling to adjust?  Does he not believe it’s a real thing and thinks it’s a phase?  Does he understand how it impacts your child when he slips?  

When my kid first came out to me, I went through all the phases of grief. Denial (it’s a phase), anger (why do I have to change the way I talk), depression (I no longer had a daughter and all the life events that would come with it), and finally acceptance.  He may be experiencing something similar and needs your compassion. 

If you find that he really does want to be supportive and is struggling it very different from he’s just an ass. If he wants to be supportive here are some tips. Put a sticky note with the pronouns on the mirror in your bathroom so he sees it every day.  Come up with a signal when he slips you both agree on so he realizes he slipped.  Give him credit when he gets it right. Don’t expect perfection.  He’s human and will make mistakes.  

Good luck!  I hope for the best for you and your family.
Maybe sit down privately with your kid and have a conversation about it. Ask about what it's like for them so far when people gender them correctly and incorrectly. Tell them about how you are advocating for them and trying to teach their dad. Explain the importance and strength in being yourself despite bigots who may never change. Explore other things that are gender affirming for them, maybe there are activities you two could do together that would bring more gender euphoria and safety into their life. Ask them what they would like you to do/say if their dad (or anyone really) misgenders them. Perhaps one day when your kid is older, they can talk with their father and find common ground.


My parents are similar, though I'm an adult and my folks are into their 60s, and I only came out 3 years ago. My mom tries to use the right pronouns and is slowly getting better, but my dad completely ignores it. When I came out, my dad said he supports me and he hugged me and told me to do anything that feels right. He made it clear that his heart is in the right place, but I don't know that his language will ever change. I hope that at the very least your kid's dad will come to embrace your kid for who they are even if they struggle to express it right. 

From the outside looking in, seems like you're exactly the kind of mom your kid needs. You got this ♡
It’s up to him and in the end, it’s really his loss. And that’s sad. Good thing your kid has such a supportive mother that advocates for them.
I saw someone who had a younger trans brother, and when ever their parents misgendered him, the older sibling blew an air horn. Older siblings said it got them to fix it really fast. Maybe try the same thing? Idk tbh, but what you are doing now is already fantastic.
I would correct him every time. Not because that’s what everyone needs, but because it sounds like he won’t change otherwise, based on your description of him. Good luck
Honestly, as a non-binary adult who has felt like I had to fight for my life to get my own parents to even consider using my pronouns and taking me seriously, I think you’re doing the right thing by correcting your husband every single time. The fact that your husband called you the “pronoun police” shows me how much more he cares about his comfort than providing comfort and basic respect for your child. That’s a huge issue. I get that old habits are hard to kick but hiding behind that excuse will not help your child in any way. If he refuses to change the attitude he has, it will surely jam a wedge in their relationship. In fact it might actually make your child feel like a burden for wanting basic respect from their father. And with that, the trust will—slowly or quickly—dwindle. Which could lead to your child feeling very alone, or at least unsupported by their father. Not a good feeling at all. When I didn’t feel 100% supported by my parents, I grew extremely suicidal and almost didn’t make it. Truly. Let your husband know that it could be essential to your child’s life that he fixed his pronoun usage. Correct pronoun usage could very well be suicide prevention. Let him know if he truly cares about his child, he will put in the work, educate himself, and be open to changing his habits. If he doesn’t, or doesn’t want to, he’s a shit father and it’d be worth telling him that he isn’t doing his part to protect your child.
Have you said this to him?
It seems like your relationship has a lot of red flags, but you have maybe been willing to ignore them or deflect their messaging (for whatever reason). Maybe it would be helpful to have an honest conversation with yourself, a therapist, etc. about why you’re staying.
Basically the majority of people will call you a “pronoun police” for literally respecting people’s pronouns which is just basic human decency. Since the idea of using different pronouns is still new to people, they see it as weird and unnecessary. So you’re absolutely right to respect your child’s pronouns and you’re doing an amazing job. I feel like your husband has transphobic tendencies that he needs to work on but isn’t fully aware of
He has never read a book in our 11-year relationship... it's a situationship where he's on thin ice as it is, and the rose colored glasses have been not only removed but smashed to pieces.

But that said, I make the resources available to him. I have a few on Audible and have gotten most from our local library (which is in walking distance, yay!)
You've interpreted the situation correctly. We got pregnant with their older sibling 3 months into knowing each other and have stayed together primarily for the kids, but now that it doesn't really benefit them other than financially, I've completely reassessed that decision. This lack of effort is one of many tallies leaning towards divorce. 

Our 10yo gets it right 97% of the time and will correct himself. We're doing our best to make a supportive home.
>  mom.

*cough* pls adjust

> fluid in using gender affirming pronouns

Was interpreted as OP being fluid and using various pronouns (not, as I realize now, a typo for *fluent*). 

However, this is not the place to angrily downvote someone reminding you to respect others' pronouns, even when they're wrong about which pronoun should be used.
Thanks for saying what I needed to hear. He's mediocre at best and I've recently come to terms with that.
This is really well put

I would add that it *might* help for OP to express to husband/dad that efforts to remind him, again and again, to give a shit are actually a huge favor—to him. 

If OP weren’t there, trying to help him come around to caring about his own kid, how obvious would it already be to the child that their dad doesn’t accept them, support them, or care much at all about their comfort and happiness? Without OP there covering for him and trying to help him be a good dad, how clearly would their kid have already seen that they don’t have a dad who really loves them? If he doesn’t wake tf up and start expressing love with his actions, it’s absolutely on him that his own child cannot trust him; cannot count on him; cannot confide in him or rely on him. OP is trying to help save him from the mistake of violating their child’s trust. And it might be too late already—kids are not stupid, they can tell when people don’t care. 

He isn’t bothering to express love for his kid. Calling him out on that over and over again is an extremely giving thing to do, and him interpreting it as some kind of nagging is self-centered on his part, *at best*
Yes to all of this! And I'd like to add even if he doesn't listen to these people, this mentality is common in people who don't want to change their behavior. It's easier to come up with an excuse like the ones listed in this comment than actually adjust to a whole new way of viewing gender. I think if he's not willing to make the adjustment, OP, you're right, it's not worth putting your child through that. They deserve someone who won't discount their perspective or try to avoid making changes or learning things about them and their perspective on themselves. You seem like an awesome mom and this commenter is awesome for laying this all out so you're maybe more prepared to defend your child and your own perspective if you agree this is what's happening. This is why I love this community 👏 ❤️
I really appreciate the time and effort you put into this response. To say that you hit the nail on the head would be an understatement. I'm absolutely thinking about how his current actions will affect our child in 5 years, 10 years, and beyond. Neither of us had supportive parents, and it feels like I'm trying to break cycles, but he's perpetuating them. 

He actually did call me a ""pronoun nazi"" before changing it to ""police"", and while I haven't seen or heard him listening to those alt righters, we moved farther south a few months ago and he works on a military base (contactor doing blue collar work), so I don't know what kind of conversations he's having outside of the home.

On a positive note, my child and I are both currently in therapy (separately), which helps. My child's therapist, tutor, and pediatrician have all been great about their pronouns. I'm slowly but surely creating an exit strategy.
Most times, it'll just be ""they"" or ""them"" when ""she/her"" is used. But I get the ""yOuR t0nE"" comments based on those one word corrections. Thanks for validating that I'm handling it in a supportive way for my child, whose feelings matter more than his on this subject.
Added to the wishlist!
Protecting their mental health and happiness I'd my #1 goal
The dogs would hate an air horn but I can think of something similar. Might be a fun way for the 9yo to correct him.
For tips, all I could say is routinely use their correct pronouns no matter what he says. Use their pronouns all the time in front of him. Keep correcting him no matter how annoyed he might get. Have a conversation about how important it is and emphasize that he needs to do some internal work. Point him to some resources about pronouns. There are plenty of books, articles, YouTube videos, tik toks, podcasts, etc to look into. Honestly he needs to do some work, hold him accountable if he won’t do it himself. Though that really isn’t your job and he should take accountability and do the internal work for himself and the greater good of your child. If he doesn’t show any forward change, your child’s well-being should come before your marriage. Leave him if he’s unsupportive
Loud and often.
My child and I are both in individual therapy. I tried couples therapy but it didn't help. I'm financially dependent but coming up with an exit strategy.
Any book? At all? Wow. I don’t have helpful advice, but I’d like to bring up that my German teacher in college had a tote bag with the words “If they don’t have any books, don’t fuck them” sewn into it. I thought it was great.
Well I hope things work out, and it really sounds like you've created an inclusive environment for your children. If your husband ends up taking part in that (and I really hope he does!) then great! But if not, don't let him hold you back.

Edit: also I'm sorry for assuming how you would choose to be referred to in relation to your child (using 'mom' instead of 'parent'). I meant no disrespect.
Trust me honey, divorce isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. There’s so much societal pressure that you HAVE to be with your spouse for life and I don’t believe in that. I mean I believe it’s possible, but I don’t think that should be the default for everyone. You can evaluate perhaps the advantages and disadvantages of divorce now that the kids are older. But yes I would say not respecting his child’s pronouns is a red flag if he keeps insisting on it even after time passes and he still keeps doing it. Best of luck to you and you child 😉✨
I think divorce is a wise option, honestly. As someone who had a crap dad who was also a crap husband (not conventionally abusive or anything, just not great and didn't seem to care that much if he was hurting us, which is what it sounds like your husband is), it is better for you to leave than wait around and let him hurt you and your children. I wish my mom had divorced my dad, primarily for her sake. If someone doesn't treat you with respect, you shouldn't stay.
Your ten-year-old is acting more like an adult than your husband. I think that's pretty telling.
Best of luck, friend. I hope things go well for you and your children.
OP isn't nonbinary, her child is
I didn't downvote you, but while I take the point that I assumed a parental title, it was not done out of disrespect and was based on how OP identified (31F).

There was little context in your original comment, which confused me. Thank you for clarifying in your edit. I'm open to being reminded to check my assumptions.
Huh??
Big hugs, my dear. Thanks for being a good parent and I hope you sort this out, whether that means therapy, leaving him, or him finally coming round. You deserve better.
I’m glad I could help! 

Joe Rogan, Alex Jones (the dude in charge of Info Wars, alt right think tank) as well as a bunch of other alt righters have relocated to austin texas permanently. A lot of the talking heads are located in the south currently, and many target blue collar contract workers. 

Generally, they target them through shit like “the liberals wanna end this industry and then what will you do? They want to take away your career and make you work at McDonald’s” which hits a nerve bc most contractors have reasons for being contractors and not hourly employees. Once they’ve gained credibility there they tie it in to masculinity “they want to make your sons in to daughters AND they wanna take away your home. I mean what’s wrong with being a hard working man these days?” 

Basically they exploit their (completely valid) frustration at classism (“no one appreciates you” “we work so hard and those men in suits keep all the money”) but turn it in the entirely wrong direction (“so fuck those pronoun nazis and feminist cnts” instead of “unionize, and work towards abolishing capitalism”) and at people that *should* be their comrades. 

Anyways, it’s very likely your husbands been on that pipeline through work. When your kiddo isn’t around and if you have the interest/energy I’d look through joe rogans Instagram page-I bet you’ll find that a lot of the things your husbands been saying is on there. The podcast is extremely accessible with a gazillion episodes. 

I figured out all this shit bc I kept getting hate crimed in ~new and exciting~ ways and was feeling crazy trying to find the common thread. So I fell down the rabbit hole and quickly found that most of the shit I was dealing with was shit joe Rogan/Matt Walsh said verbatim. Now I keep an eye on them every so often to basically prepare myself for how I’m going to get hate crimed at work that week lol
You can have a serious talk with your boyfriend and set him an ultimatum. You can explain to him that using the correct pronouns halfs the liklyhood of s... And has a massive Impact on mental health for trans kids (Trevor study). When he is not willing to take this serious. I would not subjekt my kid to this. Everything that is not full acceptance will take a toll on their mental health. Even when they say its no big deal and not that important it likely very much is. We dont want to bother or cause problems for other people and therefore we often play down the effect misgendering has on us but we pay a hefty price for the comfort of others.

Your kid is very lucky to have you and be able to be their true self that early. Your Instinkt is correct you should not compromise on this.
Generally, with effort, it took most of the 40-50y olds in my life about a year to be 100%

Without effort I gave up around the three year mark.
Sending you emotional support 💜 
Couples therapy not working (assuming he wasn’t willing to do the work) is a valid enough reason.
It's a quote from filmmaking legend John Waters!

""We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they don't have books, don't fuck them.""
Okay if the don’t read or listen to any educational content. Not everyone who knows things will have books 😂
No disrespect taken at all! 💜
>  fluid in using gender affirming pronouns

Fluid pronouns implied not cis to me.
My child is 100% the type to not ""want to make a big deal"" of something to not be a bother, but I'm not afraid to be one. I am currently one word correcting my husband (simply ""they"" or ""them when the wrong pronoun is used) but I'm full mama bear mode behind closed doors. I'm at the end of the line with him. 

Thankfully Redditors have helped me validate that 3 months of getting it right MAYBE 10% of the time is a failure on his part and not me having too high of expectations. He'll have an eye opener soon enough
I'm hitting the 3 year mark of being in therapy this coming May and leaving him has been an overarching theme. Breaking up a family isn't easy, but suffering through a failing relationship is worse.
Oh thank you! I didn’t know it was from someone.
It doesn’t have to be educational even. Fiction is perfectly good. Anything. Ebooks and audiobooks count too.
I think it was just a malapropism for ""fluent"".
Tbh I've been trying not to say loose him. Sounds like this is only the most recent manifestation of some far deeper problems.
Audiobooks are my medium of choice, so I have a nice collection of my own, as well as Libby through our library. Dude won't watch documentaries either. 

I've outgrown him, immensely.

Friendly reminder for all the lovely peeps here:	You dont owe anyone ANY amount of femininity, masculine, or neutrality! Gender is a spectrum! Your indentity is YOUR identity, no one else's. You dont have to explain it.	"Thank you for the reminder. My logical brain knows this, but it's always at war with my emotional side, which tends to be stronger. But reinforcement of that is reaffirming. ,🥰🥰🥰
Very true. I sometimes feel like I don't fit in non-binary spaces because I'm not androgyne, don't use they/them, and I'm only minimally GNC.
I struggle to not start using they/them even though playing d&d characters who are NB feels 'right'... outwardly I can't pass for anything other than female (huge chest) and I feel like I'm a fraud...
I definitely needed to see this. sometimes I feel like I wont be accepted cause im too fem presenting
pronouns =/= gender. i know a cis woman who prefers he/him and many cis queer guys in the drag scene use she/her and he/him
i know you know this already but sometimes you need someone else to remind you that you are valid 💜
you can always try asking your closest friends to try out new pronouns for you and see how you like it 🥰 boobs are unrelated to gender for me but i can certainly commiserate over having “traditionally feminine” features. hugs!!
Fems can be thems! How you present doesn't matter, how you feel does!
Oh, I know! I identify as 'me' generally. But taking that step into changing pronouns at work and maybe changing my name is... intimidating...
Oh ok 😄 I'd say just go for it! It certainly is intimidating, but once I did it I've felt the best I ever have in my life! Highly recommend!"	yese85	NonBinary	117	1.0	2022-10-27 13:46:01

I'm honestly scared that even this community won't see me as a fellow enby..	"I'm afab, I came out to a close friend who asked, ""what kind of masculine tendencies do you have"" and ""you're just giving up on womanhood?"" when I told her I was hurt when she didn't support me, she said she just couldn't understand and told me to explain more. 

I've gotten side eyes and weird looks from others I've come out to. and I'm just scared that even other enbies will accuse me of.. idk pretending? or attention seeking? 

I'm thankful that a few of my friends fully supported me even if they didn't understand at the time. 

growing up having no validation from parental figures and as a bisexual enby who looks very femme~ it's really controversial and there's a lot of criticism directed at people like me.

just makes me wanna hide from everyone 🫥


edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and affirmations🥺💜 I greatly appreciate all of you wonderful people! I'm truly grateful to be a part of such a supportive community🌈🥹🫶"	"Sounds like you need better friends! You can present however you want, you don't have to do anything
I didn't tell anybody. I just do me things
You're totally still valid! You don't owe folks androgyny and there isn't a wrong way to be or present as enby. I know there are some who have a hard time understanding that and I'm sorry your friend reacted how they did. All the hugs your way if you need them!
Presentation doesn't matter nothing matters if you feel non binary then you're non binary, even if people don't agree or think you arnt only you truly know.
dont worry, i feel the same way too, but no matter how you present yourself, remember you're still valid :]
One you need to get real friends because that’s gross 😤 and two you are valid no matter who tells you different! We’re here to support you :)
You are valid! Gender identity =/= gender expression. Pronouns don’t even define gender identity. Some cis women are very masc and some cis men are very fem and obviously vice versa. Literally nothing but your own sense of identity should matter to those who are true friends and just people who respect you as a person. Your identity is valid!!!
Eh if you identify as enby, you are enby. You don't have to look a specific way to be an enby. It's like saying a gay person isn't gay because they don't look gay
I'm so sorry your ""friend"" reacted like that. 

It's not your job to make your friend understand you. I think your friend needs to do some soul-searching as to why they couldn't be supportive and educate themselves cause those are some ignorant questions.

There's no test or qualification to being nonbinary other than... being nonbinary. You don't have to act or dress a certain way or have ""masculine tendencies"" (whatever that means). Just gotta learn to find that internal validation (and hopefully some more supportive friends).
I support you ✨
As an agender person who thinks their untransitioned body is already an agender body, and whose ”gender” expression is all over the place, I get the (mostly unconfirmed) sense that a lot of people aren’t taking me seriously to be a non-agab person. It’s very frustrating, because I really don’t wan to have to overly lean towards a binary gender (expression) just to get to not have a gender socially.

I know as a friend at least one afab femme nonbinary person, and I really don’t think one’s agab should limit what nonbinary positions are considered valid, that would just be extending the binary into the non-binary. You’re just as valid as a predominantly (or exclusively) femme afab enby as an amab enby would be. Given that most people can’t properly tell apart gender from ”gender” expressions/traditions, you’ll probably have more trouble with people not getting how they’re separate in you, but you’re still just as valid.
I don’t know you at all outside this post - but if you feel more you when identifying as NonBinary, then you are NonBinary. That’s it. “Test” Passed with Flying colours 🏳️‍🌈 (badum-tsh) :) x x love from a fellow AFAB NonBinary human
every enby is welcome here it dosent matter what ""friends"" say and if theyre not supportive of you as a person then yeet them as friends and find new ones perhaps even in this community
Being Enby isn't about being androgynous and experiencing dysphoria with things related to your birth sex. Hell, gender dyphoria isnt what makes people transgender in the first place! Some trans people don't have dysphoria and are still trans(even binary trans folk).

Non binary is an umbrella term meaning not solely male or solely female. You are not solely female on the spectrum, so you are enby regardless of presentation.

I am Genderfluid and I often think that I am faking it or not valid on the days where I feel like my birth sex or don't experience dysphoria, and there are people here who feel similar to you so your not alone!

Thats my piece, hope it helps!
You don't need to have masculine habits to be NB. You don't need to be androgynous, and androgynous isn't inherently masculine anyway 

If you're nonbinary, you're nonbinary 💚
If you feel non binary then you are, there is nothing more about it, it's just you expressing yourself and your gender in the way that you prefer!
Lol I get trauma flashbacks just reading this. Fun times. I still don't know if my family actually accepts me. Ugh anyway you're not alone and like others have said you don't owe anyone some kind of androgynous presentation or ""stereotyped nonbinarity"". But there ARE indeed enbies who will jump down your throat for this. People suck.
There’s no rules to being enby. If you feel this identity suit you then it does! There’s no accidentally faking it. Just be you ❤️❤️
Dude, I’m in the same position. And I just want to say, I see you as valid. Anything outside the binary can be non-binary 💜💛🤍🖤
Oh honey if you say your enby you’re enby, you don’t have to check a list and meet every “requirement”— you are who you are and the broad spectrum of non-binary identities and peoples easily encompass you. You are strong and beautiful and your friends just simply don’t understand the vastness of the gender binary and are simply acting off of a very boxed definition of what they think it means.
that's so hurtful! I can't believe she said that to you. you're definitely an enby and definitely welcome here <3
My husband is very masc and also non-binary. It’s hard for people to understand, I think, but their job is to trust you to know who you are and respect that.
Enby people don't owe anyone androgyny! You ste completely valid and I hope you can find and get more people to understand you.

-Love from a fellow femme AFAB enby (though i can't lie wish i was a little more androgynous but that'll come when i chop off these chesticles lmao)
I feel that as a masc presenting enby because i still live with my parents its hard to a degree i question myself sometimes
im the mostly same way dude! nonbinary and seeking top surgery even though i present femme most of the time, no one elses opinions on it matter, its how you feel in your own gender identity! ur totally welcome in this space and any trans/nonbinary/lgbt space. if anyone tells you different fuck em
I’m also a bi, mostly femme presenting enby and get that a lot. Even when I don’t present femme to me, I still look it because of my shape and I don’t like overly baggy clothes. I just look like a “girl wearing boy clothes” it’s hard. But when I do present masc I feel like it’s too much and I’m trying too hard. I’m plus size and black so I don’t really get to be androgynous. (In the eyes of society) I also love pink and being colourful. I say all that to say I accept you and I’m proud of you. You’re not alone. 

Also you don’t need masc tendencies to be enby. I’m fluid between femme and agender. But I use they/them
sounds like you need better friends, and that's okay. 
When i came out i ended up finding out that not all my friends were actually my friends.
i had one friend who called themselves my best friend. They are nonbinary and when I came out to them the first thing they did was scoff at my name and then ask me if I was sure about it. 
i remained friends with them after that and they kept asking me questions about my gender in a very binary way. they also didn't want me to change my appearance and when i did they started acting differently around me. i ended the friendship once I realized that they didn't actually care about me. 

however even though i lost a few friends after coming out, (mostly from me leaving the friendships after noticing that they weren't really friends) i also gained a deeper friendship with my real friends. 

i have a group of cishet dudes i met at a gas station and i honestly never thought that they would end up being the supportive, kind, and caring group that they are. 
they don't misgender me, correct each other for slip up's, listen to me when i explain why certain jokes aren't okay, send me cool nonbinary shit when they find it, and they check in on me. they are the best allies i could ask for and the best of friends. 
where as my friends from school who i thought would be the most supportive have been the most distant. 

i have also been told that i am giving up my ""womanhood"" by an ex friend and her boyfriend. 
it bothered for awhile, then i realized i cant be giving up on something that was forced on me. that's not giving up, that's just saying ""no thanks."" 

i am glad to hear that you do have a few supportive friends. they will hopefully make things easier for you.

and all the people staring, or making you feel uncomfortable just know that they are doing it because you make them uneasy. and that is totally fine and okay. it's not your responsibility to make sure that your appearance is palletable to everyone, screw appearance, it's not your job to be palletable period. 
anyone who gets uneasy by your existence is a person who has such a small mind that they feel the need to control others. they get uneasy because they see you as uncontrolled and free and that bothers them.
but it doesn't matter if they are bothered because this is your life and you get to live it how you want, as the person you want to be and are. 


if any other enbys think that you are ""faking"" or ""not really nonbinary"" then they are projecting their own insecurities and gender issues onto you and that isn't fair of them. the only criteria a nonbinary perons has to hit to ""really be nonbianry"" is to simply exist as themselves. only you know your gender and anyone who tried to tell you otherwise has controlled issues and shouldn't be listened to. 

hope things get easier for you and welcome to the sub. we're nice here and if someone isn't being nice then we have lovely mods to help with that.
I know what it’s like. I told three friends, two being queer and the other having no idea what queers are like.

That one friend kept asking questions like I need to fully feel like it or about my style and getting them mixed up.

And the queers did not help. I was new at this, and should’ve waited to figure everything out, but wanted help. I thought androgyny was a gender, and they had right to tell me it’s not, but that’s the only thing they said. They didn’t give me advice or anything, which didn’t help at all.

Also, being non-binary has nothing to do with the opposite sex. It’s literally in between. The first question is understandable if they don’t really know what it is, but the second question is offensive
lol maybe it's just my trauma then😅
It's hard when people still treat you like your agab though. Really hard.

A lot of Cis people don't think twice about their behaviour.
Word!
Your trauma is valid and so is ""letting it define you,"" whatever that means.
We all have experienced some kind of trauma. Best not to let it define you.
I completely get that, only like 2 people treat me like how I want to be seen. 
It messes with me some days."	wgkld4	NonBinary	109	0.99	2022-08-05 03:24:15
Today is my first birthday since coming out and changing my name. My amazing gf works for a news station and had them feature my birthday on the morning show. I really don't know how to explain how good it felt to hear my name and correct pronouns used so naturally for everyone to hear. 🥲		"Woah that’s so cool! I assumed this was an edit of some kind
This is phenomenal! Happy birthday!! 😃😃
Hope you enjoy my deadname!
Haha thanks, it was really cool! They showed two pics of me and talked about my crochet, it was awesome :)
Thanks so much! :)

Being Acknowledged by Cishet People	"Ever since I came out as an enby I’ve only had relations with other queer people. I recently started seeing a cis guy, and I was quite anxious about how he would react to me being non-binary, my pronouns, body image etc. He was very understanding and very supportive to the point that he asked me if we could explain to his family that I’m non-binary together, because he wanted them to accept me as who I am. Even when I mentioned that I was uncomfortable with my breasts, he asked if I wanted to get too surgery and when I said yes, he said that he’d support me until the end. We recently started dating and he’s not slipping about calling me his “partner” and not a gendered term. 
I know these should be considered bare minimum and I probably shouldn’t be this happy about someone just respecting my identity, but god does it make me overload with joy. Being fully acknowledged, accepted and respected by people who don’t quite understand or relate to your identity is on a different level for me. His behavior has eased my anxiety so much and basically proved all of my fears wrong and I even feel like crying from happiness writing this."	"I’m so happy you’ve found someone who is supportive and accepting of your identity! Really glad you have that kind of person in your life. Wishing the best for the both of you.
u definitely should feel happy abt getting respect! it sounds like u might not have had all that much in the past
That's so great they support you
I love this for you! I've been struggling with getting people to use the correct terms, and it sucks because it also comes from other non-binaries. I physically cant present androgynous due to my masculine features but everyone defaults to he/him and man. The amount of times an 'ally' or other lgbt person has misgendered me and didnt seem to care is astounding. I'm beginning to think its because of how I look.
Yayyy! I'm so happy for you \^\^ I definitely get both sides of this, dating people that don't get it really, and then people that are super awesome about it even though they're cis! I wish you the best of luck.
This is so nice and sweet! I hope the best for you two
He sounds like a keeper and im happy youve found someone who is willing to support you through everything and is willing to go at a pace that makes you comfortable and helps your settle when you need it. Theres no alot of nice people in this world sad to say but when we meet em it makes it that more better and its warming youve found someone who down to earth i wish you all the best
Thank you so much!
I’ve mostly surrounded myself with queer people so it’s not too bad, but my family doesn’t know therefore it’s constant misgendering on their part and the family members who do know, along with the other cishet people that I’ve told, while not in bad faith, can’t really understand the situation therefore end up being a bit stupid around it haha. So it feels really nice to be accepted purely, no questioning involved. Thank you for your comment!
People alot of the time have that misunderstanding but theres quite a few reasons why it happens none of em your fault i might add but it could be people just dont know or they might be confused. But this is understandable it happens to me all the time and i usually listen to the tone if their voice as to if they are genuine or trying to insult me. If they are geuine ill politely correct them so they know in the future if they are trying to insult me ill pride my wsy through and say its my life not yours i csn do what i like snd it usually shuts them right up and ill walk away. Im not afraid to fight but ill never strike first (self defense law) i dont mean to mean but the best thing to combat it is to be thick skined and stick to your guns no one can get to you but you have a bite snd its part of being hsppy with yourself. The more you accept yourself the more people will accept you. Its like a saying from rupaul (roast me if you will but its a bloody good saying) if you can't love yourself how in the hell you gonna love somebody else. Ive misgendered alot of people so now i ask before i even start the conversation but you cant expect people to do that its like driving you treat everyone like an idiot. So you keep 2 seconds distance from the driver in front  and you watch what they do.

Sorry for the long post but i hope this helps 🥰

My mom told me that my short hair makes me look like I have cancer	"I've been out to her for 2 years. 3-4 months ago I started just shaving my hair off when I got tired of it. It's cheap, gender affirming and it's really great for my sensory issues. I love it. 

My step dad said something about my hair and I got annoyed. My mother stepped in to tell me how it made me look like a cancer patient, and then went on to explain why. I told her I know that chemo affects the hair, but that I find it weird to look at someone with very short hair (I was never bald, just shaved to 3mm) and just assume they must have cancer. It annoys me even more that they would think that about me when they know my gender identity (she even said that she doesn't think that about bald men). 

I'm AFAB and not on hormones, which makes it all seem like ""I see you as a woman and women are only bald when they are sick"". 

I'm just so frustrated and sad that they make me feel like this. I'm spending Christmas with them tomorrow, so I can't even distance myself from them right now. 

Sorry for the vent. I needed some air"	"I have cancer. And a full head of hair. They're being weird and shitty. The bald thing isn't what makes people look like they're on chemo, I promise you that. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with that! Just know that not only are they being transphobic they're *also* being ableist. Tune them out, only argue if it's a matter of safety. The people who matter won't care.
I'm a trans woman but I shave my head too (for each new moon), so I feel ya. I wear wigs most of the time now, but people have told me I look like a cancer patient without them; or of course, like a man, especially since I'm still pre-E/surgeries. I'm usually able to just filter out other people's assumptions these days, mostly because I don't want to keep wasting my energy on people who won't even try to respect me.

Hang in there, and keep on doing what makes you comfortable!
I shaved my hair in high school and college. It was nice not having to mess with it. The cancer part is weird; there are a lot of people without cancer with shaved heads.
I think it’s really important to pause and ask ourselves what kind of people use “_____ patient” as an insult, especially as a vehicle to insult someone’s looks. Let’s really reflect on that.
Response to such a comment: ""If I do, it's probably caused by your shit attitude.""
Your hair. Your choice. 

Isn’t it that simple? Your parents should accept your freedom to chose what works for you.
Her statement says more about her than it does about you. It’s not even about you, because as Fast Eddie said, “It’s not whether they’re right or wrong about you. Is that they’re giving you $h!t.” I’m glad your hair makes you feel good! Too bad they can’t just be happy for you too.
I’ve been waiting for summer (southern hem) to finally shave my head and feel that gender euphoria. 

I ended up injuring my spine recently and now use a wheelchair to get around. Unfortunately I can’t help but feel now is no longer the time to take the plunge :(
my dad told me the same thing when i shaved mine. fucked up
wow thats gross of them transphoia and ablism id leave or cut them off asap
Their loss 💅💕
Personally, I’m a fan of “the only cancer here is you”"	ztpf4i	NonBinary	99	0.99	2022-12-23 18:44:08
Yesterday a kid asked me if I wear a bikini or shorts when I go to the beach and I’ve been feeling dysphoric since	"I work with kids ranging from k-12 and have been pretty open about explaining my pronouns and correcting them when I get misgendered.  For the most part they’re cool about it, but there’s one that stresses me out lol

He’s a kid, he’s curious.  He’s trying with my pronouns and is mostly fine when I correct him (I let it slide now and again cuz I don’t wanna overwhelm them or anything).  But like I said, he’s curious and hasn’t met someone like me before, so he’s asking questions.

I don’t wanna just dismiss his questions because I want to help him understand, but it’s exhausting at times.  He asked yesterday if I’d wear shorts or a bikini when I go to the beach.  And this questioned bugged me, heck it’s still bugging me hence this post lol

“I don’t go to the beach”
“But if you did what would you wear?”
“Jeans and a hoodie, like I’m wearing now”
“What about for when you go in the water?”
“I don’t go in the water”
“Why???”
“I don’t like the water”
“But you live in California!  You were born on an island!”  Funny enough me not liking water seemed the hardest for him to grasp lol 

I don’t like my body, never did like having to wear lady swimwear.  I don’t like feeling exposed.  I’m a baggy hoodie kinda person.  A don’t-perceive-me kind of person.  The thought of me in a bikini stresses me out.  The idea of someone suggesting it, or even the mere thought of them thinking it fills me with dread.  I’ve been feeling self conscious ever since.

On another note, same kid asked me “if you were in the military, would they use sir or ma’am?” Told him I neither, just whatever my rank is.  He started asking more hypotheticals.  Wanting to be done talking about it, I told him “well, I never plan on joining the military, so that’s not a problem”.  THAT blew his mind and I had to explain why the military isn’t for me which was exhausting in another way lol

Anywhoo, I’m just tired.  Tired of explaining my gender, my preference and my existence.  Tired of being misgendered and correcting people.  Heck, just tired of being perceived in general.  I go to work in a few hours, I hope he doesn’t ask those questions again.

Just needed to get that all off my chest.  I’m feeling a little better now at least.

If you have suggestions on how to answer kids when they have a question you don’t know how to answer or don’t wanna answer, please let me know.  Thanks ✌️"	"I'm not a teacher but I've worked with kids in educational settings and I feel you on how their well meaning questions and lack of appropriate boundaries can be exhausting :)

Perhaps treating it as a teaching moment around healthy boundary setting could be a way to approach this?

Like maybe say something like 'I understand your curiosity and it's always okay to ask, but that information is personal I'm not comfortable discussing it with you' and then gently but firmly repeat if they don't respect your wishes?

It's a normal part of childhood development to need to learn to appropriately respond to 'no' from folks and it's probably good that they learn that some information is considered intimate or some questions intrusive. You demonstrating that for them should be helpful to them in the long run
Lol back at Summer camp I would just mess with them. They think its funny when you make obvious lies like ""Im actually 49 years old"" and then fight you about it like No you arent! If u really want them to stop bugging you about it just make up crazy lies. Like you grow fins or scales if you go in water. It entertains them and theyll stop bugging you. Doesnt work on EVERY kid though. I think their curiousity is fun though.
His curiosity is healthy, but it's not rude of you to ask him to stop if it's making you uncomfortable. That's another lesson he should learn, that harassing someone with too many questions isn't cool either. I definitely feel you on avoiding the public eye, I have social anxiety myself. More than a few people in my surrounding area and I start feeling self conscious as hell
Make a sad face and say that you don't get to because nobody's invented the right clothes for it yet. Watch him try to turn a diving helmet into enby bathing suit bottoms for you. 

It's draining and takes a lot, even with well-meaning questions. It wouldn't be wrong to take advice from other posters and gently but firmly cut him off once it gets to be too much. And if the whys get too intense, be honest but gently so: ""I don't do some things because it HURTS. And like any hurt, it distracts you from trying to have fun while you're in pain. The beach isn't a fun place for me to swim. It's a painful place where people stare at me and try to see me as only a boy or a girl. Avoiding things that hurt is pretty smart, right? That's why it's so important to me, and why it's important for you to be kind to others even if you don't understand what's important to them.""

Others are also correct. Blatantly ridiculous lies are an excellent option with kids. ""I wear an entire diving bell, and I have to paint myself fluorescent yellow first to confuse the fish. Oh, or red if it's salt water.""
He sounds like a super inquisitive kid, and I am glad you are answering his questions. I'm sorry it is so exhausting for you, though! 

I feel like he will most likely burn out on the subject and move on, on his own. Hopefully sooner rather than later, for your sake. It sounds like he's at that age where you just get a zillion questions and ""why?s"" no matter what subject, lol. Perhaps today he'll already be focused on another new subject. 

Maybe if you can find out something else he is very interested in (ie if he esp likes art, history, a specific movie or show etc), and try to redirect him towards that and/or use examples of it to help him accept new explanations. (Ie, Batman goes swimming in his Batsuit w shorts over it in the old 60s show, maybe youre hiding your secret identity). (Kind of a goofy example but hopefully you get my point lol)

I havent been swimming in years but this year I plan to get me some trunks, a swim binder, and get out in the sun with SPF 9000+ on in all my hairy legged glory. 

I also hated feminine swimwear like, the moment I hit puberty. 

Hope today is better and includes way less tiring questions. 

Thank you for existing. 💖
""you know, these are a lot of great questions! But, I don't think I can answer all of them just yet for you. I'll tell ya this, each day you can ask me 3 questions about myself, that way I can give you the best answers I can!""

Kids love learning, if you make it a fun game and something they are openly able to do *within reason* then they'll absolutely be happy with whatever you answer them as.

Or you can answer as a joke, which frustrates them and they'll eventually just stop asking.

""What do you wear to the beach?""

""Oh full green suit, gotta blend in with the environment when I'm green screened in.""

""What would you be called in the military?""

""Chef, someone's gotta make them their sloppy joes!""
When people start in on the sir/ma'am thing, I like telling them to use 'mistrum' abbreviated as 'Mm.' or 'Mist.' 
It's a gender neutral version of mister/mistress from the Latin root 'magister', so it fits in well where a sir/ma'am usually goes most of the time in my experience. 

But of course you're well within your right to set a boundary and just tell him you're not feeling up for 20 Questions right now about any topic. It's good to learn to just respect people
No advice, just popping in to say that you’re freaking awesome for taking the time to be so attentive to this kids questions even when it’s exhausting. This is part of how kids will learn that gender isn’t what they think it is. You rock!
It's worth considering the strong desire to learn more, might be a desire to understand themselves.  I think many lgbt kids get obsessed with the first person they see that they feel like.  Could be simple curiosity as well though.  I'm sorry it gets to be too much.
Kids are curious j get the same at the preschool I work in they’re just being interested. I usually just try
Move the conversation when it’s getting too deep or give them an answer which will make sense for their age. Try not get too frustrated or upset by it they’re curious and trying to figure out the world it’s quite positive that he’s asking questions. But it is ok to be like I don’t wanna talk about this rn can we do something else
Say you wear a wetsuit and go surfing lol
It’s great that the kids are curious, but totally understand where you’re coming from. No suggestions on how to answer questions, but related to swim suits, “crop top” style bikini top (or just a sports bra) with trunks has become my go-to swimwear and it makes me feel so happy
I think your response should sort of be tailored to what this kids’ deal is. How old is he? Does he have any other behavioral issues in class? Is he just inquisitive or is this a pattern of trying to push buttons? 

Just from what you’ve written it sounds like this is a kid who knows asking you about gender gets under your skin and is less interested in the answers than in making you uncomfortable and drawing you into a lengthy discussion. (If you’re sure it’s just genuine curiosity, disregard the next paragraph) 

I doubt it’s malicious, it’s just that some kids really like to test boundaries and if they know they can make the person in charge squirm a bit they are going to say exactly the thing that gets a reaction. Essentially you’ve had a reaction to all his questions about gender so you’ve rewarded him with your reaction and now he’s gonna keep asking about it. My technique with a kid like this would be to give quick, simple answers and move on. “Do you wear a bikini or shorts?” “Whichever I feel like wearing, but usually I don’t swim. How are you doing with your book report?” Or “In the military would you be a sir or a ma’am?” “I haven’t really thought about it. Ok, time to get in line for recess.” If he keeps asking you can say, “I’ve answered a lot of your questions about this, and I’m worried thinking about it is distracting you from xyz activities so let’s not discuss it right now.” 

If you think he is genuinely curious, I might offer: “now isn’t a great time for these questions but I know you’re really interested. Let’s sit down at X time and you can ask me all your questions and I’ll answer as best I can, when it’s not disruptive to the class activity.”
“I would wear whatever I felt like at the time if it’s board shorts and a I’ve protective shirt then that’s fine if it’s a bikini and bathing suit cover then fine if it’s just whatever old pair of clothes I can find then it’s fine”
Seems to me like you handled the situation quite well. Even though a kid is a kid, it’s always acceptable to just say you don’t want to answer, or you’re not sure, or whatever, and then just change the subject. Regarding swimwear (if you’re ever interested), there are a number of gender neutral uni-suits available. I’ve got one from tomboyx, but I’ve heard nice things about beefcake too.
Kids are curious and have been fed a binarist narrative and live in a very overtly binary context where this is reinforced daily (more so than adults, since they receive direct instruction bc they’re kids. And you just opened up a WORLD of possibility for this child. Get out of your own head for a minute and consider whether you may be talking to a (future) non-binary/trans/gender nonconforming kid who doesn’t even realize that the reason he’s asking so many questions is because seeing this possibility for the first time is touching something deep within him. If you look at it this way, how would you respond?
Tell him that questions like that are inappropriate.
First off I second everything the other posters have said about setting boundaries: Super hard, but super worth it for everyone (I'm sure that kid doesn't want you upset either). 

Hopefully this might help satisfy their curiosity before your boundaries are reached though: I've worked in a few primary (US: elementary) schools with kids under 10, and I found that telling them there's another option generally works. I understand that in your beach example saying ""I wear something else"" would prompt more questions, but in the army one maybe this kid would understand something like ""Some people don't like sir *or* ma'am, but there doesn't need to be another word because you can call them by rank"" might work.

*Might*. This kid sounds super inquisitive though. I've been there and I want to reassure you that thinking ""shut up kid"" is absolutely fine and nothing to be ashamed of, just as long as you don't actually say it.
Shorts and a swim top like those ones with long sleeves would be a good swim outfit I think
Say your are trans make or trans female
.you know thee nothing that non binary
This! Kids should be taught immediately that consent matters in EVERY context. Obviously it takes kids some time to understand what can and cannot be said ""no"" to, but teaching them now is the best way to go.

And if you're willing to answer the questions but just need some time to think, or need a break from the questions, you can explain that to them too. It may take some time, but eventually they'll learn ""not right now"" and ""no"" are important sentences to pay attention to and respect.
Great point great point.  Practicing setting and communicating my boundaries is good for me as well
THIS. Kids love lies ***if*** they are unbelievable enough to be obviously lies. Something like ""If you don't go to bed right now I'll turn into a big green monster and gobble you up!"" told with the same grin you give them each time you exaggerate or mildly wind them up will usually be met by a laugh and them going to bed. ""Go to bed because it's time for bed"" will often be met by a child wanting to know *why* is it time for bed?
These responses are amazing.  I'm autistic, and if people had explained stuff this way to me when I was a kid, I would have been much better equipped to be a good friend to my peers.
Haha thanks, and you’re probably right, I think he’ll be focused on some new topic today.  (And if not, I’ll definitely work on changing topics lol)

Just hearing other people weigh in and have similar experiences especially with swimwear is always reassuring.
It's true.  If this kid turns out to be nonbinary, they will probably be more ready to accept themselves because of having had you in their life.
Don't want to assume OP's opinion but in their situation I would rather not have to go down the ""Why is it inappropriate?"" questioning route that would immediately follow. From the way OP talked about the kid I would guess that at this point of their development ""I don't want to answer that question"" and ""I don't want to tell you why"" seem like more constructive responses. Once the child understands that not wanting to answer some questions is a thing then you can move on to ""That's inappropriate"" (i.e: ""That's one of the things people don't like being asked"").
Also, when I was around kids more often, I would often get used to saying ""I don't know"" and ""I haven't really thought about it.""  ""Neither"" and ""Both"" can also help when you state them very matter-of-factly.
So hard to do, but so worth it.
I myself am autistic and honestly explaining stuff to kids is way easier than people want to think.
And saying “I don’t know” teaches them softly that authority figures aren’t infallible, which is a lesson best learned as soon and as gently as possible."	ud82cr	NonBinary	101	0.99	2022-04-27 16:48:42
I created this to explain being fluidflux to my parents. It's not quite as simple as I thought		"Amazing! Thank you for this.
Gender as an exercise in set theory
Huh. Didn't know about that distinction between genderfluid and genderflux.

Hmm. Thanks for teaching me about fluidflux. That... might be a good label for me.
Huh, I can actually place myself on this chart pretty easily. I wasn't sure I understood ""flux"" before but I think I get it now in a much more intuitive way. 

This must have taken a lot of time, so thanks for sharing!

Glad to be of service
Another tip:
Under the fluidflux umbrella, there are things like faeflux, faunetflux, faunflux, and the fae equivalent of faunetflux.
It did, thank you. And I'm glad it helped.💖

Little old lady came up to us last week	"What the title says. We live next to a set of flats, and this little old lady came around searching for her lost cat. We know her a bit because our mum helps her with some things, but we've never really talked to her.

So she's been looking for her cat, who's been missing for a while now. He was injured last time she saw him, so she was very worried. We talked to her about it, promised we'd ask around, and keep an eye out for it.

She told us that we're a good girl for helping her, and we responded with that we're not a girl, as we're openly nonbinary. She asked what that meant, so we explained it to her. Her response?

""That's nice :) I don't understand it but it's nice it makes you feel happy"" /pos

She is around 90 years old.

Hope you find your cat, miss <3"	"I'm a little confused about the ""she told us we're a good girl"". I'm asking respectfully :) Besides that, sound's like a nice story!
Seems like OP uses plural pronouns for themselves, so “we” and “us” refer to OP in this case.
as someone else suggested, yes, we use plural pronouns to refer to ourself. we're a system, as in DID/OSDD :)
Ohhh I see, thanks for the clarification!
Alrighty :)
Their user flair is 'poly monarch' and some countries' monarchs do indeed use plural pronouns, e.g. 'We the King'.
Holy crap we never thought of that-

the user flair is a joke an old friend made, because we're polyamorous, polysexual, polyromantic, and polygender.

we refer to ourself in plural because we're a system :)"	p6p8xw	NonBinary	103	0.98	2021-08-18 11:28:45
"r/nonbinary member discussion: All about ""Can you explain non-binary?"" posts"	"Hello r/nonbinary!

As we are working on the sidebar/rule revamp, we want community input on those ""Help me understand non-binary?"" posts. The current rule says that posts of that sort will be removed if it's clear the OP hadn't bothered doing a search. This worked for a while, but now the sub is so busy that by the time a mod sees a post that should've been removed, it's already been commented on to the point where removing it only removes access to answers that people have spent time making. We've noticed that these posts are almost never reported unless they're obviously trying to be offensive. 
 
Do you notice these posts? Do you answer them? Do you have opinions concerning them? Please share."	"> Do you notice these posts?

Yes!

> Do you answer them?

Often.

> Do you have opinions concerning them?

While I realize it would be impossible to moderate fairly, I think the line should be ""asking in good faith"" rather than whether they've searched or not. I don't mind answering variations on the question as long as the person doing the asking legitimately wants to better understand.

That said, the people who are just trying to start an argument or want to ""catch someone in a contradiction"" or whatever can gtfo. I report those when I see them, or when the discussion turns that way.

Thank you for providing a safe place for people to ask in good faith, and for all the great work the mods here do.
I notice them. I wouldn't prioritize answering them. However, I do sometimes read interesting answers and wonder if the question allows us to articulate whatever is going on for us, which ends up benefitting nonbinary-questioning people who wouldn't themselves necessarily ask that broad of a question. 

Ideologically, though, I do feel like ""What is it?"" queries have this implicit underlying statement that our identities can't just exist, be confusing to others, be fluid, or be inexplicable. They must be justified, defanged, etc. That bothers me. There's no space to go on Twoxchromosomes, for example and say, What is a woman? Can someone explain it? So it ends up recreating hierarchies even when the OP is asking in good faith.
I notice the posts. I almost always ignore them, unless I particularly have time and op seems to have a unique situation. I would ultimately wanna see less, but like you mentioned, I am not sure how you cut down on them effectively?

The other frequent post I see that kinda bugs me and I feel like folks don't search before are the ""I am writing a book with a nonbinary character, how do I do that?"" It's been asked before, and like the answer is ""respectively,"" and I feel like those are better left for a writing specific subreddit but maybe I am just the odd one out there.
I think perhaps maybe making a flair for these types of questions might be useful? I'm going to suggest a taxonomy if 90% of the posts I've seen on here (feel free to ignore):

- am I nonbinary?
- i want to support a nonbinary person
- i don't understand nonbinary/trans
- nonbinary inclusivity for the public (including books)
- ""gender neutral version of"" ____
- name me
- selfie
- transphobia/enbyphobia sucks

as for people breaking  the rules, I know the reason *I* rarely report is that because the report button doesn't have the option for ""breaks r/NonBinary rules"" so it only has the options of if it's harassing or whatever. I don't know how other subs get that to show up, but it may be something worth looking into.
I think its important for cis folks (allies or newbies, or eggs) to have a place to go to have these questions answered.. It can be really intimidating irl (and dangerous and difficult because of the virus rn) and also, I personally hate being interviewed about what being NB is irl, but I don't mind answering questions when I have time to put my thoughts together. My partner is neurodivergent and struggles with face to face interaction. It's great for him to be able to interact with enbys online who are happy to explain things to him, and who he can have an ongoing dialogue with.  Helps take some of the emotional weight off of me, and is a better way for some people to learn than reading articles, etc (which he of course also does).
 It's just another great resource to add to the list for cis people that want to be good allies. But maybe if it causes problems or is an annoyance or a trigger for enbys in this subreddit, there could be a separate subreddit specifically for this purpose (if there isn't already). 


Uh sorry, super convoluted and all over the place. 
Did that make any sense?
I haven't noticed them, but if I do see one that isn't obviously enbiphobic, I'll reply. I remember how confusing it was for me to do the enby research, and how happy I was when one of my friends sat down and explained it to me. I want to pass it on.

I think this reddit should be about learning what it means to be enby as well as confident enbies discussing, relating, ranting, and sharing. If people are curious, I think it's okay for them to post questions about what being enby means.

Maybe you guys can pin a message on the top of the reddit, giving links and giving a basic explanation of what being enby means for questioners?

This is one of my favorite reddits - thank you so much for trying so hard to create a safe space for us :)
Do I notice them: Yes.

Do I answer them: Sometimes.

Do I have opinions: Loads.

&#x200B;

First, I'm generally happy to help people who are trying to understand their own real-life situation (whether it's questioning their own gender, or supporting a loved one), but I'm not really here to explain or defend nonbinary-ness to people who are just idly curious.  I'd suggest a rule urging people who don't currently ID as nonbinary to keep their questions specific to their situation, and remember question-answering is a courtesy, not the primary purpose of this sub.

&#x200B;

Second, I think a sidebar full of simple explanations and links/ resources is a great, great, great idea.

&#x200B;

Third, I think it might help if there was an auto-reply or a pop-up when people first try to post a question that urges them to check the sidebar because their question may already be answered.
I notice these posts and answer them and I find them adorable and helpful for me and other enbies looking for discourse
I might be a tad late to input my views but personally if the post isn't offensive then I don't see removal as necessary, and if it is offensive then it's more likely to be reported. So I wouldn't worry about them all that much.
I notice these posts and those of their ilk: what do I call people besides sir/ma’am? What’s a gender neutral word for [parent, sibling, partner, child, etc]? How do I use [pronoun]? What’s it like to not be a binary gender (because I’m a man/woman and I don’t conform in xyz way but I’m still my gender)? So-and-so came out, how do I treat them like a human? I’m writing a book with a nonbinary person, answer my very broad question without any specifics. 

They stick out like a sore thumb but don’t detract much from my experience here.

I see these all falling in a bucket of externally generated questions that could be answered by searching the sub and by reading our experiences and putting in time rather than expecting time to be spent on them personally without the value of a relationship to make it ultimately worthwhile. Generally I feel like I could cut and paste answers, but for whatever reason the person asking thinks their question is new due to individual exceptionalism or some anecdotal nuance. The amount they bother me varies depending on my mood and energy.

I sometimes reply to them, I try not to when they annoy me because I don’t want to be combative, but I’m not always successful. Sometimes I answer them in good faith and put effort into my response.

When the person hasn’t offended me I generally don’t have more of an opinion than it’s mildly irritating. Recently someone replied to one of my comments directing someone to do some googling by saying that there’s a lot of bad information and they would rather people come here and ask actual nonbinary people rather than get misinformation. I think that was a valid response, my search engine knows my preferences and has selected into elevating sources I already use. Someone else wouldn’t have this. But they could still search the posts on this sub?

What I see as an area where it gets tricky is the ambiguously offensive person - someone who asks a question and by choice or accident says something that is offensive to people who spend time thinking about gender and care. Are they trolling? Are they unenlightened? We don’t know without more information. Methods of response to the ambiguously offensive person are contentious. Some want to be highly accommodating to them, thanking them for asking, gently redirecting their language choices if anything is said about it, and being hostile to negative reactions saying that getting angry at them hurts our cause. Some in communities don’t want to allow them to have any space, correct them with hostility and defensiveness, and are unwilling to engage in good faith conversation. I have been both at different times and I don’t think one or the other is wholly right or wrong.

I would prefer that there be a rule against these posts generally (but I don’t want it to be entirely punitive and clearly people are willing to respond) and ideally I’d like some kind of in-sub reference to faqs that I could just drop in as response and invite follow up questions when I’m willing. If that already exists it’s not accessible on mobile which is my only experience of Reddit. If it doesn’t exist I have past experience in writing such things and would be willing to offer assistance although I am sure that there are others with stronger ties to the sub that can do that.
is there some sort of masterpost that can be pinned on the r/nonbinary sub which redirects people who are asking these FAQs, just for convenience, and for reference when new people do ask but you want to kindly redirect them? i think that would be useful and i think it wouldn't be a lot of effort to do and automoderate (eg. an automod that picks up on when a new post is asking these same questions and comments on the post with a link to the masterpost of FAQs)
Thank you! And thank you for reporting the ones that go sideways.
Couldn't have put it better myself. I think it's great if people want to understand. Understanding others helps eliminate bigotry. As long as like you said--it's not a thinly veiled attempt at baiting people into an argument or trying to prove people wrong for their own identity.
I'm with this
Thank you. This is very thoughtful.
Well, we could create a flair which people could exclude through the widget in new reddit or the search, but I know mobile options for filtering are more limited.
We will be adding report reasons, for sure. However, there should already be a free text option where you can add your own reason. Does that not show up for you?
Someone (unaffiliated with any mods here) did make a non-binary ask community recently--last month? Not sure how it's going as I don't think they promoted it that much. 

It doesn't seem like there is nearly the level of animosity towards those posts as we had thought. The ""search the archive"" rule is really old and I imagine both the questions and the member cohort answering them have cycled through a couple times since then.
Exactly why im searching this thread lol
Thank you for commenting. That seems to be the general sense of it, which is different than what we expected. Very glad to have asked.
I am 90% on mobile, so I assume that's why it doesn't show up.
It shows up for me using old.reddit.com and is the method I typically use for reports. If the post/comment is an egregious violation of reddit's hate speech TOS, I report it under that heading instead. I'm unsure if those reports go only to admins or also to moderators.
Is it r/asknonbinarypeople?
I’m really grateful that you’re asking these questions in the first place! I’m new to Reddit, and really love the sense of community I get from this sub, and similar positive/helpful subs! (... particularly since I live in a lame little town and there’s not a lot of positive queer energy irl!)
I know the ""promoting hate based on identity and vulnerability"" reason goes to admins as well as mods. I think the ""misinformation"" one might, but haven't checked to confirm.
I don't think so. I think ""enby"" or ""enbies"" was in the name and it's newer than that. I wasn't aware the one you linked existed!

It may work well to ask mods of the existing subs to crosslink and promo them. It's something we'll look into.
Alright,  I'll do some research too ○°○
R/askenbies?
Looks like it might have been made about a month ago, although I'm new to reddit so I'm not sure how to tell."	kart2a	NonBinary	98	0.99	2020-12-11 00:43:35
Frustrated with Texas anti-trans law discussion at my work	"As I'm sure many of you are aware Texas has proposed an anti-trans law that will affect many children and their families. The law would consider it child abuse for a doctor or parent to provide their child with resources like hormone blockers, hormones, and gender affirming surgeries, and much more. Anyone could report anyone essentially. 

My coworker who I recently came out to as NB were having a discussion before I arrived about it. This was all for discussion we don't even live in texas. Since they know about me being NB now they wanted my take. Essentially they asked me if it was my child would I allow them at a young age to take blockers/hormones/get surgery etc. When I essentially said yes they were shocked and talking about all this ""allowing their child's natural body to grow"" etc. 

I tried explaining why I have my take, that at the very least I would allow hormone blockers and guidance. But I tried explaining that it's not more natural for a child to be pressured to be CIS, but I didn't have the right words to explain that to an entirely cis crowd. I feel defeated. Even though I know its not my job to educate people I still feel like if I can't explain my side adequately then I'm doing a disservice to future trans kids. Like if I could've put words together better I could make them understand even a little bit better. That it might help when these people have kids. 

Then they all got quiet after I said yes, and then were talking about how kids are exposed to too much. I'm reading that as a covert way of saying they might see trans people living their lives on TV and think about their own identity. My coworkers also seem to associate trans and lgbt+ people as sexually deviant so I'm reading their takes on ""exposure"" in this light as well. 

I told them it's uncommon for a kid to say they know they're not CIS at such a young age. But I feel like that's only due to the fact that kids aren't taught that they're allowed to explore themselves as humans. They're pressured into little cis boxes and fear their parents reactions to anything contrary. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading. I just needed to vent this here. I appreciate any feedback."	"Sometimes it’s just easier to say “this probably isn’t a great discussion to have in the workplace”, then walk away
The surgery argument is a red herring. Basically no one gets surgery before the age of 18. So the real debate is over hormone blockers, which are reversible. The argument I would use is ""why do you think the state should interfere in the private medical decision made by parents and their doctor?""  


Personally, there are often pros/cons to any medical decision. Why should I assume that I know better than the person affected and (if they are a minor) their parents? I would pose that question to them.
My young child is non-binary as well. They were able to articulate this identity by three, which is not coincidentally the same age developmental charts say to expect an understanding of gender to emerge. We live in a state considering similar laws, and it is an abomination. I will absolutely ""allow"" my child access to appropriate healthcare, whatever that means for them. The alternative outcomes are very clearly dangerous, and far more likely than the potential downsides from delaying puberty or hypothetically choosing the ""wrong"" hormonal or surgical options.
Children never get gender affirming surgeries so i don't know why people even bring that up. You can't even get hormones until you're at least 16 in most places. And puberty blockers are completely reversible and cause no lasting effects. I think a lot of cis people have really misinformed ideas about what transitioning looks like for children so they think some 10 year old trans kid is getting SRS.
“Medical decisions should be between medical providers and their patients and nobody else”
They didn't ask you this question because they actually wanted to know what you think or because they're interested in listening to what you have to say as a trans or non-binary person, they asked you do they'd have an opportunity to invalidate your identity because it makes them feel uncomfortable. You should have probably told them it was an inappropriate conversation for the workplace and left it at that.
Puberty blockers and hormones are both available to, used by, and safe for cis kids who need them. They don’t act any differently in trans or nonbinary kids’ bodies. 

The number of children who have had precautionary tonsillectomies is ridiculous, and no one’s up in arms about ‘not letting their natural bodies grow’.

Puberty blockers help prevent the need for later corrective surgery AND give children more time to think about what they want to do and be sure of who they are and, again, are also used by cis kids. 

If kids are ‘too young’ to know they’re not (only) cis, then they’re also too young to know they are. It’s exactly as absurd to say ‘they’re too young to know’ about a kid coming out as lgbt+ as it would be to say ‘they’re too young to know’ about a kid coming out as cis-het. It’s not different in any way at all. And yet your coworkers accept the latter all the dang time. 

Oh my god, babies and children are so aggressively gendered at. Even before they’re born. Holy cow. It is insane. And so incredibly annoying. (This is my rant.)

Trans and nonbinary kids who are not accepted as who they are *suffer*. A lot. It is child abuse to choose that suffering over acceptance. 

If your colleagues are interested in thought experiments, ask them to imagine that they are the gender they are, but everyone around them believes they are a different gender (opposite, if you like, although genders aren’t binary). Nobody accepts their name, the clothes they like, the way and length they want to wear their hair, the things they like even. Everybody calls them by a different name, different pronouns. They have to wear differently gendered clothes. If they try to speak up about who they are, try to wear the clothes they want, use their own name, call themselves their own gender, everyone around them not only doesn’t accept that, they all tell them they’re wrong, damned, perverted, sick, degenerate, they and people like them should be beaten or raped or killed. And it’s not just talk, they know those people mean it and would follow through. If they try to be themselves, their families and friends will disown them, or try to convince them that really they aren’t them, they’re just misguided, and if only they’d try to be the gender everyone else thinks they should be then they’ll be loved and accepted. If only they’ll lie and pretend to be someone they’re not, forever, everything will be ok. How would they feel?

Short version of this, ask them how old they were when they knew what their gender was. If any one of them says ‘only after I was legally an adult’ I will be…actually, I won’t be anything because no one will say that.
I wouldn’t say it’s “uncommon” anymore. I work with high schoolers and middle schoolers during the school year and elementary aged children during the summers and I’ve known many trans children. Like, trans folks overall are a small-ish slice of the pie, but I don’t think the difference in that proportion between minors and adults is nearly as big as it was even 10 years ago. Hell, I see in increase in the number of trans and non-binary students every semester.
Yeah, I'm p much done being people's teacher when it comes to identities and gender and orientation. I usually will tell them what I am, tell them why they shouldn't be assholes, and request that they learn more from people who have degrees in the subject. Therapists can be amazing teachers, so I usually suggest trying therapy.
Most people would be downright shocked at some of the conversations we all have at my work. Which might be a red flag for my workplace. However, I do think a lot of the things we talk about are important to discuss with peers. Especially peers with different backgrounds and opinions. That being said nobody I work with is a boomer so I think we feel safe. No offense to any boomers in the thread, but in the area I live in this isn't a safe discussion with boomers generally.
I told them about the surgery age limits as well. I think a lot of fear tactics are being used to pass this law as if there are doctors performing this surgery on very young children. 

I basically also told them that it is completely based on the individual. That criminalizing parents, teachers, and doctors isn't ever going to help anyone.
That's awesome that your child has such a supportive parent. I can only wish that for every child. I think its obvious by my language that this is a hypothetical situation and I don't have kids. I also didn't know the developmental age of understanding gender. That's really interesting. I absolutely would advocate for my hypothetical future child. In this instance I was struggling to make cis adults (who will certainly be parents in the future) understand without having done research on the topic prior, other than trans rights.  

I think many kids may be more delayed than others with more supportive parents in their ability or willingness to express their feelings on their identity due to the pressure of fitting into the CIS norm. At least that's what I think speaking from my own and friends experiences.
They've been brainwashed into believe doctors are just handing out gender reaffirming hormones like candy.
I also think it is so ironic that the fear inducing sentiments cause a lot of incongruencies in these people. This is a generalization but “the government can’t tell me what to do with my body (e.g., mask mandates, vaccinations, etc.) yet they say the government can tell other people what to do with their bodies (e.g., abortion rights, access to gender affirming resources). 

Their arguments are fallacies, driven by moral superiority.
Oh yes, I would not at all hold having gone along with the idea of having been a certain gender against a person. Wanting to fit into a family unit and feel a sense of belonging and safety is a very powerful urge in a child, and if anything it's more surprising that any trans and/or non-binary kids *do* speak out in disapproving families especially.

The thing to keep in mind about the folks arguing in favor of these laws is that they're relying on scare tactics and strawmen. Literally nobody is saying we should administer HRT to kids where that's not clearly a good and helpful route. That's the entire purpose of blockers, which are also simply not the horrible experimental drug they're made out to be, and supportive mental health therapy. And literally nobody is saying ""let's remove our children's reproductive organs!"" as if it's just a fun trend. So any argument that contains those things needs to just be shut down, not engaged with. ""Nobody is doing that. That's not what's being discussed, nor what the laws would prevent.""
i fucking wish right?
I'm 34 AMAB and I just am starting to explore my gender, I came out in November as nonbinary and genderfluid, use they/them, and have been presenting en femme most of the time since coming out. I grew up in rural NE Indiana and looking back to my ""egg"" stage there are so many signs in retrospect that I subconsciously chose to ignore to fit in to the overwhelmingly white, conservative, cis-het area I grew up in. None of the boys I was intimate with in highschool wanted anything other than NSA hookups, they may have even been embarrassed that they enjoyed what we did so I exclusively dated girls despite knowing from middle school that I was bi/pan."	t84ssn	NonBinary	101	0.99	2022-03-06 18:19:25
"Medical practices need to track gender identity independently of ""sex"""	"I've been thinking about this since it happened, and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get about it.

Kinda long, so:

TL;DR: I was misgendered at a hospital because the only gender indicator on the medical paperwork was my AGAB.

Background: I'm an AMAB she/they demigirl. I almost always present femme, even at home. There's a strong chance that I'll be pursuing transition in the coming years.

So, having recently turned 50, I had a colonoscopy yesterday (colon cancer screening—zero signs, zero polyps, thankfully). Because I have severe sleep apnea, it was done at the hospital instead of the outpatient facility.

Opting for comfort, I wore a loose dress that would be easy to get out of and back into. As instructed, I wore no jewelry. I put my hair (that goes halfway down my back) up in a tight bun so that nobody would have to worry about it. Obviously, no breast forms or gaff, as they would have to be removed before the procedure anyway. (I don't normally wear them for medical appointments anyway, because they tend to get in the way.)

Spouse dropped me off at the entrance and went to park the car. (You have to have a trusted person present to drive you home after a colonoscopy, because of the anesthesia.) From the moment I walked in, people were polite and gendered me as I presented, even the registration person who had my (still masculine) name and medical info on her screen). Which I appreciated greatly.

Then Spouse and I were taken back to the prep room, and I was given the medical gown to change into. Obviously, for a colonoscopy, you have to take off everything. So gone were all signals that I'm not simply male, except my hair—which, to be fair, wasn't particularly gendered given the popularity of ""man buns"".

From that point, I was gendered solely as the ""M"" on the paperwork. There was no indicator anywhere that my gender identity is NB. I didn't make a big deal of it, because there was no way anyone would know at that point unless I told them, and I wasn't about to repeatedly explain it to every person who I had to deal with (two nurses, an orderly, three doctors, and whoever else was in the room during the procedure—I didn't count them).

But then I was in the procedure room, and the anesthesiologist made a comment about my ""man bun"" when he was fitting the oxygen mask. I spoke up at that point and corrected him, saying that I was nonbinary and so it wasn't a ""man bun"".

Now, I will mention at this point that I have always hated the term ""man bun"". It's not called a ""woman bun"" when a woman wears a bun; it's just a bun. It doesn't need gendering. I can't even think of another hair style that's called ""man X"" or ""woman X"". So part of my irritation was from that.

But I think I struck a nerve, because the entire group in the procedure room went silent. There was no more banter while I was awake.

The rest of the procedure and recovery went smoothly. But that one comment continued to irk me. And the problem could have been avoided if the paperwork had two gender markers: one for the anatomy/AGAB and another for gender identity/pronouns.

I've seen the personal data fields on a variety of medical software (doctors tend to show me what they're doing when I commiserate about how badly the software is designed), so I know that it is now standard for the software to have a field for gender identity. No medical office I've seen this on uses it. It's always been blank, even in offices where I've explicitly identified myself as NB/M on the paperwork.

Now, I'm the last person to argue that my AGAB/anatomical sex don't matter in medical—they absolutely do. Medical is the only area of life in which I believe people need to know all the details: your gender identity, your AGAB, and the status of any medical transition. Anatomy matter there. So I don't think that my AGAB was irrelevant there.

But it really bugs me that the way medical records are used in most facilities means that non-cis people are doomed to be misgendered, because all that's on the paper is a bare ""M"" or ""F"". From now on, whenever I check in for a medical appointment, I'm going to specifically ask if they can include gender identity in my record, and insist on being marked as nonbinary if they can. The only way this is going to change is if we push the issue."	"It's also medically necessary to have more than just agab for some patients if they've had hrt or something like that
I work HR for a rather large health system in my area. I've been trying to advocate for them to update the HR system and all systems used by clinical and nonclinical team members to display preferred names and include a field on the personnel file for team members' sex as well as gender identity. I understand the need to have biological sex/AGAB but it's just as important to have gender identity. 

It has not been easy and honestly if it weren't for myself and a couple other trans team members, might not be considered at all. 

You bring up an incredibly good point that we should fight for patients to also have that option. I do see a doctor within my company and I know they have notes they can put in for pronouns and identity, but honestly it's an LGBTQ+ clinic so I'm not sure it's system-wide. 

Thank you for sharing your experience.
I was put in as “genderfluid” in my doctor’s forms after disclosing that I was trans despite not asking them to change anything in my records— and they still misgender me lol
I’ve seen some places doing Sex assigned at birth, Legal sex, Gender Identity. It’s nice, sadly not the standard and I still get misgendered because legal sex/agab are plastered across their screens automatically. For the rest of them I’ve been dramatically scratching my own options so they are visible.
We use a program called Epic and inpatient and outpatient patients are able to select the option for nonbinary, which has been really lovely. Haven't seen too many adults using it, but loads of teens, which makes me happy that they have the option.

I think it depends on the health system if they choose to use this option or not, [here's a wired article about it](https://www.wired.com/story/the-battle-to-get-gender-identity-into-your-health-records/).
👏👏👏👏👏
I'm very sorry you went through that. I've dealt with it in the past. And you are right the issue has to be pushed.

And this makes me grateful that the system I go through has a Pride Clinic, and I am allowed preferred name and gender identity.
I work and live in a really progressive area. Our charts have both AGAB and gender digitally but if if orders are printed the gender/sex area will be blank. It’s just frustrating for me In the lab because everything has to be legal names so I have to verify that over the phone vs preferred names DX we could totally fit both. We could even fit gender identity acronyms too but it’s probably not going to happen DX
I am blessed to have a local hospital that does this right. The electronic patient info I fill out has three items that get shown to everyone who looks at my chart.

Gender/Sex marker on ID

Gender Identity (Optional)

AGAB (Optional)

All I give them is the F on my ID personally, but this is the way
Gahhhh this is so frustrating. I'm so sorry that happened to you! (Also colonoscopies are the actual worst but I'm glad they didn't find anything) 

Tbh, I didn't know that at the hospital I go to for doctors appointments had a Gender v Sex choice until I saw it in their online system. The gender choices were simplified to a degree but it was definitely progress which is good.
From what it sounds like the silence must've been them internally cringing at misgendering you for that long.

At least, it sounds like it to me.
Yes 100% agree with this. While it’s important for doctors to know assigned sex for obvious reasons it should also be just as important or then to know how you identify. It wouldn’t be a big deal to have a second option on the forms for gender identity/pronouns. Going to the doctor is similar but also different to taking your car to the mechanic. The difference: we are social creatures, so acknowledging how your patient identifies is extremely important. The similarity: the mechanic obviously needs to know what make and model your car is to work on it properly.
im sorry this happened to you. i’m glad to hear the results of the procedure were good though 🙌 i get this the other way around, where my sex is assumed and not asked for. i am legally NB on my ID, but F for health insurance, but doctors assume i’m male and just put an M on everything. i worry the medical needs of my body are being overlooked when doctors assume i’m male when 1) im non-binary and 2) im afab."	wtfg1n	NonBinary	96	1.0	2022-08-20 19:33:22
Describing being Nonbinary to my hubby.	"My hubby asked me a few days ago, what does it feel like to be Non Binary? He is a cis male and an extremely supportive ally. Sometimes he catches me off guard with things I have never even thought about. This was one of those times. After stumbling over some metaphors I realized I still hadn't answered his question. So I told him I'd get back to him on that answer after having some time to think it over. 

And today I gave him my answer. I told him it feels like being a cis male (I used this since he is one). And he just stared at me confused. So I continued, ""if you were any of the other genders it would feel the same."" He gave me what I like to call his thinking look then his explain please look. I obliged ""how does it feel to be a cis male?""  His thinking expression again, then he looked at me confused again. ""I think we both feel the same way. I couldn't tell you how it feels to be Non binary anymore then you can tell me how it feels to be a cis male because it's what we are not a feeling but a state of being. But I could tell you how it feels to be something I'm not. Just like if someone insisted you were a girl and  you weren't."" And his eyes lit up and he smiled at me. ""I get it."" 

I'm sure not all non binary are the same in this but I thought I'd share this just in case someone is similar or perhaps an ally that is just looking to understand and maybe this makes sense to them."	"I often wonder what it's like for cis people to just... never question their gender. To be perfectly comfortable with their agab. How is it possible??
I’m an aspiring ally and that is very helpful to me. Thank you!
There's a joke that if you want to know what it means to ""feel like a woman"" ask Shania Twain because no one feels like a woman (or any other gender for that matter) they just are that gender.
My most successful explanation has been to walk the person through a thought experiment. So (when talking to a cis male): If you had to have your foot amputated, you'd still be a man, right? What about your whole leg? If you lost an arm? Continuing all the way to- If you were just a head in a jar like in Futurama, you'd still be a man? Ok so now what if you didn't have a body at all, what if your consciousness was uploaded to a computer, do you think you'd still be male? and then. if your consciousness got downloaded into a little box robot, would you be a little robot guy? That line of questioning helps separate the concept of gender from physical body, and as something inherent to the self.

Then I explain that for me, I would NOT be a little robot ""girl""; I would just be a little robot. I don't have that sense of maleness or femaleness that would travel with me. People look at me and because the meat suit I'm piloting around has boobs and curvy hips they perceive me as female, but that's not something coming from me that would travel with me if the chassis I was piloting were a little box robot.

It's possible I've found success with this explanation because most of the people I've tried it with have been as nerdy and into Scifi as I, so ymmv depending on who you're talking to.
Yess this is how I always explain it 👌🏻
This post just gave me imposter syndrome 😥 

The description I would have used is ""freeing.""  Freeing from the expectations and bullshit of (toxic) masculinity.  But I guess that just makes me a non-conforming cis man.  At the end of the day I suppose it makes no difference.
I literally only identify as a cis male because of my penis. If I had a vagina I'd call myself a girl.
Oh I know! I use to think everyone went through all the shit I was going through and when I realized that wasn't the case it was like...🤯
Oh your welcome!
Oh! I like this way of thinking! I do know some people who attach their gender to their sex so they would probably say something along the lines ""well I'd be just a head or just a robot"" but this would be another good way to see how someone thinks differently! Cool!😎
I think you must separate the two things:

1. How does **being** non-binary feel

2. How does being non-binary (and accepting it) **makes** you feel…

There is huge difference 😘 - so, no need for imposter syndrome..
That's totally valid! Doesn't mean you're a GNC man instead of nb. I can relate to both your experience and OP's. Growing up, I was forced into a box: cis female. When I finally accepted that my dysphoria wasn't going to magically disappear, I put a lot of pressure on myself to fit into the new box: trans male. Ultimately, both things were attempts to make myself blend in with ""normal"" society. Embracing my nonbinary gender has been very freeing; it's like for the first time, *all* of me is ""allowed,"" you know?

But I think the reason it feels that way is because we're pushed into those boxes to begin with. That feeling that OP described, knowing you're *not* something, that's what we start out with. So it makes sense that letting that go and choosing to be who you really are would make you feel more free. Anyway, we all have different experiences. Your identity is *yours,* there's no wrong way to be nonbinary.
Freeing was definitely how I felt when I accepted myself as nonbinary and came out. But to me being nonbinary isn't a feeling. I have always been nonbinary so most my life felt suffocating from not having what I needed to understand myself. But I get what you're saying.
So your gender is related to your sex. 👍 People are all different!
I'm sure it's not going to work for everyone, but it really does illustrate my own experience with being agender.
Just to clarify: the answer for the first question was given by the OP 😘

The answer for the second (for me) was also “freeing” - once I accepted it. Freeing for me and for my wife…
I guess what I'm trying to answer is, am I nb or are the boxes stupid to start with? And maybe there's no difference between the two in the end...🤔 

EDIT: Gave it a quick Google and gender is entirely socially constructed.  Which seems entirely pointless to me but nb it is, I guess.
Exactly! 👍
Thank you so much for this analogy! I was hoping to figure myself out by lurking around here and this pretty much exactly covers how I feel too! Just a different chassis.

I'll definitely confront some friends with this to gather more data on my quest to find out how gender is supposed to feel.
Well, gender roles and the ways we express gender, like pronouns and names and style choices, that's all socially constructed. I do think gender itself is a little more complex than that. There's evidence to suggest that there's a biological component to why trans people feel the way we do and it is innate to some extent (like David Reimer, the cis man who was raised as a girl from infancy due to a botched circumcision and developed pretty bad gender dysphoria about it). But I don't think it's as simple as saying we're all born this way and that's it either. Each individual's experience with their own gender is going to vary, and they're all valid.

I think if being trans was basically the same as being GNC, it would be a lot easier for us trans people to just be GNC and be done with it. But for whatever reason, that doesn't feel like enough to me. Trying to think of myself as a GNC woman just feels wrong. GNC trans man isn't quite right either. While clinging to those identities, I still felt that longing, like there was something missing, pieces of me I wasn't allowed to think about. Embracing an nb identity, that feeling is gone. That's how I know it's right 🤷 It's up to you to decide if thinking of yourself as a GNC man feels right to you.
It's so confusing, lol, but thank you 😊 

Tbh I don't really *want* to think of myself as a GNC man, but I felt like that was all I am ""worthy"" of/am ""allowed"" to.  So I get where you're coming from.
Lol it is confusing for sure, sorry I don't quite know how to explain it! For what it's worth it took me a long time to get to a point where I could really acknowledge even to myself that being nb felt right. Society teaches us a lot of bullshit about gender and it can take a while to untangle all that from what you actually want for yourself. I started questioning my gender more than a decade ago, and it's only within the last couple months that I've fully accepted who I really am. It's a journey!"	ytp6q4	NonBinary	95	0.99	2022-11-13 02:15:28
The concept of gender should go away, it's as bad as our political system.	"So I've seen some push from the LGBT community against the nonbinary and trans community recently. Including jokes about how ridiculous it is that there are 50+ genders.

The problem in my opinion is the concept of genders. Society has said that sex has a mental element called gender and if you fall into 1 gender you have to act, like and present a certain way. If you fall into the other gender the same thing.

We as humans want to feel like we belong so we are very adamant in finding labels that match our feelings. That way we can explain to people why we are different than what society says.

But I have a novel concept, let's get rid of genders and let people be and express themselves how they see fit? Keep the concept of sex around for medical reasons but nowhere else.

I think this would push for a better world for our communities. I think less people will feel pressured to transition of they can be happy expressing themselves. I only say this because I know transitioning is very tough and expensive and not always solution for someone. Partial transitioning will be more acceptable where someone takes T or E to adjust their body to their liking.

That is part of my motive to be honest. I want to bend and destroy gender binaries and shoe the world that someone like me exists and is proud. Someone who has become successful in life and spends much of their time helping others and charities. That a guy who wears a dress is not confused or mentally ill.

For me, I like many things as a genetic male. I race cars, I work in Technology, I run my own break/fix company on the side. I love technology as a whole, run a tech YouTube channel, love horse racing. I also love fashion, love to cook, but I also work on cars, can fix appliances and other electronics.

I follow the beat of my own drum and the world should accept that everyone else can too!"	"I have some of the same sentiments about gender, and when I mention these feelings to anyone who is not nonbinary (even binary trans people) they get very confused about *why* I would say such things. I've learned that I *just don't understand* binary gender because I don't experience it, in much the same way that many binary people don't understand nonbinary gender and cis people don't understand trans people, etc. My lack of understanding for these experiences does not mean that they should be erased. I have had to work to accept the fact that some people are empowered by the binary gender system and by a segregation of genders. This goes for binary men and women, and some nonbinary people too. I believe the solution is to allow the same space for people who experience gender this way as we would like them to allow for us. Live and let live. Keep pushing for trans\* rights and inclusion, but not at the expense of erasing other peoples' experiences of gender.
Gender is different from gender roles. Gender roles are what need to be abolished, not gender in itself. One, because it's invalidating to plenty of nonbinary people, and two because it's invalidating to binary trans people. It invalidates cis people too in a way, they aren't just their sex either, some have a very strong important sense of their gender. Getting rid of gender roles would mean that people are free to be as feminine/masculine as they liked, have the hobbies they enjoyed, etc without being ridiculed or experience any pushback for it. Forced gendering and gender assignment and the expectations that come with it are bad, but that doesn't mean that gender in itself is bad.
Can we compromise and just de-intitutionalize/de-regulate gender?

Stop assigning a legal sex, no gender markers on official documents, all forms that ask gender are purely self-reporting and do not have to match any other self-resport, no distinction between genders in dress codes, etc?

But people are still free to identify with/perform gendered patterns.

As a nonbinary person, I'm NOT agender. I have a gender identity! It does not correspond to manhood or womanhood! No I don't have a cohesive theory of how gender identity works that explains my experience, I just have a single data point.

Also if we abolished gender and kept the binary concept of sex we'd just be defaulting to a TERF view of gender. (I.e. that gender does not exist and sex categories are real), which is the assumption that underpines their transphobia, because they see misogyny as only affecting people assigned female at birth and see trans women as ""appropriating"" AFAB experiences somehow.
This is invalidating. I'm a nonbinary trans man, my gender is incredibly important to me, just like gender is important to binary trans people and a lot of other nonbinary identities. Your problem is with gender roles. You seem to assume that gender and gender roles are intrinsically linked, but they aren't, otherwise you wouldn't have trans tomboys and femboys. Just because someone doesn't follow a certain set of gender roles or follows a different set of roles does not mean they are not the gender they feel they are. 

Just because you don't want gender does not mean everyone else wants their identities to be erased. That is whay you are doing with this, erasing identities. If gender didn't exist, they I wouldn't be a nonbinary trans man anymore, I'd just... be. And I don't want to just be. That feels gross and uncomfortable to me. It makes me dysphoric because I am not agender. You cannot abolish gender without invalidating everybody who isn't agender, which is most people. 

Plus, gender has pretty much always been around. It is intrinsic to our psyche at this point, even if someone is agender, that's *still* an intrinsic thing within the person.

And then you're reducing people to their genitals. Do you really think there wouldn't be any stigmas and problems with that? And also, that is gross and dehumanizing. I have a vagina, I am keeping it, I am still a man, I am *not* a vagina.

I understand you're coming from a good place, but this is an incredibly harmful concept. That is why there's a push to say ""gender *roles* are a social construct"" instead of ""gender is a social construct."" You're welcome to be agender all you want, but don't push your identity onto other people.
Dude (lmk if that’s ok, I use it with everyone), I’ve got the exactly same perspective, and I’m totally torn between “gender is obviously a just bunch of made up rules about how people ought to behave in society based on their genitals and we’d all be better off to abolish the entire construct,” and, “wow, internal sense of gender really seems to be a thing lots of people are attached to to the point that they’ll go through hell just to match themselves to it, so I guess I’m just nonbinary agender if I don’t have that internal experience.”

The further problem with having these discussions is that these are among the primary conflicts between gender critical radical feminists and liberal feminist/queer theorists, and taking up any position that has been used by radical feminists gets a person lumped in with the trans-exclusionary camp because suggesting that there’s no such thing as an innate internal conception of gendered self denies the existence of binary-identifying trans folk.

The biggest issue in my mind is that the science is lagging behind the social discourse, such that we know that testosterone acting on a fetal brain increases the size of the hypothalamus (don’t quote me on that, but it’s one particular brain region), but we don’t know how size of structure correlates to neural activity (it appears not to), or how in any way that fact correlates with a conscious internal experience of gender.

So all we have to go on is social theory and self-reporting. From my perspective, these seem to be at odds with each other. But they can’t be reconciled until we know what’s happening in the brain.

I want to be able to simultaneously abolish gender and support trans people, but it doesn’t seem like there’s a way to do that.
I see gender *roles* as a binary and socially determined, but individual genders as a two-dimensional spectrum. I encourage everyone to feel comfortable being as gender conforming or gender nonconforming as they like.

In my view, gender roles exist because of underlying sex dimorphism, amplified and narrowed by individuals performing these roles to advertise their reproductive fitness (my view combines both social construction and evolutionary biology). There is nothing wrong with these roles per se, as long as individuals feel free to ignore them and society accepts those who do. The problem arises when individuals and societies let themselves be constrained by these roles.
so you... want me to abandon my nonbinary genders, and to force me into being a male? sounds like terf shit to me. get out of here.
This responses to this post are the perfect example of why I do not ever discuss queer theory in trans and nonbinary spaces. People flip out at the notion of gender being something very different than what they were ""taught"" in Tumblr memes and egg forums.
Almost the same thoughts. I'm sad you've been downvoted and compared to TERFs. I'm afreud we are faaar away from the genderless world... but I'm happy that nonbinary/genderqueer community exists as the alternative to the binary at least.
We haven't broke anything, at this point it seems people define their genders based on secondary sexual characteristics. All the stereotypes are there (and getting worse), the roles have changed but it is still assumed there are roles, etc. Gender should indeed disappear.
Hey I just wanted to point out that ""trans*"" (trans with asterisk) isn't necessary, you can drop the asterisk, bc trans, as an umbrella term, already includes nonbinary people in it.
The problem is, gender is made up and something society controls, it's as bad as our political system. I would say a large percentage of America doesn't fall in the gender binary spectrum. Guys wear skinny jeans? Woman fixing cars or playing sports? Gender binary is more of a problem than anything. It adds unneeded complexity to our society.
Gender identity is strongly linked to gender roles. Without gender roles, gender seems pointless. What defines a male or female? What defines nonbinary? I feel removing everything to do with gender means identity is meaningless. What does identify as female mean if there is no definition of what a female is outside of the sex of a person?
Gender only exists because of societal roles and expectations. If there were no societal roles and expectations, there would be no purpose for gender. The two are inextricably linked.  Sociologists and feminists have written about this subject at great length. 

Here is a relevant quote by Judith Butler, one of the pioneers of queer theory: "" There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; ... identity is performatively constituted by the very 'expressions' that are said to be its results.""
I can get behind that. Just wanted to add that  the TERF mindset is seeing sex as gender and appropriating gender experiences as purely based on sex.
But if gender is deregulated then why would it even need to be acknowledged in society at all? The moment you acknowledge it, then it's automatically regulated again by virtue of association. It's impossible to have a society where everyone can just be whatever gender they want in complete absence of roles and expectations.
Maybe change it to, ""has a penis"" and ""has a vagina""? I definitely get what you're saying. I tend to agree with your assertion as well.
I definitely understand your point.  Removing gender does much more harm than good, even if Gender is the root cause of many of these issues.  If the concept of gender did not exist then we wouldn't have dysphoria of that many people do.  But I can understand at this point people have lived their lives to find an identity because society has ruined the concept of gender that taking it away would crush people.

Society norms just suck period...
gender is a social construct
I think a big part of OP's message is that gender is unnecessary, because it is made-up by people, and can just as easily go away. One must also consider that *everything* we do, say, think, is made-up, and that doesn't make those things bad. It means gender is not an *intrinsic* value we have, but one we give ourselves, and we should not be *mandating* gender as government or social society.

I think that I relate to OP a lot. I'm agender and I never wanted gender, never understood it, never felt masculine or feminine. I feel like the whole thing is too flawed at its core to keep. I do not intend to invalidate anyone, and having labels and defining your gender is absolutely find and valid. I think that the frustration we feel when seeing the damage that forced gendering of society comes out more aggressively than it should sometimes.
You know, before you get upset maybe you should try and understand my points/goals. And maybe understand who I am. This is also just a thought of mine. Why are we seeing pushback from the LGBT community against trans and nonbinary communities? Why we were forced to make a nonbinary gender that has 50+ genders? Can we fix why this is happening? It's society forcing us to do so by boxing us into 2 genders.
No not at all. Remove genders and everyone is free to be who they are. No more male and female
I use the asterisk for clarity, so that it’s obvious what I mean, bc I have been speaking also about binary trans people.
I think you’re conflating likes/dislikes and hobbies with gender identity.
The meaning is up to the person to decide, just like you did for yourself.
Gender doesn't mean anything except to a person's own experience of it or lack of. Nothing 'defines' one outside of identifying as such, whether that come with following gender roles or not. That's the difference between gender and sex; female and male only denote the biological makeup, not anything about what that person is actually like. Plenty of people are binary and don't follow gender roles or don't follow all of them to the same degrees, gender and gender roles are literally not the same thing, just being something doesn't say anything about you aside from the fact that you are.
So a few questions about your proposed categories:
 
1. In what contexts do you find the categories ""has a penis"" and ""has a vagina [and not necessarily any other associated traits]"" to be useful? The only thing I can think of is sexual compatibility with people who have strict genital preferences.

2. So trans people who have bottom surgery switch categories in this system, yes?
Dysphoria would still exist because people's bodies would still be wrong. Many people still say yes to the 'would you transition on a deserted island' hypothetical, myself included. Dysphoria doesn't only exist because of gender roles.
guess what? i was forcefully gendered too! and gender is still important to me! if you think gender is inherently flawed you are ABSOLUTELY invalidating people, whether or not you intend to! not every nonbinary person shares your experiences!!! for example, im a trans girl as well as nonbinary, and just refusing gender to me and then \*on top of that\* telling me we should ""Keep the concept of sex around"" is crypto-terf garbage. i won't have it.
""Keep the concept of sex around"" yeah, no. i'm done with crypto terfs painting themselves as ""gender abolitionists"".
Including the asterisk separates nonbinary identities from being trans even though they're already considered trans identities (not cis) and fall under trans (no asterisk). Trans encompasses all you were talking about especially since it was summarizing the identities you were speaking of including binary trans people. (I'm not trying to start anything , I just wanted to let you know as politely as possible without getting into specifics and breaking down your sentences)
Gender Identity is still labeling yourself to fit a mold that society understands or accepts,  Think about gender as a whole: ""Gender refers to the roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men. Gender interacts with""

Gender is defined by your overall self, what you do, what you like, activities you engage in, how you present, etc.  This is all because of a 2 gender binary system that society made up.  Remove the system and people are free to engage in roles, behaviors, activities, attributes and presentation without the need to associate or validate themselves by picking a label.
I wish that was the case, but society seems to disagree.
That doesn't make any sense. Identity only gains meaning and importance in the context of a society. To say ""*Gender doesn't mean anything except to a person's own experience of it or lack of* "" and ""*gender and gender roles are literally not the same thing,*"" directly contravene decades of political feminism and academic queer theory.
And what about intersex people?

I feel like the only time sex is important is for medical stuff (some things are more common for one sex, and lots of medical care is for one sex than the other ie pelvic exams).  Gender can be helpful for ID purposes (the lady stole my hat).

I heavily dislike the idea of telling someone what’s in my pants.
Oh that was purely for medical. In many cases hospitals need to know a bit about you to treat things.
also, xenogenders exist, and telling people they need to abandon that despite it being the epitome of rejection of the gender binary is ridiculous
I didn't say anything about it being wrong to have gender, and I don't think that OP did either, but maybe I'm missing something. I'm sorry that my words had that effect. I don't intend to push my views or suggest my experiences are somehow better or more valid. At the same time, myself and OP have these feelings and want to share them too. Please stop calling me a terf and if you want to call me an asshole or idiot, go for it, and tell me why...but that's really inappropriate to make accusations like that over a misunderstanding.
seriously, as if ""sex not gender"" isn't the most basic terf garbage
Politely, I disagree. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the asterisk. I don’t use it all the time, but include it when I want to be clear.
Some people are empowered by the system and I think that is okay and that we should try to understand those people’s experiences. Removing the system, at this point in societal development, would cause a lot of people to feel very lost. If the system had never been established in the first place, that might be a different story. We should adjust the system rather than abolish it.
Well, that's society's problem, not gender's.
Your heart's in the right place but remember intersex people exist and some don't have clear cut genitals and a lot of genitals mutilation goes on, even in the states, when a baby is born who has not quite vagina not quite penis looking genitals. Many are given an assigned sex that way and forced to grow up to perform the role of that gender assumed with the sex.

Otherwise, yeah, agreed, sex (including intersex!) Is really only necessary for medical reasons.

I do note that some government ID in the US and perhaps other countries are allowing a different marker for NB identity so, sex shouldn't be on those ID. But in medical ID absolutely, or just keep it at the hospital while government ID show gender identity!

Ideally, everyone would have free healthcare or low cost healthcare and ACCESS to healthcare, then everyone can have a medical ID with their sex, while government ID just have gender marker :)
They hardly ever need to know ""do you have a penis or a vagina?"". You're subconsciously including the other, actually relevant traits (i.e. hormone levels, do you have a cervix, do you have a prostate, etc) with tangentially related exterior signs.

Doctors should know things about the configuration of our bodies that may affect our health! But using exterior genitals as a proxy for those various factors is inefficient and in some cases leads to real medical harm for trans and intersex people whose bodies do not match those assumptions.
no! i'm not going to call you an asshole or an idiot! you aren't ""dumb"" or ""being mean"" you're repeating garbage that terfs say. have you seriously never heard a terf say ""sex not gender""? they claim to want gender to be gone in place of ""biological sex"".
and on top of that, my gender identities are incredibly important to my existence as a nonbinary person, and by forcing people to abandon those, you're excluding a big chunk of nonbinary people. which is garbage.
I can understand that completely. A concern I have is, part of the LGBT community are not allies of the non-binary community and I'm concerned about the future.
Yes, so how do we fix a problem that society created?
Indeed! And for medical it's only for safety reasons
You'd be hard-pressed to find a terf who agrees with anything I say. Terfs want gender and sex to be linked together, and that is not what I am advocating at all. I am suggest all people should feel free to express themselves however they want without the need to fit into one box or another. If that box is gender, that's okay, if it's not, that's okay too. The idea with gender being made-up is that nobody should feel obligated to use it, not to judge those who do. And of course, society and government and etc, these should not in any way mandate or dictate how people do those things. Your gender or lack thereof is your business, and yours to share.

The ideas with keeping sex is that, well, humans are a sexually dimorphic animals. The vast majority of humans have male or female parts, and that's medically and reproductively important. It just shouldn't be forcibly attached to gendering.
Why did nonbinary popup? Because society forced gender norms to people who did not specifically identify with one side or the other.

I understand your concerns, but if you researched who I am you would know I am not anything that you acused me of. I would encourage you to always take a step back before posting, I know you may have felt attacked but clearly that was not the intent nor what anyone else felt.
That’s a valid concern. All we can do is keep pushing for trans* rights and inclusion. I have hope that over time, people will become more educated and more accepting. I’m only 22 years old, and I’ve already seen a ton of progress on this front in my lifetime. Trans* people and allies older than me have seen even more. There will undoubtedly be setbacks along the way, but the world is trending toward acceptance.
I really appreciate you digging deep into post to grab most of what I was trying to say.
The world is definitely but I've noticed our allies aren't as thrilled sometimes because we ""drag them down""
You're welcome. That being said, I do think that u/hazel-gayzel makes some important points, and both of us should read what they said and take that into consideration. Accurate communication without putting others down is vital to being a transformative force in this world.
There are certain circles and corners of the internet that are like that. I wouldn’t even consider people like that to be our allies, regardless of how they describe themselves. There has been a large pushback, on reddit and elsewhere, against that mindset. Subreddits like r/LGBDropTheT are getting the almighty ban hammer, and while the folks on those subs are simply moving to other subs or different platforms, their treatment of people like you and me has been condemned over and over again. People who think that way are willfully ignorant, and I feel sorry for them because they are choosing to be so divisive. It’s important for us to speak out against hatred and ignorance when we see it.
It's hard to do so because it's all pure emotion without much actual information. They've just been attacking me for the most part.
That emotion speaks volumes, and it's important to listen even when we disagree. That kind of pain doesn't come from nowhere, the world traumatizes all of us in many ways. It's not fair to insult and attack like that, of course. You are very critical of gender itself, as am I, and gender is something that also brings a lot of people euphoria, helps provide self-actualization, and a sense of peace with oneself. It can provide a framework for expression, which is something so many people struggle with. It makes sense that someone could perceive this as an attack on them or the people they care about, or people in general, and I can speak from experience with losing sight of the goal and just arguing when coming from that kind of emotional place.

As I've said before, communication is essential, and it's our superpower. Being able to communicate these ideas in a way that doesn't put others down, and helps lift us all up, is paramount, and something that I believe we should always be improving on.

I'll end before I keep ranting. You do you, friend. Your feelings are as valid as mine and everyone else's.
Very few people have ""attacked"" you. If you think reasoned discussion and explanation on why your views might be harmful is an attack, maybe you should have kept it to yourself. Tons of people have told you why this view is harmful in very kind terms, very few have been rude, and you're acting like a victim when you aren't. Like I get it, it's not fun to be told your views are harmful, but you have to listen instead of pulling the ""everybody hates me"" card.
There are always different POVs. My interpretation is just one. It's not right now wrong just my own. My thought process is, most of the problems trans and nonbinary people face is gender itself. That is the concept of gender never existed would be easier on everyone.

You mention that gender brings euphoria to people and I agree. But the reason that people long for self-actualization is because of the problems the concept of gender has caused. That was my point I was making initially.
Actually a vast majority of people have been positive about my general thoughts not negative. There is one person who is very upset and that's the OP. And judging by the positive upvotes I tend to think my thinking is well received.

The issue is I'm thoughts are very deep and philosophical about the problem and I think a select few are looking at the surface that I am trying to take something from them. I cannot control the level of emotional intelligence of others unfortunately, and it does stink when someone does not understand your thoughts are they maybe too complex and start shouting obscenities like TERF at you.
I also made the mistake of assuming that people would do some due diligence before making outlandish claims. I've literally been contributing to this community daily. I think 90% of my karma is from this community and how big of an influencer I am being to the NB Community as a whole. I mean if they did any ounce of research they would know their claims are meritless and maybe best to ask for clarification. I've set my sites and goals to try and help evolve society for the NB Community for acceptance and equality.

I know, and I feel you. I think this idea,

>That is the concept of gender never existed would be easier on everyone.

is one of the bigger points you are trying to make. Gender should never have been a thing, and then nobody would have been hurt by it. Unfortunately, we are thousands and thousands of years into gender, and it's a significant part of all of our lives. It may not be the most effective method to simply call for its abandonment. Not that it's wrong to do so, I am just saying I understand why people may feel hurt when they read it the way you have presented it.
Maybe I'll relook at my words to see why the OP got so upset."	hsv911	NonBinary	95	0.89	2020-07-17 12:59:38
Going topless on the beach after top surgery, but surgery is non-binary?	"So it's hard to explain my question in a title (pronouns for me are they/she). But I just recently got top surgery 3 1/2(ish) months ago and I am now thinking of future possibilities (probably wayyy in the future) of going topless at the beach or pool. And I am wondering if that would be socially acceptable. Here's some background or context for that question. What I mean when I say that the surgery is non-binary is this. I got a double mastectomy and my chest is 100% flat. BUT, I was able to choose where the nipple placement was, and the size of them. So I chose the placement to be a tiny bit higher and tiny bit closer together than the ""typical male"" and a centimeter larger than the ""typical male"". That's the surgery side of it. I also have not started on T yet, so I dont have the muscle development or anything like that. So would that still be okay for me to go topless at the beach or pool? (I'm in California, and I know the laws here are a tiny bit more liberal currently). It's just something that I've been wondering cause I usually dont obviously pass as a guy.  
Any thoughts would be appreciated! Thanks :)"	"I „pass“ a a guy, so i might not be the one to say it, but do what you want! I‘ve seen girls being shirtless on the beach (Berlin, Germany) and I honestly think that if people saw you they would probably assume you‘re a teenage boy with strange nips. Of course if it doesn‘t feel right, don‘t it. There‘s some nice uv-shirts for surfing and stuff. Tho they probably don‘t allow these at pools. Also you could ease yourself into it by being shirtless around people you know. Try not to worry too much
I deal with this same thing except I got the full top surgery to look more like a typical cis man with the nipple placement (I'm transmasc enby). That said, I'm often read as a woman (ugh). 

I think it depends on the situation for me - I think you need to see what feels right to you depending on the people around you. If I'm swimming outside (pond, lake, beach, etc.) then I go without a top because chances are people aren't paying attention to me or it's secluded. If I'm at a pool, and it's not private with a bunch of friends or something, I concede and wear a top. Similarly, I try to wear a top around my family because they struggle with my gender and they are trying but not ready for that yet. 

All I can say is judge each situation for yourself. Stay safe and stay sane out there!
Wait you actually can have top surgery as nb? Why did I think that I will be stuck in binder for the rest of my days
You definitely can! I am considering similar options and plan on going topless at times (tho unsure how often, but I want a sick chest tattoo and I gotta show that thing off). Tbh cis chests come in all shapes and sizes with all nipple shapes and sizes and if people are paying that much attention to you then they are the people with issues.

Ultimately it is what you feel most comfortable with and what is safe for you ❤️
Based off my own experience, just do what feels okay to you.
And don't be afraid to experiment or change your mind about what feels okay.
I had top surgery a year ago and ID as non-binary. I knew I was going swimming this summer and I bought a swim shirt because the thought of getting stared at was terrifying and I was self conscious. However, when it came time to swim somehow all those thoughts went out the window. I was at the lake, I was there to swim, and I didn't want to wear a t-shirt. If someone cares to say anything about my chest, they're the a-hole. I mentally dared someone to say something and I was ready to chew them out. No one said anything, and I swam happily.

I'm fine at the lake, but it's a bit different when I went to the pool. It's the changing room situation for me. There literally is no space that I could use where I felt comfortable. I used the women's and tried to avoid people as best as possible. Again, no one said anything and I feel safer around women than men.
I have lived in California, and I have lived in much less progressive places, and it basically all comes down to the area. Even within California. The Bay Area is obviously going to be different from some of the more conservative parts of the state, for example.

Sadly, whether you have trouble depends on whether you get read as a woman or not, not matter your actual gender or your legal gender marker. If you get read as a woman in a place where it's not socially acceptable for women to be topless, then yes, you could easily have issues even if the law is on your side. I remember a case while I was living in California where a woman got arrested for going topless even though it was legal in that jurisdiction, because the police officer didn't actually know the law. There have been cases of cancer survivors with mastectomies getting charged with indecency, even though there weren't even nipples left. 

You know whether it's acceptable for women in your area to be topless better than we do.

Clothing optional beaches are of course pretty much universally a safe bet, and if you have one of those in your area that would be a good option for nipple freedom.
Having slightly larger males than the ""typical male"" doesn't make it socially unacceptable. Some cis dudes have big nipples, droopy nipples, high nipples, matching nipples, odd nipples, laser nipples, inverted nipples, hairy nipples, etc. etc.
I'm planning to say ""these aren't female presenting nipples"" and flip off anyone who has a further issues.
I say do it no matter what. California has some of the best civil rights in the US. Imo. 
Hi from LA!
Thank you! I guess the thing that makes me hesitant is comments from my mom (which I shouldn't even listen to or care about), about how I wouldn't pass and the weird tone she used when she asked me the question of what i'm going to wear at the beach or pool. I just told her I would wear what I always wear - a swim shirt and board shorts.
In the U.S., in many places, it's illegal for women to go topless. So what you experienced might not be applicable to the U.S.
There are some places, and some insurance companies, where you might have to pass yourself off as a trans man to access it. But yes, totally possible, and explicitly allowed under the current WPATH guidelines.
In Canada, you don't need to be on T to get top surgery either
Ugh yeah, mother‘s comments always hit the hardest. I wish you all the strength to wear what you want!
Oof I’m sorry for peeps with boobs. I mean I totally understand if someone doesn‘t want to take of their shirt because of sexualization, but I think it should be up to them. I don‘t understand why so many countries have to be so sexist
Thank you!
Yeah, many Americans are frustrated by this too. There was a huge push about a decade ago to get this changed, but nothing came of it on the federal level, and I haven't even heard of individual states allowing it either. On the national level, we did get them to legalize breast-feeding in public, and after that win, people stopped fighting. And yes, you read that correctly: it was illegal up until very recently just to breastfeed your baby in a public setting.
Wow. I never even thought someone could be as misogynistic as to forbid breastfeeding publicly. Like how do you feed your baby??
I agree with you completely. It's because breasts are considered to be inherently sexual here. Incredibly disturbing. Even now, it's still not uncommon for people to harass someone for breastfeeding in public. Harassing someone for breastfeeding is not illegal, which is again, incredibly disturbing. There was also an alarming case where a woman was arrested for indecency for being topless in her own home; the reason she was prosecuted was because a child she had been watching walked in the room while she was topless (the woman in this situation was not expecting to be walked in on)."	ph3ad3	NonBinary	95	0.99	2021-09-03 11:27:41
Can someone explain why you don’t identify as trans while identifying as non-binary?	"I’m a bit confused, as a (trans and nb) demiboy. 

I’ve always considered myself trans and found it harder to accept being non-binary than just simply trans, so I’d just like to understand why other people feel differently."	"I don’t know if I identify as trans or not. I guess I don’t feel “trans enough” and am afraid of intruding on trans spaces. I’d consider myself trans-adjacent.
For me, I don’t identify as trans because it just doesn’t feel like me. I don’t honestly know how to explain it better than that. Labels serve us, not the other way around, and I don’t feel like trans serves me, but non-binary definitely does.
i dont use the term trans for me personally becuse after coming out as nonbinary i dont think i really 'transitioned', i didnt change my name or anything about my appearance. i also dress like how my agab is 'expected' to dress so all these factors combine i feel like me using the trans label would be intruding on trans spaces
i identify as trans since non binary is under the umbrella and im definitely not cis. plus dysphoria & stuff,,
While non-binary falls under the trans umbrella, I just don’t identify as trans. Labels are tools, not rules.
My thought is that me coming out an Enby was more me accepting myself and my gender as a person. I no longer hide or avoid my ""odd"" urges for feminine things. Now yes, Enby falls under the trans umbrella... I do not feel a connection to the term trans because Unlike trans-men/women and some enbies, I am not changing. Not the best way to describe it, but the most accurate to my outlook.   


Some people need aid to rid themselves of dysphoria, become who they feel they are, and/or accept themselves. I don't (at least right now) need anything. When I came out, I was actually among the last to have realized it in my friend group...so I already had support and didnt change who i was.  


With all that said, in turn I avoid Trans as a label ONLY because I know some people have to fight, have to struggle, and have to be loved just to be Trans. I am the the background trans who will stand beside someone who needs the label. I am the person who will listen to you and be there for you.  


My views wont mesh with many people, but I share it in good faith when i can because I dont mean any harm. I just know its how i feel, and odds are I aint the only one.
Because I just don't identify as trans. It doesn't feel like ""me"".
i think a lot of people have preconceived notions about what it means to be trans, and they dont identify with those aspects or certain trans struggles. many nb people also still identify with their agab experience, so its more of a ""little bit of this PLUS a little bit of that"" instead of trans being ""no longer this, now that."" not a transition to a new gender, but an un-sition away from gender.

personally i identify as nb but if identify with the trans colors so you'll never catch me with purple and yellow pride gear, only pink and blue haha
I think because sometimes I view myself as not having a gender. I'm not ""the opposite gender"", I'm not any gender at all. I also don't get dysphoria in social situations, just in the way my body is presented. I don't really identify with the word trans and feel there are very big differences between myself and a transgendered person. I don't want to change my body, just the way I look. I don't want to look more masculine. I dont want to start hormones or undergo surgery (not saying trans people who dont go this route are any less valid though). All in all i'm still comfortable with female and neutral pronouns being used. I just personally dont feel like I fit into a trans label
In general I think nonbinary people are under the trans umbrella. However because its a spectrum a person can closely identity with their agab and therefore not feel like ""trans"" (meaning across) is an appropriate term.
I have several binary trans coworkers who have completely gone through their transitions. They've gone through so much more than I ever will, physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. I recognize this, and respect their fights. The trans id is their right, their space. Not mine.
Ok. As someone who identified as nonbinary first and just recently has started to identify as transfemme. It took a while for me to acknowledge my dysphoria . I always knew i didn’t fully identify with male and female but like I’ve always presented as male (amab) and never got to fully explore my femininity and now upon reflection and like being in the egg_irl subreddit, i realized all the signs that kinda pointed towards me being transfemme and now I’m researching like hrt and top and bottom surgery and what not
For me, I don't identify as trans because I don't think I've really changed or transitioned at all. Maybe I will in the future, but I kinda doubt it. I don't feel the need to get any surgeries or even bind, and I haven't done enough research about HRT to really consider it for myself. The most I've done is cut my hair really short, but tbh I did that way before I realized I was NB.
Simply going by definition, every NB person is trans. Any person who does not identify as their assigned gender is trans. But whatever makes people comfy I guess
I don't identify with trans as I haven't really transitioned  any way, so it doesn't feel earned. However if someone says I am, I don't mind as technically I could be considered one or I could not be considered one.
I consider myself trans, nonbinary, and genderfluid. I was forced into the girl role growing up but it never fit. I feel not cis even when I’m displaying femininity. ❤️ and I’m happy with that!
as petty a reason as it is, i don't do it because i dislike the trans flag aesthetically

pastels aren't my thing
i just don’t resonate with the label. i generally just identify as queer (sexuality and gender) and have never really felt great with any other label
Because I have no desire to transition to male. I'm AFAB and being nonbinary means to me I can present feminine or masculine depending on the day. I only had dysphoria when it came to my chest because of how huge it was before top surgey. My breasts didn't fit my idea of femininity. Now that they are gone I am quite happy with my body. The rest of my anatomy I don't mind. I never had any desire to be on testosterone or transition to male.

ETA: someone told me I couldn't be nonbinary without being trans and I strongly disagree.
I feel like people in the comments need to have a look at what their reasoning is rooted in, which is internalised transphobia. Trans people don’t need to change their name. They don’t need to medically transition. Their gender expression (masc,fem) doesn’t need to match their gender identity. 

Now I’m not saying that all nonbinary need to id as trans. Honestly don’t even know why I’m saying this, and my intention is not to attack nonbinary people. People aren’t more or less trans based on their experience. I guess since society/cis ppl has these preconceived ideas of what trans is and should look like, it limits other people under the trans umbrella to feel comfortable with the term. Nonbinary people aren’t intruding in trans spaces, the only space we would intrude are binary trans spaces. 

When I was in the early stages of identifying as nonbinary, I also didn’t feel trans enough. That I shouldn’t be allowed to use that term and that it doesn’t even fit me. But it does. I am trans
I don't identify as particularly ""cis"" but I also don't fully feel like I'm exactly trans either. I think it has to do with the fact that I'm not fully ""out"". There's not a ton of people who know I'm non-binary, because my family isn't particularly accepting. They seem to think I'm female, and I don't particularly care. I generally present more masculine, and I'm not a fan of feminine clothes, but I haven't changed my name, and I only use different pronouns with some people. I haven't put in much effort to change the way other people perceive my gender, so I don't feel like the trans label belongs to me. I do perceive my own gender as neither male not female, so I do feel like I'm non binary, and it took me a while to come to that conclusion.
It just doesn't feel right for me. I do want physical changes to my body to better match my identity, but I've kind of got it in my head that I'm not trans enough to claim the label. I know that a lot of people would say that there's no such thing as not being trans enough, but idk. I like the nonbinary label. My gender fluctuates a lot, and I feel that nonbinary is the best and easiest label for me.
I don't identify as trans because it makes me uncomfortable to call myself something i'm not. I feel that I have not transitioned (and I don't mean with operation or HRT), but have only come to evolve as a person. I came to realize that calling myself trans makes me feel even less like myself. I felt nonbinary was best to describe me because as I am indifferent to gender, I don't feel there was any push for me to ""change"" myself.
Enby here. I have to admit, I sometimes feel scared using the label Trans just because I do feel like I'm ""not trans enough"" or can't relate or feel welcome in Trans spaces because they're usually made for binary Trans people. I've often felt left out or invalid. I only realised I was NB earlier this year, and I think it took me so long because I hardly saw NB representation what what being NB is about, until I realised I was NB and started actively looking in the community and videos etc.   


I also had a lot to unpack. I was very confused and a little frustrated, but I'm happy and comfortable where I am now. And I'm glad I've finally found places where I feel welcome and can relate a lot.  


But that is entirely me, others might not feel this way at all and it's simply personal preference.
This is the information I have collected about it, which is just opinion and not fact because everyone has their own truth. 

- People have mentioned they don’t identify as trans because they don’t have gender disphoria. This kinda makes it sound like being trans IS disphoria and is therefore some sort of illness, which you don’t have if you’re enby. This is inaccurate.

- People assume that if they don’t want to identify as trans, that means they must be cis. Labels were created by us to serve us, they are a tool. If one doesn’t fit, that doesn’t mean you HAVE to pick the other. 

- Some people have mentioned not being ‘trans enough’. The goal of most (but not all) trans people is to pass as their true gender. If you worry that someone is going to gatekeep your label as trans when you have in fact transitioned, in any capacity, and you feel comfortable with the label, maybe the gatekeepers are the ones that need to assess their behaviour.

- Medical/ Hormonal transitioning is often the most accepted or obvious form of transitioning which I think is the reason why some don’t use this terminology to describe themselves. They are not medically transitioning. 

- Trans- adjacent is a lovely term :)
I’ve always considered non binary to be under the trans umbrella term, so I use both for myself, but I’m not going to say it needs to work that way for everyone. Not gonna let anyone tell me I’m not trans enough tho.
I'm gender fluid so some days where I feel a little masculine I think ""I might be trans"" but on other days I just feel like myself and reject all male/female attributes I might have. Sometimes I hate my body, sometimes I love it. I cannot be consistently trans.

And, this is solely my opinion for myself, since I'm not transitioning physically I also don't really feel like I'm trans
Cis/trans is a binary. I personally think nonbinary should not only be outside of the man/woman binary, but outside of the cis/trans binary too. Since some nonbinary people are 'more' trans and some are 'more' cis, and some who are completely fluid are both, in terms of how closely we identify and present to our AGAB, we don't really fit into either category.
My nonbinnary gender identity is very similar to my asisgned at birth gender. I am AFAB, and my identity is... something which includes elements of femininity and elements of neutrality in varying ratios over time.

 I'm comfortable with cis people assuming I'm a girl most of the time - I'm ok with she pronouns although I enjoy being called they, and while feminine nouns make me squirm a little it's not worth it to me to explain things to cis people. I don't want to have to explain my identity to cis people pretty much ever, so it's easier if they see me as cis. 

I think it would feel like appropriation to me if I ID'd as trans, even though logically I know I fit the definition. I don't feel ""trans enough"" which I know is bullshit and I would never tell anyone else they're not trans enough but it's still how I feel.

Edit: I'd like to add, I like the idea that an an enby, I can reject the gender binary and also the cis/trans binary, which feels limiting to me.
for me im a transmasc nonbinary lesbian. i dont call myself a trans lesbian because it has the connotation of being a trans woman, which is fine of course, but im not a trans woman and dont want to give people the wrong idea. lots of ppl have different reasoning but the main reasons ive seen from talking to other enbies is that calling yourself trans seems to have the connotation sometimes of being a binary gender, like being MtF or FtM. obviously being FtX or MtX is just as trans but there are connotations we've applied to different labels if that makes sense
I think of it like flipping a coin. For me, my agab is one side of the coin, and the other binary gender is on the other side. If you're trans, you completely flip the coin, whereas my gender experience was more like standing the coin on its side or throwing the whole coin away. 

I do see myself as technically trans, because my agab is not my current gender, but I don't use the label for myself. Despite that idea that trans means changing gender, the trans label is more often understood as and used for binary trans people, and I agree with what one of the other users said--my experience isn't the same as binary trans people. Because of how the term is used, it doesn't feel like the right fit for me.
I try to explain it in this way (as a person who does not identify as trans):

According to society, I meet the criteria that puts me in the ""trans"" umbrella or category. But my identity is *not* defined by society, it is my relationship with myself. I don't identify as or with the process of ""becoming myself"". I was born as me and will continue sculpting and cultivating my identity until my physical life is done. ""Trans"" is a medical term defined by a social bias - meaning I was born with certain visible traits that have been associated with a specific cis (male or female), but I do not adhere to the labels associated with those traits. Chemically speaking, I wouldn't be called trans, but doctors don't tend to check sex hormone levels at birth (as far as I know). 

There are plenty of cases of people who fall under the medically trans umbrella who would say they don't identify with being trans, that transition is a necessary part of the process for the outer mould to align with the inner world. They are begging to be seen as themselves, not as the process of becoming themselves. I happen to be one such person. I don't identify with the liminal space of becoming (because then I would see all people as trans), I identify with who I am and who I've been inside this body.

To clarify: those who identify as trans are not wrong. Your relationship with your identity is your own story to write, tell, and share. Everyone has their own perspective of transitioning, becoming, and identity. It's rather immature to gatekeep something so subjective and individual to each person. So... anyone who insists you aren't trans when that's how you identify yourself is still growing up. Pity them and celebrate yourself, darling.
Simply put for some of us trans is you idenitfy as the other gender. As non binary you identify as both or Nether.
Because I don't. That's it. 

Here's my question: Why does it bother you so much if someone doesn't? 

The whole point of being an accepting community is to let people be who they are without judgment. 

I'm so tired of people trying to shove identifying trans down my throat or constantly questioning it. 

I don't want to, so I'm not going to. I don't consider myself trans, so there for I'm not.
I feel like trans is not that great a term. Most people are just fixing their social delusions and getting rid of barriers that curb self expression. The word Trans itself is mostly a social construct anyways, and only serves to separate as much as cis genders do, so if you don't want that separation then it's likely you'll just identify as NB.
My headmate doesnt id as trans even though his gender doesnt match our agab bc of his view of gender as a whole. 

Like he gets *why* trans is a thing and doesnt like. Bring this up to people. But the way he sees it people shouldnt be gendered till they can say for themself what they are. Ig he doesnt love that theres a need to transition in the first place.
(Again he doesnt say this shit unless asked specifically abt it, just wanna be clear so no one thinks he like. Will say this when a trans person is talking abt their struggles or anything 😅)
One of the definitions of the prefix trans means ""such as to change"" - to not be your AGAB is to be trans.
Because I feel gender expansion not gender transitionary.  I'm not trying to remove womanhood from my body or myself I'm trying to add manhood to my gender experience because I feel I am both male and female and thus neither
I think a big reason is the fact that non-binary identities only started to be actively included in the trans community fairly recently (the early 2010s). In the past, transition had to be strictly binary and many non-binary people were left behind. Non-binary people were only fairly recently included in the definition of trans. Because of this, many non-binary people don't feel ""trans enough"" because trans still has the connotation of being ""the opposite gender"". Whenever I came out to people as trans in the past, everyone would automatically assume I was a trans man, and I'd have to correct them.

In the case of my partner, they don't identify as trans because they are agender and feel that the term ""transgender"" implies they have a gender. In my case, I stopped identifying as trans after having had too many bad experiences with binary trans people in my local trans community. Unfortunately, there is a chunk of the trans community that preaches non-binary exclusion and hatred towards non-binary people, and my local community had many people who felt that way strongly. I felt like I was being held to impossible standards so I decided that not using the trans label was better for my mental health.

I do plan on medical transition, and while many non-binary people feel like they aren't ""trans enough"" because they aren't transitioning, there are also non-binary people who medically transition and do not identify as trans.
For me I dont identify as trans as I'm Agender, I don't want to be associated with having a gender. I don't feel like I am the opposite gender. So um, yea
Depends on how you define trans, and a lot of people still understand it with a binary mindset, ie trans is someone born male sex and female gender, or vice versa. Or someone whose gender is not the same as their sex, but they still only recognise binary sex and gender so the outcome is the same.

I don't consider myself to have a gender. So I don't use the word trans because I think it'll lead to misunderstandings - people are liable to assume I want to be a man when I don't. Or something about penises. So I prefer to emphasise that I don't have a gender, and trans as a label doesn't get that across.
I still identify as my assigned gender at birth so I feel like trans doesn't fit me, though I do appreciate and relate to a lot of trans memes
i find it’s each go there own. i consider my self nb and trans i have done hrt but still consider myself nb. for me it’s cause i’m amab and have gone through a transition but i don’t consider my self fully female more not male with femme traits.
because while i as a nonbinary person am comfortable being referred to as either a man or woman and dont really care which you use for me, im not trying to transition from one gender/sex to the other. im comfortable with my body and somedays prefer to be more on the feminine side, other days i want to be more masculine. i dont want to make any physical changes to myself and dont experience dysphoria, therefore im not going to call myself trans
Echoing some stuff that's already been said but

1) ""not trans enough""
2) not wanting to steal focus from people who have fought a long hard battle for that identity, especially in the face of dysphoria
2b) a lack of dysphoria
3) years of thinking I was trans, but that not feeling right, and then finding there was something else. 

Its like living in North London, and being asked if you support Spurs or Arsenal- and actually, you don't like football, or even care.
Depends on what flavor of non-binary you specifically identify as. Some non-binary folks don't identify as a gender, but both they and those folks who do use it as a catch-all umbrella for ""not wholly and solely male or female"". I think that someone who doesn't identify as any gender is by definition not transgender, because I define transgender as ""*identifying at least partially or for some portion of the time with a gender* other than the gender aligned to one's birth sex assignment"".

 My emphasis is on the criteria that one must identify as a divergent gender or multiple genders, whereas other people focus on the portion about deviation from the gender correlated to birth sex assignment. In my opinion being trans and being non-binary are independent questions. One can be both (for example a person who identifies as bigender or genderfluid or comparable), binary trans (trans man/trans woman), or just non-binary (agender and similar identities).
As far as i understand, trans people have an innate sense of their gender, they know they are a woman a man a *, just that unlike cis people they don't associate that gender with their physical form.
Please correct me on that, if I'm wrong. 

I as an enby have no such innate gender feeling. I don't feel like i belong to any gender, kinda genderfree. And my physical form isn't so much a concern for me at all, it's more the gendered social norms and expectations people have towards me because of that body that are bothering me. 

So yeah i think that's why i don't think I'm trans.
It’s kind of complicated, I do identify as trans, but I also have self doubt sometimes because I mostly present as my AGAB so trans exclusive spaces can feel like I’m out of place
I think I dont identify as trans cause though I do have dysphoria, I dont feel like there’s anywhere to transition cause the opposite or outside of my agab is not me either..??..I feel pretty genderless and dont really relate too much to either ”side” of the binary. I’m afab so feminine features on me like curves, breasts, ass, feel extremely uncomfortable and give me so much dysphoria to the point of a soon decade long ED, BUT like otherwise I’m like ok with this body that I’ve learned to love more and more and it just happens to be a female body I don’t think it makes that big of a difference for me cause i relate to neither female or male.

 It’s like there isn’t REALLY anything I would have to change (to ”transition” into something new or me), figuring out I was NB was mostly just a crazy relief for me to understand and also being able to understand that I dont have to try to force myself into the woman-box, prove people im a desireable wOMaN always thinking i should dress and act more feminine if i wanted people to think im attractive. You was trying to climb the wrong tree my friend
I Mean When I First Started Identifying As NB I Didn't Identify As Trans, Mainly Due To Denial (""I Swear I'm Cis!"" ""Okay, Maybe I'm NB, But Just A Little Tiny Bit."" ""Alright, Maybe Like Demiboy Or Something?"" ""Oh F*** I'm A Girl (Still NB).""), But Nowadays I Do Identify As Both.

I can think of a few reasons other Non-Binary Folks might not ID as Trans though, Maybe they're Demigender or something and pretty comfortable with their AGAB, Or Genderfluid and only sometimes feel like a different Gender from their AGAB, Or just Don't Care about Gender, Et Cetera, Not sure if these are common though just some ideas.

I Guess Speculation (Which Is What This Is) Isn't Terribly Useful Here Though, Especially As Other Answers Probably Don't Make You Need To Speculate.
Well I personally don't think it feels completely right because if society wouldn't talk about all the time I would have recognized it earlier way earlier
I'm a male who doesn't identify with masculinity, and I don't identify with a whole lot of femininity either.
I'm non-binary, gender fluid (though I only use they/them pronouns, but its more about my expression of how I act and dress for the day) but I also identify as trans masc, I havent done anything to transition (i am going to get top surgery in the future) but I don't think you should have to transition in anyway to be able to use the label, because at the end of the day whats most important is what feels right for you label or no label
Trans people want to transition from one set of the binary to the other.  Nonbinary don't acknwoledge the binary and embrace that there is more

Though I think it's just a rejection of the narrative that been upheld for a few centuries - there are only two, nothing else.
I don’t see myself as trans because I have no plans to physically transition (through medicine or surgery), but I don’t identify as cis, so I am nonbinary. I mean, that’s just how I quantify it in my own head. (Not saying you have to be if the label serves you! I’m just saying that I personally don’t feel attached to the label and this is why.)
I don’t really connect with the label, I’m non binary but I still dress and present majority my AGAB and I’m ok with that for now.
Well I'm non-binary (agender) doubting myself ever since my sis (trans) told me she was agender before realising she was trans. Now I don't fucking know what I am and this is why I'm non-binary.

It's as easy as it gets
I'm NB and identify as trans, and a lot of folks esp within our community internalize the propaganda that we have to gatekeep this experience bc of resource scarcity aka trans discrimination etc (this is a super bullet point.) long story short, trans experience is varied and valid across a spectrum, folks are scared and so restrict experience. Makes sense ppl are scared. we could maybe be more detailed like, trans masc/ trans femme if that's your truth (ppl do, but not everyone I guess) trans enby or whatever. But truth is if you're not cis you're trans so like. Let a (gender free) bitch live.
I am agender. I feel like saying I'm trans would negate my agender identity as I specifically want to steer away from gender. I feel like I haven't transitioned into anything, I've just become more comfortable with my masculine and feminine sides
As my experience with being enby is more ""man+"" rather than a break with my AGAB, my experience doesn't really feel like a trans one? I usually see presenting masc as a safe, unexposed nook rather than something I'm ""retreating"" to
I feel the somewhat the opposite, I have been enby for 2/3 years and I have realized that trans Is not just for people that are in the gendered cistem but can be expressed in multiple different ways.

I totally understand your case, and myself I don't use the trans term myself.

It's not like we are people that fit in multiple different boxes, it's more like we are the fluid that goes into the boxes to fill them up with multiple different experiences 

You don't have to connect being enby with being trans, it's all your feelings and how you express yourself
I identify as non-binary, but since I have no interest in transitioning or making significant changes to my body I don't think I could identify as a trans non binary. I don't want to be male nor female, I just wanna be me, I'm not trans... Just non conforming.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt dysphoric in the way that other trans people I know have. I don’t want to intrude and it feels wrong when I know I’m comfortable appearing as my agab (at least sometimes).
Depends on peoples personal definition of trans. Like for a while i didnt consider myself trans bc, like other commenters said, there can sometimes be a feeling of not being trans “enough,” and that was what i felt for a while bc i didnt feel like i was actually transitioning to anything. But the more i got to understand my identity to more I realized i do resonate with being trans even if i havent medically transitioned(which is not a requirement for anyone to be trans, but a lot of ppl have that interpretation). That being said, not identifying as trans while being nb isnt always insecurity in whether or not you qualify, some people just dont really feel trans, often for similar reasons i said, they might not feel like they’ve actually transitioned to anything, they just are who they are! Labels are pretty subjective and i think its pretty common to not strongly identify with certain labels even if they technically fall under it
The same reason I don't call myself a Cancer Survivor because I found my melanoma early, got it cut out right away, and was cleared by the biopsy that I needed no further testing or surgery.

My experience was vastly different from people who've fought hard for months on end and accrued endless medical debt and using the same term for both feels - to me - like I'm diminishing their experience.

.

I'm amab, demiguy/fluid, present almost the same as before I knew what NB was (exception being dangle earrings and *subtle* women's tops sometimes).

If someone wants to say I'm trans I won't fight them on it and might use it as an opportunity to advocate for issues facing the trans community.

Someone else said it well: trans-adjacent.
There is also trans being the umbrella term. Cis or trans and under trans is non binary.
Identify as trans non binary as I believe that trans is an umbrella term for not only trans women or men but non binary people and other groups. I personally don't find it hard to ide tiny with that but I also believe that it is someone's choice
i don't consider myself trans because i feel like it's typically associated with the binary genders, and as someone who's nonbinary and purposefully has tried to get away from that binary as much as i can, i just don't really feel that the label trans fits me.

i do, however, consider myself to be part of the trans umbrella, since calling yourself that doesn't allude to a specific gender, just that the person isn't cis.
I think nb counts as trans
I’m nonbinary trans. Never encountered trans folks who think I’m not trans enough, but it did take me awhile to fully identify as trans. I guess I’ve always seen it as a personal preference or comfort with certain labels.
I tend not to identify as trans because I don’t experience dysphoria, which seems to be a universal trans experience.
I don't because I don't think it fits me as an Agender who isn't really anything. I also just don't want to identify as trans because many people try and force me.
This.

Trans people have specifically told me that I am not trans, and that my experiences are different and not-comparable.

I was assigned male at birth, and while other nonbinary people still identify me as nonbinary... I still look like I was assigned male at birth. I have a beard, albeit bleached. I'm a big powerlifter. My femininity is expressed through clothing and makeup and my personality. This is super important to me, and when I can't be feminine I feel like I'm acting as someone else.

But I'm not attached to the trans label, so if trans people say I'm not, well, I'm fine with just being an enby.
Agreed on this. When I first realized I was NB I felt disconnected from the trans label because it always was ""Trans *and* Non-binary people"", not just using trans as an umbrella term. And I can understand to a point because yeah, outside of the binary -> *non-binary*. But it still made me feel like it wasn't a label for me.  
  
  
I've only just recently started using it for myself, and while I do identify with and get along with my other binary trans friends, I still don't feel that much of an *attachment*, i guess, to the label.
I felt like this for awhile and it was pushed harder when I heard it from the mouth of one of the biggest activists in our area but also it's bullshit. I was with a trans woman for 7 years and it's a big reason I had those feelings. But also I realized just because we had different gender struggles didn't make mine less valid somehow. Yes her transition is much riskier. Yes in situations where my safety is in question I can mask as a cis woman to avoid such. But also we still DO face discrimination. Outing our status CAN put us at risk. We can and do lose friends and family over coming out. Before I use this example I'm not at all saying it compares to the black experiences BUT. Lets frame it as race for a minute. Do you think white passing mixed kids should be left out of any culture debates? I have a friend who absolutely is but he's also still half middle eastern. He still has had to hear things about his family, he's been personally discriminated against based on his name etc. White passing kids still grow up in the house of their non white parents. They still watch their families get treated poorly and again if someone's racist and finds out they're mixed they can still be at risk of personal injury. Their black/Hispanic/middle eastern/Asian etc experience shouldn't be less valid just because other people deal with things more directly.
Honestly- I'm not attached to labels in general. I do like some more than overs; I don't think they fit well. It's been that way since I was 6ish and ""Tomboy"" was a term no one asked me about but saddled me with anyway. I digress.

Imho- The trans community is in this hyper-awareness mode. They need support but they also need to be taken seriously and that starts by ""Verifying"" everyone using their modifier to please the mainstream in a effort of protect themselves from people using the term for gain.
Trans is for transgender, not transition. Not trying to tell you to use trans as a label for yourself, as no one should impose labels on anyone else, but I also want anyone who reads this to know that, if they want to use the trans label, they are valid regardless of whether they have or will transition.

In its simplest definition, trans means your gender is not the gender you were (coercively) assigned at birth. My gender identity is nonbinary. I was assigned a binary gender at birth.

Whether or not you are transgender is not defined by whether or not you transition.
Yeah exactly this, I didn’t change my name or anything about myself really other than my pronouns
This is the way I view it (if I’m not cis I must be trans) so it’s odd to hear that other people have a different opinion regardless of not identifying with their AGAB.
As someone who's come into this supporting a family member and still being cis myself I found it difficult to understand why NB and trans were placed together. 

I think this is confused as the word ""trans"" being both a process and a destination. Also people who are binary trans will be functionally non-binary for part of the process, while still identifying as trans.

But as an outsider I still see ""binary trans"" and ""non binary"" as two different identities. I'm also learning that non binary is a pretty huge umbrella term in itself. 

But having said all that, your identity is whatever works for you.
Just want to say, that as someone who identifies as both trans and enby, I don't think being trans is about the trauma and struggle that cisnormative society puts folks through.

I imagine a world where that doesn't happen anymore. I'd still be trans in that world.
This!!!!
>many nb people also still identify with their agab experience, so its more of a ""little bit of this PLUS a little bit of that"" instead of trans being ""no longer this, now that.""

This Is Very Much It For Me, I Do Identify As Trans, But I Doubt I'll Ever Just Say ""I'm Trans"" Without Specifying, Because I Still Do Feel Like A Lad (My AGAB), Just Also Like A Lass. I Might Say ""Yes"" If Asked If I'm Trans Or Something, But In Identifying Myself I'd Probably Say NB, Because It's More Specific But Also Broad Enough I Feel Many People Would Understand It.

~~(P.S. How *Dare* You Not Wear Purple Pride Gear? :P)~~
This.
This was basically me. I didn't feel like trans was an accurate label for me at first, although if anyone asked I'd tell them I was ""technically trans"" by the not-your-assigned-gender definition.

But now that I've learned to recognise dysphoria for what it is, I've given myself permission to explore my relationship to my body more deeply. It didn't take long for me to discover that I'd love to feminise my body while leaning into butch territory (a la /r/MTFButch). Those feelings I'd categorised as simple attraction or fetish, were ultimately envy. And I've found my euphoria too; breast forms showed me a future that's in reach.

So now I consider myself nonbinary and transfem, and more than just ""technically"" trans.
Me too! It’s so interesting that if my gender expression matches my afab, I feel like I’m cosplaying lol
I feel like many enby people don’t identify as trans due to bad information around the word (not being “trans enough”, thinking trans means the “opposite gender”, or transmedicalism) from bigots or exclusionary trans people.

Some will probably decide to do as you and I did and identify as trans later on when they’re more rooted in their identity, but some will probably never feel connected to the trans community.

It’s really saddening to see that most of these answers are about not medically transitioning or not being discriminated against, which definitely aren’t requirements for being trans.
I feel similarly!
I feel unaccepted sometimes but I feel like I should at least feel comfortable in myself with the word trans even if other people might disagree. 

I “came out” to myself and internally transitioned far before any sort of external transition (which hasn’t even happened yet as I’m closeted) and I feel like that was very important and in itself makes me trans regardless of what I do from now on.
x2
that’s binary trans vs non binary trans. not “trans vs non binary”.
Calm down, they never said to be bothered by it
But people don't have to use that term if they choose not to. Using the word ""trans"" to describe myself makes me uncomfortable, because I don't think there was any actual changes made to me. Just a subtraction of gender. I remained the same, but removed the concepts (my ideas of gender and what I didn't want to associate with), that came with my AGAB.
I agree, which is why I’m confused by non-binary people who don’t use the term because they think transgender means to be the “opposite gender”.
That makes sense I guess (the part about it creating misconceptions and people assuming you’re a woman/man). 

I tend to simplify demiboy to just a guy a lot of the times so I guess I kind of do that myself, but I still believe both terms apply to me (trans and enby).
Awful that you got treated that way. NB exclusionary trans folk are something I can't comprehend how they can be so hateful, they're truscum transmedicalists trying to pander to transphobes and exclude parts of the community to look better when that does nothing but harm for the community.
Also can't you be just NB and not trans?  I mean I am an Enby but not trans.  AFAB but do masc, fem and androg pretty well.

As I like to say I wake up and pick my gender (or lack of gender) for the day.

I am going for a breast reduction and lift because some days I can't hide the girls but I also don't hate they exist I'd just like to be able to camouflage them easier.
yea, you're right n\_n; i just shy away from using the label often as i feel like due to the factors i mentioned my experience is far far different from most trans peoples. i mean, all nonbinary people are technically under the trans umbrella, but i still feel like i dont have much of a connection with it
I just want to hop in on this comment specifically, because if I’m not my assigned gender at birth I’m trans, but if I’m my assigned gender at birth I’m cis then that seems just like another binary. I don’t really say I’m trans because I don’t feel like I had to transition in any way. I don’t believe in traditional gender roles and just would rather there not be any binary. It’s party of the reason I know I’m non binary, because I don’t want to be seen as male, female, trans male, trans female, or really even non binary. I just wanna be seen as human just as Paideia.
A lot of people struggle with the trans label because they run into trans gatekeeping. ""Not trans enough"" is a common sentiment. Trans medicalists won't consider anyone who is not medically transitioning as trans, for example. 

While nonbinary folks are under the trans umbrella, our trans brothers and sisters aren't always the most inclusive bunch.

Then being accustomed to existing outside of norms and not fitting into labels it's easy to just feel like being nonbinary is its own thing entirely. I'm honestly not sure it isn't much of the time.
I don't exactly feel like agab is a good expression to describe how i feel. I feel like i was assigned a sex at birth, and society like my parents decided that was congruent with a certain gender and their specific roles. 
So actually i more feel like i don't have a gender,  no innate sense of ""that's the roles i feel comfortable with"".
>(if I’m not cis I must be trans) 

~~Amateur, Why Not Do Both?~~
I think gender is a journey for everyone all of their lives - even cis people experience changes in how they relate to their gender identity. To say that trans is a ""destination"" implies that until someone reaches that ""destination,"" they aren't actually trans. Which is the whole trouble we're experiencing with gatekeeping - people who consider themselves closer to some kind of arbitrary trans destination telling other people that they aren't ""trans enough."" 

Also, would like to gently ping that ""functionally nonbinary"" is an unhelpful term that fundamentally misunderstands nonbinary identities. Gender isn't a straight road from MALE --> FEMALE, with nonbinary being all the places you are in-between. I know this is a lot for people to wrap their brains around, because society has hammered the binary into us, but -- to coin a phrase -- gender is just a construct. There's no such thing as ""functionally nonbinary."" It's a meaningless term. Because which features or qualities make you ""functionally"" your gender? Is it that all your external genitalia match those of the average cis person? How big do they have to be to qualify? Or is it that your hormone levels match the average cis person of the same age as you? Or that you ""pass"" a certain percentage of the time? What if you pass in public as your gender until you speak? Or you pass in some clothing but not others? What ""functions"" are you not fulfilling that let you qualify as your gender?

The answer is that gender isn't dependent on any ""functions."" If you identify as a trans woman but you haven't transitioned medically in any way or changed your name or your presentation, you're still a trans woman. If you feel comfortable presenting as your AGAB but you identify as nonbinary, then you're nonbinary. Muy simple. 

Personally, I consider myself trans nonbinary, because not identifying with my AGAB is an important part of the way I feel. However, because I haven't taken any steps of medical transition (Yet? Maybe?), I've been told by people (including other trans people) that I wasn't trans enough. And I struggle with that insecurity all the time.
i dont understand your comment😭what do you mean trans is both a process and a destination?? and ppl who are binary trans are also nb?? for me transgender means anything that isnt cis, plus a lot of non binary people do transition with surgeries and hrt etc. i feel like its for lack of a better word weird?? to say that non binary people aren’t trans when they undergo (depending on the person) all of the same experiences as mtf/ftm??
That's fair. But as I see it, inherently right now it's got a lot of prejudice levied against it. Seems every time I turn round some politician is hoosing to be a cunt. So I choose to support those who want ot need the label, since I don't feel it myself

That's a really nice way to think of it! Internally transitioning is a phrase I'm going to remember because I definitely did do that (and still doing that). Thanks!
Except this seems to be a post on repeat in this group. 

People are supposed to explain why they don't identify as trans, but if someone kept pressing people as to why they identify as trans people would be up in arms about it. 

""They didn't say it bothers them,"" 
No, but they heavily implied it and instead of just saying, ""Can someone explain this to me,"" they give reasoning to invalidate those who don't identify as trans purely on their own experience. 

How many times do cis people do the same thing? ""Well, I don't understand this. Explain it,"" 

I'm tired of people constantly questioning my identity as just. Nonbinary. 

I've been out for 15 years as Nonbinary and only in the last few years have people been obsessed with pushing other nonbinary people to identify as trans. Before? It was rare to see someone identify as trans and nonbinary. No one questioned it, and it wasn't an issue. 

Then suddenly, it's like every damn month someone is pushing that envelope and I'm tired of it. Why do I need to validate how I identify because someone can't just accept me as it because they don't understand it.
This
Thanks for calling me out on that and for the insight.
So there is a process of ""transitioning"" the destination can be ""transsexual"" as in across m-f or f-m. Or the destination can be non binary.
I’m not sure how my personal experience of being more comfortable with the trans label than the non-binary label was “reasoning to invalidate those who don’t identify as trans”. 

I never said anything about how non-binary people should, just simply that (by definition) it would make sense for any non-binary person to identify as trans and I never quite understood or had anyone irl to explain to me why some enby people don’t.
yep
No worries, yo! Thanks for being an ally!
But this is a question constantly being brought up in enby groups. 

It's like a cis guy saying they don't understand someone whose trans bc they don't know any person whose trans irl, then going to trans groups and telling someone whose trans to explain themselves. 

Why do people need to explain how they identify as? Why are you not just able to accept people are nonbinary and a chunk of don't identify as trans as well? 

If you come up to a group of nonbinary people and say ""I'm enby and trans!"" No one questions it and says cool. But if I say I'm enby and not trans, suddenly I'm having to explain myself. 

The whole point of the LGBTQIA+ community is to be accepting of each other... not to go questioning each other just because we don't understand it.
> It's like a cis guy saying they don't understand
someone whose trans be they don't know any
person whose trans irl, then going to trans
groups and telling someone whose trans to

People do this, and I don’t go on a rant about it in the comments. 

Asking a respectful question about something I don’t quite understand but would like to isn’t “not being accepting of each other”.

I never forced anyone to answer or said anything insulting. I merely asked to increase my own understanding of other enby people who are different than me.
The point completely went over your head 🙃
No, you overcomplicated a question that I asked in good faith that wasn’t offensive in any way.

If everyone found my question rude and offensive, they would’ve all downvoted it to hell and wrote angry comments. However, you are the only one upset, and I asked in order to gain knowledge rather than to “convince you to be trans”.
I never said you were trying to ""convince me"" to be trans. 

I didn't over complicate your question at all. I pointed out how it's a question that's already been asked more than once and the ""I just was to gain knowledge!"" Is such a weak reason.

You're asking people to justify being nonbinary and not trans just because you ""don't understand it"" 

And the point on a cis guy asking someone trans something similar? It's asking someone to justify their existence and identity. 

Google is free, and this is a thread. I swear every other damn month in this thread about this question. You could've easily looked first. 

You're getting pissy that I pointed out an issue with your question and how it comes off as. Just like a cis guy getting pissing if someone trans called them out for a question coming off rudely."	ygxf56	NonBinary	92	0.97	2022-10-29 22:51:32
I came out to my family yesterday	"AFAB

Last time I came out it was to tell my family that I like girls. It was scary and nerve wracking and I never thought I'd have to go through that again, but last night I did. I told my family that I'm transmasculine NB and I explained to them what that means. 

It went surprisingly well. My old fashioned mother is the only one who didn't say anything to me afterwards but I expected that. I think she's been struggling with my masculine tendencies since I was a child and she's always feared that ""this would happen"" to me. But I know she'll come around. My dad and sisters all gave me their support and they said they just want me to be happy :)

I also just got a [fresh fade haircut](https://i.imgur.com/xXMqhx1.jpg) and I got a fantastic new prosthetic and I'm feeling on top of the world. I feel like I've been set free."	"I'm glad it went so well for you!

Edit: you look great :)
Yay! Glad it went well, and you are rocking your look.
Very nice haircut and glad things went well. Unfortunately I didn't get the same response. My parents think I'm being rebellious (at 29?) or I'm just ""confused"". 
kickass, man.
Congratulations!!! Also you look absolutely amazing, please tell me your secret!
I'm so happy for you! Also, you make a strikingly handsome gentleman.
Badass bro, I'm glad you're feeling positive!
Congratulations!! :)
Thank you!!
Thank you! :)
Ah jeez that's what I was worried would happen to me. Sorry man :/
Thanks bro ✌
Haha thank you! 
Thank you!
Thanks bro!
Thanks :)
I appreciate it. But glad you didn't have the same experience as me. What sucks more is I'm stuck with my parents. Was born with all kinds of health problems, disabled, and can't work. And I live in the middle of nowhere. Trying to find someone online.
Good luck with your future and hope things go well for you!"	7wt87z	NonBinary	91	0.97	2018-02-11 15:03:59
I'm in a Bl*ire Wh*te video, vent	"So yesterday I found out that I'm in Blaire White's latest video collab with Kalvin, taking the piss out of trans people on TikTok with the usual amount of transmedical bullshit thrown in. My TikTok was talking about how the ""trans"" in transgender isn't short for transitioning - something that a lot of young people on TikTok think. I explained what suffixes are and why the two words are similar, but that one isn't short for the other.

BW and KG decided to watch five seconds, cut off the rest of my video and laugh about how the suffix trans means across (or ""change thoroughly"" as they loved to put it) which I LITERALLY said myself in the next sentence.

Not my first time getting dunked on by the Trumed squad, got put in a KG ""Transtrender Cringe Compilation"" a few weeks ago too.

Both times I got relatively lucky as the videos they used were shot from the chest up so they couldn't see the fact that I don't bind but I still get really awful comments on my TikTok from the videos.

Could really use some general support or advice as to whether there's anything I can do to get them to leave me alone."	"Can you not have the video removed for using your likeness without permission?
Jumping off /u/AZymph's comment, a DMCA takedown might be your best option (disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer). Assuming you filmed the TikTok yourself, I'm 99% certain you own the copyright on that video, which means the only obstacle might be them arguing it's fair use. It's debatable, though, because while fair use does protect ""criticism [and] comment"" (https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html), what they did (sorry, I went and watched the video for context) was barely either of those things -- they just watched those five seconds of your video and started spouting bullshit about the definition of trans and then somehow moved on to ""I don't agree with TERFs ***but***-"" (ugh)

However, there are other consequences to keep in mind. While I do believe you can keep the copyright strike anonymous, there's still the chance that these assholes will guess or figure out it's you. You may end up being harassed in other ways, so that's a risk you'd be taking and I thus advise you to make sure your social networks are separate from your personal information so you can't get doxxed.

I wish you luck in whatever you choose to do, and on a less legal note, fuck those guys.
It sucks so much that our own community can be as toxic as terfs and transphobes :(
I keep hearing people say that TikTok is this great utopia for queer representation...but what it really seems to be is a social media *designed* to be an echo chamber. If you go looking for it, straight TikTok can be found easily, and the content on it is VASTLY different to queer TikTok. And then even within queer TikTok, there's TONS of bi/trans/enby phobic content...it's just easy to not notice when you've carefully curated who you follow.

Edit: and don't get me wrong, echo chambers *for entertainment to be consumed in reasonable doses* can be okay. It's fine to have things you enjoy and immerse yourself in those things for even hours at a time occasionally for entertainment; but TikTok is also, in many instances, being seen as a teaching tool for a number of issues...and that's concerning, because that makes it VERY easy for a person getting the wrong information from bad sources to keep hearing that same bad information in their echo chamber until it is validated in their mind.

And this goes both ways, to an extent. My wife showed me a TikTok about how the English word ""picnic"" was supposedly SUPER racist...turned out the story they told of its ""etymology"" wasn't remotely true and picnic is a word we stole from the French...and the racists will EAT THAT SHIT UP because it's a tailor made example of ""race card"" bullshit they love to bring up to try to discredit anti-racist activism.
honestly, be careful about tik tok. you've read the stuff about how it's basically wiretapping you, yeah?
I'm sorry that happened to you.  Blaire and Kalvin are bullies.  I watched one of his ""transtrenders"" videos and it was literally half an hour of Kalvin making fun of a genderqueer person by telling them their dysphoria is fake and shit.  It pissed me off so much.  They're bulliesn and I don't like bullies.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. I hate how some folks will just shit on others like this (like they didn't even let your video finish wtf), you in no way deserve this treatment. 

Also please know that I think you are 100% right with your video, F those jerks for spreading hate and lies.
I'm sorry that happened to you! You don't deserve that. 

I can't really come up with something that's helpful that isn't keep your distance and remembering that you aren't doing anything wrong. And that doesn't feel fair to me. I wish it wasn't that way. But it is the way it is and it will take time for things to change. 

Some people are fighting for privilege rather than justice. And that's sadly everywhere, even inside our own community. Making fun of others and intentionally making them look stupid aren't uplifting nor forwardthinking nor done with empathy and compassion. They probably have their own issues completely separate from you that makes them do mean things. It does have everything to do with them and nothing to do with you.
Unfortunately I'm pretty sure it falls under fair use, I'm not sure what a takedown notice would do :(
Yeah it's wild how different TikTok can be depending on what algorithm you fall under, it's like a totally different app
Yeah, I worry about echo chambers and how they can foment the spread of disinformation and propaganda, too.  Minor quibble, though: The *picnic* canard has been circulating since before social media, so it's not a great example.
That's every single app thats on your phone. Tiktok has been blown out of proportion because it's Chinese owned.
You are good and wonderful and beautiful the way you are!
At the very least, it would cause a mild panic -- you've likely seen the channels that simply get hit by the strike, and despite trying to fight it, get stuck with the hit to their channel. But this might still carry the possible harassment I talked about above.

Additionally, if you or anyone else ""featured"" in the video are minors, you can report that and the video will have its comments and such disabled, which would definitely cause a noticeable loss for the channel and hopefully make them think twice about using random TikToks again.
not the same thing. check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fxgi06/not_new_news_but_tbh_if_you_have_tiktiok_just_get/fmuko1m/?context=1) and tell me facebook does anything close to that"	hzgk2q	NonBinary	92	1.0	2020-07-28 15:21:42
what's up with all those name me posts?	"As title says, I'm honestly not judging or criticising here, just trying to understand what's up with this idea of having people naming you based on your looks.

I'm confused on how someone could give you a name based on your physical appearance.

Can some nice sighted folks explain to me what that's all about?"	"Its more about ""what name would u guess is mine"" to give people ideas. 4 eyes are better then 2 right?
I think people just want to find out how others see them or what another possibility might be for themselves they hadn’t considered. I think it’s part of self exploration even if they have no intention to choose a new name.
Media creators name characters all the time. Some might be for plot reasons, some for personality, and some for looks. There are certain names that have a “type” to them. 

But also people often add a few details about the kind of names they like, and how they see themselves. And those might spark ideas for other people.
I can see, but honestly i have no idea how they expect that to work either. A name is something either chosen for a baby who you don't even know how it's gonna look when grown, or for yourself based on personal preference. I don't get how appearance has anything to do with it.
Prefer it when people give us some options. We are strangers to each other and there’s more to a name than how it looks on you. WHO are you? I don’t know. I just hide the post and keep scrolling
Maybe they just want people to give them ideas for a name… and that’s it?

It’s actually rather lovely, I think.
It's definitely just to get more ideas. But have you ever met someone and it's hard to remember their name because they don't look like they fit that name? 

Ie, ""But you don't *look* like a Kyle!""

Edit: Oops! I skipped over the sighted part of your post, my bad. Anyway, it is a thing where sometimes people just don't fit their name aesthetically. I'm not sure how to explain that phenomenon to be honest.
Why is guessing someones name by their physical appearance strange? Before you're born, you're given a name at random with out any indication of who you are, or what you are, or what you will be.
It's kind of like that whole ""You look like a brad, I'm gonna call you brad"" thing I used to do in Highschool.
Some people just “look like an [insert name here]”
It strikes me as odd because it perpetuates and strengthens stereotypes, which are limiting and oppressive.
Could be way off here, of course, but I've read those as people looking to be seen. In an erasive world, I get that.

I am personally pretty burned out on seeing slight variations of the same. exact. selfie. damn near every day. I'm probably just old, but a community forum is not at all like a personal IG account imo. /shrug
You sound like a Clover
Some people can equate the two
Personally I think these posts are just asking for someone to get doxxed, it's really dangerous >^<
Its mostly just about people wanting name ideas that seem to ""fit"" them

Like, if theres a feminine person who's super edgy and gothic, they might get name suggestions like ""raven"" or ""October""

If they have a neutral face and aesthetic, based on certain features, people may be reminded of the mental images they get with certain names. 

Maybe the name ""Emily"" sounds like a happy name to someone, so they suggest it to someone who seems friendly. 

Maybe the name ""Archie"" makes someone picture a guy whos an artist, so they give it to someone who looks artsy. 

Maybe to someone else, Archie seems uncreative and Emily seems depressing, so they suggest different things to the same person.

Its just about wanting suggestions and not being able to come up with ideas on their own, and, for whatever reason, people seem to associate certain sounds, letters and names with certain physical attributes or personal characteristics, so they ask for help.

Theres also a lot of unusual names that the poster may not have ever heard of before!

Its mostly just for fun and help is all :) hope that makes sense

(plus its fun to see what other people would name you, like a game!)
I'm actually glad I'm not alone in not understanding then! I thought I must be missing something again, that happens a lot.
Right, all that you've said makes sense. I get it better now. I hope I didn't offend anyone though, I just really wanted to get the idea behind all those naming posts. I don't really mind them, just I didn't get why that was a thing.
I also don't really get it, kinda wish I had an easy way to filter out ""name me"" posts.
Just to be clear cause words on internet lack’s inflection.  I was just joking, naming you based off seemingly unrelated details. Meant nothing by it.
Haha that's all good. You didn't offend me or anything. I wasn't sure how to interpret this though, like you said about text lacking inflection. :D"	11n3uyj	NonBinary	88	0.94	2023-03-09 21:08:26
Why do some people use it/ it/itself pronouns?	I was at a diy punk venue and met a couple people that went used it/ its/ itself pronouns and I never got the chance to ask further about what made those pronouns clicked for it. Can some people that go by those pronouns or know about them explain? Also how can i use those pronouns in a sentence so i can see how the different versions of it can be used? Thank you in advance!	"animals and objects being called it/its has already been mentioned, but for example forces of nature are it/its as well, which i like
I know a lot of enbies use it because the pronoun is used for animals and objects and it's fully singular and neutral. Some because their identity is tied to something that isn't human, (xenogenders for example), some as a reclaimation if the dehumanization they face, others because it just feels right. 

Personally I don't use it/its (not yet anyways, I've considered it), but he/him has all but replaced my personal use of they/them because I use he/him the same way I would use it: on bugs and animals and objects. So often when it comes up I'm like ""I use he/him, but in a bug you found on the sidewalk kind of way"" so I get the idea behind it/its.

Oh and: 

Its name is Max. Those glasses belong to it. It really likes watching anime. It's really tired. It and I went to watch a movie together. Max saw itself in the mirror. Etc.
My partner is agender and it uses ""it"" as a primary pronoun because that connects best with it's gender identity, simple as that really!
I use it!

Most of the time, you don't question the gender of an animal when talking about it. I want the same treatment.
I feel like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/armm7t/on_it_its_itself_pronouns/) post gives a pretty good explanation why some people may prefer to use it pronouns
I was called an it growing up because of my autism symptoms and general non cis behavior, so for me it's reclaimation, just like someone might reclaim a slur

On top of that, I never liked they/them or neo/xeno pronouns so it's a gender neutral option that works for me, that being said my pronouns are he/it and I love being called he just as much if not a little more
If you want to explore how it might look in conversation, [pronoun dressing room](http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/) is a good resource for that.
If you like reading things, Becky Chambers has a couple of books with a protagonist using it/its (with bonus they/them main character), beginning with *A Psalm for the Wild-Built*, and in Ann Leckie's *Murderbot Diaries*, the narrator uses it/its.
I'm any/all, but I'm super comfy with it/its so I'll just pop in my two cents-

'It' has no edges. 'It' isn't defined- you can use it for a rock, or a tree, or an animal you don't know. 'It' isn't tied to any gender expression, stuffed animals after all often have gender expression, but still can be 'it'. When you call me 'it', I feel like I'm limitless- I don't have to fill out a box of he or they, I am free to be nothing more than energy and carbon, and that's how I feel a lot of the time.

&#x200B;

Also in my case it's a haha funny clown joke so I gotta lean into it
Not only do i vibe with the animals being referred to as it thing, but its also a reclamation for me after some childhood abuse. I accept other pronouns because people make such a fuss about using my correct pronouns, but its the most neutral set of pronouns that reflect me better than they
everybody uses them for different reasons, but for me personally? my gender feels kind of like a monster? like,, I’ve always described it like this; do we think slenderman or mothman have a gender identity? do we think they have genitals? no not fuckin really(except for some monsterfucker individuals), but everybody sees them as ‘man’. I’m,, like that? Like I want people to look at me and see a man, like my outer shell is supposed to be a man, but on the inside I know my gender is only partially that. The other part feels like something that lurks in the shadows and hides in the dark. Something that horror writers have nightmares about. Something that feels more “it” than anything human. Hope this helps
I use it/its

Idk why, it just feels right. Feels good.

Except for when people put too much emphasis on it. That shit makes me dysphoric ngl. It's like the person is being sarcastic about accepting me. (Example using he/him: HE went to the park. Oh, I was just talking to HIM! HIS pronouns are HE/HIM)
While I can’t speak for other people, I like it/its pronouns in an eldritch/ethereal kind of way. I relate my gender to non human things, specifically the void or some sort of eldritch god. I like it in a “it has awakened! The one who sees all, knows all, and comprehends none!” Kind oh way. Like a cultist worshipping the elder ones. (I’m very into lovecraftian horror and things similar to it if you can’t tell lol)
I assume for the same reason anyone uses their preferred pronouns. It feels right. The way in which it feels right will vary from person to person, but it's just a preference.
I’ve seen some people with it/it’s pronouns use it in the same way some people reclaim slurs. Since trans people have been derogatorily referred to as “it” pretty often in the past, some trans people now are taking the opportunity to reclaim it/it’s for themselves and their community!
As a person who uses neopronouns it’s just something that clicks, it could be any pronoun really. I use ae/aer and that just fits me personally. If u wanna get more educated on it I suggest going to pronouns page and finding out about them more!
I mean, you've pretty much aced how to use them already. As for HOW... I'm not too sure, but I daresay someone has already provided a brilliant example.
I use them because my dad used them on me to hurt me and I wanted to take that power away from him :D can't use pronouns I like to je called against me!
As someone who uses it/it’s/itself pronouns I just feel more me then when useing any other pronouns and idk it just makes me feel like well me ya know
Because they like them :)
For myself, on rare occasion they/them bothers me however it's typically when I'm at my most dysphoric, so going by it/it's when feeling so bad makes me feel more like just a thing that happens to have a feminine body. 

(I'm pretty sure for myself it's more about disassociation of myself entirely)
For me it's the depersonalization too. Healthy way of doing it and getting that affirmation.
Honestly? It makes me feel good. It just- fits? In a way. Idk how to explain. It's kind of like asking someone why they go by they/them or by she/her, etc. It just makes me feel good about myself.

Okay I'll admit it's also because when people use it/its on me it makes me feel like a mysterious being that you do not use any pronouns on cause it looks just very inhuman. 

I just thought about it, but (for me) it may also be because gender is a very human concept (humans are the ones that really care about it), and when something isn't human, a lot of the times you use it/its on it. And since I don't have a gender, those pronouns make me feel more valid? Somehow? Idk this might just make sense to only me-
Well I use them a lot of days to represent when I feel agender!
I’ve seen people who feel that they/them indicates feeling both genders or somewhere between on that axis, while it/its is for people who take a more “none for me thanks” approach to gender. Idk how common that reasoning is though.
Me personally it's cuz I'm cool with any non-fem pronouns but I prefer neutral pronouns the most, also it's kinda funny like ""Hey can you tell it to speak up a bit""
Ha, same as the “she/her, but like a ship”, which is my current favorite pronoun set for myself.
As someone who is in the non-human community (you may have heard of Therians and Otherkin), it/its pronounced are used more frequently than average there, for the exact reason Moss-drake explains.
Interesting... I read in Braiding Sweetgrass that anishinaabemowin uses they/them for living and natural objects, and it/its for things made by human hands. 

I know this isn't the point of the OP's question, or your reply, but isn't it interesting to ponder whether we trans folks are natural or the product of our own intention?
I take issue with automatically using male pronouns for  animals/bugs/objects, even though I do the same thing. it seems inherently sexist to me-- why is male our default?
There is no apostrophe in the possessive ""its"".
That's a cool reason, never thought of it that way!
This. I use it when I feel safe doing so, but that's not all the time due to some personal circumstances
If you're comfortable answering: whats the difference with they/them? Im having trouble wrapping my head around it/its as pronouns.
That post helped a lot! The way it explains its pronouns makes a lot of sense.
Thank you!
Just wanted to say I really liked how you worded this. “If you like reading things” feels so non-judge-y and like… made me smile? As someone who has a hard time reading things due to ADHD/learning trauma, this was really nice 🥹
I love this angle, like by day you're a human, by night a cryptid, a mysterious force of nature that science is too afraid to define
There is no apostrophe in the possessive ""its"".
There is no apostrophe in the possessive ""its"".
Hahah I love that so much. All I can imagine is:

“How is she doing?”

“Aye, she’s got a good many years left in ‘er yet!”

“That’s good to hear!”
Majestic af
She's Bristol fashion, and I don't mean a hipster.
Yeah I used to ID as therian myself and am good friends with one, so I 100% said that with the expectation that a good chunk of it/its users are therians.
I really like thinking about that. Ultimately we could spend forever defining natural vs unnatural and not get anywhere. I'd say that the history of third genders in cultures certainly implies we're as natural as culture, if uncommon. I'd say that industrialism and christian patriarchy have certainly made what would have been a nonissue in a pre colonial village into a constant struggle for understanding in an uncaring world.

So tldr: I'd say we're as natural as our surroundings. Take of that what you will.
I get it, but it's worth mentioning plenty of unnecessarily gendered languages have a pretty good split of gendering objects (chairs are feminine in french) so it appears to be a largely english thing. I'm pretty sure it dates back to the 18th century. Regardless, it doesn't bother me because I understand it like I do the seperate uses of singular and plural they. He masculine, and he neutral. Doesnt mean it has to be the norm, maybe its better if it wasn't, but it is whats right for me.
Yup! But hey, little typos like that definitely aren't worth editing for because who really cares? Pedants, maybe, but meh.
The only difference is how it feels on you. I use both, but I think ""it"" is a preference.

""It"" feels like ""I don't care about gender""

""They"" feels like ""I'm neutral about gender"" / ""I want to include every gender""

But that's my personal view and pronoun isn't synonym of gender!
> Pedants

Guilty as charged. My partner calls me Stannis. I am coming out as an insufferable grammarian.
Thanks for answering! I realised that 'it' doesn't directly translate as a pronoun in my native language so that might be why I keep being mystified with how to use it/its ('it' does exist but it has different rules and applications than pronouns like he and she)
Same (French here), but I've seen ""it"" quite early when learning English, earlier than singular ""they"". At least, in English, ""it"" is still a singular 3rd person pronoun, so it's easy to use if you know how to use ""he"" and ""she"". ""They"" was more confusing, for me (if I should use ""is"" or ""are"", after), but then I remember about the singular ""you"".

Just curious, what's your native language?
It's Dutch! Yeah I was practicing 'it/its' for a bit after commenting above and I realised that English is really fortunate to have such simple pronouns, only a bit plural vs singular things, but for neopronouns you just can come up with words and yeet it in a sentence so to speak. 

In dutch I literally had to look up on grammer rules on how to use 'it' as a pronoun before figuring out it's technically a pronoun in dutch but just because the classifications for pronouns are a bit different between languages, you can't use it like she/he/they. 

Also in dutch the they/them equivalent isn't even mainstream and gramatically accepted yet, so it/its is a bit far away in dutch oof
That's interesting! And same, in french, we have some weird ass rules, at least in semantic.

In french, we have some ""neutral"" pronouns. (""Neutral"" in french is masculine, because there are two semantic genders (for objects and people), oof. So if a group is full of women but with one man, this will count as a masculine group. This language has sexist roots... or branches)

We have ""ça"" but it's used for concepts or situations. Otherwise, we have ""on"" which is grammatically ""he/she"" (3rd singular person), but semantically ""we"". It can be used as an non-personal pronoun, like a generic phrase (equivalent to non-personal ""you"" for proverbs, for example)

So using these for neutral is not something we can do. However, in old-french, we had ""el"" or ""al"" for neutral but is not used anymore. Last year, ""iel"" (a mix or ""il"" (masculine) and ""elle"" (feminine)) was added in a popular dictionary for neutral pronoun. A victory for a latin language where everything is binary gendered!
Interesting! In dutch words are either gendered or non-gendered. 'de' for gendered (so both feminine and masculine words) 'het' for non-gendered words. 

Difficulty is that 'het' is also the translation for the english 'it', so you can use 'het' as a neutral pronoun, but only when referring to non-gendered words. 

You can say: 'I paint the house, it looks nice' 
But you can't say: 'I paint the chair, it looks nice' 

House is non-gendered, chair is gendered. When you use the second 'it' in the chair sentence you actually refer to the painting itself and not to the chair, which is why I keep falling over it/its in english because I keep assuming 'it' refers to other things than people. 

On top of that 'its' just doesn't exist, you need to use 'his' which is neutral then because it refers to a neutral word.

Is 'iel' used in french? El or al sounds cool too
That's good to know!

>On top of that 'its' just doesn't exist, you need to use 'his' which is neutral then because it refers to a neutral word.

Funny thing is that english also lack of the ""his""/""hers"" equivalent for ""it"". You can say ""This is my ball"" as ""This is its ball"". But you can't say ""This ball is mine"" as ""This ball is ~~its~~"". You have to say a name or a noun. ""This ball is the dog's / The ball is u/Dragenby's""

""iel"" isn't used by standard people. Only LGBT and feminist communities use ""iel"". Maybe in some decades it will be use officially
Why can't you say 'The ball is its'? You can say 'The ball is his' and I thought his = its in this case?
Yeah, but there's a difference between :

1. His / Her / Its (Her ball)
2. His / Hers / ~~Its~~ (The ball is hers)

""Its"" only exists for the first case, not the second one. You can however avoid that and say ""The ball belongs to him/her/it""

Oooh I get it, thanks! To be fair language is dynamic, if we'd all start using his/hers/its it'd become a thing soon enough."	w3krzv	NonBinary	89	0.95	2022-07-20 12:12:36
My Workplace's Inclusivity Project is Regressive and Terrible!	"My workplace is pissing me off.  They're trying to be inclusive but they're doing it in ways that are the complete opposite!



As part of championing diversity, my workplace has begun a so-called Gender Intelligence Initiative.  Frankly, it's horrifying.  The entire premise is a gender-essentialist exercise in biological determinism - think ""men are from Mars, women from Venus"" levels of bad parading as so-called equality.  It revolves around the idea that men and women are in some ways fundamentally different and uses stereotypes as examples.  They literally included the well-debunked ""female brain at rest"" vs ""male brain at rest"" CT scans in the presentation.  The talks and information presented was so bad that it literally led to people saying things like ""so that's why my husband never listens!  Hahaha men!"" and ""see I told you women never make any sense!"".  



They presented a made-up and exaggerated example of a bell curve difference in men and women, and I don't even know how to being yelling that There Is No Single Bell Curve For Who You Are!  If you get tested for spacial awareness, visual tendencies and all the other things we bell-curve by gender you may trend in a certain direction in some of them but chances are if you average out all of them you may well end up more vaguely defined in the middle damnit!  We don't know!  And we still don't have a conclusive nature vs nurture answer on any of this!  To say nothing of Gender not being the same bloody thing as sex!


 
At first I thought it was just going to be like what most employers do around these sort of times - a bunch of talks and presentations about how We Value Inclusivity followed by business-as-usual.  So I ignored it.  But now it seems like this is something that people in my office are trying to take forward and to start building ideas around.  
 


I don't know how to explain that their attempt to be Gender Intelligent and inclusive is actually making me feel excluded and unsafe without outing myself.  If this is the direction the company is moving in then being public about my gender identity being constructed mostly from vague hand-wavey gestures and shrugging would probably be an unsafe idea.  Frankly, my RadFem Senses are tingling something fierce.


 
Can anyone suggest accessible scientific studies, literature and articles debunking this stuff?  I asked, but the people leading the initiative apparently didn't have direct links to any studies or specific scientific articles, or any recorded sources to link me to, or I'd already be sitting here with a highlighter pen working on it all!"

**Sex differences in psychology**

Sex differences in psychology are differences in the mental functions and behaviors of the sexes, and are due to a complex interplay of biological, developmental, and cultural factors. Differences have been found in a variety of fields such as mental health, cognitive abilities, personality, and tendency towards aggression. Such variation may be both innate or learned and is often very difficult to distinguish. Modern research attempts to distinguish between such differences, and to analyze any ethical concerns raised.

***

**Causes of transsexuality**

The study of the causes of transsexuality investigates gender identity formation of transgender people, especially those who are transsexual. Transsexual people have a gender identity that does not match their assigned sex, often resulting in gender dysphoria. The causes of transsexualism have been studied for decades.

The most studied factors are biological.

Can I vent for a minute about my child's experience?	"My 6yo came out as non-binary. He uses what she calls ""mixed up"" pronouns. She's been saying he's not a boy or a girl for over a year, and put a lot of thought into it. 

Nearly everyone in my child's life has been warm and positive about their identity, so I feel like I can't complain when I know other people have it so much worse, but... I also really want to vent for a minute.

1. My kid went back to dressing like their AGAB for a while after other kids were rude and it breaks my heart, but I am really anxious about accidentally putting pressure on her to wear something so I'm trying to leave the ball in her court. She wore GNC clothing yesterday, though, and the other kids were cool, so fingers crossed that he gets back into it because she seemed so much happier in it.*

2. My FIL sent easter candy labeled ""HAPPY EASTER DEADNAME"" when he's never ever ever sent candy with a specific name on it before. He apologized, and maybe I should let it go, but I'm still mad.

3. I'm trying not to obsess over this aspect of my kid's life but with all the anti-trans bills it's hard not to focus on it.

4. My child said that they wanted to do something that physically their AGAB can't do (extremely specific narrow case) and I hated having to explain that the science isn't there yet to make that happen. Crushing a kid's dreams is never fun.

5. I am trying to give my kid space for this to be permanent and space for this to be a phase, if that makes sense. Just validating who she says he is and not trying to plan her future for him. I realized that I would be embarrassed if my kid announced that they weren't non-binary after all and I'm trying to let that go - so what if they change? We all change.




(* Yes I know, boys can wear skirts and girls can wear cargo pants, but realistically there are gendered associations with certain clothing.)"	"It always makes me happy to see such supportive parents. Sounds like you have your kids best interests in mind. We need more parents like you around.
I have a little non-binary kid too and I definitely hear you on all this. Mine goes very much for femme-styled clothing and it's difficult for people to disassociate that from using she/her. They're in a support group a social worker from the school district runs and even the binary trans kids in there do it regrettably often. Letting it both be permanent and potentially a phase is something I try to keep in mind too. I worry that the overwhelming number of people who use she/her for them even when they really really should know better will eventually make them think they should just use those pronouns and/or identify as a girl, and I'd struggle a lot if they did decide they were a girl because it'd be so hard to tell whether it was completely, idk, authentic or intended as self-protection.
I'm sorry that had to happen to the both of you! People can be asses. From my perspective, you're doing an amazing job for your child!
You're doing great!  I'm an adult but my mom thinks I'm being dramatic and attention seeking by identifying this way.  It's so nice to see you show so much empathy for your kid. <3
Thank you for posting this.  I'm a parent of a 13 yo NB kiddo and have just begun encountering the same frustrations and situations.  

 *Just validating who she says he is and not trying to plan her future for him.* 

Gonna use this as my mantra this week.
I really sucks to have your child treated unfairly, and you have every right to be annoyed, frustrated, or upset by it. Just keep being the awesome, supportive parent you are and keep advocating for your awesome kid!
I think you’re doing a great job he’s lucky to have you there’s an artist called DJ sprinkles who makes beautiful music and uses the same changing pronouns
I think you’re doing a great job as a parent! You’re being supportive and letting your kid explore without feeling like they have to stick to anything or worry about losing your acceptance. I’ve been out to my own parents for four years now and they still get mad at me for trying to correct them on my preferred pronouns. I honestly think that just knowing that you are there for him and accept her as he is going to mean more and more to them as she gets older. You’re forming a health perspective on gender and individuality early on and even if other people in his life try to force her to be something she isn’t, you’re what he’s going to remember most.
Have you heard of the One Bad Mother podcast? Biz has 2 non-binary kiddos, 6 and 11 I think. I'm NB myself and found those conversations wholesome and hopeful"	mutdsa	NonBinary	82	0.97	2021-04-20 15:50:37
the cis are at it again	"my professor just started BUCKLING DOWN HARD on using the ""average FEMALE and MALE"" as examples of communication styles. Like, hardcore old school type thinking-- e.g. ""men always want to solve the problem, females will just want to listen"" or ""women LOVE talking just to talk""

i IMMEDIATELY tuned out. So fucking annoying. Im out in every part of my life and she tried to pick on me to get me to explain why I looked so annoyed, but she was obviously doing it in a really ""calling you out"" type of way, so I didnt even unmute my mic. Just looked at her with a blank face and shook my head.

so tired of the cis. Im so gd tired... why the hell does this type of thing happen EVERY DAY. IM SO TIRED. KEEP YOUR BINARY AWAY FROM ME"	"I absolutely hate teachers that use their platform as a soap box and then target students who are in disagreement. 

I had a teacher who did this with literally every type of bigotry you can imagine. 

Me, nonbinary trans man, and the only black student were constantly called out on ""what we think"" or ""why were making that face"" when he would say shit like white people recieve more racism than any other race, or some ""not all men"" bs, and even using phrases like tr*nny. It was ridiculous.

It's both an abuse of the position and abuse of power. To take away from actual education to push your outdated and bigoted views and to target students when you know that they are in a substantially lower position than you- especially when theyre also a minority. It quite frankly can cause danger.
[deleted]
I hated gender stereotype bullshit when I was 13 and knew nothing about more than 2 genders existing, I can't imagine dealing with this nowadays.
Yikes. I came out to pretty much every teacher in high school. None of them used my pronouns, but I figured it was worth a shot. This one English teacher was talking about pronouns and how they can only be plural. She always looked at me while stressing that. I’m from Alabama, so the bigotry is strong. A lot of my classmates and teachers joked about gay and trans people everyday, so that was fun.(note the sarcasm)
holy fuck now all these older cishet people are making fun of the tide pod challenge, I am ACTUALLY in hell today, get me the fuck out of here
if he was speaking about those things SOCIETALLY then I kinda get where they were coming from, but BIOLOGICALLY this is infuriating bullshit 100% of the way
[deleted]
its the worst 😓 especially because I run into those teachers a little TOO often

I choose my professors really carefully bc I am such an easily targeted person for so many reasons, and it hurts a lot when I hear a lot of good stuff about a teacher only to interact with them personally.... and realize all those reviews about them were either from people who are way too willing to overlook bigotry, or really willfully ignorant people. Like, if I was ever to complain about this person, I likely would get NOT sympathy unless I could find another LGBTQ+ peep to talk to

thats why I come here n_n you may not know who Im talking about specifically, but the fact people can relate helped me climb a couple levels down from my annoyance lol
i just realized how actually fucked school was
RIGHT?! it makes no sense at all when given the slightest bit of thought. It is sooooo reductive to literally everyone involved
for real, I remember rolling my eyes at teachers as early as 5th grade who would say the usual stuff like ""I need some strong boys to help out moving some stuff"" or UGHHHGHGUH all the disgusting comments I see in hindsight from male teachers directed at teen girls

watch my Queer ass move ALL these desks **by myself**
fuuuuuck, that is SO brave of you to do based on just the small info you provided. Coming out is always hard but what youve done definitely took a lot od bravery ❤

Im originally from GA and I could never have imagined trying to come out in high school. Fuck that crusty old lady and her LITERALLY INCORRECT understanding of language
Yeah, I remember when I came out, my English teacher made a point to lecture the entire class on why I was ‘wrong’ about my pronouns. He spent the rest of the year taking a point off my grade for every time I used they/them on an assignment, even in quotes. He said he was trying to get me to ‘break the habit.’
even societally it is all bullshit
Listen don't ask, I had a whole semester of that shit and Everytime he talked about anything relating to misogyny and I countered he'd go ""well you know that includes you too"" (I'm a trans man) and I would literally say yes and he'd roll his eyes.
I'm an educator(albeit early childhood), I just can't imagine using a space where you're meant to help them in their own growth, development, and learning, to manipulate perspectives and target those with differing ones. 

Education isn't meant for that. It's meant for exploration and growth.
I have a hilarious story but its only sort of connected. I went to a school where half our time we did outdoor work it was basically a work study thing. At the time I was 5'4 and 113lbs, we were planting willow stakes to help stabilize a river bank. These bundles of willow stakes were like 20-25lbs. These two boys were trying to show each other up and I was just minding my business carrying normal amounts which was just 1 because they were heavy and we were going very long distances. They made a comment when they thought I wouldn't hear. ""She's not going to carry more than that because she can't."" Mind you I'm non binary but wasnt out as I lived in hillbilly sexist racist garbage land. I went back to the stack and carried 4 bundles two in each arm the rest of the day and these dumb boys were only carrying two trying to show off to each other. Anyway I carried more than half the stack to the bank and they couldn't keep up for their lives. (There's another story where I won 50 bucks opening a water bottle a body builder couldn't open)
Aw, thank you so much! Sorry, I just saw this comment
I am so sorry
well true I don't think that there should be a societal difference between genders I'm a gender abolishionist, but in our current society we can't deny that there is a difference between mannerisms of men and women unfortunately.
YAS, OMFG. i live for these stories xD show those small minded people whats good! Youre my hero
no worries!! life happens xD Its very sweet of you to come back and show your appreciation
I’m sorry too. I at least had a couple friends who were supportive. I can’t imagine having **everyone** around you be so bigoted. I’m glad you’re not in that situation anymore 💕
Not in the way OP's professor was describing. And its such a vast generalization anyway; saying ""women do x"" or ""men do x"" doesn't help anyone and only hurts people. There are billions of men, there are billions of women, and they are all unique and as far as i can see, all the things people say are different between men and women are highly exaggerated and then projected onto the whole population when it doesn't represent them at all. Noticing patterns is fine, but that's almost never what is actually happening with people like op's professor. What she was saying are literally just dumb stereotypes that do nothing but enforce the binary. Binary cis society has an obsession with dividing men and women as much as possible, looking as hard as they can for differences that arent really there, so they can keep defining them as ""opposites"". And where are we left, as nonbinary people? We've probably never even crossed the minds of the people that spout this stuff.
My water bottle story isn't as cool because i only opened a water bottle but I got 50 bucks because idiots thought I wouldn't open it, but I grew up opening bottles and jars after my 6'5 250lb dad who does crossfit like I can open jars he can't. I won that money so easily it was the best.
No prob!
I mean, I had a few supportive friends and even another enby who I was romantically interested in and I was pretty sure they felt the same way about me, but we lost contact. My sister’s super supportive. I’m in community college right now, still the same area
I feel kinda bad bc I agree with you guys that the generalizations are vastly bad I'm just saying that potentially i see the point that could have been being made to preface further discussion but I believe what OP did was correct :')
but stillllllllll the satisfaction of proving them wrong for their BASELESS ASSUMPTIONS. you mentioned youre a fairly small person so I just love imagining the looks on their faces when you pop the lid off like its nothing xD
I wear rubber bands on my wrists partially to assist with like work where you have to loosen tight things so technically I had assistance but I offered them the advice and they wouldn't take it to open the bottle. Plus half of them just made fun of my classmate who is a body builder and won a few competitions for it. They all were picking fun at him and I just gave him one of my rubber bands and explained how to do it lol. You gotta know the tricks"	okwing	NonBinary	86	1.0	2021-07-15 16:35:59
I’m kinda sad that I’m not non-binary.	"I know the title seems really weird, but let me explain.

For the past year or two, I’ve kinda questioned my gender identity, after hearing about non-binary online. Growing up, I didn’t mind playing with girl toys despite being a boy. But now I’m alright with being male, but may still like some stuff that many people consider “for girls” like pastels, dolls, the color pink, etc.

So after hearing about non-binary identities, I tried experimenting with different labels, such as gender fluid, bigender, agender (because then I felt like I didn’t understand and/or care about having a gender) and demiboy (because I still felt somewhat masculine).

However, as time went on, I started thinking I’m not non-binary, and that I may actually be cisgender male, because I’ve gotten used to being treated as a man and when I check my gender on online surveys I choose male because if I chose other, it wouldn’t feel right. Yet I also feel kinda sad that I’m not non-binary. I don’t know why, but part of me sorta wishes I was somewhere on the non-binary spectrum. I sometimes feel like I think I could be non-binary, when I might actually be seeking validation from others. Plus I feel like I don’t always think, behave, or feel like a man, so I don’t know what to do.

If you could offer to give me advice in the comments, please feel free to do so. Thank you!"	"Guess what, no one gets to choose your gender except for you 😊 

If it makes you feel any better, the whole concept of things being inherently masculine or feminine is made up...


Being nonbinary can seem freeing because you're not tied to the binary system. Well guess what? You spent all that time thinking about this stuff. You can use all that effort and be your true self. That's what matters most! 

Even you're cis, you can still act on those desires you have and be the man you want to be, rather than the man you were assigned to be.
i think the number one thing to remember is that we live in a world where bullshit expectations are what keep us held to that feeling of whats right as a man, woman, enby, etc. know that there is no right way to be non-binary or a man or a woman or genderfluid or anything for that matter. be kind to yourself and explore your gender identity personally or privately first and experiment with things other than pronouns and tests. try on fem/androgynous clothing or makeup! try wigs or growing your hair out even. if any of this is something you feel comfortable exploring, i seriously encourage you to try it. even so, being a feminine or androgynous male is absolutely and completely okay. don’t let anyone make you feel differently.
That sounds like a very non binary thought pattern to me. I struggled with some of those thoughts too, and I am indeed non binary. If you're not, that's 100% okay. But I don't think cis people are sad that they're not an enby
One thing I forgot to add is that while I don’t really feel like a certain gender, I still identify as male. And as I mentioned before, if I’m not non-binary, why am I kinda sad about being cisgender?
Wanting to be nonbinary is sometimes a symptom of being nonbinary btw
You might find this book helpful: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34138367-you-and-your-gender-identity. Sounds like maybe you still have some thinking to do, even if it’s just to confirm to yourself that you are actually cis. Best of luck on your journey <3
Lots of nonbinary folk identify as their assigned gender at birth in addition to acknowledging there's more to their gender.  You dont have to use different pronouns to be nonbinary.  You don't have to present any differently to be nonbinary.  Being nonbinary doesn't have to mean any more than you want it to mean.  I still mark F on most forms because it's just easier when I live in a state that doesn't recognize any markers other than M or F.  You don't have to dislike who you are to be able to become a better version of you.
It's so important to do self discovery. And if at the end of it you come back understanding yourself more but also learning that you are cis. That's not a bad thing. You can then go forward more assure of your identity than before, and that's okay. 

It seems like you might still be working things out right now, and that's okay too. You don't have to get everything exactly right all the time. Labels can be fluid, and that doesn't necessarily mean you were wrong for using certain ones that you find don't fit in the future.

I wish you the best in your journey, wherever you find yourself.
Aside from everything that has already been said and I fully agree that you are the only one who gets to decide/define your gender. 
I was wondering if you have spaces around you where you can explore healthy masculinity without judgement? It can be difficult to define our gender if we don't have spaces to experiment and you are still ""allowed"" to be masculine and male-presenting if you are non-binary. Anyways, I'd recommend r/bropill for a trans inclusive space that's very chill about masculinity.
You can be a dude who likes whatever he likes. Tonnes of men like different sorts of things and they're still men.
You could be a gender non-conforming cis male. Either way, there's nothing wrong with being cisgender, and there's no wrong way to be a male, cis or otherwise.

Just focus on being true to yourself and don't worry about trying to label yourself. Maybe somewhere along the line you'll discover something different about your gender. Or maybe you won't. All that matters is that you're kind to yourself and others.
Fwiw, there was a time when I thought I was ""a man ig"", but also wasn't afraid of ""women's"" activities: cooking and sewing especially. However, I was nervous someone might call me out on it, so I spent who knows how much energy coming up with various defenses in my head, just in case. It wasn't until after I came out to myself that that layer of noise went away.

Nowadays, my transition is progressing well, and I've started accidentally ""blending in"" with women. I'm non-binary (demigirl+a bunch more), but I do present femme more often than not, and it's just easier to stick to using the women's restroom or not speak up when I'm called a lady by a stranger. It can make me wonder if I'm actually just binary trans sometimes.

At a different end of a spectrum, I know someone who identifies as a man, uses he/him pronouns, speaks with a deep voice, and maintains a light stubble, but also prefers titles like Mx/Majesty/Mistrum to Mr/King/Master, wears heels regularly, and might even transition if there were fewer trade-offs. None of it's a philosophical stance either, and I know he's put the work into self-discovery and isn't an egg. He just says he's non-conforming, and all these things about him are what he finds most comfortable and natural.

So, you can have a lot of binary traits and still be non-binary, or a lot of non-binary traits and still be binary. Gender is weird and confusing, but if ""non-binary"" helps you understand yourself, that's what counts. You don't have to check any other boxes.

Oh, and you may have heard of these already, but you might just need the right masc-aligned name, smth like: demiman, neoman, boyprincess, and there's assuredly more that I don't know about
i can’t really give you advice, but you experimented with things and that’s awesome, you can always try new things to experiment this gender idea, it’s okay if you decide you’re a male too. speaking from my own experience i am also really confused right now if i am a trans girl or a non binary person, but i’m young and i have time to figure it out, and if i never figure it out it’s okay too, i’m just gonna try to live my best life
Hey :) it's absolutely okay. You don't need to have a certain gender to do and like whatever you want. A big part of nb for me is the realisation that there's no recipe, no ingredientlist, nothing you can't like or must do, to cook up your gender. If you like playing with dolls so what? Says *nothing* about your gender. Like wearing particular clothes that are ascribed to certain genders *by society*?! Doesn't make you less or more anything except yourself. Please think of gender as a fundamentally stupid thing.
You sound like me a few years ago.  


All I can say is this: Cis people don't generally say things like this, lol. Sure, you had a masculine upbringing and don't mind masculine labels, but you don't want to be a cis male... which isn't something cis males would ever relate to.  


As I've gone along, I've found that slowly taking steps towards looking what I want to look like, gender regardless, has helped me become more comfortable with the idea of being nonbinary. Grow your hair out, get your ears pierced, buy some more pink clothes. Try whatever you want to try without worrying about whether it's too masculine or feminine for you. Gender expression is way more important for your identity than any labels. Heck, I'm still not sure of what label to pick half the time and I still put male on most documents just to be safe. The internet might have you believe that being nonbinary is a declarative thing, where you must separate yourself from your birth gender entirely. It's not nearly that performative.
I thought this title said you were sad about being nonbinary. 😅

Re: what it actually says: Just because you were AMAB and you don't always object to male terms *DOES NOT* mean that you have to be cis/binary-gendered. You can be nonbinary and still use your AGAB terms sometimes, even be comfortable with that. 🤷 

Pretty sure most cis people I know aren't sad about being their AGAB. 🤔 Frustrated by challenges the world forces on them due to their gender, sure, but not sad.
There are identities like demi-boy and nonbinary man that might be a good fit for you! If you are a cis man, I'm so proud of you for exploring your identity, that's something many cis men are too insecure to do. But if you're this interested and invested in non binary identities, it's pretty likely you are gender non conforming! There's a million different ways to express and explore your gender. Think about David Bowie- a very gender queer individual who identified as a cis male, but still explored his gender expression his whole life, expressing femininity AND masculinity. Don't gatekeep yourself from a community if it feels good to be in it. There is room for you here!
Gender nonconforming cis people are a welcome part our community.
My advice is one day when your not to busy go sit on your bed and do nothing but just thinking about that and then you might come to conclusion, I wish you luck.
You're the only one who gets to define your gender.  You know yourself more than anyone else, and ""wanting to be nonbinary"" is... a sign of being nonbinary lol.  There's no application you have to fill out, no membership fee, no exam, nothing.  If you find yourself wishing you were nonbinary, chances are good you're nonbinary already.  That's literally all there is to it.

It took me an embarrassingly long time to wrap my head around that concept and I still have imposter syndrome over my identity occasionally, but I'm pretty solid in my self identity overall at this point.  I don't look, sound, or act any different than I used to, I'm still the same person, but I understand myself better.  And ever since it clicked I have these flashbacks to the most blindingly obvious signs I have always been nonbinary, such as the glee I got whenever anyone would say ""I couldn't tell you were a girl at first"" when I was a kid for example.
Unfortunately social media has people divided and confused “If you do XYZ, then you’re non binary/non cis” when people are young they often do want validation (not necessarily a bad thing) but this has become an easy way to do it. There’s nothing wrong with being a man and having feminine traits/ideas or ways of thinking, but yeah you’re probably not NB
You might be a nonbinary man, demiboy, genderfluid ranging from agender to cis dude, or just genderqueer which includes all the above along with gender nonconforming cis people. 

Honestly you don't have to label it at all if you don't want to but you're the only one who gets to decide what gender you are.
i think the way you express gender feels different than how you feel your gender is? like you maybe feel like a male but because you don’t like typically masculine things or don’t feel a connection. 

BUT remember that gender is a spectrum, you don’t necessarily need a label. maybe legally you’re male but who knows what you feel. you’re still figuring things out and that’s okay. 

i remember when I realised I wasn’t a lesbian, I was also sad, it felt like apart of me was missing and a part of my identity was gone. but i got used to the fact that i wasn’t a lesbian and i’m totally okay with that now, even though it took a while. you could be in this stage.

just sit on it for a while, don’t analyse how you feel for a bit and just be nothing. you’re just existing. i know you want to figure it out right now, but doing nothing and not labelling yourself IS apart of the process. you’ve got all the time in the world :)
I've been out as genderqueer for like 16 years and I still do not enjoy checking ANY gender boxes on forms, even when they have nonbinary options that make me happy they're available but still uncomfortable checking them. I don't wanna check your fucking box, Susan; stop asking people their gender when it doesn't fucking matter! Also I feel like I'm going to be singled out, or sometimes systems allow for Other boxes but then stop functioning if you actually use them / if they don't match your legal ID. So. Not liking that is not necessarily a disqualifier. Nor is feeling okay in your body or history, or even assigned gender if it's part but not all of you. Keep exploring until you feel right. Even if you don't choose the label, now or ever, you can sit at the enby table if you're looking for validation and people to have your back. The gender binary hurts nonbinary people, but it also hurts people with binary identities but gender nonconforming interests (see: almost everyone, until the world beats it out of them), and I will fucking FIGHT it for you.
I think this can be hard advice but sometimes I personally find the most clarity when I step back from spaces that talk a lot about gender (both in negative and positive lights). When we have too much of a spotlight focus on an issue it's hard to see what's there without any external pressure or forcing anything from the inside based on that. I kinda move back and forth between it and find myself more at ease when I step away from defining myself too acutely, or at least lessening the emphasis of labels. While I do love non-binary friendly spaces as I am an NB myself I find too much talk around gender can be overwhelming. For me it is part of who I am but it doesn't define me. Something that helps me is finding NB or genderqueer related media that has genderqueer people but the topic itself isn't discussing gender.  


One idea that helped me a lot is that labels should work for us, we shouldn't work for the labels. However you feel and whatever label you pick, at the end of the day you are you:)
Lots of good perspective and guidance here. Something to add that’s vital: patience. You don’t have to figure it out all at once or immediately. It sounds like you still have feelings to work through. Maybe you will come down on the cis side of things, but you don’t have to. You’re not signing a contract forever. You’re figuring it out. Try to be open and honest with your feelings and your questions and your searching. It’s OK to figure it all out as you go. In the meantime be as true to yourself and who you are as you can possibly manage.
The gender umbrella is very complex and tries to be as inclusive as possible. After all, this is what the LGBT community wants the most: inclusion and acceptance. The way you describe I believe you'd be gender nonconforming and if you want a more specific label it sounds like fingender (one who's naturally feminine but is not necessarily a woman)
You can choose to be non binary. 
I recognise your feelings. 

For me being non binary means refusing to put female or male as a label on myself. It’s an act of rebellion against others who always thought U was too much like a guy sometimes or too much like a woman etc. 
So now I am like: 

You know what? Fuck you society. I am non binary and I refuse to be anything but just human and me. 

You can do whatever u want and be whoever u want. 

Be non binary if that is what you WANT and what makes you more happy.

i can kind of relate to this in a way, because i had a similar experience of feeling sad that i may not actually fit into the LGBTQ+. 

My story: I always identified as pansexual and genderfluid, but I had a relationship with someone who was also genderfluid that was so terrible i believed that i was not actually pansexual or genderfluid (although come to think of it, i also had my doubts that i was pan when i was in love with a straight cis man too). It’s disappointing thinking you’ve found a label that describes you and a community that will accept you, only to come to the conclusion that it may not actually be the case and you’ve been a fraud and have to remove yourself from the identity and community. I’m not sure if your situation will mirror mine, but eventually i fell deeply in love with a cis girl and that reinvigorated my identity as genderfluid and pansexual. I know people always say you don’t have to have experience to know your sexuality, but having confirmation helped me feel more confident in presenting as pan. And i hated how much i confused people with my gender identity so much that some days I would just accept that no one sees me the way i would like to be seen and it’s just easier to present in a way everyone is familiar with. but when i’m alone, there’s just NO denying the euphoria i feel of switching through genders, the way i dress, the way i act, the way i think is all so undeniably genderfluid and I keep returning back to that no matter how many times i think i might be cis or trans. And at the end of the day, even though i absolutely attribute so much importance to it, it really is just semantics. If the worst thing I am is confusing, I think i’m doing okay.

tldr; i doubted that i was pansexual and genderfluid until i met someone that made me feel certain about those identities.

Idk if this applies to your situation or if you feel the same things i did, and i don’t want to put pressure on you to present a certain way, but i’m just throwing the idea around that you may just be going through a period of self-doubt. Your identity can fluctuate, and it’s a journey to discover yourself. I think the fact that you’ve put so much thought into this and you’re grieving that loss of being non-binary means something that’s not quite cis, even if there isn’t really a label for it. Anytime I thought things like this I would have to remind myself: cis people don’t think about things like this that deeply if at all. Of course, I could be WAY off base here and you could absolutely find pride in being a cis man that wants to overcome gender norms, and i think that is extremely cool and admirable. My favorite celebrities are cis men that love pink and fashion and otherwise “feminine” things. I’d say the best thing you can do is exactly what you’re doing right now, talking about it, especially with other queer people, and experimenting to find whatever makes you feel most like you. I think we sometimes put too much pressure on ourselves to choose something, and how can we not when society literally wants us to check off boxes for ourselves! I really wish we could answer with something more like “still in the process of discovering myself” lol. Maybe someday! Just try not to be too hard on yourself 💖 whatever you identify as, there is one thing for certain: you sound really cool!
The specific label you take doesn't matter, even if that means you're most comfortable just saying your cis and just like feminine stuff also. 

You don't need to be sad no matter what label fits you best it's just a description. As long as you respect the labels of others youre good in my book. 

And the nonbinary spectrum is very expansive you're always welcome if you feel not 100% male or female even if you actually feel 99% male or female. That still makes you non-binairy.
Non binary does not equal androgyny. Non binary also does not mean that you can't present yourself as male. If nonbinary feels right to you, then go for it! 

I struggled with this exact thing, and held off on using nonbinary as a label because I didn't feel like I was ""nonbinary enough"". But the thing about gender is that it has nothing to do with how others think of you, or their opinions, but how you feel. Not to mention, you only have one life, and you can do whatever you want with it. If you want to identify as nonbinary, if you feel that it fits you, go for it! Don't forsake your own discomfort because you feel like you're not ""xyz"" enough. 

Lastly... Cis people don't wish they were another gender 😉

- A transmasc nonbinary
Don't worry about norms.

Almost four billion of the worlds population are male. 4 billion.

Every man is different. Maybe you're nonbinary, maybe you're not. You will see in time. But whether you're a man or an enby, you have one life.

So fuck the gender norms bullshit and LIVE IT.
I often find myself going through periods of self doubt feeling similar. Then my depression and anxiety are a bit more manageable and I think maybe I am a trans man, and then I am much better again and I realise, yea I am still nonbinary, this is just part of me figuring out my feelings with social pressures to be “binary”.
Be proud of who you are, regardless. You took time for introspection which is more than what most do. That's a person who'd I want around.
Liking girls toys doesn’t a non-binary make. It’s about the euphoria you feel while presenting (whether with your name, pronoun, your appearance or voice) as nonbinary - versus the feeling of when everyone assumes you’re a man. Some people are nonbinary who are fine with presenting the exact same physically but they need their pronouns changed, some are fine with their pronouns but need to dress a certain way or change their name to feel at peace with themselves. It’s really down to you and what makes you happy. 

It’s also not your fault that forms demand us to choose between male and female - it can feel more comfortable to pick the one you currently present as than say you’re a woman which may also not be true. 

It’s really all about how you see yourself, what you’d be if everybody got reintroduced to you as a new person and didn’t remember who you were before. Little stuff like what toys you liked, what box you tick on forms and behaviours society sees as masc or femme - lots of cis people bend those rules so it’s not really about that so much.

I hope you find your truth about it all :)
I guess just remember that being non binary is a spectrum inside the gender spectrum and you can easily fit in it even if you don't particularly identify with any particular label inside of it.  


There is no specific way to be non binary. Don't beat yourself up over not feeling or being a certain way. Your confusion is valid and I myself can relate to it and I identify as non-binary. I guess just remember that being non binary isn't well binary even if it feels like that sometimes.
The way I see gender, the labels are just to help others understand. If gender is a spectrum, we ALL lie somewhere on it. The point is you are not confined to age old ways of thinking on subjects such as gender and sexuality. Be yourself; label it if that feels good for you, and most importantly, don’t worry about what others think. This is your experience, so live it true and to your fullest!

Hope this helps ☺️
gender expression =/= gender identity, express however you feel comfortable friend
Because you are struggling with internalized gender norms and toxic masculinity.  If you're not happy being a cis man because of what society expects of you, then... don't.
I think it's really important to distinguish 3 things. 

1. Bodily form, genetics etc, that's what is *sex*,  it's a spectrum with many different bodies from male over intersex to female, and all are valid, and say nothing about your gender.

2. Societal norms that are expected of you because of these bodily forms. That's what was called *gender* half a century ago. People seeing female forms thought ""woman"" and attributed all sorts of expectational bullshit to it. That's the gender that's been fought by 2nd wave feminism, aka ""gender norms""

3. I've never read about it, and i don't think it has a name yet. But there is an feeling inside many of us that says ""I'm a woman/man/x"". It's that intrinsic feeling that hasn't yet a name but is often confusingly also called gender in the last 20 years or so. Many people have that. It's what trans people mean when they say ""I am a ...!"" Some have it, some don't, like me.

If we mix these up problems ensue. And if you say you don't feel like a certain gender, do you mean the third? And if you say you identify as male do you mean the first? Because that is how i feel and I'm non binary.

Please note that this is how i make sense of stuff. I am convinced I'm inaccurate somewhere here, and possibly even wrong. I mean no harm,  this just makes the most sense to me. If you want to make me a smarter person and help me make *better* sense of stuff please don't assume I'm an enemy. I just wanna make sense for me.
Ok, no one hate me please, but I think you might be struggling because you’re thinking all these terms identify some real essence rather than just being our best human guesses at how to communicate ideas with one another. The words are not a gateway to finding the gender inside you. Whoever you are can be expressed in different ways. You’re just looking for the way that will work best for you. Who you are will stay the same no matter what words you choose
I mean, male is your biological sex, whereas gender is man/woman. Being non-binary doesn’t mean that you’re not male, and you can enjoy your body and how it works without subscribing to binary gender. I’m perfectly happy with being female, but have no desire to be treated like a woman. I just don’t feel like my body parts and DNA have anything to do with who I am as a person. I don’t think they should dictate how I act, what clothes/make up I should wear, or how people treat me. I’m just me, and the biology of my body is distinct from the thoughts of my brain. Not all non-binary people feel the same way (obviously), but to me personally I describe myself as non-binary because I don’t vibe with a specific gender.
Lol I agree :) I wanted to be NB and now I am.
When I first came out as nb, I thought that meant that I should be attracted to both men and women. This was not exactly the case and I ended up putting myself through some traumatic events before I came to that realization. Trust your gut, you’re not wrong and by no means should you let a biased computer program tell you any different! ❤️"	z2dydn	NonBinary	83	0.95	2022-11-23 03:23:27
Just had a conversation with my mom about gender	"So, I was texting my mom (who already knows I'm enby, btw), and we got to a point where she was like, ""So, what does that mean again?"" I explained the gender spectrum, the difference between sex and gender, and my thoughts on gender as a whole. Then she follows up with, ""Does anyone ever feel like both genders at the same time? I've always felt pretty masc/fem and never really thought anything about it.""

So now I'm freaking out, cuz my mom just lowkey came out to me as bigender. I'm so friggin excited! Maybe more than I should be, but still! 😖😍"	"This is so cute, and I 10000% feel you on being SO EXCITED. I still remember when my mom took me out to dinner to tell me she was dating a woman after divorcing my dad. She was so nervous but I literally screamed I was so excited, haha.
This is really cute, but I'm also pretty excited! If anything more in the topic please update!  (if you want to ofc, no actually need I'm just interested^^) it always makes me happy learning about other LGBTQ+ people's discovery journeys ^^
I had a similar experience! I was talking on the phone to my mom, just explaining stuff about gender (not out, because not really done with questioning) and I wanted to explain how cis people just ""know"" the answer to the question ""are you a (wo)man?"" and I asked her what she would answer if I asked her if she was a woman... Silence... She did not seem to want to elaborate more so we just talked about gender in generall after that, but I had not expected that!
That reminds me of the time I told my mum I was pansexual, and she asked what that meant. I explained and she looked at me and went ""But that's how everyone feels, no? Like, the gender of the person doesn't matter at all. You just like them or you don't.""
Me: ""Uhm, for most people the gender does matter though.""
Mum: ""it doesn't for me.""
Me: ""Mum, you.. You're pan!""
Mum: ""uhm... I mean i guess???""

I was like 😱🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg, yes! That's adorable! It takes a lot of courage to tell someone something so personal when you're not sure how they'll react. I hope your mom is happier now than she's ever been! ❤
Oh, sure! I don't mind updating, but I'm not sure what more will come of it. I was just excited that my mom was able to put a name to something she's felt most of her life. She already presents pretty nb, imo. If anything else comes up, I'll be happy to update tho. 🙂
It really does!! I'm so happy you have a supportive parent and now you can give them advice!! :) 

Thank you!! They got married about a month ago and they are disgustingly adorable, haha! <3
Haha, i kinda hope that didn't sound too awkward, i didn't know really how to say it... But yeah! Finally finding a name for a feeling you couldn't quite understand for a long time feels amazing, I'm really happy for her ^^
Not at all! I appreciate your enthusiasm! I just meant that I might not have much of an update, lol. My mom lives in a different state, so I don't see her all the time. If anything interesting comes up, I'll definitely post an update, tho. :3"	in41fz	NonBinary	83	0.98	2020-09-05 16:27:44
let me try to explain my gender	"I’m Non-binary, i use They/them pronouns and i’m very feminine presenting, I’m AFAB as well. but i wish i was AMAB but still feminine because i want to wear a dress but i don’t want to look like a g*rl when i do. When i wear a dress i want people to see me like when Harry Styles wears a dress. I love my chest and identify with it so i don’t want top or bottom surgery and love being feminine but how do i look like i’m a feminine man to achieve true gender euphoria 

do you see the problem"	"I'm like the exact flip of this, AMAB and when I wear cargo shorts and a flannel I want people to see me like a butch lesbian.
I understand the problem and how a lot of people probably don't understand what you mean.

Maybe you could try to using makeup to make your face more muscular? Or getting a more mascular haircut could help.

What really helped me feel better in my body was gaining muscles. People started commenting how my shoulders got wider and my back looks really masculine. So maybe that could help you with that?

Taking T would probably help, too, but from what you described it doesn't sound like a good option for you. (Sorry, if that interpretation is wrong, could be that you totally want that and I'm just assuming wrong things.)

If you don't plan on going on T, you could also do voice training to lower your voice maybe if that's what could help you.

It goes against 'being a feminine man', but you could try to learn a manlier walk and how you sit and things like that. The way you move your body actually makes a ton of a difference in my opinion.

I hope that you'll find a way to express your gender and feel good in your body.

Most importantly: surround yourself with people who understand you and accept you. There's nothing better than having people see you as who you truly are.
Oh big same. I have long hair (with a side shave) and I wrestle with wanting to cut it in a short masc style so that people are more likely to remember my pronouns, and wanting to keep it long because I love how long hair looks on guys. I love femininity, but not always when it makes me look like A Woman.
I relate to this a lot. I want to be feminine in a masculine or “man” way and I want to be masculine in a feminine or “woman” way. I also want to be both and I also want to be neither.
Just want to say that I very much relate to this. I enjoy presenting feminine but don't want to be seen as a woman.
Yes I relate to this so much!!!
Maybe unpopular opinion but a good mullet, maybe some shoulder pads… and some masc-looking boots to pair with the outfit could go a long way!
I see a lot of folks in r/FTMfeminity express this sentiment. 

I also identify as non-binary, and am AFAB and am currently transitioning through HRT and plans for surgery.  

I can't relate to the liking your chest bit... I actually still dont fully understand bring trans without dysphora TBH... but at least once a month I get itch to wear something exceedingly girly.  It feels like drag to me, even though I still don't ""pass"".

Before I get top surgery I've actually had a fantasy of dressing Uber femme, hiding how deep my voice is and seducing some cis guy for night, lol.  But that probably some kind of self sabotage... IDFK.

Gender is weird, you are valid and skirts are hot.  My BF looks ahmaazing in a dress.  Crossdressing is fun, and it's hard for me to do in public anymore and feel true to self but I get compulsion.  

Also,  women's clothing is just plain sexy and more fun in general.
Maybe you can try going to the gym and doing the same routines as men. Woman usually focus on the bottom, you can focus on the top, so your figure can be a little bit more rectangular

And if you don't want to look muscular, maybe don't do too much cardio.
Aahhhh you and I have such a similar gender!
Literally exactly how I feel. It's complicated 😅

(Edit) Wanted to add a bit now that I'm seeing some of the comments about hairstyles. I cut my hair short and dyed it and it helped a lot for people recognizing me as queer in general, still more 'masc girl' presenting rather than the other way around, but it's something. Problem is I really love my long hair too (used to go all the way down to my butt) so I end up going back and forth between short and long every year or two because my hair grows fast and neither look feels quite right. I want to try a viking side shave with man bun type of look sometime and see how that feels, but there's a lot of maintenance needed to keep that kind of style, and I'm not very good with that unfortunately.
One of my lovers exists similarly to this.   They describe their perfect existence as wanting to be a very very pretty boy.  They are currently taking gel based T to blur their default presentation a little.  The gel works slower than injections apparently.  They are as comfortable in a binder and T shirt as they are in sexy fem lingerie.
Omg im like the exact same
i have the same exact issue just flipped. im amab but often find myself wishing i was afab to have the masculine woman look that i just cant reach.
im sure its possible, but it'd take a lot of work considering the unlucky genes i got. my body is basically a forest and shaving is its own sport, thats just one of the many reasons.

i think the best advice i could give is to focus on specific parts of your body. look for clothing that makes your shoulders look more broad, something that slims out your hips a little, just anything that makes your body appear more male.

i dont have a lot but i hope this helped :)
amazing outstanding incredible i love you
Same <3
Oh my god yes.
Relatable
never related to something more
i didn’t say i don’t have dysphoria just not about my chest, and definitely not after i got it pierced, i think it’s awesome now. either way i think it’s totally valid to not have any physical dysphoria for some people changing their name and pronouns is enough to feel like they’re expressing themselves properly and i think that’s amazing 

this also isn’t meant to be rude just trying to explain a bit more. 

i so totally agree that women’s clothing is more sexy i feel like there isn’t clothes that are masculine and made to be attractive unless you’re in a literal tuxedo. my wardrobe ranges from Feminine God to adam sandler and no in between lol
Cardio doesn't make you muscular, it strengthens your heart and makes you a bit leaner over time. Lifting is where bulk muscle usually comes from
What I meant is that if you do cardio, you'll lose fat, as you said, and your muscles will be more evident. Sorry if I didn't say it properly, english is not my native lang"	xfgai3	NonBinary	78	0.98	2022-09-16 03:28:40
How I explain to people what it is to be non-binary		Of course it’s way more complicated than this but I found this works. I like to tell people that I was born a purple marker with a pink cap. Just like someone who identifies as female is a pink marker and someone who identifies as male is a blue marker	g699rr	NonBinary	81	0.98	2020-04-22 20:57:47
Hey hi say alot of stuffs about my hair so I thought showing more would be a good idea I hope you like. I can also explain a lil how I did it		"Looks like the bi flag!
Stunning! I wish I could dye my hair pretty colors like that. I love how they blend together
Wow awesome is the upkeep difficult?
Gorgeous!!
I love it and I totally want to hear your method
It looks awesome!
The process is alot easier than ya think. Pretty much dyed all my hair and layered on 4 different colors of dye from artic fox. I did use a brush just gently mixed the dye into sections of my hair."	mjz6mc	NonBinary	78	1.0	2021-04-04 16:11:23
Is this black-tie appropriate?	I got in an argument with my Lieutenant about an army mess event im attending where he explained that “women wear cocktail or dinner dresses and men wear suits” I spoke to the Captain and he said I could wear whatever I wanted along as its within the dress code and want to make sure this is.	"is it black tie or suits and cocktail dresses? black tie is like… tuxedos and gowns. this looks good for a cocktail/suit event. for black tie i think if you could switch out the shirt for something fancier you’d be good
I'd say no. It's business casual.
You look great, but I don’t think this is black tie. It’s too casual.
That looks amazing on you. No idea if it's black tie appropriate but still
Black tie for a military function is typically the mess dress uniform and guests wear tuxedo or long dresses. 

Google “mess dress uniform” and you will see samples. 

Having said all this, depending on your rank and whether you’re being honored- your outfit minus the blue jacket would likely go unnoticed. Head to goodwill and see if you can find a black jacket. 

Enjoy the event.
You look good and everything but honestly I would go more formal. I'd find a jacket that actually fits if I could afford it. Probably either switch to a dress or a collared top with a tie, but with a jacket that fits you could maybe get away with not.
Seems alright to me. Maybe check ahead with the Captain to see if it's fine
I mean you look fantastic, but are they taking the ""black tie"" thing literal? If so maybe you could go for a suit or a button down? 

I would just ask if you have the chance haha, either way you look great!
Black tie is like, james bond. This is business casual. You can easily look up levels of formal dress online.
Seems great 👍🏽
Also, out of curiosity, hows it being non-binary in the military? Are you out to everyone in your core or safer to be selective?
Yes, great outfit.
Ysss all about the wide-leg pants
Where'd you get that necklace?
It's clearly not appropriate here, but dressage attire seems to come about the closest I can find to a gender- agnostic style of formal wear.  Someday I could see myself arriving to a fancy event in breeches × top hat as a form of protest!  🎩
alright, thank you !
thanks !
im a L/Cprl but I think I am going to have ranked up by the time the event comes round, thank you !
i dont think i would want to wear a full suit but i think i could wear a shirt underneath that so the collar is showing, do you think that would be better ?
yes im out to everyone, and since we go by our last names it doesnt really effect me that not everyone knows my chosen name, however i stay in the female rooms for sleeping etc. bc i am afab and there are generally no gender neural sleeping rooms on camps
it was from a local spiritual shop but im sure you could find it online, it was an aquarius/february one ! :)
might just me being autistic and not understanding cues but how is it “clearly” not appropriate? but thanks anyways :)
Like a button up? That would look good! Maybe even pair it with a tie/bowtie would look good, though it could probably be formal on its own if its done up all the way :)

Im sure whatever you do will work!
That’s great! I’m so glad to hear. I was in a Canadian core for a number of years but not exactly the safest place to be out. Glad yours is and hope you keep feeling surrounded by safety
My apologies, maybe it isn't!  I just imagined the military not looking on it favorably.  I don't know how that world works."	1175d7r	NonBinary	77	0.99	2023-02-20 12:25:35
Came out to coworker and now she's intentionally misgendering	"So I finally felt comfortable enough with a few coworkers to tell them that I'm NB and go by they/them. Another coworker was nosey and wiggled her way into the conversation. Anyways she asked a ton of invasive questions and I answered most since I'm fairly open, but limited myself in what exactly I would explain/say. During this convo I specifically told nosey coworker that I dislike the terms:lady, ladies, girl, girlie, etc. She responded that nobody even really uses those terms. I told her its more common than you think. Also that I don't get upset if clients misgender me bc they don't know me/barely talk with them. 

Anyways, it's been a month and it seems like nosey coworker is now intentionally misgendering me and using the exact terms I told her I disliked. The terms she said nobody uses 🙄 yeah she uses them a bunch. This week I was called girlie, girl, lady, multiple times. Anyways I just wanted to complain here. I hate cis people, especially cishet morning people 😮‍💨"	"Does your workplace and/or local government have a policy about discrimination toward gender identity and gender expression? Where I live and worked, that was grounds for being fired.
That's sexual harassment. I would contact hr and file a complaint.
Act unbothered and refer to them as; ""man, boyo, dude, guy, etc..."" Then live in peace knowing that their life is so dull they felt the need to misgender you to spice it up.
Basically I only came here to complain and maybe get some validation/ emotional support. But I don't want to solve this or engage in a conflict with my coworker. Additional info below.

In response to everyone saying to go to HR I probably won't. I am not out to my family or a majority of my other coworkers. We work pretty closely with everyone and there's only like 14 of us. I have not made it clear to my boss that I'm NB. My boss had some kind of bullshit sensitivity training with corporate and would want to ""know more if I don't mind"" if I came out to her. She thinks the only out cis lesbian at work is the one who can educate her on Trans issues. I don't want to educate all of my coworkers and feel like they're watching me differently or going to ask me more invasive questions. It's honestly exhausting. And sure I could say no, but then they'd still be watching me differently. 

I also live in a pretty conservative area and it's not entirely safe for me to be out to everyone in my situation. My goal was to tell only a few people at work who I'm closer with. I also never wrote in my sign on forms that my pronouns were they/them because in the end it still made me pick she/they and I thought well fuck it then they don't actually give me the real option so I won't give them that information. I made myself appear cis on paper. I also work for a big Corp that I don't trust at all.
Sorry you're going through this. The Position I always take is that if someone can remember to use a different name after someone gets married or can remember to call someone Dr. so and so after getting an MD or PhD, they can remember a damned pronoun. As for her having tough times, I wouldn't accept that excuse. I'm disabled, pretty much in constant pain and exhaustion, and even when I was also in a 20-year abusive toxic relationship, I was still able to be considerate to others. I hope your situation changes for the better soon.
Could be that she's a dumbass. I have so many of those who seemed receptive when I told them, but just don't seem to get it. Doesn't *feel* malicious when they use those terms for me, but they've made it clear to me that they're just idiots. Honestly, if you can remember a cat's pronouns, you can remember mine. Same with gendered terms. How often do you correct your coworker? If it's everyday, then she's probably doing it on purpose. But if you've only said something once or twice (spaced apart), then she *could* have forgotten. 

I stopped correcting people for the most part, so I just deal with it.
The only sexual harassment aspect of this was OP for talking about this at work
That's a good suggestion. 👍
I think it's possible that it's not malicious. But it seems odd that she's using every single one of the terms I told her not to use for me. I think cis people just don't care. Im not out to all my coworkers so i think its easy to just not change anything and pretend we didnt have that conversation. I dont correct anyone. It takes too much energy that I don't have. She made it sound like anything other than cis would be too hard for her when I told her. I was like yeah the world of pronouns CAN be complicated in the same way that people can be complex and complicated.
its funny your name is ""independent thoughts"" the way you parrot conservative talking points without a semblance of critical thinking. hope you get thoughts of your own one day <3
How on earth is disclosing your pronouns and name preferences at work sexual harassment?
Incorrect. The topic and the fact that it makes the OP uncomfortable makes it sexual harassment. That is how the law defines it.
It’s not. I’m just trying to point out that the whole idea that any of this can be considered sexual harassment is just false. From both sides
[removed]
Okay, I would rephrase your original comment then because it doesn't come across the way you implied it to
Then you did a shit job because all you had to say is that it doesn't qualify as sexual harassment. Instead of clearly communicating your point, you independently thought your way into parroting the right wing party line.
But pronouns are not a sexual term. The ones referenced by the OP are sexual on nature, that's what makes it sexual harassment.

So I came out to my parents!	"I finally mustered up the courage to explain to my parents that I’m non-binary and they were so loving and accepting! I’m just really happy. They offered to help me find a gender therapist and physicians so that I’m better able to move along with any affirming hormones. I realize what a privilege this is, and I’m just super thankful!

I wanted to share the good news with all of you and thank you all for being so supportive. The posts I’ve made as well as reading the posts here have affected me so positively, so thank you a million times to each and every one of you! "	"Congratulations. I bet it feels like such a release and a relief. Pay it forward when you can. The community can only benefit from those of us that don’t experience the worst. 

Volunteer, donate, engage. 


Congratulations :) I'm really happy for you!!
Wow! What awesome parents!
Thanks! Absolutely. Ideally, the work I'm doing within my school will help kids/young adults feel more comfortable approaching the topic of gender, and give them the resources that a lot of us wish we had when we were young. Hooray for equity and inclusion programs! 
Thank you, friend!
Absolutely! I had no idea they (mostly my dad) would be so open to it, I suppose because it's something we've never really spoken about. I was raised catholic by my biological mother and she sort of forced that ideology along to my dad, as well. They've been divorced for about 5 years now. I don't speak to my bio-mom anymore, but I know she's totally anti-LGBTQ+. I guess I didn't know how much of that mindset stayed with my father, and it turns out none of it has, which is great not just for me but for him as well! I knew my step parent would be okay with it, she and I have sort of breached the subject before but never went into depth. Anyway, sorry to write a book, I'm just relieved and happy to be here, haha.
When I was in college (small town in the inland Pacific Northwest - read not that diverse) I participated in panels to educate college students. We gave short statements on ourselves and then opened it up to questions. It helped people see us as people. I wasn’t out as NB then, but I was seen as a butch lesbian speaking up and getting heard. It meant a lot to people and we got a lot of feedback from people that were helped. Either LGBT themselves, or when a family member later came out. 

It all helps. Good work!
Don't be sorry! I love happy stories on this sub! Proud of you! :3"	75sw0t	NonBinary	77	1.0	2017-10-11 23:03:33
A bit confused/liberated to be wondering about my gender in my thirties	"I have a female body, that I feel relatively comfortable with now, and have a daughter that I was happy to have in my belly and then breastfeed, so I am grateful for my body in that sense.

But when I was younger I would look in the mirror and try to imagine how my male body would look, even now sometimes, at 33 years old. Even though I don't necessarily want a male body. I feel so uncomfortable in most feminine clothes or make-up, like I'm trying to be someone else. I feel comfortable wearing masculine clothes, but have never experimented much because... I don't really know why. Pressure from family maybe, or social ""norms"".

Ugh, its hard to explain with words, i don't know.

I like men, but I dont ""feel"" like I'm a woman. Or a man. Or maybe I feel like I'm both. I feel like I've always been stuck in the middle of somthing, not belonging in one thing or another.

I guess when I was younger I didn't really know you could be non-binary. But I'm feeling a bit confused to be wondering about these things in my thirties, and also a little like an imposter, I don't know… But it's also exciting to think that that's what I could be after all, and that its ok. After all these years of feeling like I make a ""bad"" woman. Or that you had to be either male or female. That it might be ok to just not be either, or maybe both.

I guess I'm still trying to work it out, but I wish I could have started sooner! Does this feel familiar to anyone? I'm so confused haha"	"Yes, sounds familiar. I'm also in my 30s and just discovered being nonbinary at the beginning of this month. I felt so relieved and free to finally have a name for the feelings I've had all my life.

I wish I'd understood sooner, but I grew up in a way that being something other than my AGAB just wasn't a possibility. I never learned the vocabulary to describe what I was feeling and knew it wouldn't be accepted, so I repressed a lot. Now that I have the vocab to describe me, it feels so great - like I can finally put down a mask a be myself.

It's ok to take time to figure out who you are no matter your age! You owe it to yourself to live life authentically, whatever that looks like for you. And being nonbinary may just be a stop on your way to something else as your explore your gender, or it may be your final stop.
SAME BOAT. I just came out to my husband last night, too, even though I'm still parsing through everything. I hate feminine clothes, being called 'lady' & 'woman'. I've met with a gender therapist, Mix Thomas, and had a gender consult with Matisse DuPont. I highly recommend it. It helped me find the term agender, and even though I don't really accept myself (never really have anyway), I have a better understanding and don't feel so alone.
Yeah. I came out to my then fiance, now wife, last year just before my 30th birthday. And I don't think you can live that long without at least building some amount of comfort for yourself in the body you have. Kind of like how we get nostalgic for food we had when we were kids, even though we know it's nothing like what we like now. It's familiar, it's comfortable, we may not like how it works, but we do know how it works.

But that nagging itch sounds very familiar. If it's like mine, no matter how much you lay it to rest or rationalize it away, it will just come back. At first when I decided I wanted to do something about it, it didn't even feel like it would change much: I was still probably going to present as I had, because work and other responsibilities, but taking the time to allow myself to understand myself has opened so many things I didn't realize I had kept from myself.

Absolutely worthwhile to take that journey, no matter where you end up. I wish you luck :)
Oh hi! I’m also in my 30s and just came out as non-binary this year. I can’t believe I didn’t know about this for so long. And even after meeting my partner who is non-binary, it still didn’t click for me for years. 
I always worry about being an imposter with everything, but I figure if something concerning identity feels so right, then there must be something to it. 
Anyway, you’re definitely not alone. Cheers to us! 🥂
Yes, I feel this everyday. I’m 45, so older non-binary folks exist and struggle, too. I sometimes think, geez, yeah, top surgery for me! Be my masculine self! Embrace it! Then the next day, my chest is the best! This bra is epic! 

I feel masculine in personality, at least according to what society defines as such, but it often feels weird to toss normal human attributes we all experience into arbitrary buckets labeled “feminine” and “masculine”, hence me being non-binary. 

We older non-binary folks go through this journey at both an advantage and disadvantage. We have accrued life wisdom and yet have also been bereft of this entire world (at least I was) and it’s support for not growing up with the internet. I’m playing catch-up and I feel mostly up to date with my younger siblings. Still a challenge. 

You’re not alone!!
I feel this way also, I am 27 years old and grew up in a rural area that is not lgbtq friendly. One parent (that is no longer in my life thankfully) was the most biggoted person on the planet but my other parent was the opposite. I've been exploring my identity and have similar thoughts for myself as you describe for yourself. I don't feel comfortable is mainstream fashion. When I dress exclusively masculine or feminine neither feels right. I started inventing my own blend of styles, that is probably best categorized as a subset of goth. I feel very inspired by fashions and overall characteristics from masculinity and femininity. I was often described as a tom boy in school. Now more than ever I reject the gender binary because I don't like assumptions being made of me based on what may or may not be on my chest or between my legs or inside my body. I don't want someone stereotyping me one way because they see me in a dress on Wednesday and then trousers on Friday. I'm struggling with choosing pronouns due to the hate I grew up around surrounding lgbtq, but i know i don't like feminine pronouns. Good luck in your discovery journey! May you find self love and peace.
This resonates with me a lot! I am 32 AFAB non-binary. It was pretty confusing figuring this all out later in life! While the process was very difficult in the beginning, for me accepting my trans identity has been so important and improved my mental health a lot. 

As you mentioned, growing up I barely had any exposure to any flavor of queer folks, and had absolutely no awareness that being non-binary was a thing. 

One tip that my therapist gave me was to just explore things without putting a label on it. For me wearing a binder, cutting my hair, and doing some masc contouring were helpful early on. For me the hardest part was sorting out my ide toy vs my expression. But trying different things has been helpful. I personally like non-binary and queer to describe myself, because I’m still not sure exactly how far masc of center I want to be.

If you are able to, I think it would be great to chat with a therapist who has worked with other trans folks. I found mine on psychology today and she has been so amazing. Meeting with a genderqueer support group (on Zoom because of COVID restrictions) has also been so helpful! It’s wild how many people there are who have similar experiences.
That does sounds very familiar!

I figured out this year at 30 I'm nonbinary. I actually come from a pretty progressive background, but even then I never heard of nonbinary growing up. I have watched documentaries about being trans, and transitioning, that always intrigued me (I remember 10 year old me stressing I needed to know if I wanted to be a girl or a boy before 13 so I could or could not start hormone blockers). It would have helped me a lot to know there was something in between, or outside the binaries of men and women.

I still occasionally think  'I wish I knew any of this when I was in my teens, so I could have got help back then, and maybe even started puberty blockers', just to figure out what I felt comfortable with within the time my body was still growing and changing.

Where I live, I feel the biggest disadvantage of figuring this out later in life is that most lgbtq+ communities and lgbtq+ help are more focused on teens and people in their twenties, or right over to 65+.
You should watch Shonalika on YouTube, their video “Nonbinary is made up” really helps clarify a lot of what you’re saying. Best of luck! I came out to myself at 27 and a half, never too late to try something new.
34 year old enby sounding off. Just came to this conclusion of myself this year and I feel similarly. I like my male body but it doesnt define me. I'm still early in my journey but I've learned a lot about myself. For me, it comes down to allowing myself to express in different manners my upbringing said was wrong. I no longer have to be ""hard"" although I enjoy staying fit. It's tough to explain but it's been freeing. I've always hated mens fashion but never thought to explore other avenues. ""Men dont wear that"" so on and such. Social pressure is tough but I think it's worth breaking free of society's shackles. Embrace the journey.
Thanks for posting this, and thanks to all the other wonderful commenters. Your words are helpful to me too 

I am also older and coming into this later in life. Sometimes I feel a little out of place on this sub, when I am old enough to be a parent to so many of the people who post here - including OP. In a lot of ways I already knew I was NB when I was much younger, we just didn't have the vocabulary. These are words my own kids educated me about initially. 

It's also good to hear the advice to find a gender identity experienced therapist. I have had the websites of a couple in my area open for a few weeks now and I have been scared to take that leap. This might help me stop procrastinating
37 year old enby here. I've always felt uncomfortable with my own (AFAB) body, but I believed it was because of weight and such. Had restrictive, purgative and bingeing ED behaviors for a whole lifetime. Thing is, at my thinnest I loved being mistaken for a guy. And when (at the other extreme end of my ED) I gained a lot of weight, I didn't feel as terrible as I feared, until my hips widened. Not even a soul knew about different gender identities and presentations back then, so I always believed it was all about societal beauty canons and fitting in. But my feeling better when heavier didn't match. I've always been gay but tried to ignore the fact. And the penny dropped when I finally accepted myself as a lesbian while at the ED therapeutic process. I still keep on reconciling with my body since I found out that I'm nonbinary. The ED episodes are slowly subsiding, and I finally have the tools to understand what feels right for my body and mind. I didn't recognize myself in photos and mirrors, and that's also slowly getting better since I present more masc. But I don't want to fully turn into a man because I feel that I'm both simultaneously, if that's a good way to explain it. It's more about the outwardly expression of the simultaneous duality that's inside, than anything else. To achieve the expression of what was always inside, if that makes sense.
39 year old NB. I grew up joking with people saying I was asexual like a sponge and would some day reproduce by budding. Make jokes about I was more like a gay boi trapped in a female body. Wanted to look asexual. Liked to be misgendered as male, or would get offended if I was trying to look masculine, and people would still see me as female. Always been interested in intersex people, trans, and wholly supportive of others differences. Never knew NB was a label or thing I could be that was accepted as until recently. What you feel or want to be seen as can change over time and that’s ok. Hence genderfluid, NB,… I feel like I have found my place, just like others here, and that is a wonderful thing! I have always found others that accept that I’m AFAB who doesn’t shave or wear makeup, but only a couple in real life who do the same and are open about it. Now I have found so many more and it is so validating.
I'm smashed in the middle, amab at 25 weeks gestation in the second trimester (balanced hormones at birth) back in 1982, then hormones got unbalanced due to Spironolactone use for diuretic purposes from birth to age 3 and menopause from age 9 onward, now on monotherapy hrt to stop menopause and feminise body finally, not sure if I'll go to bottom surgery since I've always said to myself I'm just to the female side of centre which is where I'm getting to now finally
This feels *very* familiar! I am also 33, and while I've known I was nonbinary for several years now, I just started transitioning (MTX) this month! It's never too late to start. I always felt like I've done a fairly terrible job of being a man, but I don't think I'd be a great woman either. I've always just sort of lived in androgynous land, and when I've tried to be the best man I can be, I've always felt this awful sense of inadequacy and what I later learned was dysphoria. This has been especially painful for me when I'm forced to wear formal men's clothing, at weddings for example, or go to a bachelor party and partake in ""manly"" activities with other men.

I am also in a long-term relationship with a cis woman, and while I identify as pansexual, I am primarily attracted to femmes, and 90% of my relationships have been with cis women. I definitely feel you on the trans imposter syndrome stuff, as I've felt before that maybe I'm not trans enough and I should just keep to myself and just continue to live as a cis man who is a bit more femme than average. My therapist was able to convince me that being my authentic self was the most important thing (in my physical expression, not just on the inside), and that everything else would fall into place if I just went for it and did my thing. She was 100% right. I'm finally starting to physically present as the genderless creature I always have been on the inside, and it feels soooo liberating, words cannot even describe.

TL;DR It's never too late to realize you're nonbinary. Wanting to present more masc does not mean you have to be attracted to women. There's really no correlation there. You're not an imposter at all. You have definitely found your community here, as we all share at least some aspects of your experience. This is a safe space to be however masc or femme or confused you be. Gender is a spectrum and we each live in our own unique space on that spectrum (we are also free to play around in that spectrum to our heart's desire). Welcome!
Yeah, I'd never heard these terms before. I wish it had been sooner, but I'm glad reading these comments that its never too late to start figuring stuff out!
Congrats on coming out! Its cool that you were able to talk to a therapist about it, and find a term that helps to figure out who you are! Its reassuring to read these comments and know that its never to late to start exploring :)
Congratulations 🎉🎊
Thanks :) And yes, I see what you mean about ""getting used"" to something. I don't think I would ever want to change my body, but I'm happy to finally realise it doesn't have to define who I am as a person. I'm happy to have a female body, but knowing that just because I don't feel like a woman doesn't mean I have to feel like a man either, is also reassuring. I'm looking forward to getting to know myself better, wherever it is that I end up
Cheers! Yes, it feels more right than anything else I have heard of, feels more like...me, i guess! Its a bit confusing, and also scary but also exciting and liberating at the same time.
“I sometimes think, geez, yeah, top surgery for me! Be my masculine self! Embrace it! 
Then the next day, my chest is the best! This bra is epic!” 

This is SUCH a mood 🤦🏻‍♀️
I finally ordered a binder from gcb2, and I can’t wait to try it out. 😅
I am always saying that I wish >!boobs!< were detachable so you could have them when you want and not have them when you don’t LOL.
I second the working with a trans-experienced therapist and looking on Psychology Today. My therapist is trans and I found him on the PT site, and the change it made in my life helped me feel seen. It’s been so affirming. And I see him on Zoom otherwise we would never have connected.
Yes, all these comments are so helpful! Thanks all so much!  
You're right, I guess we are only just getting the vocabulary to put words on this feeling of ourselves.. its quite enlightening!
\>This has been especially painful for me when I'm forced to wear formal men's clothing, at weddings for example, or go to a bachelor party and partake in ""manly"" activities with other men.

Ha, this sounds like me, but the opposite version! My sisters would sometimes put make up on me (not to be mean, they just wanted to help), or dress me up, especially as a teenager. I just wanted to feel like I looked good and be as confident as they seemed to be, so I went along with it, but I felt so awkward and out of place. I didn't know why exactly at the time, but it felt horrible. I don't let them do that anymore, but I still don't quite feel how I would like to feel, or look how I would like to look.

It's great that you went for it and are doing your thing now, and that you are happier for it!  And thanks for your support and kind words :)

what to tell children?	"How should I explain to children what nonbinary is. Or even what should I say when they ask if im a boy or a girl. They ask that because of how I look 🤭
I just tell them I'm whatever you think I am and let them pick."	"My kids (6&8) have non-binary classmates. From what I’ve seen, it hasn’t been confusing to them or any of the other kids at school at all. Adults seem to have a much harder time with this concept than kids do.
i typically say “neither” to “are you a boy or a girl”, or “no”/ “nope, just a person” if they ask if i’m either in particular
Just tell'em you're a swarm of bees lmao
My sibling is non-binary. My kids seem to understand it just fine with some explanation.  
Just be honest amd casual about it I think works best.  
I just told my kids that my sibling does not feel like their former name suited them anymore, and that they do not really feel like a boy or a girl.  
My kids were like ""ok, sure"". Now they will correct my mother when she accidently slips up and uses their deadname. :)
I usually go with ""neither, you can just call me [x]"" with whatever is appropriate in that situation. Usually human/a person for strangers, my name for people I talk to a bit longer, my role if I'm there as a teacher or in another function. For the really little ones that's plenty, when they're a bit older they might have some follow-up questions but generally very open-minded. Parents listen to what you tell their kids and tend to talk to you with the same language, sometimes I'll use a word like nonbinary or genderqueer for them but usually that's not needed in short conversations. Kids have short attention spans anyway, they'll accept whatever you tell them and move on.
I'm neither. Just like snails aren't girls or boys but kind of both.
I wasn't in a situation to tell young kids yet, but I heard they really don't care, unless their parents already tought them some hateful stuff. ""Neither, my name's ...."" probably works.

With older kids/adolescents, I try to explain it by comparing it to being binary trans. Almost everybody knows that, so ""You know how some people are born boys and become women, and some are girls and become men? It's similar to that, but I'm not a man nor woman"" and than add a bit about pronouns. If they ask further questions, I'll explain, but usually that's enough.
I told my niece and nephew (6 & 9 when I came out) about being nonbinary that inside I wasn't a boy or a girl, but inbetween the 2 and they were perfectly okay with it. Now they tend to default to the he/him pronouns because of their idiotic & bigoted adoptive parents.
I work with kids and honestly they're pretty accepting. They all call me by my first name, so there's no need to explain how to pronounce Mx. The funniest ones are the younger ones (5/6yrs) I said neither to are you a boy or a girl, so they've concluded I'm an alien, and I'm alright with that
I would tell em the same way I understood myself at 8. I'm neither. There are other options besides girls and boys
Whatever you are comfortable with. Kids are awesome and get these concepts super easily. My daughter, 7, instantly changed from dad to Bub pretty much over night when I came out last year
I say the same as you! I work in education and get kids asking my pronouns and I say 'I literally dont mind, what ever comes automatically to you'   


When they ask what nonbinary is I just say 'when people say 'I feel like a man, I feel like a woman' for me, I just feel like me. I wouldn't mind if I was a boy or a girl, so long as I can be me'
I say ""I'm neither! I'm a they."" and when explaining I explain using pronouns. ""Shes and Hes and Theys are all different, and I'm a They.""
I would say I'm both.
I'm 50 and have always been this way. At first people described me as a ""tomboy"", then I would say I was ""crap at being a girl"", then we used the word ""androgynous"". I use the ""Mx"" honorific but when people ask what to call me, I just say ""I have a name"". Gender identity has nothing to do with sexuality and that means it's pretty safe ground when broaching the subject with young people. I guess I never really had to ""come out"", because I was who I was and that was pretty clear and people just accepted me as I came.
We were raised with the thinking that what you do in the privacy of your bedroom, providing it's all consentual and nobody is getting hurt, is nobody's business but your own. So that's how it is..I am who I am and who I have always been, I use an ""Mx"" honorific and my sexuality is my business.  [gender identity ](https://cadehildreth.com/gender-spectrum/)
I'd show them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5fNzEqYzi0
Not sure the kids' ages, but we found books to be very helpful for introducing the subject.
I find children are much more open-minded than most people realize. I usually tell them ""I'm not a boy *or* a girl!"" and leave it at that. Their reactions range from ""oh, ok!"" to ""[runs off] MOMMY MOMMY DID YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARENT BOYS OR GIRLS!!!!!""
Kindergarten teacher here. I get asked, by kids, multiple times a week and always tell I'm both at the same time! They've just accepted it like ""ooh, cool!""
I’m a nanny so I see a lot of kiddos with work. Kids really don’t care or notice. I work with under 5s, so most of them are still understanding how gender works in society.

My nanny kid knows I have an “old name”. She uses she/her, but her parents use they/them. The other day she used them for me and my heart soared!

The most I’ve gotten from other kids is “Nanny Kid, is that your aunt or your uncle?” “AVeryKindTroll is my nanny.” The end.

The other day a friend of my little one sat next to us to have snack. He then told his nanny sometimes boys look like girls and girls look like boys so you can’t always tell. That was wholesome.

Recently my nanny babe was talking about how we were on a girls walk, no boys allowed. Not only did I shut down the exclusivity, I was like “Well I’m not a girl.” We had a brief chat.

It is NEVER a thing with kids in my experience. But again I work with kids who don’t have a strong understanding of how society and gender intersect, so they are super curious and open!
Kids learn fast and understand concepts better. I did read this cute book about it called ‘The Non-binary Bunny’ by Maia Kobabe, check it out!
Say you’re two (or three) goblins stacked on top of each other posing as a human
All my younger siblings (16,12,10,6) know that I’m nonbinary. My youngest calls me an “unbino” and he knows that i’m not a boy or a girl. He does tell his friends which gets a bit confusing and awkward but I think it’s cute. I think it’s good to teach them young, he now knows that it doesn’t matter what I wear, I’m still an unbino to him. Obviously can’t use my pronouns yet haha but all my other siblings do. And I’m still their sister, that title will never change
I teach preschool and I tell the kids I'm not a boy or a girl and it's as simple as that! It took a few conversations but they adapted incredibly fast. One of the kids has even already figured out how to not use gendered terms for me like calling me teacher, friend, and person. The kids are more than alright, they're incredible!  :)
“Y’know how almost everyone you meet is either a man or a woman? I’m not. I’m a third thing called an NB. What about you?”
I work at a school with K-4, when I had a classroom this summer (8-9 y/os) I tread lightly on the NB topic and focused on forms of address, showed a short clip from Craig of the Creek. 

I just say “I’m non-binary, which means I’m not either a man or a woman, or boy or girl, I prefer to be addressed by my name (no mr/ms/mx) and use they/them pronouns” 

I have been given the nickname “mystery” and am sometimes called “a god” 

A lot of times it comes down to reminding them “there are lots of kinds of people you haven’t met yet, so this is an opportunity for you to practice being kind and keeping an open mind”
My friend has a 4 to 5 year old. No idea. She has trained him to ask the person's gender if he wants to know otherwise use they. So sometimes he will say ""are you a boy or a girl?"" and he has gotten mostly girl as an answer, but when he gets ""neither."" he asks ""what are you?"" To which the person can say they are nonbinary or something. He has one person tell him that they are a swarm of bees.
I am a nanny. My 3 year old nanny kid and I had this conversation the other day:
 
Kid: Na, are you a boy. Because you look like a boy.

Me: yeah I’m a boy

Kid: oh. Cause i thought you were a girl. (I just came out recently) 

Me: yeah I’m a boy AND a girl.

Kid: oh. I’m gonna call you a boy and a girl then. 

And then we had a conversation about how haircuts do not equal gender lol. And then the next monday I had dyed my hair green and she said “Na, I’m gonna call you green boy!!” And it made me feel really good. 

We have had talks about gender before. A REALLY good book for little kids about gender is “It Feels Good to be Yourself” it explains trans and nonbinary identities in a way that is super simple to understand for little ones. It’s essentially like (paraphrasing)  “some people feel like a girl, some people feel like a boy, some feel like both, and some feel like neither. There is no right way to be nonbinary and everyone experiences their own gender differently. I find that it’s actually a really good book for adults who are new to queer stuff too.
i use soda bottles to explain what non-binary and trans ppl are to my students. if you put coke in a fanta bottle, it’s still coke (trans women and trans men). to make it easier for someone to identify that there’s coke inside, they might switch the label on the bottle. the bottle is still a fanta bottle, but we wouldn’t say it’s fanta bc it’s filled with coke and has a coke label (transitioning/watered down version of gender presentation). if you mix coke and fanta in the same bottle, you can say that it’s no longer coke or fanta, and it now something in between (non-binary umbrella). sometimes we know how much coke and fanta there is, so we might say something like “this is half coke and half fanta” or “this is mostly fanta but not quite fanta” (non-binary identities). sometimes we don’t know exactly how much there is, and that’s ok, and in that case we can just say it’s a mix

(edit: wording)
Amen to that! 

When I told my kid (10yo) they just looked at me and shrugged “ok that’s cool”.
As a 19-year-old nonbinary person, it's refreshing to see children as young as six and eight figuring themselves out! I know a couple with two boys aged five and eight, and I feel more ready to maybe come out to them in the future. Hearing about elementary-aged children being supportive of their classmates gives me hope.❤️❤️❤️❤️
🤣 God that made me laugh
Negative, I am a meat popsicle.
Are we snails? Because I'm okay with that.
Now I understand why I always felt a kinship to snails growing up 😂
I hadn't seen Bub before! It's delightful!
Works like a charm ;] lol
Most land snails are both male and female. I relate to snails, if you do too that's cool!
I'm going to say that next time XD since I'm a silly person anyways and like to play/joke around with kids."	y6zyqm	NonBinary	73	0.98	2022-10-18 07:25:25
Does this makes sense as a way to explain what it's like to be non-binary in a binary-centric society?	"This was a random thought, but it might be a way to help people understand what it's like for us, or at least me.

Many aspects in U.S. society divide people by gender or make them explicitly or implicitly declare that they are male or female - public bathrooms, men's and women's clothing departments, driver's licenses, registering for sporting events or sport leagues that are all-male or all-female, etc. What if instead of dividing people by gender, we did it by eye color but we only gave people the options of ""brown"" and ""blue?"" What would this mean for the people with green or hazel eyes? 

Allegedly they only make up 2% of the population, so it's not a big deal to ignore them, right? (sarcasm) Just make them pick brown or blue, even though neither is correct but their eye color is probably closer to one than the other. Or they can get colored contacts to disguise their true color to fit in with the rest of society. 

Does that make sense? I'm sure some people would respond that eye color is genetic and something a person can't change, to which I would respond, ""Exactly."" I didn't choose to be non-binary. It's what I am; it's how I was born. Just like I can't control that I was born with blue eyes. I can adjust my mannerism and dress to try to fit in to a binary-centric world, but it would be a lie. "	"This is useful.
This is much less culturally relevant than it used to be, but I sometimes describe it as everyone being either Team Edward or Team Jacob, and not only insisting that you pick a side, but completely unable to understand why you wouldn't want to or feel like you couldn't, because their team is So Obvious to them.
As a green-grey eyed NB, I totally support this. :)
You can have surgery to change your eye color. And absolutely. I def agree with this description. 
I think it's useful, but I'm weary about placing too much emphasis on physical attributes when discussing gender.
Thanks. I wondered about that too. If I write a blog post about this, I'll probably include that it's an imperfect analogy, but I hope it captures the same idea/feeling of what it's like to be non-binary in a society that wasn't created with us in mind."	84dzq1	NonBinary	70	0.97	2018-03-14 14:55:42
"Why the pronoun is ""they/them"" and not ""it""?"	"I must specify im not a native english speaker, so this is just a genuine grammar question.

I've been taught in school that ""they"" is plural, while ""it"" it's singular.

So to me it's super confusing. Why do you use a plural pronoun to refer to a single non-binary person? Shouldn't you use ""it""?

&#x200B;

Why this happen? ...Maybe cause ""it"" is referred just to non-human things and so it would come out as off and offensive? I'd like some explaination here

&#x200B;

Thanks. It's a genuine grammar question. Nothing more."	"They/them has been used for centuries to refer to individual people of unknown gender.

For example, ""each child should open their book"", or ""I wonder who left their wallet here?""
Like the other commenter said, they/them has been used as a neutral singular when gender isn't known or specified in a more occasional and colloquial sense in english for some time now, it's just being adapted to now serve as a neutral singular pronoun to be used consistently for someone who's gender is known, but not strictly male or female. Some people need to get used to it being singular as many native English speakers don't realize or notice when they use they/they pronouns as a neutral singular in that occasional colloquial way, and remembering to use it that way always for someone doesn't always immediately click, but compared to all other options it's what sounds the most natural and intuitive to most English speakers. 

I've had some people simply not notice that others were referring to me consistently as they/them for a good while unless I told them explicitly because again while it's not like a thing most people learn or use conciously, the singular they does exist in native English speech so it can kinda fly under the radar for a bit if someone isn't paying attention. It's just adapting an existing but previously sort of unconscious quirk of the language into a more intentional and consistent inclusivity.

It/its on the other hand, is generally only used for objects and animals. Therefore if it's used towards a person, it's almost always in a dehumanizing and insulting fashion. If someone calls you ""it"" usually what they're saying to you is they see you as less than human. There is also a history of trans people specifically being called it and dehumanized and treated as a freakish lesser other. So for a lot of folks bring called ""it"" evokes memories of being harassed by, threatened by, or discriminated against by transphobes. So it doesn't really appeal to most. There are some trans people who reclaim it/its in the classic queer fashion of ""take the words they used against you and make them your own and take away the power"", and that's also 100% valid. Some people do use it/its and that should be respected. But you shouldnt use those pronouns for someone unless they ask you too and it likely won't ever be the like predominant neutral pronoun.
Your assumption on why is actually pretty accurate. 

Since ""it"" is used for objects or things like animals, it can feel extremely dehumanizing or insulting to be called ""it"". On another note, in certain contexts ""they/them"" is regularly used to as a singular pronoun. 

For example, if someone you don't know left a coat somewhere you might say ""Someone left **their** jacket here. I hope that doesn't inconvenience **them**. **They** might get cold."" English has a lot of weird little rules like that,  I've heard it's one of the more complicated languages to learn. 

There ARE a handful of people who actually prefer ""it"" over ""they/them"" but most find it to be hurtful so unless someone tells you to use ""it"" as their pronoun it's much better to stick to ""they/them"". 

It's appreciated that you cared enough to ask this!
I was told not to use it to refer to people, since it is used for objects. I do know some people use it as one of their preferred pronouns, but this is the reason why you should use they over it unless someone uses it.
Some people use it but I would personally find it dehumanizing
Although you'll often hear people complain about they/them being grammatically incorrect, it's always nonsense, as they/them has been used all throughout history as a singular pronoun.   


In 1881 the poet Emily Dickenson wrote, ""Almost anyone under the circumstances would have doubted if \[the letter\] were theirs, or indeed if they were themself — but to us it was clear.”  


When we refer to a single person of unknown gender, we always use they/them. When we refer to objects, that's when we usually use it/its.  


From 'The seven rules of chess'  
""The king can move himself one square in any direction""  
""The queen can move herself as far as possible in any direction""  
""A pawn can either move themselves forward one square, or capture diagonally one square in front of them""
Some people do also use it. I know people who use both they and it.
""It"" to refer to people is usually considered very insulting in English. Except for some specific formulas (""It’s Alex,” for example), it’s reserved for non-humans and animals for whom we don’t feel affection. 

""They"" is closer to historical English usage. Various dialects have used it for a single person whose identity is uncertain for at least 500 years, possibly longer. Going from that to using it to describe a definite person is a relatively smaller change.
you were taught basic. Pretty much language has more levels in it. It is more art than science. Kinda like spanish 1 vs spanish 2. which got to say spanish 1 did not give us pronouns.

Pretty much think of the fact when you don't know the gender of the person you use they/their/them instead of It. 

As it, that is used often to refer to an object not a person. And some people find being referred to as an object insulting.
Check out the comprehensive Wikipedia page for [singular ""they""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they). Singular ""they"" has been used since the 14th century. 19th century grammarians tried to suppress singular ""they"" and prescribe generic ""he"", but singular ""they"" had a quiet resurgence alongside women's rights. I was using singular ""they"" in technical writing in the 1990s without even being aware of what I was doing.

Singular ""you"" only replaced [""thou""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou) in the 17th century.
""It"" is a specifically inanimate thing and is generally felt to be deeply dehumanizing, however, being referred to using that pronoun gives me gender euphoria because I'm kinky like that.
there are some who use “it/its” but it is mostly seen as a disrespect by trans/nonbinary people since it’s usually used for animals. 
ex: “Omg is that ur cat?? it’s so cute!”
“they/them” is also used for people u dont certainly know the gender of (singular or plural)
ex: “why would that person walk with sandals in the snow? are they crazy?”
I would like to add that some people do go by the pronoun 'it'. It's not very common but it is something you can run into.
Hi English Major and Native Speaker here,

Language conforms to the needs of the people using it.

So things that were often used to refer to plural forms and singular forms can become interchangeable. Like In some English dialects people say, “you is” or “they is” instead of using “they are” or “you are”. 

Also, you have to recognize that unlike other languages, articles and verbs stay the same(for the most part when referring to both masculine, feminine, and gender less objects), so it’s a lot easy to say “you is” then it is to say “tu sont” because most English speakers will recognize that ‘is’ is being used as the verb form of “to be” 

And since the adjectives, adverbs, direct objects, etc. Aren’t affected by gender, the sentence keeps the same understanding.

So using they to refer to a singular person becomes possible because it doesn’t change the structure of the sentence it just uproots the societal context.

I hope that helps😅
Personally I feel that “It” is dehumanizing. I do know of people who prefer “It” as their pronouns and that’s cool.
Well one is typically used for people while one is normally used for objects, I use they/them bc I'm still a person
I would consider it a neopronoun, even though it's technically already an established pronoun, but when referring to people I think it/its are in that category. It/its can feel pretty impersonal to use for those not open to the idea of neopronouns. They/them being already widely used specifically for people feels the most linguistically natural. In the future, I hope neopronouns are more widely accepted and people who want to use it/its can do so and feel respected.
some non-binary people do use it/its pronouns, and not all non-binary people use they/them, but like others have said, singular they has been used for a while
They/them can be used in singular. And while ""it"" refers to animals/objects, they/them can refer to people too. 

Thus ""it"" can never be the singular origin of they/them.
English has animate and inanimate 3rd person pronouns; the animate pronouns are split into 3 genders: masculine ‘he/him’, feminine ‘she/her’, and neuter ‘they/them’, and the inanimate being ‘it’, aswell as a singular plural pronoun for all genders, being ‘they/them’.

They/them is both the plural 3rd person pronoun, and the singular animate neuter 3rd person pronoun. German does a similar thing where ‘Sie’ is both the general plural 3rd person pronoun as well as the animate feminine 3rd person pronoun.
I mean some people do use it/its as pronouns. It’s really a preference. 
But if I’m not mistaken (someone correct me if I’m wrong), “they” can be used when referring to an individual too. Like, as an example, “I don’t know whose jacket this is, but they’ve got great taste.”
""It"" usually refers to inanimate objects or non-human. It does have negative connotations to be dehumanising, at least for me it does. But ""they"" can be used as pural or singular, same as ""you"" can be, so it's more of a pronoun for people(s) of unspecified gender, either a group of people or just one.
For me it/its feels less personal, I like they/them because it feels more human to be. But some people do use it/its pronouns and it's very cool.
As other comments pointed out they can refer to singular or plural groups of people but also it has been used to demean and belittle trans identities but also as someone who uses both they and it as pronouns the only time you should use it as a pronoun to someone is if they ask you too as many reasonably take offense to being called it
I mean to be fair, your confusion is completely warranted, and you are exactly right. Most everyone who has pronouns aside from the binary he/him and she/her don't use it/it's as their preferred pronouns, and don't like being referred to as such unless they have chosen those pronouns, as it often comes across as derogatory. Another thing that I think is worth mentioning is that most non-English languages assign genders to mostly everything. However, except for a few cases, the genders are almost always masculine or feminine, as opposed to neutral. And as well, whenever you would refer to something as ""they"" in other languages, it's almost always plural, so the idea of the singular ""they"" would understandably be confusing to non-fluent English speakers.
“They went to the store.” Could be singular or plural. 

English and pluralizing words is kind of a grab bag of rules that frequently contradict each other. They and them is a perfect example. It can be both plural or singular depending upon context.
Would you believe, in my college English class, the teacher told us never to use ""it"" at the beginning of a sentence? 🙄
they/them can be plural but it is also used to refer to someone who’s gender you don’t know, where as “it” usually refers to an object or a thing, some people still use it as a pronoun however it’s not considered a typical pronoun
Im a proponent of “any pronouns used with respect”

I don’t feel exceptionally attached to any individual pronoun/word/identity

I’ve been called an “it” many times and it was never respectful
It is used to refer to objects and I’d rather not
I’ve heard that ‘it’ was used as a way of ‘dehumanising’ used by phobics. So it’s usually best to say ‘they’ if you don’t know someone’s pronouns. Personally I go by it/its but that’s just me
I like it/its. There's a few of us who like the pronoun. That having been said, it is inherently dehumanizing (and for me personally that's a part of what makes it appreciable).
Personally as a nonbinary person when someone calls me it , it makes me feel less human like they see me as a creature or an object rather than someone to be respected however some people don’t mind the pronoun it, pronouns are all about personal preference
It is used for objects and can be seen as dehumanising.
They and them have been used to refer to both a singular and a multiple amount of people the singular is when you do not know someone's gender or they do not identify as male or female while the multiple is for a group of people e.g. 'They were partying'
Without a time machine, There's not really any way to know, As ""They"" has been used in the singular to refer to people for hundreds of years. I don't think it's unlikely that it was used instead of ""It"" (That's a confusing sentence) for the reason you mentioned, ""It"" is usually reserved for inanimate objects and non-human creatures (Likely a sort of hold off from back in Old English when there was proper Grammatical Gender), But there's no way to know for sure.

In the modern day, We use ""They"" instead of ""It"" simply because ""They"" has been used like that for hundreds of years, Whereas ""It"" is usually considered offensive to refer to someone with (Some people like to be called ""It"", But probably best not to call someone that unless they tell you it's fine.).

EDIT: Actually, It's very possible the whole thing is a holdover from grammatical gender in English, At a time when ""He"" was specifically masculine, ""She"" was specifically feminine, And ""It"" was specifically neuter, The plural ""They"", Which doesn't change for gender, Would be the only gender-neutral third person pronoun. Although I'm not an expert so English grammatical gender might've already been (Mostly) gone by the time singular They began.
Most people do not want to be referred to as it, as in English that is generally used for animals and objects.

Historically, ""it"" has been used purposely to dehumanize groups of people seen as lesser, like racial minorities and trans people.

""They"" is also both singular and plural, just like ""you."" This is because the true singular form of ""you"" is ""thou"" which is archaic and no longer used. So while They and You work like plural terms grammatically (they are, not they is), both often get used to refer to a singular individual
Ive been lied my whole school education :o
Everybody upvote this thing cmon
>I've heard it's one of the more complicated languages to learn.

I'd argue the opposite. While it does have weird rules (or more exactly, almost no rules), it's structurally a very simple language. It all but lacks verb conjugation, it has relatively simple verb tenses, no grammatical gender, and no declension (except for pronouns). In some sense, I always think of English as a minimum viable product of languages. The only aspect that's difficult is pronunciation; English-speakers at some point decided that they were too good for phonetic writing and now the way words are written gives only a vague clue on how it's pronounced.
>English has a lot of weird little rules like that, I've heard it's one of the more complicated languages to learn. 

While I Don't Have Any Experience Learning English, I'd Guess It's Primarily The Orthography That Makes It Hard To Learn: Our Spelling Is F***ed, But English Grammar Doesn't Feel Too Complex, Atleast Compared To Some Other European Languages. Although Ofcourse As With Learning Any Language It's Relative: It Will Be Far Easier For A Dutch Or Frysian Speaker To Learn English Than For A Japanese Or Swahili Speaker To.
And on a slightly unrelated tangent, since coming to the realisation that I am non-binary, I have found myself defaulting to using they/them pronouns when referring to people online who haven't specified their gender/pronouns, which I'm sure is becoming a more common thing now.
I'm sure there's older examples still but I like to go *right* back to Chaucer (Early Middle English) for my quote. People who complain about ""new"" pronouns don't really have anywhere to go when you point out singular ""they"" predated Modern English\*:

>""and whoso findeth him with none switch blame, they wol come and offre a Goddes name""

In Modern English:

>""and whoever finds himself with no such blame, they will come and offer in God's name""

Basically going from singular ""him / himself"" to ""they"" in the next line, referring to the same single person.

&#x200B;

\*(OK, some people will still argue the toss; saying something like ""Oh, then it's archaic. Unless you can provide examples of it being used in Modern English then it doesn't count."" *That's* when I pull out the Shakespeare, Dickinson, and Austin examples.)
Willam and the Werewolf, 1375 “Each man hurried… till they drew near… where William and his darling were lying together.”  It goes back to middle english.
Even in the example of “It’s Alex,” the English uses “it’s” to refer to the name of the thing, and not typically the thing itself or themself. 

When you say “It’s Alex” it is most commonly to answer the question “what is the name of ____?” 

“It (the name of the subject) is Alex.”

The English language is such a complicated language 🫢
>It is more art than science. 

This. Very Much This. Many People Act As If There Are Strict Rules To Speaking A Language But There Really, *Really*, Aren't, Sure There Can Be Some ""Guidelines"" That Will Make Better Sounding Sentences, But Those Are Based On What The People Of The Time Think Sounds Good, Rather Than Anything Concrete, And Tastes Change Overtime. I Always Like To Say If People Can Understand What You're Saying, It's Correct.
Well They/Them Can Refer To Objecsmts Too, Just Usually Only In The Plural.
>And while ""it"" refers to animals/objects

\*usually refers to animals/objects

it/it's can be used for people too, but only if they specify that they use it/its pronouns
Yeah the singular ""they"" is often used unconsciously to refer to an individual whose gender is unclear or not known.
To be fair so are most Brits of my generation. Not sure how it's taught now but I remember being told by a language teacher (Spanish, not English, but still) that singular they is incorrect and ""If one of my students used it I would mark *their* answer as wrong."" Yep: This teacher actually used singular they while telling me singular they doesn't exist.
Yeah. They teach you how to use it singularly in school but say otherwise for some reason.
In many ways it's like ""you"", the plural pronoun has been adapted for singular usage. You can see it in the reflexive pronouns – just like the singular you conjugates to ""yourself"" rather than ""yourselves"", the singular they becomes ""themself"", not ""themselves"". 

Personally I kinda think the English language should've stuck with thou/thee/thy/thine pronouns, but that's not up to me. Either way anyone who isn't campaigning to bring back those classic second person singular pronouns should cool it on the ""they can't be singular"" stuff
Blame the Victorians. They had a political agenda, and part of that agenda was to cement the male hegemony. Banishing the singular ""they"" and instead teaching that the official role is to use ""he"" except when the subject is explicitly known to be feminine fit nicely with their goals.
Lol and also I’m not a literal object
I like this, but many binary trans do not and consider they/them to be degendering. 🙁
Oooh! That's eight years earlier than my Canterbury Tales example!
""Who’s at the door?""
""It’s Alex.""
Yeah, sure. I just meant in lingvistic way - pointing out, that ""it"" isn't singular for they/them, cuz they/them alone can be used in singular.

But it can surely be used with people who use it too!
That's hilarious. I was such a smart ass kid I would have called the teacher out on that. So many people don't realize they use they/them/theirs for people all the time. It's kind of easy catching them doing it and calling them out. I'm still a smart ass and still do this.
>Personally I kinda think the English language should've stuck with thou/thee/thy/thine pronouns,

Fun Fact, Some Local English Dialects (I Believe Some In Yorkshire And Maybe Some In Scotland Too) Actually Still Use ""Thou"" Or A Variant Of It.
This, And If You Don't Believe That Singular ""They"" Was Attacked For That Reason, I Shall Point You To The Fact That I Believe The Earliest Recorded Complaint Against It Also Says Not To Use ""He Or She"", Apparently One Cannot Use ""They"" For An Unknown Person As It Is Plural, But Can Use ""He"" For An Unknown Person Even Though They Very Well May Be A Woman, Yay Hypocrisy!
I mean that's fair tbh.
I Mean I Can Understand That If The Person Doing It Already Knows Your Gender And Pronouns, But If They Don't Honestly Being Mad At Them For It Is Just Expecting Them To Read Your Mind.
Thank you for this! I didn’t think about that. I wonder why we say it like that 🤔
I kinda tried to, but lacked the confidence and vocabulary at the time to say ""Mate, you just said it"".
exactly thissss. i’ve had this argument w so many people and they would just end up saying, “well that’s different!” 💀
Most binary trans people seem to want others to guess the best-effort binary pronouns. Advertising their pronouns might be considered an admission that they have to do so and are not read as their binary gender. See the Contrapoints drama for example.

I am nonbinary and prefer they/them as a default and wear a they/them pronoun pin. This seems to be a distinct cultural difference between the binary and nonbinary communities.
I Mean The Problem Is Just Guessing Could Easily Lead To Misgendering People, Especially In Cases Where You Don't Really Have Anything To Base The Guess On (E.G. Online), And I'd Bet Say A Trans Lass Would Rather Be Called ""They"" Than ""He"", Even If She Doesn't Like Being Called ""They"", Although Ofcourse I Can't Say For Certain.
I think we agree, as do most nonbinary people, that it is always better to ask.
I Definitely Agree There, But Ofcourse You Can't Always Ask, Most Notably When Referring To Someone Who Isn't Present, And It'd Be Annoying To Wait Until The Return To Refer To Them, In Which Case I'd Say Defaulting To They/Them Is Definitely Fair. ~~Certainly Gonna Sound Way Less Weird Than If You Just Remove Pronouns From The Sentence Lol.~~"	xhgp01	NonBinary	73	0.87	2022-09-18 13:28:32

What if it is a sin?	So idk im bisexual non-binary and i think homoromantic but the thing is i came out to my mom a while ago since then she told me that she knows that she cant cange me but she wants me to see things from a different perspective (she thinks being gay is a sin) and she talked to me on a few different ocasions and she explained why its a sin and stuff and some things actualy made sense and she told me that tonight she had a dream that i was reading something gay and there was a devil next to me and he was saying something and tgere was an angel that was crying and he said he cant help me and my mom told me she couldnt sleep because of it and that she is very worryed and idk what to do im scared of making a mistake because if it is a sin and i keep living like that then ill go to hell but if its not and i listen to my parents then ill probably live a sad life because im homoromantic i just cant be in a romantic relationship with a man and idk what to do im very confused and i dont care how many people tell me its not a sin i just idk who or what to belive and im hella confused does anyone have some advice?	"[deleted]
Ordained pastor here (in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America). Two masters degrees in divinity and theology. Also non-binary.

It’s not a sin.
If being gay is a sin, then so be it. If nobody sins, Jesus died for nothing and we can’t have that.
i really encourage you and your mom to look into some resources at The Family Acceptance Project. Your mom is not bad for believing what she believes, however, her beliefs are having and will continue to have a negative impact on you right now, right here, in this current life. Family Acceptance Project has some resources on families of faith learning to better support their children who are LGBTQ.
First of all: whether you sin or not, it doesn't matter: God loves you **unconditionally**   period.

And if you want to see a great video about why homosexuality is not a sin, you can watch this: youtu.be/WqYvkVqVLFo (you can watch this with your mom too)

He founded a non-profit which could be helpful for you: www.estuary-space.org

Hope I could help you. When you want to talk about why I don't think homosexuality or being trans* is not a sin you can write me here or send me a dm.
I'll pray for you and your family and that you can feel the love God has for you and that you can see, that he created you the way you are
Oof. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, friend. I also come from a highly conservative, traditional religion/family and have been dealing with those sorts of things by slowly leaving the “church” part of my faith behind while keeping what’s important to me. 

Dreams are often just reflections of our subconscious, and it sounds like you’ve been ruminating over whether who you are blossoming into is inherently “sinful” or not—that’s the most logical reason for that kind of traumatic nightmare. Idk if you come from a Christian tradition or not, but if you do, remember that God is Love, and God is Truth, and everything flows from that. Be gentle with yourself, and be kind to yourself. Sending love & support your way
Sweetie, you wouldn't be graced with the gift of being able to love so much, and being who you are, if it was a sin that could send you to hell. I am not personally a Christian at this point in my life, but I grew up in a sect of Lutheranism that was fairly strict and prioritized a lot of talk of repenting for original sin etc. All of my study of the Bible in those years, as well as my reflection on religion and the Grace of God etc, led me to believe this in regards to the Christian faith: if God is supposed to have created everything and then said ""it is perfect,"" even with the introduction of sinfulness after the fall from Eden, then the concept of being doomed to hell for traits that are inherent to you is fear-mongering by your church leaders to get you to fear them, not the divine. 

I am also bisexual homoromantic and non binary. Being true to myself and having the room to express this and understand it has been one of the most beautiful things in my life. I have a wonderful, lovely, wife who is a non binary trans woman of the same orientation and I have found that experiencing love and acceptance like this is incredibly healing and positive. I absolutely promise that things get better. 

Your gender fluidity is precious, it is a cosmic gift. There will be other people in your life who will understand and love and accept you as you are. Your bisexuality and homoromanticism are also both wonderful things because you have an ability to open yourself to love and intimacy in ways that some can't and that perhaps you didn't expect, but you get to discover it all for yourself and then share it with the people who love and respect you back and most deserve it. 

I can't fathom a divine entity who would reject its divine creations. I can't fathom a loving God who would punish you for these joyous, beautiful things about you. And truly, as difficult as it can be being LGBTQ+ in spaces that are less than affirming, especially if you don't know many folks who share that, your identity and your love is something that should be cherished. 

I can't tell how old you are, but it sounds like these revelations are newer for you and I just want to emphasize that it can be ok, it does get better, and if religion is something that makes you feel good, there are spaces for you as a religious LGBTQ+ person that will affirm you and show you the love you deserve.
If it’s a sin, I don’t care. I don’t respect any deity or god who considers love a sin, so if I end up being wrong about religion when I die (I’m agnostic), I don’t really care either way. I don’t want into a “paradise” full of judgmental assholes, and a heaven without gay people isn’t a place I’d want to be anyway.
Sounds like she's trying to guilt trip you
If being gay/non-binary/homo romantic is a sin, why would God have made you that way?

I grew up in a 7th Day Adventist home with really strict rules (for example, couldn't wear pants unless it was 20 below - always had to wear dresses and skirts). I knew I was gay from the time I was in 3rd grade. My father figure, in addition to spewing constant rhetoric about all gays being perverts and pedophiles, also told me that heaven was segregated, and me being mixed, he wasn't sure I even qualified for heaven anymore. That hurt. I knew his God couldn't be the same God that made me. I studied other forms of spirituality, moved out, and now I'm living my best life with my beautiful nonbinary boifriend and all our supportive friends and colleagues. Idk what the exact point is of me sharing this story besides letting you know that, if you're a teen or just a young adult living with your mom, there's so much more to this world than feeling shame for who you are. Keep being introspective, learning about yourself and your faith, and forge your own path. Nobody else can do that for you. And I'm sorry your mom is having this reaction to you. It's an ill-informed, possibly well-meaning reaction - but it's not right.
I personally left the church behind, however, I can tell you that biblically, your mother is wrong.

The current translations that vaguely condemn homosexuality are mistranslations. Many of the figures in the Bible were very queer in their original telling before things got left on the cutting room floor. (Lookin at you, David) There's so much more to the story, and modern Christian texts do a lot to cover that up and purposefully misunderstand. 

The first person to teach me about nonbinary identity was actually my father. He was an Evangelical pastor, and got into reading the books that had been tossed out of the Bible. He told me he read about how God was a combination of masculine and feminine beyond human understanding that resulted in a nonbinary identity we addressed as He. Aka: my conservative as hell dad was telling me about he/they pronouns before I even knew about wtf being trans even meant. He, of course, continued to be a transphobic jerk because that's my dad's thing, but he literally got that idea from Biblical texts that the Catholics thought were too spicy, so I think God understands just fine.
Find some affirming spaces for your faith, if not in person then at least online. There are lots of people asking these questions in all the major religions, people who want to take their beliefs seriously while setting condemnations of 'gay stuff' in their historical context. For the record, this kind of targeted use of dreams etc, while well meaning, can also be seen as manipulation and spiritual abuse.

If you let me know where you are and what your faith is I can look out some legit resources for you - and feel free to dm if you'd like
please cite the bible passage that says gender nonconformity is a sin
Here is my take on the issue of sin: 

If God has an issue with me, I'll settle it with a shotgun.
Are you and your mom christians? Tell her that it's considered a sin to betray trust of a partner - and that what she's been taught sounds like 'homosexuality is bad' only because it applies to a cishet people in a heterosexual marriage who already have a partner - the vast majority of people. Not to bisexual or gay people, or polycules who all consent to poly relationships. Love, sincere love for a person, not out of infidelity, cannot be a sin. Otherwise Jesus himself would be a sin, and that contradicts the very core of christianity. Tell her that if she a) doesn't believe and trust you, her own child and b) continues to threaten love with her misguided beliefs then she's willingly serves forces directly opposed to love, altruism and Jesus - selfishness, hate.


Since she's not an 8 bhumi bodhisattva - and if she were she would have never said those things to you -  she cannot see anything but karmic traces and Mara tricks - so don't worry much about her dreams. It's just how worried she is about you, although this worry is born out of delusion.


 Please update us on how it goes!
There are lots of Christians, laypeople, ministers, pastors, who do not agree that God would both make gay and trans people and consider us a sin.

I personally left the church, I couldn’t handle it after questioning so much of who I was but I truly miss my spirituality and now I am surrounded by churches who welcome people just like me.

If it is a sin, then by the same beliefs, all humans are sinners and it is faith in the power of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice that Christians are redeemed. Not through their own merits, but through their belief. Lots of different ways that these beliefs end up being discussed and lots of different denominations with different preachings about exactly how you get into heaven. But I really cannot imagine a god worth following whose messengers say they love everyone on Earth, yet this whole population is set up to never be able to do the things that will give them fulfillment and peace or they face damnation. If someone came to you with a new religion like that, would it be compelling? Would it seem like a positive thing?

It would be nonsense. Just like racism and sexism in Christianity is nonsense, so is homophobia and transphobia. Jesus spoke of seeking the outcasts and welcoming them in, not forcing them to give up their humanity and suffer. Find Christian theologians who cherish you and love you half as much as your God does. Don’t surround yourself with hate.
she's fucking crazy.

as long as what you do isn't objectively immoral, being yourself should never be considered a sin.
My heart breaks that you had to hear those things from your mother. Being bisexual and non binary is not a sin, love. There are people who believe it is, because they are very buried in religion and tradition. But just because you love those people, like your mom, does not mean you have to believe the same things. She might be trying to help you in her own way, but the things she's saying are damaging. Her dreams are based on her religion, and her fears.

She can believe what she likes, but who you are is not up to her. It's up to you. 

Follow your heart. Be yourself. Don't let others make you afraid of who you are, because that is your greatest power. 

Please don't spend years of your life pretending to be something you aren't to make someone else happy. I speak from experience, it's not a happy existence. 

It's hard to stand up for yourself, to be yourself in the face of disapproval or worse. But I promise you, it's worth it. Be you, and don't let anyone take that away.
It’s not a sin.  You are who you are and there is nothing wrong with that ❤️
If it was, in fact, actually a sin, that would have a few distinct implications:

The first is that your mother somehow has had cosmic knowledge instilled in her to divine the ancient question of ""is God, Heaven, Hell, Angels, and/or Demons, real?""

Then it would imply that the millennia of religions before and after the birth of Christianity,or Catholicism, which both are relatively new historically speaking, are 100% false.

Then it would imply that your mother was capable of understanding the thoughts and feelings of God, God's specific attitude towards your behavior, and how God picks who goes to hell and who goes to heaven.

There are more but I'll conclude this segment by saying your mother implies God is not perfect, omnipotent, or all loving, by making a mistake with creating you and being willing to punish you for something you can't change. 

Essentially as a Christian, it's your mother's job, as told in the words of Jesus, to love and support you through ""sin"" without making you feel afraid or shameful. If she can't do that she fails you a mother, and fails God as a believer.

She is also using hell as a threat to make your fear for your immortal soul mean more than your choice of who to love. Jesus chose who he loved, and was punished for it anyway. 

Choose to be like Jesus, without fear of consequence for your love.

Tl:dr mom's beliefs are valid but they are beliefs and should not be used as a fear tactic with her kids, ever.
Short answer: nope not a sin, and the concept of sins is highly illogical to me anyway (who cares if i have sex?? Or eat and sleep a lot??)

Long answer: I'm so sorry you're going through this with your mom. It is totally inappropriate and manipulative for her to tell you about this dream. All she talks about seems to be god and sin, so I'm not surprised she had that dream.

Soon after I first realized I was gay, I had my first sleep paralysis dream where the devil was standing next to my bed. It was terrifying, and I spent too long with the deeply held fear I was going to hell. It took me a long time to unlearn that, here's what I know to be true:

1)I'm not hurting anyone. My struggles as a queer trans person have made me kinder, stronger, more empathetic, more of an activist. Those are very, very good things

2)If there is a god, they will see that what I am, who I am, is better for it. My purpose is to help humanity, animals, and world in general. If there is a god who would condemn me for it, they can fuck right off and I'll reform hell on my way back up.
The word homosexual did not appear in the Bible until 1946 it was a bad faith translation of a word that actually means pedophile. And the line that read man shall not lie with man was retranslated from man shall not lie with boy. These were translated in this way to fit the agenda of the translators at the time to justify their own homophobia. Many Christians today do not ascribe to this translation of the Bible. Do not let anyone, even your mom, scare you with hell because of the bigoted beliefs of a big group of white men in the 1940s. I don’t personally believe in hell but I can’t imagine someone being sent there for loving who they love and the Bible does not support this idea either. You are amazing as you are. 

I am also a non-binary bisexual homoromantic. I have been living out and proud for 5 years and they have been the happiest of my life. Don’t let anyone keep you from a happy life <3
Hi pal,
Dreams are illustrative of what's going on in the dreamers mind. Your mom having a dream like this just means that's what's going on in her head, it's not reflective of any reality. 

Assuming you come from a Christian background, I'd assure you Jesus never mentioned homosexuality. 

Check out this video from God is Grey, she's a Christian YouTuber who affirms LGBTQ people and explains how some things in the Bible can be misinterpreted or lost in translation over the years: https://youtu.be/SGcyqFKBH5M
I'm not an expert in religions but I've observed over time that religious works and beliefs are often twisted and weaponized after their original creation to be used against people that are 'different'. From what I've learned about a few religions is God's all encompassing love for all He's created, and that that love should be embraced and practiced by His subjects. Unfortunately I think your mom is just scared, she doesn't understand, she may have grown up being taught being different in this way is bad. You're not hurting anyone, you're being true to yourself, qualities that sound like something any well meaning God would encourage, u know? 

I apologize if any of this is out of line! I indeed take criticism. I wish you the best with this, be gentle and kind to yourself
This is strictly through a Christian lens. There are so many of philosophies that aren't homophobic for no reason. If you're worried about it from the perspective of your own faith, the christian bible doesn't even take issue with homosexuality. It takes issue with pedophilia, which was purposely mistranslated to homosexuality. That's a whole other thing.

So the fear is based in religious ignorance on top of regular ignorance.

The only 'Sin' I see here is parents pressuring their child into deepening self-hatred just so you can fit into the box they picture you in. Good parents don't do that. You are a whole person outside of them and they do not own you or you feelings.

You destiny is your own, not theirs. Stay free, stay happy, stay true.
If God exists, and loves you, and made you, then how you feel comfortable expressing your identity, and who you're attracted to shouldn't be an issue. If you believe God doesn't make mistakes then you're made the way you should be and shame has no place there. Either way, shame is not a useful tool for growth and I hope your mother opens her views up a little. 💕
There’s a theologian named Walter Wink who wrote an essay on homosexuality and the Bible, that you can find [here](https://reconcilingworks.org/images/stories/downloads/resources/003_Homosexuality_and_the_Bible-Wink.pdf). 

Using specific biblical examples, and combining a multitude of perspectives, he basically makes the point that *“there is no biblical sex ethic.”*

I have found this to be an excellent resource when I have to, yknow, justify my humanity and the humanity of others to rabid Christian folk. 

Mind you, it was written in 1979, so its tone feels outdated at times, but I think it’s honestly one of the better Christian-based counterpoints to anti-queerness I’ve ever come across.  
  
Hope this helps!

Edit: typos
God creates everything, so He wouldn't have made you bisexual, nonbinary, or homoromantic if you were going to be sent to Hell for those things. I'm admittedly not Christian, but from what I understand He wants you to be happy and help others be happy. I don't think you'll be sent to Hell for being the person you are
Your mom should look into the origins of verses that say homosexuality is a sin. Most were added and changed that way fairly recently compared to the age of the Bible.
Long answer short, might get downvoted for bluntness, but dreams don’t actually mean anything and god isn’t real. If it is, it’s a very cruel god that lets innocent children suffer every day, while letting evil people prosper. And that’s not a god you should want to worship or listen to.
Not sure if this is helpful but it might be useful if we break this down into 3 core assumptions. First that being queer is not a choice, you are born that way (which i believe) second that being gay is in fact a sin, and third that the 3 divine attributes that many christians assign to God  are true (ie that God is all good, all powerful, and all knowing). If all of these assumptions are true then we've reached a concerning dilemma. If god is all knowing, then he knew you were going to be queer before he created you and did so anyways, knowing that for you to live happily you would have to condemn yourself to hell. If he was all good why would he knowingly create a person that he knew could not be happy without going to hell. More over why would a good god make being queer a sin to begin with and where does this moral judgement come from? Are actions moral because god says that they are Moral? Or does god say that actions are moral because they are moral? (this might sound like the same thing but its not, for more on this you can look up the Euthyphro Dillema). Also if God is all powerful, and god does not want human beings to be queer, then why is anyone created queer? He would have the power to make it so that no one was born queer, and yet it is evident that queer people exist. One might answer that we are given free will and thus can choose to be queer, but that goes against our first assumption that being queer isnt a choice. For the sake of argument lets say it is a choice. Even then, if god is all knowing, he already knew you were going to be queer or else he is not all knowing. And if there is an all knowing entity that knows all your actions before you take them, can you really be said to have free will? I've probably made this question a lot more complicated for you, but thats the point. Morality and ethics are much more complicated then just what the bible dictates. You must carefully think about what is right and wrong for yourself, what is sin and what is not. Your mother does not have all the answers, your pastor doesnt either. 

TLDR; Morality is much more complicated then whats dictated to you by the bible. It is up to you to contemplate your own morality.
hello love, i’ve been in your shoes. here’s what i know. god created us each in his image with purpose, he knew what we were going to be like before we were even in our mothers womb (Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139:13). that means he knew you would be non-binary, that you would love people other than men. i do not believe the god of love would create someone in a way that would immediately condemn them to hell, he wants what is best for us, and i don’t think that would mean living your whole life lying to yourself and repressing your truth. but i know that is something you would have to think through and believe yourself before it would mean anything more than some bs from a stranger on the internet. 

another thing: what is the sin here? loving? i found this article online that i think would be very helpful to you, especially the part where it talks about how each mention of same sex attraction in the bible was condemning another vice (like sexual violence or exploitation) https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-homosexuality 

i hope this helps you some my friend. you are beautiful and wonderful and your journey towards living truthfully is worthwhile. <3
no god would send someone to hell for living happily.
One. Anyone how tells you being gay is a sin doesn't know thier Bible at fucking all. The one passage they use is about pedophilia not homosexuality. It's about not sleeping with a young boy. The man shall not lie with man interpretation is for 1953. Period. It's just not true. 

Two if it is a sin fuck God. He is the monster then

Three J boy died for your sins and he was all about not caring what other people do and just accepting them

Three point five J boy only ever got mad at tax collectors, and only when they stole money or didn't use it for social programs.

Moral of the story J boy and G money are queer accepting socialist and anyone who denies that need Jesus in thier life and to read a Bible 

You are valid enjoy yiu life knowing J boy loves you. Unless you a tax collector stealing. Then fear him cause he's coming for you with the belt

I was struggling with this; and I still don't have it all figured out, but hearing this sermon was the first time since coming out that I really felt God speak to me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_VFXQXh2Xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_VFXQXh2Xo)
When I was first coming to terms with my sexuality and gender identity, I struggled the most with how my religious beliefs affected my self-perception, like you. For me, what really helped was learning more about my religion and questioning those Unquestionable Truths I was raised to believe. You said she explained why it’s a sin, and she likely gave you a lot of evidence to back her claims. She’s trying to make you see her point of view from the knowledge she has, whether or not it’s true. Try finding your own evidence and believing your own truth. Try finding websites and videos online that have done a deep-dive into subject matters like this. Maybe even dig into your religion’s sacred texts (if applicable) and see what you can come up with. 

It’s important to not fall into a rabbit hole and to have support as you go through it though. Do you have any friends or support groups that you can discuss with? It really helps talking it out and processing it with other people. I was fortunate enough to take a class in college where we studied the Bible. It was an incredible class because it had nothing to do with religion. It was purely an analytical class aiming to understand the Bible objectively, as a book of history and humanity rather than faith. It can be really helpful and affirming seeing things from a different perspective and understanding something from knowledge you yourself have gained rather than from what someone had presumably unquestioningly grown up believing in.
i'm not christian myself but i believe that god, whether the christian idea of god or any other, doesn't hate people for things like being gay or being genderqueer. what god would hate someone for is probably stuff like intentionally hurting others, treating people like crap for no reason, just generally being a bad person and damaging others (which you are not doing by being queer) so don't worry. i am certain you have nothing to fear if you are true to yourself.
Fish Out Of Water is a great resource 

https://youtu.be/oSQuO8bMNfM
I don’t consider myself Christian, but I was raised as one and still make efforts to learn more about the Bible. 

OP, I don’t believe that being gay is a sin, based on my own research of the Bible and experiences.

Even if God does hate people being gay, remember that He also hates fraud.

He would not want you to pretend to be something you’re not. He created you the way you are and loves you the way you are, whatever his reasons.

I struggle to believe that God can hate a healthy, loving relationship. As long as it doesn’t distract from the individual’s relationship with Him—I mean, think about the writings of Paul, who advises that you enter a relationship only if not being in one would make it more difficult for you to focus on God.

I don’t believe being gay is an affront to God. I believe most of that has come from mistranslations and hundreds of years of prejudice. But either way, it sounds like remaining alone and celibate  or in the closet your whole life would just build resentment against God and distract you from Him.
Also, from a biblical and academic standpoint, your mother should not have told you that being gay is a sin. There is no evidence in the bible of this, as most of the lines people point to about this subject refer to ""men laying with men as they would a woman"" but the translations are dubious at best and the original verbiage would better translate to like ""don't lay with CHILDREN as you would your wife"" or, in some interpretations, ""don't treat a man the way you would a woman"" i.e. as inferior. The same way that the translation of the ""virgin"" Mary just refers to her being quite young, rather than an actual virgin. 

There is simply not any hard evidence of homosexuality being a sin in the bible, let alone an unforgivable sin.
You are who you are. That's the way God made you. If he didn't want you to be gay or Homoromantic, he wouldn't have made you this way. Killing people is a Sin. Loving who you wanna love isn't. You won't go to hell. Be true to yourself, and be proud.
A few things!

-why would god care what you do with your body? It's not a sin to eat yummy food, play fun games, listen to good music, wear comfy clothes, or anything else, so why would it be a sin to have good sex? If there is a god, I'm confident that what's sinful is *hurting people*, and I don't think they care how you do your business otherwise

-if the whole hell thing is probably not real. It doesn't show up *anywhere* in the bible, it's not mentioned even once. It was invented in the centuries after jesus, imo to better control people by having something to threaten them with.

-if there is eternal life, and you go to the same place all the other queers do after you die, that kinda sounds like a party? I'd rather be in hell with all my friends and lovers than in heaven with a bunch of stuffy straights

-your mom's dream doesn't mean anything at all. Dreams are just dreams.

-talking about what's in the bible, it doesn't condemn homosexuality even once! The passage that is commonly claimed to condemn it is actually about pedophilia, not homosexuality

-if you're still troubled, and you believe in god, why not ask them? Surely they wouldn't tell your mom something about you, but refuse to tell you the same thing?

-if personally think the whole legalistic, rule-obsessed tradition of sorting things into sins and non-sins is complete bunk, but if it's all true, then can't you just ask for forgiveness before you die?
Im really sorry that you’ve been struggling with this. As a christain bisexual enby, the best succinct advice i can give you is that if it is a sin, it is not the only time you’ve sinned. We sin countless times every day, even if we dont always see it. The Christian journey is to strive to become more like Christ, not to purify ourselves from sin

A few relevant verses:
Ephesians 2:8-9
for it is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this is not from yourselves but is a gift from God - not by works so that no one can boast

Romans 3:10
As it is written: there is no one righteous, not even one

I could elaborate more if you’re interested, but the long and short of this argument is that if it is a sin, its certainly not the only one, and you are not unique. Theres no “special” sin that cannot be forgiven in christianity. (with a possible exception not relevant here) 

As long as you are making a genuine attempt to persue God with your whole self, your mother doesn’t have anything to worry about, you arent any more sinful than she is. The problem is that christianity recently is less of a religious movement and more of a means to control and enforce cultural norms. Dont let anyone - ANYONE tell you that you are less for who you are, or who you were created to be.

Acts 10:15
The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”

And

Romans 5:1-11 (copied from: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205&version=NIV&interface=amp)

 Therefore, since we have been justified(A) through faith,(B) we[a] have peace(C) with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,(D) 2 through whom we have gained access(E) by faith into this grace in which we now stand.(F) And we[b] boast in the hope(G) of the glory of God. 3 Not only so, but we[c] also glory in our sufferings,(H) because we know that suffering produces perseverance;(I) 4 perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 And hope(J) does not put us to shame, because God’s love(K) has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit,(L) who has been given to us.

6 You see, at just the right time,(M) when we were still powerless,(N) Christ died for the ungodly.(O) 7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.(P)

9 Since we have now been justified(Q) by his blood,(R) how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath(S) through him! 10 For if, while we were God’s enemies,(T) we were reconciled(U) to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!(V) 11 Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
There are LGBTQ+ people in the bible. The wedding vows of today were first spoken by lesbians. Joseph is believed by some to have been a trans woman. There's evidence that Jesus himself was both bi and polyamorous. There are several other examples throughout the entirety of the bible as well, including figures like King David and Moses.

Christians often do not read their own bible, or do not understand it, and will twist the verses to reflect what they *want* to believe, and use scripture to harm others.

That is what your mother is doing. She is a bigot, end of. Pursue your own truth, not her proclaimed (false) one. Do not let yourself be a victim of her prejudice.

EDIT: I forgot to add that there's also evidence that Jesus was also nonbinary.

EDIT 2: I learned about all of this in the book ""The Gay Gospels"" by Keith Sharp. The author does a way better job than I ever could of exploring these topics and using the scripture to support what he says. I found it at my local library and gave it a read, so maybe you can find it at a library as well. Even if you have to buy it, it's worth the read.
God loves you no matter what. You were made to be yourself and live your life to the fullest. You were made this way.


Psalms 139:13-14 


""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. your eyes saw my unformed body.""
What kind of God would make angels who are powerless against devils? 

It’s so silly to me, the idea that a being of pure divine will and light would be crying powerless over a devil’s deeds and not, like, a righteous warrior ready to do battle for your soul. 

What would be the point of free will anyway if devils had more power over us than angels? 

I don’t know if Hell exists or not. 

But I know that if there was a Christian God then He would be a God of pure love and forgiveness. The whole entire Christ story is about love and forgiveness, not damnation or fear.

Who does Jesus hang with in the Bible? Not the priests (pharisees) and not the pious. He hung out with whores and outcasts.

It might be counter intuitive, but IMO it’s okay to lie to your Mom and stay in the closet until you can live on your own. Frankly, your sexuality and whether you’re sinning or not is between you and your God—it’s none of your Mom’s business.
Dreams are dictated by our subconscious, so they’re just a manifestation of your mother’s beliefs, not prophecy or anything. 

I’ve always found it interesting about Christianity there are things that are undeniably universally accepted: Killing is bad. God is real, and so is Jesus. You should love God and love your neighbor (whether people actually do is less universal, but they all say it…). So on and so forth. Then you get into more specifics, and there’s a lot of disagreement - is being gay a sin? What is meant in the New Testament when it says Jesus fulfilled the law of the Old so we don’t have to focus on it? What is the level of humanity’s depravity? By what means is salvation delivered to a person? 

Personally, I’m a Christian but I don’t like what a lot of people who call themselves Christians stand for. Our core belief is love, and the amount of hate spewed at the LGBTQ+ community is mind boggling to me.

I can’t tell you what is and isn’t a sin as I don’t know the mind of God. Like you said, it doesn’t really matter how many people here tell you it’s not a sin. I think the only evidence you can go by is when you truly feel you are living the value of love. For me, denying my queerness and trying to conform to others’ picture of Christianity kinda made me a hateful person, ngl.
Look, clearly being gay isn’t choice. If it were, you would choose to be straight cis and not worry if it is a sin, right? God made you perfectly. God made you the way you needed to be made. 

Also being gay isn’t a sin and there was no mention of homosexuality in the Bible until the 1940s (in the US and many manufacturers are based in the US so this spread). And most of the passages that are now read to be about homosexuality are actually about pedophilia in older translations.
In the torah, the original texts of bereishit (genesis) describes the creation of adam as “G‑d created man in his image, in the image of G‑d He created him, male and female He created them” that being, adam, the first creation of HaShem was both male and female, one being with both traits, being more or less a non-binary entity. It wasn’t until G-d split adam that chava (eve) existed as a physically separate being. There are also several different instances in the Torah of multiple genders being identified ( androgynos, tumtum, saris, aylonit). while this is the Jewish interpretation and not Christian, i figure since they have the same G-d and a similar foundation it might help.

On a personal note, Im also non-binary and something i’ve pondered and discussed with clergy is that because every person has purpose given by G-d, perhaps the purpose of non-binary/transgender/gender nonconforming folks is to open the eyes and minds of people to make a more accepting and loving world. I hope this helps :)
It's something you can't control. If it's really a sin, then it doesn't matter. All you can do is live your life. I'm sorry that your mother has harmful ideas engraved in her mind. You deserve to be happy!
If god is universal love, and god is telling you you can’t love someone of the same sex, then you have a contradiction. i’m agnostic now, raised Catholic. But what helped me release my religious guilt was that if god is love, god would not want you to limit your love. You can’t love with the fullness of your heart, if you have to turn a piece of it off. 

I’d also go further into how a god that requires worship is rather vain, and that these rules were made by humans, not god.
I am definitely not minimizing your fears or concerns at all. But if that we’re me, I’d be more miserable being something I’m not while being alive then what’s going to happen to my soul when I die. I’ve been queer/non binary openly for 17 years. I came out young. According to most religion I’ve committed several sins. But honestly if God, whoever that is, didn’t love me or want me, I wouldn’t be here. Everything has a purpose. I’m happy and authentic. Whatever comes for me next when I die will be my problem then but for now? I’m not hiding.

Also accepting that not everyone is going to be okay with it is difficult, especially family. I’ve had to be alone on several occasions in my life due to lack of family support. It’s either going to take your mom time and an adjustment period or she may not come around. Regardless, you have to do what is best and safe for you, but remember that your happiness and contentment is important.
I have a lot of the same conflictions, but I encouraged you to do A LOT of research on the topic before you make any decisions. Don't just take what your mom or anyone else says for verbatim (including me).

First of all, there are a lot of studies done on this topic and explanations that make sense. It's not just as simple as ""the bible says homosexuality is wrong so it's a sin."" There's conflicts with the translations from Hebrew and Greek and how the text has been altered over a series of those translations. 

There's also reasonings that have to do with the historical setting the people lived with culturally when they wrote it. Back then women were opressed, the bible said it was okay to have slaves, and to even think about a fight for the rights homosexuals seemed impossible. However, the evidence is clear that the bible tries to push the boundaries of  what their society thought and/or did. While the bible seems extremely sexist at times now, it was extremely revolutionary then. They were steps in the right direction for the church to follow through with down the road and give women more rights later on. The same can be applied to homosexuality.

There are also a lot of things that the bible says that we don't do: the sabbath, stoning cheaters/ non-married women that have been caught having sex, not wearing clothing woven of two kinds of material, not touching people on their period (When a woman has a discharge, if her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean. Leviticus 15: 19-20), and then it says this too- Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves. Numbers 31:17-18. 

However people LOVE to concentrate on the fact that it says homosexuality is a sin when they ignore all the rest of what I wrote above.

I am a Christian, but I don't think loving who you love is a sin and that isn't me just rejecting what's in the bible because of what I personally think, it's a grounded belief based on research.
Bro I'm just going to say this bcuz it might be true. The fact that your mom had a dream like  that is something not to take l lightly, all these ppl here will of course tell you she is a bigot but think about it first isn't it not Nebuchadnezzar that had a dream from God about something true didn't   God tell Pharoah about the farming surely God must have showed your mom something that really going on around you if you're not convinced let me tell you a dream I had , my mom had cancer I asked God what will happen to her and in my dream my Mom died ppl told me that it was a lie, end of the story she did die. If you want to know the truth then ask God and he will tell you
This 100%. I'm a psych major; dreams have zero meaning except they might have to do with topics the dreamer is stressed about.

- 

**Edit** --- I've oversimplified the situation, please read the comments of others, which better address OP's issue 👇
It's not even all the time a stress thing. Most of the time dreams are just things that you have in your subconscious, so if she consciously or subconsciously thinks that on any level that's why It would appear in her dreams. Yes she is more likely to dream about it if under stress, but even so a large part of the time stress dreams dont manifest themselves nearly as clearly as, the devil was talking to you bcs you were being gay and angels were crying. But still most likely doesn't actually mean anything, its just because she already has it in her head that that's how it goes most likely. (I'm sorry I mostly skimmed after I saw religious mother using her dreams and religion to scare her child who is brave enough to be themself)
Without knowing much more about you, I must say - you seem very cool ☺

By farming I meant farmine
To be fair though we can't really apply this religion. Sure we have no basis in psychology to say dreams have any meaning, but psychology doesn't disprove the existence of God. 

If somebody has faith that God gave them a dream for a reason there isn't any logical way to argue against that.

I'm an atheist but if someone honestly believes in a religion you aren't going to logic them out of it. 

So imo yeah dreams have no meaning whatsoever but if OP and OPs mom honestly believe that it does you need to meet them where they are at and try and work from their understanding. If you want to be a therapist one day ""meeting the client where they are at"" will become a mantra.
In my experience I have more dreams about whatever I was interested in like a week before than what stresses me out. Show taking place in an apocalypse? Roadtrip across the world while wacky creatures try to catch me. Controlling weird ice stuff after ice-y DLC on Destiny 2? done. Have a mute friend after watching a show with a badass mute character? been there. My bad dreams/nightmares are few and far between, most of my dreams are pretty fun.
good bot
You make an excellent point 👍 I was being simplistic and cynical about something as complex as religion. Thanks for calling me out
Yeah, a dream or “vision” like the one OP’s mom had would be extremely frightening if you felt it was from God.
I don't believe that but I think my mom does but the thing is that a while ago i don't know what was the context she told me that dreams have no meaning but now she tells me that this is a sign or something

So I'm honestly not surprised to hear your mom's opinion on dreams changed. When somebody desperately wants something the brain is good at compartmentalizing and holding contradictory thoughts at the same time without knowing it.


The two best things I could advise would be one, trying to just have conversations with her and educate her on this stuff. However I imagine you try this and it sounds like your mom is pretty dug in right now and this may not work.

What I recommend significantly more is to try to get the two of you into family based therapy. I've seen this situation a few times, with a few different psychiatrists on the treatment team, and every time the recommendation is family based therapy.

Having a neutral third party there to see your dynamics and conversations, and point out miscommunications, misunderstandings, and poor methods of communication, is more likely to get your mom to listen. This is about you so your opinion may not hold much weight to her, but she may be more likely to respect the therapist's opinion.

Good luck op I hope you two are able to bridge this gap
Actually tbh, I finished my bachelor's in psych six years ago, and now I'm a restaurant manager lol. I don't plan to use my degree; I could never be a therapist, too intense for me.  Thought about social work, but am scared of it for the same reasons; don't think I could handle seeing so much trauma and grief every day. Are you a social worker? How do you handle the stress?

Thanks very much for the gentle advice though - if I were still a student, this would be very helpful to hear 👍
Yeah I'll try to talk to her but idk why I physically can't and when I came out to her I wrote her a letter because I just couldn't get the words out of my mouth and my mom tells me that she wants me to be more open with her and that I've insolated myself but its hard for me to open up to people because I have some trust issues and I kept these things inside me for a while and we had a talk after I came out but I just couldn't speak and a thing that annoys me its that when I bring up an argument she tells me not to believe everything on the internet but most of her arguments were from the internet
I am a social worker and honestly just have a high tolerance for other people's trauma which is important since I actually work inpatient with kids and teens, so child abuse in every form is not uncommon. Also part of it is I'm actually a binary trans woman with severe dysphoria and have gone through some terrible shit with people because of it which motivates me to help others. Make the world brighter than the one I was born into.
I suggest family therapy even more now. It's designed to address exactly those problems
that is beautiful. Thank you for the work you do, I couldn't, but it's so important"	rhka51	NonBinary	71	0.95	2021-12-16 06:08:56
I regret coming out to my parents	"I came out to my parents as someone without gender about a year and a half ago. They have strong religious beliefs that contradict that, so I've always tried to make it clear that I didn't expect them to change their beliefs. I just wanted them to use They/Them pronouns for me. 

They have never used the correct pronouns. Around 6 months after I came out, I sent them a message to tell them it upset me that they still hadn't once used my correct pronouns. I asked them if I could correct them and they said yes. But I felt very awkward doing so, so I stopped correcting them for a time. 

Yesterday, I had a talk with them. I said I wanted to talk to them about them misgendering me. Before I could even say anything my Mum started shouting, aggressively saying that she ""doesn't get it"" and that ""she's trying"". I reiterated my discomfort to them about using incorrect pronouns. I told them that I'm going to be a lot more consistent about correcting them. 

They said such horrid things. My Dad kept asking why this is ""such a big deal"" and why I was ""making this so dramatic"". When in reality, I imagined sitting them down, saying what needed to be said and moving on. I didn't want it to be dramatic. He said that I was ""disrespecting their beliefs"" and ""forcing them to change"". 

My Mum told me that she'd ""read about the sort of people who say things like cis gender"" and that she pretty much believes cis gender to be a slur. I explained the meaning of cis gender, she understands the meaning. But she said she doesn't like the sort of people who say that word. I said ""people like me?"" she said of course not, the people at large who say it. This of course means LGTBQ+ people and allies. Which basically means she is not ready or willing to be an ally.
 
I said the phrase ""come out"" and my Mum said ""What do you mean 'come out' your not GAY are you?!"" as if me being queer would be the absolute worst thing in the world. I am a  closeted pansexual to them (not closeted to anyone else) so you can imagine how this made me feel. 

They said ""we're just never going to get it."" which of course means that they're never even going to try, even though they keep saying ""we're trying"". 

It was just awful. I don't get why it's so hard to accept their child. To just respect me. To care about me. It's so confusing as well because up until this point, they've been such amazing parents, honestly the best parents someone could ask for. Which means that their caring for me had small print attached ""I'll care for you but only if you're cis and straight."". 

It's honestly making me want to say to them ""right, I can't do this anymore. Just call me she/her. I'm sick and tired of it."". I regret coming out to them so much. It's completely ruined our relationship in a way that I don't know if we'll ever be the way we once were. 

It also makes me scared for my child, who we know as our daughter unless she says otherwise. What if she's trans? Or queer? Or non binary? I said this to them and my Mum aggressively said ""let's just not go there"". Which was scary and horrible to hear."	"Kind of a random thought for me to attach to here, but does any religion actually say anything explicitly against being non-binary or just trans in general?
Okay so first I’m so sorry that this is happening. Second if your parents wouldn’t have accepted you in what they view as a same sex relationship then personally I don’t view them as good parents. Anyone who puts conditions on their love is not a good parent. My best friend is trans and comes from a big Mormon family and they have accepted her despite their religion so this is an excuse and a crutch not to change. You have explained how this hurts and upsets you and still they have not tried to change despite saying they are. I am glad they don’t visit often so you don’t have to deal with it super often. Sometimes in situations like this an ultimatum is necessary letting them know either you accept me and try because that’s all you’re asking for or you will go no contact. They won’t see you or their grandchild anymore without trying. This is only a suggestion and obviously it’s your choice. The other suggestion is having family counseling with them.
How old are you? Do you have many years left in their house? Do you intend on attending college/university? 
Sometimes it is best to find the emotional support you need outside your relationship with your parents until you can be financially independent.
This is a complex and rough situation. I’m really sorry you’re going through this.

I do feel for you a lot but I’m trying to understand where both sides are coming from. You’re frustrated that your parents can’t do something really simple for you, address you by they/them pronouns (something that I agree is really really simple in the grand scheme of things), but I really hope you consider that for your parents it’s probably not as simple as it is for us. The idea of a non-binary gender identity and using gender neutral pronouns is likely not something they were raised with a very good understanding of, and if they’re particularly older which it sounds like they might be it might be the all the more difficult for them to adjust to.

Honestly I’ve read through your post three times now and it seems like your parents do really care about you. I think the shouting and aggressiveness is unnecessarily cruel but everything your parents have said indicate to me that they are really trying to understand you and are frustrated that they can’t.

I think you guys need much clearer communication. Something that stuck out to me is the things your dad said about making this a bigger deal than it is. You and I both know how important pronouns are and how crushing it is when we’re misgendered. But to your dad that crushing feeling is probably something he can’t even wrap his head around  since it’s something he’s likely never even experienced. That’s why to you this is extremely important but all he sees is you making a big deal out of nothing. So, bridge that gap, if you can. Don’t just ask him to use your pronouns, explain why it’s so necessary that he does.

For me personally, I remember my mom had a lot of trouble understanding why being misgendered was so terrible for me. I told her that every time somebody called me she/her it felt like being shot in the chest. I opened up to her about the pain. I was brutally honest. And no (good) parent wants to see their child in pain. So that changed things for her. It might be hard but maybe what your parents need is some brutal honesty from you about your experience being non-binary.

This is a really shitty situation no doubt and if your parents don’t want to change that’s 100% on them. But from what you’ve said about them I think your parents do really care about you, which means there’s some hope there. Keep trying, and try to see things from their point of view. That might help get things across. Good luck.
The religion that theu are a part of, and that I used to be a part of is The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, more commonly known as Mormonsim. It doesn't explicitly say anything about there not being other gender identities. But it does talk about gender being sacred, and gender being very important to one's spiritual identity. Also, members are called ""brother [last name]"" or ""sister [last name]"". On Sunday, the men and women are seperated out into different lessons etc etc.
Patriarchal religions require a gender binary in order to maintain their power structures. That's why they hate anyone who doesn't conform.
Thank you so much, it's nice to be defended! I've thought about cutting them off, it may have to come to that eventually but I hope not.
I'm lucky in that I'm 27 and not living with them any more. They come up about 4-5 times a year to see me, my partner and our child. I asked them if that makes it difficult to remember, but they said it's ""constantly on their minds"".
Thank you for that! I have been brutally honest to them in the past. In this talk, I told them that it's hard for me to feel respected and cared about when they misgender me. I told them that it puts me on edge when they come to visit, and that I have bad sleep when they're here.

My parents made it quite clear that they hated having this conversation, it's made me scared to ever open up about it again :S
I feel that a lot of transphobia and homophobia within religions seems to always be based on some vague ideas that are ingrained into the community without it actually being directly based on anything explicitly written down.

Like for them the justification of their hated is just assumed to be this really obvious thing, but as an outsider who wants to point out why they are wrong, I can't pin down this vague feeling that the religious have against us. It just seems like hatred for hatred’s sake, and being part of a community that repeats this idea that no one has ever thought to question. Then again, a lot of aspects of religion are like that, where no one really questions anything.
If their religion explicitly says gender is ""sacred"" and ""very important to one's spiritual identity"" then they should understand how important it's to you and how they should respect your indeed very important gender identity even when it doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary.
I grew up Mormon (or a member of the church fi Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) It’s *very* binary about everything, especially gender. It’s so binary that I used to be really angry whenever people at church talked about gender/sex at birth and that your gender is sacred (there’s no difference between asab and gender in this religion). I couldn’t really understand or tell people why it made me so angry but later realized that maybe it was because I had no words to describe that maybe I wasn’t quite one gender all the way. Or that I was one sometimes but not other times (I’m some sort of genderqueer/fluid I think. 

Tl;Dr I grew up Mormon and it is *very* binary. You’re either a man or a woman based off of what genitals you were born with and you’re being tempted by satan if you ever think differently
Oh phew. I’m glad you’re not a kid living in their home anymore. 

But I totally get you on the emotional part. It’s huge not being accepted exactly as your truest, most beautiful self. And totally normal to have all those feelings of abandonment, of not being heard by the two people you count on the most in many ways. 

I’m so sorry OP. I hope the passage of time helps. Sometimes the threat of not seeing the grandkids can do the job. Hate to say it, but also you don’t want to be mis gendered in front of your kids. That’s the type of bad stuff I work hard to make sure doesn’t touch mine as much as possible.
I’m really sorry to hear that. I sincerely hope things improve. No matter what you deserve to be respected and you really shouldn’t tolerate anything less from your parents or anyone.
The quote from a very important piece of religious doctrine: ""Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose."" so yeah, you'd think that they'd see why it's important wouldn't you? 🙄 But I guess, I don't have a gender, so maybe that's why it's so upsetting...?
Nice to see another Mormon on here! I hope you have a good situation where you are :)
Yeah, I'm really glad that I'm not living with them any more! Thanks, it's really comforting reading your message :)
If you're NB you have a gender, unless you explicitly identify as agender.
I no longer consider myself a member, but thank you! I hope things get better with you and your family!
Yep, I don't like labels, but agender describes me accurately :)
Yeah, I've not considered myself a menver for about 2.5 years now :) I more meant someone who was raised Mormon 😅 thank you 😊
No worries! It’s also nice to see someone on here who has kinda the same background!"	122ecyi	NonBinary	68	1.0	2023-03-26 07:20:42
Misgendered... by my mother.	"I'm nonbinary (born AFAB, they/them pronouns). I came out and I I had to explain literally everything.

I always thought my mother was supportive, she always asked more about the community, to try and be a better ally. But today she blurted out, ""you ***ARE*** a woman"". I've previously explained the pain and dysphoria deadnaming and misgendering do. And she still said it.

It cut me like a knife, and I don't know what to do.

For some more context, she was talking about ""specifically in the eyes of healthcare"", but it just shows she lacks the knowledge that trans-healthcare is a thing, or fully understands that people ***who are not women***, may have a vagina or a uterus.

I feel like I should be mad at her.

But instead I'm just I'm so disgusted with myself, I've never been so fully reviled by myself before. I hate my own mind. I hate my body. I hate myself. I don't even want to keep breathing. I can't speak up or say anything, my mother is proud and won't admit she's done any wrongdoing, she's already gone back to acting like she hasn't said anything wrong, because in her eyes she hasn't.

That's it, I just needed to blow, thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the support, everybody. I decided I need to have a long discussion with my mother, and how she phrased her words. I think she understood the impact her of words, and how it affected me. She said she still can't fully understand what I feel inside, and I don't expect her to be able to, but she apologized to me for what she said, and how she said it, as well as how it made me feel. Thanks again everybody, for the support. <3"	"Oh my god. I'm sorry you went through this. This is an unacceptable way to treat someone who's trans / non binary. I am going through my own tough time as well, my own family or rather whatever small contact I had left with them evaporated.

They didn't accept my coming out. They outright rejected it. I was told that I'm mentally sick, that non binary isn't a thing. That I should get a therapist to stop not conforming to my assigned gender at birth.

And yeah, it hurts like hell.

If you want to talk, my dm's are open.
This sounds like a really unpleasant situation, to say the least. I'm sorry you had to go through that. You are valid and your feelings are valid and even though it may not feel like it right now you matter; you mean something.
Is your mother your doctor, or your health insurance? If so, her opinion on your medical care and situation doesn't matter. Feel free to tell her so.
I’m sorry your mom’s a dick."	yuyagg	NonBinary	67	0.96	2022-11-14 12:44:54
How to explain my own sexual orientation without invalidating my partner/others?	"Hello! I am a cisgender woman with a nonbinary partner. I love them so much and it has almost been the best full year of my life with them! Recently, we got into a conversation about what I personally identify as. I said I was straight and they said that since I am dating them I can't be straight. I have had sex with women and nonbinary people, but typically prefer men.

It is hard to explain, but I have a lot of LGBTQ+ friends who would scoff at me for saying I was anything but straight regardless of my partners orientation. I had sex with women when I was in my late teens, and while it was something I was exploring, I never came out as bi. But I do feel like I appreciate everyone.

Let me also preface this with the fact that I was raised Christian and still am one. I feel like I am not as educated on this with years of being sheltered. I've had conversations with a few friends who are not straight and they said that since my partner is biologically a man and has a peen, that I can't really say that I am not straight since that is usually what I prefer anyways. So I am super afraid of invalidating people who are bi/gay/queer/pan by saying I am too. But now I feel like I am invalidating my partner as well. I suppose I didn't go into our relationship thinking about my own sexual orientation, more that they were a person I was extremely interested in.

I didn't know what to title this, and I guess I have just been thinking more about this and would like some opinions. I also want to say that the conversation ended with my partner seeing where I am coming from in the sense that I don't want to throw around labels when I don't know or don't want to invalidate others. I am sorry if this comes off as tone deaf, I am not the best at articulating my thoughts!

EDIT: Holy shite guys! This has been the most helpful thing I have done so far. Thank you ALL for being straightforward and honest and breaking it down for a dumb idiot like me! But in all seriousness, this post has given me a lot to consider and think about, but also has given me more peace and knowledge about the whole thing. Whether I am straight, pan, minsexual, bi-sexual, ""straight-ish"", heteroflexible (I think this is the one I relate to most so far), I feel like myself AND my partner have been extremely supported in this post. THANK YOU! And keep commenting!"	"Terms like gay, straight and bi were added to our lexicon before culture had a clear understanding that gender isn't binary (and neither is sex!), and that sex doesn't define gender. Now, we do understand those things, and the terms we adopted before then now have ambiguity in them. Does a man who says he's gay mean he's attracted to masc identifying people? Non-fem-identifying? People with penises? Something else? The term has ambiguity; it's his responsibility to clarify exactly what he means by saying he's gay.

Non-binary people are free to use gay, straight, lesbian etc if they feel it will adequately express their general attraction preferences. So can people who are interested in non-binary people. The ambiguity present in those terms makes them inclusive by default. I personally identify as a non-binary lesbian, for example, because I feel that label adequately expresses who I'm interested in.

We also have other orientation labels that are explicitly non-ambiguously inclusive of non-binary identities. For example, trixic, toric, neptunic, marsic, uranic. Some of these are based on the person identifying being non-binary, some include non-binary in their attraction, some specifically are based only on the attraction without specifying the identifier's gender.  When you think about it, there's really no reason that I have to define my orientation towards others based on who *I* am. I don't have to be non-binary attracted to women, I can be just *attracted to women.* There are hundreds of orientation labels out there to choose from, just like there are hundreds of gender labels to choose from under the non-binary umbrella.

Remember that these terms are also generalities. A man who says he's straight isn't attracted to every single woman on the planet. It's just a general indication of the people he might find attractive. There may be some women he's not attracted to, or some men that he is, but that doesn't negate his identity as a straight man because he's *generally* interested in women. It's not an exhaustive specification. It's also possible to use different words in different contexts. I might use nblw, or lesbian, or trixic or some other label, depending on whom I'm speaking with. By default, if I'm talking to a cis man, I'd probably reach for lesbian since that's something they're likely familiar with. In my non-binary support group, I use trixic, because they understand that term.

Bottom line, everyone has a unique experience of attraction, and each individual gets to pick the words they use to try to describe it. There aren't any wrong answers. There are no label police. Non-binary people, and those who love us, can use any words they feel are accurate when describing their own attraction.
I am non binary/ transmasculine and my husband has gone with referring to himself as ""a bit gay"" 😂

I think he's always considered himself straight, and I know he isn't attracted to men. I think we both acknowledge he is mainly attracted to women, but he says he's ""gay for me"".

I find it validating for him to say things like that and for him to understand that our relationship is not a straight one. He's embraced being in a queer relationship and even made me a very gay rainbow covered card for our anniversary this year. 

As others have said - your relationship is not straight, but that doesn't mean you aren't. In order to validate your partner, embrace the queerness of your relationship. Key thing is that they know you love them for who they are, and everything that includes.
You can be straight and date a non-binary person, but your relationship might be queer at least to your partner because of their queer identity.
Think of it this way: a straight person can be in a relationship with a queer person, but that doesn't make it a straight relationship. Say for example you were dating a trans man instead of a non binary person. You're straight,  hell he may be too, but because there is a queer person in it, the relationship itself is not strictly straight. Doesn't invalidate any part of anyone's identity, relationship dynamics are a separate thing from individual identities. My partner identifies as a lesbian, but I'm not a girl; just a fem-leaning enby.
I am a non binary person who is dating a man. I have ""female body parts."" It has been incredibly important to me in our relationship that he recognizes that it is queer and he doesn't see me as a ""woman"" but sees me as a queer person. Because that is who I am and I love my trans identity. He also recognized when he started being attracted to me that it made him queer which was super amazing and important in the two of us taking the next step in our relationship (sex). If he told me that he was straight but still interested in me I would not have been able to engage in a sexual relationship with him because it would mean that he was seeing me as my genitalia and not the gender that I am. That being said he is not an openly queer person and is also not like coming out to his friends as a queer person. He just makes it very clear to me that he sees me as who I am. I am not sure because its relatively new but I think he is just very okay with engaging with me as if we are two people, no gender roles at all. Another example of him recognizing my identity is one time he gifted me a plant and I was like wow we are now two gay dads, and he agreed. He uplifts the masculine side within me. I am a top in our relationship and I use his preferred gender pronouns. recently he asked me what I, as the top, wanted to be called and I chose the name ""Sir."" He said that this was okay and he calls me that when we are having sex now. This makes me feel incredibly safe and affirmed when we are having sex because I know that he sees me exactly for who I am and not the \*typical societal gender that comes with my parts\* I think it is the most important that you take the time to make your partner feel like you are aware and care/enjoy the queer portion of themselves. It could be harmful to them if you were having sex but still imaging them as ""a man"" when having sex.
I agree with your partner tbh. Anybody in a queer relationship isn't straight by definition. That sounds like a series of conversations with your partner and some serious thinking for you as to how you are yourself and your partner. I understand not wanting to use labels that don't apply to you but I know I'd worry about how my partner sees me if they said they were straight while dating me
Does your partner present masculine? You might be able to use the label Minsexual if they do. It refers to attraction towards people who are ""masculine in nature."" [https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Minsexual](https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Minsexual) 

Alternatively, terms like torensexual and uranic can be used to refer to attraction towards males and NB folk. [https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Torensexual](https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Torensexual) / [https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Uranic](https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Uranic) 

Since you also discuss appreciating everyone, you could consider bi with a preference.
Straightish?

As a genderfluid nonbinary AMAB trans-fem who predominantly presents masc, or (more simply) Enby, have a love/hate relationship with labels. And I'm not even mentioning my sexuality, which I don't understand how people don't see the weirdness in asking that within breaths of introductions.
You can just be unlabeled. Labels are sometimes more effort than they’re worth.
My partner and I went through a similar thing last year. He's cisgender hetero, and I came out as nonbinary (AFAB). I personally think, in my case at least, that it's totally fine for him to refer to himself as straight if that's how he identifies. 

I don't think it's my place to tell him how he should identify just because I've had realisations about my own gender identity. Partly because I don't want to force any kind of identity crisis on him (especially if he's not in a headspace to go through it), and partly because it's just not up to me.

We already know that we're in a queer relationship; we're polyamorous and I'm ace + panromantic. Him being straight doesn't change that for us. We've talked about it a few times and we're still on the same page. I've checked in with him about it again because of this post. I'm also not ready to be outed to most of the people around us, so this dynamic and labelling is still working for us currently.

He shows me every day that he is incredibly loving and supportive of me, my identity, my gender, and our relationship as a whole, so I don't feel worried about it. Maybe as we become more comfortable and accustomed to my nonbinary identity over time, this could change. I'm considering top surgery and we've talked about how that might change things between us (for example, will he still be attracted to me and want to be with me romantically, etc), but we will make sure to keep communicating with each other about how we're feeling.

I saw the mention of ""straight-ish"" and if you feel like that works for you then why not say it? ☺️ Otherwise if you feel like explaining the situation to people (and if your partner is okay with it) you could explain you've historically identified as straight but since your partner has come out as nonbinary you recognise there might be some re-evaluation of your orientation. But I'd say this is totally up to you, it's your identity! I do really appreciate that you want to make sure you're also respecting and validating your partner at the same time.

I think it's important that you're still showing your partner that you support them and care about them, and you keep communicating together and try to stay on the same page. That speaks more to me about how you validate them, than whether you personally identify as straight(ish) or not. 😊

Edited to add a couple of points that I forgot before ☺️
Straight includes can enbys also I would say any relationship with a queer person is a queer relationship
Tbh, you sound pretty bisexual to me. Having more attraction to men doesn’t make you any less bi. I don’t know which people you talked to, but the comment about being biologically a man sounds extremely invalidating of your partner’s identity and your sexuality, I can smell enbyphobia and biphobia from miles away.
I suggest explore your attraction and find a label if you want or you can stay unlabeled.  That is always an option. I say I'm queer or unlabeled when asked my sexuality because I don't know how I feel about women and nb people and my own gender isn't binary so it was easier to stay vague lol.
I am curious. Why do you prefer to identify as straight? I ask because you say that you’ve also had sex with more than one person with a vulva, and only ‘typically’ prefer men. 

This sounds, to me, as though you are not actually completely straight, regardless of the labels you choose to use. 

You are you, and how you identify is up to you and not me. I’m not trying to force any particular identity on you. It’s just a contradiction I noticed and I’m curious what your thoughts are. 

I will also add that bi erasure is real, and that feeling like one isn’t bi ‘enough’ because of it is pretty common. 

I’m wondering how ‘mostly straight’, or ‘heteroflexible’ feel for you. Or, just in terms of using ‘straight’ and dating a nonbinary person, sharing your sexuality as ‘straight and (partner)’. That might be the way forward for where you’re at right now, claiming your primary attraction while also acknowledging your partner.
People of any orientation label (aside from aroace) can be attracted to nonbinary people. So yeah.
you could just say you prefer not to say or unlabeled, im not a super educated person on this but thats what i thought
Easiest way is to divide the world down into two categories: people i'd bang and people I wouldn't. In the former category for me are a variety of people, coincidentally most of whom are (cis or trans) women or outside the binary. There are some men in there too, but that's probably 5% of the pool of people. I'm tempted to call myself pansexual, because I don't really feel like gender is a consideration for me. There are patterns to the majority of the people I'd date, but no hard and fast rules. Gender-based labeling is super reductionist when you get right down to it, because there are a lot more considerations than gender (if it's even a consideration at all) to who people fall in love with or have sex with. By all means use whatever language gets the information across, but don't feel obligated to use a label. 

Here's a rather cliche example of what I mean. Some guy you're not at all interested in walks up to you at the bar and says ""You're cute, would you like to go on a date sometime?"". Does it matter in that moment if you're straight, bisexual, or a lesbian? Does it matter if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend (or NB partner) already? Does it matter how you identify your gender? Does it matter how he identifies? No, none of this matters. It's all a moot point, because he falls into the ""people you wouldn't bang/date"" category. The *why* is of no consequence.

I think your LGBT friends who say your relationship is straight because your partner was assigned male at birth probably have some internalized transphobia to work on.
> I have a lot of LGBTQ+ friends who would scoff at me for saying I was anything but straight regardless of my partners orientation. [...]  I've had conversations with a few friends who are not straight and they said that since my partner is biologically a man and has a peen, that I can't really say that I am not straight since that is usually what I prefer anyways. 

I am glad that I don't have any LGBTQ+ friends who are this gatekeepy about identity. From sound of it, these friends don't really take your partner's identity seriously enough to think it reflects on your orientation.

Yeah, this puts you in a tough spot.

You'll probably find people here fall on the anti-gatekeeping side of things, which in my opinion is for the best.

> I am super afraid of invalidating people who are bi/gay/queer/pan by saying I am too.

It is common for people to worry about being impostors with this kind of thing.

You will find a lot of posts in this subreddit of people who are super afraid of invalidating nonbinary people by saying that they are too. Generally the response is along the lines ""please stop worrying about that."" If you browse some bisexual discussion forums, you'll find roughly the same thing. These categories are vague.

Hell, you just need to look at the sidebars. r/nonbinary's sidebar is worded pretty broadly:

> A subreddit for people of every stripe who feel that they don't fit into a preference-binary or gender-binary culture.

And same for the r/bisexual sidebar:

> This group is for discussion and support for those who fall in between, for the ""shades of gay"" in what is often assumed to be one or the other: * bisexuals * pansexuals * omnisexuals * queers * non-straight individuals ... or anyone who doesn't quite fit the otherwise binary ""straight"" and ""gay"" pattern. If you can't work out if you're straight, gay, or anywhere in between... you should probably visit us.

They're broad for a reason. There's enough tendency to self-gatekeep about this stuff that additional gatekeeping and drawing-of-lines is generally unhelpful.
You get to identify however you want & with What feels comfortable to you. Who you are dating does not change who you are & how you identify. 

See: Bi women finally owning this when they marry men. If you think of yourself as straight, if you feel straight, you’re straight.
As a non-binary person who doesn’t identify as either a woman or man, well being non-binary can be classified as a third gender (especially when you’re agender) and straight people are attracted to the opposite gender....  you can still be straight.

Since your a cis women dating a non-binary person, it’s still “technically” straight depending on what labels you prefer.  

But also it’s fine for non-binary people to use the term lesbian, gay, bi etc.

If you love them then should a label matter? Only if you are trying to figure out who you are yes.
This is something that I needed. I think being raised in a sheltered environment and not having a clear explanation of this has been harmful to how I think. In the church, these words are not ambiguous. They just mean what they mean. Thank you for writing all of this out!!
I couldn't have said it better myself. And yeah, there is no catch all term for probably anyone's attractions.  
  
  
As another example, I'm non binary and AMAB and attracted *primarily* to male personality traits and appearances. However, I have been very attracted to very feminine people, in fact my first serious relationship was with a girl. And genitals dont really matter to me at all.  
  
If I HAD to pick a term, I *guess* homoflexible is the *most* accurate, but that's not really all encompassing.
I love this comment! One thing that made me want to make this post is the fact that my partner is 30 years old, they are very secure in who they are and it’s honestly not something they talk about a lot since they have identified as non-binary for nearly 10 years. Your comment really helped me see the worth in still validating them and keeping the conversation going so they knew I truly love every bit of them!!
I don’t know, I’m a straight trans man and if I’m dating a het woman the relationship isn’t queer unless I identify otherwise.  Trans doesn’t automatically equal queer—it’s up to the individual’s identification.  So I wouldn’t say any relationship with a trans person isn’t strictly straight, thats pretty invalidating.  That’s implying I’m not like any other man.
Ok, this makes sense! And thank you for sharing the part at the end about your partner and yourself, it gave me something I could relate to more.
I love this comment and I am about to really be vulnerable here and be more open with this next question I have… my partner (by themselves) calls themselves Daddy in the bedroom. Or even they will use he/him pronouns and say they are my boyfriend; sometimes when they do that I am not sure how to react or think. I’m sorry if that’s TMI but it applies to this conversation! I guess if I’m being honest, in those specific moments I kind of do envision them as male. What do you think about that? Please be brutally honest because I want to learn as much as possible from this post. I don’t think of them as male outside of those moments, it’s more of like you said, they are a person and a person I love.
I think that is why this conversation stuck with me afterwards. And you are right, I think I do want to have more conversations with them and maybe do more ""research"" (? that feels so dumb to say) in the respect of figuring out how I identify/feel towards people in general. I truly don't want my partner to feel unseen or their identity to be looked over.
Thank you for this! Yes, my partner does present as masculine. This is really helpful in the sense of having a bigger vocabulary to consider if that makes sense.
Haha! I wish ""straightish"" was something that I could say, that is kind of how I feel in a sense.
This comment made me tear up a little :’) and I found your words really encouraging. Since we have been dating since almost a year, I think we have established that I love everything about them. I remind them almost daily. We have also had those conversations about if they would ever want surgery and how that would possibly change things, but I think even if they did it wouldn’t change much for me. They say no they don’t at all but realistically I know that could change. Seriously thank you, I want to be your friend lol!!! 💖
Are you saying that being straight includes attraction to enbys? Just wanting to clarify. And yes, I wouldn't say our relationship is a straight relationship for sure.
I think I already knew this, that the people who I have talked to have been a little invalidating to my experience and my partner's identity. Thank you for putting some input on what you feel my sexuality could be, although I know that it is *mine,* it helps to hear other opinions!
THIS! Not feeling ""bi"" enough. I don't think I prefer to identify as straight, but I've just been kind of told that I am by people who I assumed would tell me the truth. They typically minimize my relationships to anyone who isn't a man as ""experiences"". To me they aren't just experiences, they were people I genuinely liked. And a lot of those conversations have been with queer people so I never felt comfortable to debate them? Especially when I was younger and less educated on everything. 

So I guess that being said, I never explored different terms because I felt like I had been given one. No preference, it just kind of felt like that being straight was who I was and no wiggle room to others.

I think a lot of people have said ""heteroflexible"" and I think that is something I identify with most!
Agree on the first point, but they are not in a relationship with a male? They are in a relationship with someone who is non binary?
This is helpful. I feel like I've been trying to overthink this! 

Edit: I am not in a relationship with a male and nor do I think I am. This post WAS helpful to hear that I shouldn't feel pressured into using a label I don't feel is right.
Thank you so much. I think that is typically how I feel with my friends: I don't want to invalidate or be an ""imposter"". I think my friends sometimes misunderstand me, I am not really going through a crisis or necessarily feel like I have to ""come out"". I just want some input so I can come to my own conclusions and share it with people who I am close with. A lot of my friends have had to really explore and go through hard things to find out who they are, so I think they kind of brush me off because I don't hold as much weight to labels and stuff for myself. I will definitely be reading more in these subreddits. Thank you again!
I was thinking this too, although it would be heteroflexible since this is a cis woman with a preference to peens. Right? Eh. In the end it really doesn't matter, you can just say ""I don't label my sexuality""
I guess it is ok if they (your partner) feels good about themselves in that moment. Remember that pronouns dont equal gender, and that you might see your partner as a masculine person in that moment, and they are still nonbinary. There are people who identify as demiboy or demimasculine, for example, so those people would be partly masculine and partly nonbinary/agender. Hope you and them can talk it out and make it work for the both of you!
Hetero-flexible lol  
In all seriousness, I don't think it matters so much what orientation your friends think you are because it has no effect on them. If the way you identify is a point of discomfort for your partner, that's the only person you really need to be talking to about it! Hopefully you two can find a label that resonates with both of you and doesn't disregard your partners gender (no label is also an option!).
Don't see why you couldn't, so long as you're okay with getting into details if prompted. That's what I do. 😌

E: oh, unless your partner finds it invalidating which then another more textbookish term can be agreed upon.
I'm so happy I could help! ❤️ It sounds like you have such a lovely relationship and I'm glad you're talking things out together. Feel free to reach out anytime if you want to message/chat! 😊❤️
Yes, I am saying that straight can includes enbys
Obviously I want to clarify that you should label yourself the way you like and feel comfortable! Labelling yourself is a personal thing and other people shouldn’t decide for you.

I felt wrong leaving this post without pointing out what looked like biphobia because it sounds like you have been imposed to define yourself as straight, even if your experience and the way you define yourself says the opposite. There’s still a ton of LGBT+ people with internalized biphobia, so be careful with that. Idk, I just want to say that as a bisexual if you feel like bi, pan, queer or whatever defines your experience you are not being fake or anything like that, queer people that gatekeep sexual orientations should go out and touch some grass, that’s not cool.
Neato! Glad you found a comfy niche!

There’s a surprising amount of biphobia and bi erasure in the lgbt+ community, which is, mm, let’s say annoying. Sorry you had to deal with that. 

So, and just so it’s said at least once:
-All your relationships and experiences are valid. -There is no one right way to be not straight, and your way is an entirely good and acceptable way to do it. 
-Having a partner with a penis does not mean someone’s straight, it means they have a partner with a penis. (And hey, not everyone with a penis is a man! But even if they were, that wouldn’t somehow invalidate the totality of someone’s sexuality). Just like having a partner with a vulva would not suddenly make a person  exclusively a lesbian, really. 
-Even the most expert expert is still wrong about who you are if the label they give you feels wrong to you. You are the top expert at you. 

Oh. I’m nonbinary and my partner is straight, so it’s definitely possible, even if it’s not what’s going on with you. And I think it’s a perfectly valid i.d. for him that has nothing to do with mine, because his attitude on penises is that they’re a perfectly acceptable body part, useful to have, and not at all sexy. And there’s not really a more specific way to say that, so, ‘straight’. Works for us.

Good save! hehe 

*Don't worry, I knew what you meant.*
I would honestly suggest getting new friends or at least confronting your friends on their behaviour and sentiments and seeing if they change. The things they said in your post are not just gatekeeping and invalidating, they are straight up transphohic and biphobic, and that is absolutely not acceptable. Defining your partner by their genitals and not their ACTUAL gender identity is disgusting and disrespectful, and defining your experiences for you in a way that tells you who you are and how you should identify (and 'coincidentally' invalidates bisexuality or attraction to multiple genders) is also bigotry. I'm not saying your friends are bad people, I'm saying their behaviours are harmful and have clearly had a negative effect on your ability to determine for yourself how you feel. You should not have to depend on this sub alone to tell you you have a ultimate autonomy over describing your orientation or experiences. Your friends should be doing that. You feeling like an imposter is not a coincidence, it's because they're being awful to you and your partner, at least in the way they've discussed this topic. Queerness is not a competition, and experiencing pain or suffering because of your identity doesn't make someone more LGBTQIA or justify shitting on other people's identities.
I think that describes it better, seeing them masculine but still nonbinary. Thank you for better articulating what I am thinking in those moments lol.
As an enby trying to date, trust me, that is not generally the case.

May I recommend including a ""can"" in there? As in ""straight *can* include enbys"".
To add, while she may appreciate all people, it's unclear if her attraction (romantic and sexual) extends beyond typically masculine presenting AMAB folks.
This is a very problematic way of thinking; you still view them as their genitals, and the two do not equate. They are not a Male and don't identify as such, and personally I find this way of thinking you have really disrespectful. I am afab but will not date a straight person, as they do not see me as who I am and still see me as a woman. This person may have their own preferences, but I really implore you to look at your rhetoric and see how this just equates a person again to their genitals; and not how they actually wish to be seen
She is not in a relationship with a male. By definition this person is not a man.
Oh phew! Just making sure everyone here knew what I was referring to that was helpful lol!
Thank you for this! I always love to go back to this thread and read what people said and it was a good surprise to see someone respond to it again. I agree, and I have distanced myself a bit from those friends. I've also had many conversations with my partner about who *I think I am*. I think my friends have made me feel like I am not queer enough or loud enough about being queer. It's not important to me to shout it from the roof tops and it is not important to my partner to be loud about it either. We both just wanted me to figure myself out for *myself*. It is definitely frustrating that I received WAY more support on this thread with some of my friends but it also warms my heart that strangers support me and validate how I feel!
You are welcome!
I agree w rivercass! I think it is also valid to ask your partner how they feel about being called your ""boyfriend"" or ""daddy"" the nice thing about the non binary experience is it is very different for everyone! They are lucky to have a partner like you. I wish you guys the best of luck :)
You're completely right I'm gonna edit that real quick
I think that commenter is looking to talk about assigned sex, there aren't many non-misgender-y ways to refer to it but it's still awkwardly worded at best- a better, not-as-misgendering term would be ""assigned male at birth"" (amab for short) though it does have to be a deduction that since your assigned _gender_ is such and such, then your assigned _sex_ would be such and such. By the way merely nitpicking but, it _is_ possible to change primaaary?- mostly secondary sex characteristics with hormones and surgeries and the like, and since sex as a whole describes all of those I guess it is possible to change at least _part_ of your sex. Also I disagree with the statement about attraction just being about genitals: that exists on its own and is called ""genital preference"" btw!!
Assuming you put the ""can"" in the wrong spot by accident, I appreciate the edit and understanding. However, it wasn't my intention to force you to change it, just let you know for future reference. No pitchforks here, I swear.
[removed]
And that's why I'm not too much of a fan of using agab for sex because it usually designates gender assigned at birth in regards to the sex (except for interex people who are, actually, coercively assigned a sex at birth for a lot of them but that's a whole other subject)
Oh, XY... That sure did get heated. 

I typed out a whole response and they left. Hopefully, realizing the difference between genital preference and sexuality, leaving embarrassed but also better for now knowing. Instead of simply getting banned or frustrated, unchanged."	tb6vrn	NonBinary	65	0.95	2022-03-10 19:37:32
Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from their body?	"It's a little bit hard to describe. Ever since I became a teenager I've felt completely disconnected from my body. Whenever I look in the mirror, I don't recognise the person looking back at me as me. It's like seeing someone who lives on the same street as you, but you never speak to. I have seen them before, but I don't have any connection with them. For a long time before I realised I might be enby, I just assumed that it was my autism making me not like the change that comes with being a teenager, and that I would get used to seeing that person as me. But I'm 25 now, and I still don't know them.

I feel like my body is a burden I never asked for. I feel like moving it is annoying and cumbersome. I'm not clumsy at all, but I feel like my body parts don't move as I intend them, like there's a tiny inputlag, which I cant help but notice. Having to take care of my body is like having a pet I didn't want dumped on me, which I now have to take care of. I have to make sure it eats well, exercises, has good hygiene etc. I feel like I would be so much happier if I was just a consciousness without a physical form.

Does anyone here feel similar things? My family and friends have never understood, so I feel like I'm all alone in this. People always just say ""well, you can't just be a consciousness, you need a body to exist."" And yeah, I know that, but I wish I didn't have to. I don't know, it's hard to explain..."	"I don't feel like this all the time, but sometimes I do. There are some parts of my body that not only make me super uncomfortable but are almost confusing to me, like ""why is this here, this doesn't belong on me, it's not mine"". I've always interpreted that as part of my dysphoria. Sometimes I just look at my face and am like ""who is this person?"" it's a super weird feeling. However I don't always experience that. Especially when I'm dressed in an outfit I really like and I'm wearing my binder and I had a good day I do feel at home in my body. As I said I consider this part of my dysphoria and depression and I think the kind of disassociation you're describing *can* be a symptom of a mental illness (I am not a professional though so take this with a grain of salt)
My experience isn’t the same as yours but I am also an autistic enby and I hate most of the changes that came with being a teenager. I can’t stand seeing my facial hair in the mirror, or basically any other of my secondary sexual characteristics. It feels wrong, like it doesn’t belong.
Yeah, I can relate. For me, it’s a weird combination of autism, dysphoria, and DP/DR disorder.
Not all the time but I've definitely had moments like this.
That's why I wish I existed as pure energy.
Yeah, I totally get it. I’ve found that trying to find little things you can control about your body can make you feel better and more “you.” Like body hair? Grow it out! Hate body hair? Get rid of it! This goes for anything from hair and makeup to clothing. Maybe you want to workout and build toned, visible muscles, or maybe go for the softer appearance. Do you feel like you’ve had to hide your interests and hobbies because they don’t align with your AGAB? (I sure af did. Ugh.) Bust that shit out and feel proud. When we’re raised as something we’re not, taking back control of our identity, even incrementally, is hard, but helps a ton.

Your cis friends will never fully understand, even if they’re super supportive. Do you feel like conversations with them might be holding you back from pursuing your true self?
god yes ever since like middle school or something when i actually looked in a mirror for what felt like the first time i had my eyes open and i had no idea who the hell was staring back. my body is all weird and fatty now too, my legs dont go far enough, theyre not intricate enough its all heavy and weird, my back doesnt turn enough, my skin rolls and prevents me from moving it feels like a meat- and skeleton- suit but not me. and every day i think oh god this is just so hard I just wanna be vague c o n s c i o u s n e s s
Before I figured out that I was nonbinary, I’d often feel like I was a parasite or some sort of intruder trying to control a body that wasn’t mine. I felt like all of my movements looked wrong and inhuman to outside eyes, and it felt like I had almost no control of my limbs, so I walked with my arms stiffly at my sides at all times to minimize it. This was like, 2-3 times a month minimum where’d I’d have days like that. I haven’t had one since coming out last February (I’m 41), but I also have been unpacking a lot of childhood trauma and I’m not sure what’s helping more.
I use to, but aesthetic and medical transition has changed that. 

I see myself in the mirror now
That's how I felt 19 and younger before I started my medical transition

It's brilliant how much of a joy your own can be with the right healthcare

(I'm not autistic)
I kind of used to feel like that. It helps to make it match. Grow your hair out, or cut it, dress in gender-affirming clothes, or ask someone to call you by new pronouns.
I can vibe with a lot of this. I have a history of childhood trauma and eating disorder though, which complicates things. As I move along in my transition though I feel more connected to my body. At the very least I have worked to be more grateful for my body and the things that it allows me to do. Which has really helped ❤️
You could consider working with a (queer and trans competent) therapist who also incorporates body-based or mindfulness into their therapy sessions. Sometimes doing ‘feeling’ exercises (where you can connect to your body without looking at it or its pieces) can help you connect without facing the dysphoria. Worth a shot if you can find someone good.
I do this, too. My therapist told me it's a type of dissociation.
I relate. I felt the same way for years. Think it's partially depression, disassociating, denial, dysmorphia.
so fucking much. every day.
yes, i had feelings if depersonalization. hrt has helped me see myself in the mirror
Not quite the same, but kind of similar. I do recognize my reflection, but only when I look at it? When I'm not looking at my reflection, I don't really have any sense of appearance. It feels more like what I see in the mirror is the avatar I control, which is also what other people see. Honestly, it doesn't really feel like I have a visible form, but my reflection just shows my ""skin"" if we're speaking in video game terms.
Yeah, I have been thinking of it as a type of dysphoria, but I wasn't sure if it could be described as such. I'm happy to see that other people recognise the feeling.

Someone else mentioned DP/DR disorder and that might be something I'm suffering from.
I reacted by completely ignoring all the changes. I never shaved, and lived almost denying that I had grown a beard.
Heyyy autistic dpdr gang 😎 🤜. Sorry I don't meet people with dpdr often lol
I had never heard of DP/DR disorder. I think I will mention that to my psychiatrist. Thank you!
Yes! Exactly!
I've been trying to do that, especially the getting rid of body hair part. I really like it, and it does make me happy, but it's a massive pain to do and it doesn't last that long. It's frustrating that I can't just feel at home in my body like it is.

It definitely isn't all bad, I have felt more free than ever before since I stopped suppressing all the parts of me that I thought weren't ""manly"" enough. I have been able to express sides of myself that I've been hiding away for my entire life!

On the part about my friends. I'm not sure if conversations with them are holding me back. I'm not actually out to any of my friends yet. I've only shared as much with them as I can get away with blaming on my autism. I really want to come out, but I keep finding any reason to postpone it... 

I'm sure they would all be supportive eventually, but I'm afraid of the conversation. One of them always says that he doesn't care about gender, only biological sex, whenever we discuss gender.
Lol. That’s okay. Neither do I.

""you're not gay""-!!!!  and she is adamant.  I have tried many times to gently explain to her that my orientation isn't related to that;  she is fixated on sexuality  Personally I would love to have a female lover but that has so far eluded me.  My husband is a partner,  a business associate,  a comrade,  a trustee.  I didn't grow up in a free society.  My male/female self has been all inclusive .  I LOVE me as I am .  I am the embodiment of all gender.  I feel I am gender transcendent-  
i am not sure why I posted this except that with boobs and babies it is hard for ppl to grasp ME.  I am not angsty about their confusion but....  I suppose this is for other enby kindred out there to say it doesn't really matter what other ppl so or so not understand.  WE are amazing creatures.  We embody much magic .  Never try to stifle any part of you"	"It's always good to hear from older folks finding themselves and being happy. It's not like someone invented gender somewhere around 2010 and now suddenly every other kid is having a personal crisis because of it. We are and always have been marvelous creatures with a lot of different facets that can't be described simply as man or woman.

And there's absolutely no need to conform to people who don't understand that. Of course you can try to educate your mom, but if she doesn't get it, she doesn't get it. I tried with my parents, who are about your age, and they don't really get it either. But they're fine with me being me, if it makes me happy, and that's good enough for me.
This filled my heart so much. Thank you for this! Saved it for a rainy day when I need a little boost and this beautiful reminder 🖤
40 yr old Enby here.  

I regularly tell people ""I don't care how YOU see me I know who I am""

I present as a very butch women, sometimes a very femme man (really depends on the day) but as long as there are tits apparently that makes me women.  SIGH.

My family, friends and partner know who I am so IDGAF about randos on the street
Much love, and respect
Agreed! Wonderful words you said. 😊
Thank you for this! What you said resonated so much with me. I love this and I love you!
To often, I feel we haven’t made much progress with gender identity. Then I read stories like this and think progress is not linear. It never was. Thank you for sharing your story.
This is a beautiful and powerful message! Thank you for sharing it with us. We are non-binary, we will not settle for a lie. We know who we are.
Thank you. Seeing older enbies makes me so happy and fulfilled because I do get down with people telling me enbies are brand new and never existed until now etc. so when older enbies come around I get to say HAH! We have been here forever!!
so cool .  makes me happy -"	11gojrn	NonBinary	63	0.99	2023-03-03 02:24:16
Boss apologized to me for using the wrong pronouns!	"Hi all! I just feel so thrilled about what happened yesterday that I wanted to share it with all of you!

As a little background, I graduated from university last winter and just began a job in IT. My workplace tends to be mostly older men, so as a twenty-something nonbinary person who usually presents as fairly feminine, I feel a little out of place sometimes. I'm always afraid of seeming ""weird"" to them or whatever, so I've mostly kept my pronouns (they/them) on the DL, putting them in my signature line for emails, my work profile, and things like that, but not actively correcting anybody or introducing myself with my pronouns. I know I shouldn't feel compelled to act this way, but it's a force of habit for me to not assert myself and my needs, which I'm working on. For most of my life I've been surrounded by judgmental people and have only just gained the freedom to start coming out to some people as nonbinary, so it's ingrained in me to downplay my identity as self-preservation.

So yesterday at work, my boss called me into his office to talk. My mind immediately freaked out thinking I did something wrong, so I tried to lighten the mood by saying, ""Uh-oh, am I in trouble for something?""

And he said, ""No, I'M in trouble."" And he went on to explain that he noticed my pronouns in my email earlier and felt horrible about using she/her for me previously. I immediately told him it's not a big deal ultimately, but he stopped me and said, ""But it's a big deal to YOU, therefore it's a big deal to ME."" He told me he was going to do his best to use my proper pronouns going forward and said he wants me to feel comfortable being myself at work. I never expected to be treated this way at work because I was so scared of it backfiring if I was open about my identity, but I'm so happy to learn I had nothing to worry about and that my boss has got my back!

So yeah, that's it, just wanted to share a positive experience I had about being nonbinary at work and maybe give some hope to anyone who's worried about not being accepted if they come out :)"	"Wow that is awesome, I am really happy for you!  Your boss seems awesome
Wow, that’s great!
that's great, i'm glad you have a good boss!
Aw that's awesome!

"turns out my ""cis"" husband is actually nonbinary!"	"(he still uses he/him pronouns)

Him and I have been talking about gender a TON since i first figured out that i have dysphoria. And he kept making comments that would make me wonder about his relationship to gender. Now two years into my gender journey, we had a very in-depth convo in which he opened up a lot about his thoughts about his gender (or actually lack of). And i was just like babe... that doesn't sound too cis. like of course, i completely respect whatever label he feels comfortable with but i just explained that his feelings were very very common among nonbinary people. And i just encouraged him to consider the possibility that it might make him happier to be more open about his feeling that he has no gender identity. He had some misgivings about it at first but now he's decided that he is comfortable using the label nonbinary! He's still a very private person and would rather keep it mostly among our friends. But i'm so happy for him! And i feel even closer to him that we share this part of our identities!"	"That sounds a little similar to my own story.  I managed to convince myself for about 4 \*years\* that I was still cis despite literally already thinking of myself as agender.

For me, the illusion was shattered eventually when my sense that my apparently ""straight"" attractions and broadly ""conforming"" gender expression should be being read as queer finally bubbled to the surface.

um no one here knows who i am? or who he is? i don't know how that's really outing him if i'm speaking fairly anonymously.
It's reddit not fb, leave them alone

As a Non-Binary person, I wanna remind my enbies that you don't need to be andro to pass.	I mean you could if you want to but you see, for a while.. I was hooked onto the idea that I needed to look andro. So I'd try my best to do it and it disappointed me when I didn't. But here's the thing about being non binary. It's a spectrum of things. Just because you're not andro doesn't mean you don't basically pass as non binary. Let me explain: Non-Binary simply means you don't feel like just a boy or just a girl, right? And most people aren't physically born non binary (btw not talking about our very valid intersex siblings) so in other words, non binary can look anyway you want to pass. Like if you're agender (like me) you could look more girl-ish or more boy-ish and still be Agender because gender expression is different to gender identity. And if you were non binary and wanted to look andro then go ahead, my beautiful hooman. All I'm saying is, there's not just one way to pass as non binary and hell you don't even have to try because no matter how you look, you'd pretty much already pass as the definition of non binary. Sorry, I know I'm bad at explaining but I hope this makes sense.	"I am not really sure if talking about passing is the same as talking about gender identity vs expression. But I totally agree with the spirit of what you are saying!!!!❤️

Passing is when you are just assumed your gender by people. It’s kinda a downer but in most places there is no passing as non-binary. I have just kind of accepted that people will never automatically use my pronouns unless I’m wearing a pin or something, and some people won’t even use them if I tell them.  But passing is caught up in cishet normativaty that I am really trying hard to get myself out of. But it is really difficult :(
That is kind of my dream, but my physical body is having none of it. I like the freedom of being on the internet where it doesn't matter and I can be comfortable in being myself.

My dad keeps calling me Lasdie	"I recently explained the whole nonbinary thing to him and he keeps going to say Lass, stumbling on the ""s"" and trying to switch to lad halfway through, resulting in Lasdie. And honestly I love it."	"Lol I love this. And other variations might be ""laddess"" and ""laddette""
That’s adorable!
You know that could be the new honorific. Very creative
Ooh laddess I love that."	lvcg8w	NonBinary	59	0.97	2021-03-01 15:47:19
I finally came out to everyone.	"On facebook i have a lot of my fiancés family and family friends, and since today is national coming out day, i came out. 

Here is what i posted:
""Happy national coming out day!
I'll take this day as a (scary) opportunity to share that I identify as nonbinary.

Nonbinary means that i don't identify with either male or female, and i prefer to be seen as androgynous. Not all nonbinary people want androgyny though, and that's okay! 

I'd like to ask of the people in my life to use they/them pronouns for me, and to just call me Leo.

I understand its a weird change, and i'm not that fussed about it, but if you love and respect me, at least try.""

And surprisingly only one person was aggressively transphobic and trying to be transphobic to my 1 year old son? Idk why really it was weird, like this post was about me and not him. He's literally a baby.

Another one was this 50 year old family friend that while they came off as rude, they just didn't understand it so they in the end asked me to explain it to them in messages. Messaged them with a very simplified explanation of what being nonbinary means, and they even thanked me for explaining it to them. It was nice :)

The rest of the people that commented were defending me from the transphobe and being like ""good for you"" and ""i'm proud of u for coming out"" and were generally just really nice and supportive. I wasnt misgendered once in the entire comment section and it made me so happy."	"That's awesome. I'm trying convince myself to come out as well. I changed my public pronouns on social media. I just dont want to come out for the wrong reasons. This gave me alot of confidence and I'm gonna take some notes from it.
Very cool, I am so glad for you that your coming out went so well 😊. I came out to my best friends ( we are a group of 6 queer artists) this weekend and it was only love and support 🥰. Though i did not expect anything different, earlier this year one of my friends from that group came out as genderfluid and whilst researching to understand and support them better i kinda realized that i am enby myself and their coming out in our group was also very supportive and accepting, but still one feels pretty vulnerable whilst coming out.
I am so glad to hear this. I just came out at work today. I'm sure there is going to be a lot of reminding people about my pronouns, but so far, no negativity.
Thats great to hear
I'm so proud of you.  It is terrifying to come out, especially with a bunch of people nowadays being hella transphobic.
You are wonderful and I'm glad you came out as your authentic self ♥️
P.S. honestly fuck what other people think.  Just be you!
Congratulations Leo!
wow i wish
You do this at your own pace and when you feel ready. I changed my pronouns on my socials months ago too, and i'm proud of you for taking that step too!!
Aww thats such a nice story! You deserve support and loads of it, and i'm proud if you for coming out to your friends!!
> but still one feels pretty vulnerable whilst coming out.

It took me a fucking year to come out to my queer friend group that already knows I'm bi. I got into the group from a non-binary friend and was scared I'd look like a poser. Stupid, but either way it's scary enough to come out to people who know what it means and you know wont ask questions like ""what's non-binary"", way more scary coming out to people who have no idea and even if they're an ""Ally"" start spouting shit out of ignorance. Somewhat innocent ignorance, but ignorance all the same. The ignorance I've got from my wife's friends has been very fucking unsettling.
Hey congrats on coming out!! I'm proud of you :)
And they'll hopefully get used to it quickly
Thank you so much 🥺❤❤
Thank you!!
It's hard i know. You got this though, one day you'll be able to come out and be your true self ❤
Thanks :) I do find it alot more validating coming out. Its a very nice feeling.
Thanks ☺️ It’s interactions like this why i love this subreddit so much
To come off like an imposter was a concern of mine too, but i guess most of us had something like this or the thought „am i enby enough to use the label“  floating through our minds one time or the other.
I feel ya, even if the ignorance doesn’t come from bad intentions it still hurts and is tiring. How does you wife react to the behavior of her friends towards you?
Aww my gosh 🥺🥺
Exactly... It is a sort of imposter syndrome... Especially since I get misgendered mostly as cishet male, I feel like I don't deserve the label because I'm not transitioning or wearing makeup or skirts or whatever, not as obviously queer as other folks I know and selfies on this subreddit... But I know the biggest reason is I'm scared and I just feel safer, and honestly it'd just add to existing social anxiety. In the end, I know cis people don't deal with these feelings, and I remind myself that. It'd be a lot easier, and it's not that way.

My wife, honestly she didn't do well. She wasn't saying ignorant shit like her friend, but they were both misgendering me right in front of me, not on purpose. It was odd, her friend said ""so I hear you go by they/them, that's cool"". And then right after they keep using ""he"" for me right in front of me, like they didn't pick up what was just said. Ignorant, like didn't put together yeah use they/them, but not on purpose either that I could tell. And I'll put it this way, I had to explain to her friend why Elliot Page isn't ""doing it for attention"", why it's bad to deadname them, and why it actually validates people like myself and my enby friend to have public representation. She listened, but it's upsetting that's her first response ""yeah you're cool but other people do it for attention"".

My wife was also outing me for a bit like ""he doesn't identify as a man"" without even telling me, and I had to explain why I don't want to be outed, and that it's at least better to say ""they identify as non-binary""... I told her she can out me now at her discretion but that was rough. Like all her friends knew without me even having a clue. She told me she didn't understand, if it was her she'd just be ""out"", so it really is plain ignorance like not understanding how I feel and why I feel it. She really apologized and cried and said she wants to do right by me. She loves me to death but she's still learning. Much better now, just a very rough start..

Oh god and she told me ""my work friend wants to know what you think of the latest Chapelle show"". Im like hmm why... Oh maybe it's transphobic... I try watching it with her. It's the most transphobic shit I've seen. I'm like YEAH HUN IT FUCKING SUCKS. I don't think she understood why that was a little upsetting to watch. I turned it off before the end, around when he started saying he agreed with TERFs.

The important thing is it's always been ignorance, when I explains things she listens, and she does get better. It's not out of hate, it's out of ignorance and she wants to do right by me.
Oh no, coming out is such a personal thing, that really sucks! If it is ok for you, feel hugged from me. My ex was like that too, more with my mental health stuff, but i told him x and y trigger me and if you than do z it really makes my life just harder, he followed it twice and the third time over he went back to doing z again, or with some things he never followed it, one of the reasons he is now my ex. Maybe she understands it better if you ask her how she would feel if she found out she is pregnant and you would immediately tell everybody.
Thank you ❤️

I'm sorry to hear you went through that... Definitely toxic, and glad he's your ex. That all sounds very intentional on his part... That absolutely isn't acceptable. It's one thing to be ignorant, another to be intentionally hurtful.

Yeah, she really really tries. She's never done anything to intentionally hurt me, only been confused about what's appropriate and why I might feel a certain way, like not wanting to be outed before I was ready, and how I might still get hurt hearing transphobic stuff like that last Chapelle show even if I'm not visibly trans. Just sucks to see that's how so many people see us, sucks to see how popular that opinion is, and I'm not sure she understands that a big reason I'm not visibly trans is BECAUSE of shit like that being so mainstream.

But she tries, and anything I've brought up we've moved past and she has always listened and responded with love. I'm not worried about her at all. I just think that her understanding of everything has grown and it was a rocky start, but still just out of ignorance. And besides I've been ignorant of her own specific issues. It's not about magically not being ignorant as much as learning from it.
Thanks ☺️. 
Yes that was quit something with him, he has a bachelors degree in social work, so he should have known better, but he is very egocentric he just saw his own inconviences🤷. Ok that sounds promising, as long as your wife is listening and tries to do better it has the potential to turn out great. I guess it has to be appreciated that such a coming out is for a partner quite a process too, especially when it seems that they haven’t had that much contact with queer folks. And the media portrayal doesn’t help very much, even the more positive examples are still problematic. There far too few fictional characters that just are enby, trans, pan or in some other way queer, just as a trait of them and not their entire plot."	q5zqek	NonBinary	62	1.0	2021-10-11 16:31:09

really don’t know how to explain to people that this is the same person. Side note: I did the mustache look, felt hella euphoric and my mom told me I look gross so ouch		"that breaks my heart cuz that mustache look is absolutely what i strive for!! it looks so fucking good and attractive! i really love the fancy make up you did with it, it goes well with the gender-fuck
Wow, fuck your mom
All the looks are awesome. I would like a tutorial on how to do the mustache, super cool
You look amazing!!
thank you 🥺she really doesn’t understand the whole not a girl thing. And if u ever wanna try it I used an itty bitty paint brush and liquid lipstick and just did tiny strokes !
yeah...she makes it pretty rough to express my identity.
I’ll have to make one for you then! :)
thank you!!
Ugh. Get out of there, if you can. It's not worth living in a space filled with that kind of disrespect.
I’m trying to. I’m working towards going to my dream school in Philly, and once I’m there I’m not going to be in as much contact with her. Which will be good for me"	jcbuip	NonBinary	59	0.98	2020-10-16 15:26:57
After 7 years, I’m re-coming out as nonbinary!	"My gender journey started out with realising that I wasn’t super attached to my AGAB at 14, and that I didn’t like the changes puberty was bringing. I DID like being called they/them, so I came out to my friends as nonbinary- Greygender, quickly changed to agender, was the first thing I came out as. I fiercely hated being called a woman and insisted on gender neutral language. (Being 2015 or so this was difficult)

However around 15 I noticed that I wanted to be viewed as male and I wanted many of the changes hormones would bring. I didn’t mind being called he. In fact I desperately wanted to physically transition and I would throw aside any and all preferences I had for my presentation just so I’d pass as male. So I thought, well, I must be a trans man, and I came out as that.

I physically transitioned and it fixed huge amounts of physical dysphoria that I had. I knew and still know im a man; it feels right. But at the same time I still sort of identified as nonbinary, but I essentially got stuck in this logic loop:

-I feel a huge connection to gender queerness that I don’t want to get rid of
-if I was nonbinary that would mean im not a man
-I’m definitely a man, so I can’t be nonbinary

However it wouldn’t go away that being a man wasn’t the full story. Presenting as a man didn’t feel wrong, but it did feel like something was missing. I liked he but I liked they more. I liked masculine language but gender neutral was also very at home. I love looking visibly queer and dressing in gender nonconformity ways. I would describe it as dressing femme but that didn’t feel right either.

I think three things struck me at the same time. One- I had legitimate dysphoria about cutting my hair, looking more masculine. Two- my enby friends were describing how I felt. Three- I was reminded of something I knew but hadn’t considered in relation to myself- you can be nonbinary AND male.

It clicked a few days ago. I’m male AND I’m also nonbinary. Not in the sense that I’m less male, but rather, I am 100% male and I am also 100% a third gender that isn’t male or female. (You could say bigender man/aporagender, which is how I’ll explain it here, but for your average normie, genderqueer man will do)

So hi! I’m back after many years! Thought I’d share. I feel so much more comfortable in my gender understanding it a bit more :)"	"Agender transmasc here, who has lately been embracing dressing enby. You made it!!! You can absolutely be both! Woohoo!!!
I, too, am an AFAB enby dude!! The label I feel most comfortable with for myself is ""demiboy,"" a blend of agender and masculine identities! I definitely feel like a guy, but in a way that's just more enby than binary. Welcome back to the family, and congrats on solving your personal gender puzzle!
You should look at the term demiboy! I had some similar feelings but with women, so I consider myself a demigirl :)
I'm also a nonbinary trans guy I really relate to this. I also came out twice. I came out, re closeted, and then came out again.
This realization is amazing, I had it (I am 100% female and 100% non binary) about a year and a half ago and it just felt so right!

Congratulations :)
happy 4 u for figuring it out king!! <3
Congratulations on your self-discovery! 🎉
I’ve heard that term before, the reason I don’t use it is because I do feel like I’m 100% a man, and to me I’ve always heard it/understood it as being partially a man. I’m just also 100% something else as well as a man :)
I understand it’s absolute minutia, but to be fair I’m not using these terms anywhere else- “nonbinary man” should do it for most people lol
Of course! Definitely not trying to tell you what you are- I know some of the micro labels aren't as widely known"	12j2m5i	NonBinary	58	0.96	2023-04-11 23:54:20
Xenogenders & neopronouns don’t harm the community tbh	It seems like this should be common knowledge within the community but apparently not?? So let’s unpack , xenogenders specially were made for neurodivergent people to have a way to explain their gender in fun little ways that feels right to them. These xenogenders sometimes but not always come with a set of neopronouns. They aren’t really for allistics although I’ve seen a handful of them use them also ( which I personally don’t have an issue with ). So when you say things like “oh xenogenders are ruining the community” or “xengenders make trans people look bad” you’re actually being pretty ableist. Let people do what they like, let people be called what they like , and use the pronouns they like. Mind the business that pays you. Hope this helps :) 💙☺️	"What always bothers me when seeing trans people criticise fellow trans people for using pronouns they don’t think people should use, is that 

A) that’s word for word what transphobes are doing, so this is alienating a group of trans people from their own community when should be united against transphobia

B) We shouldn’t force fellow trans people to change their way of expressing their identity to be palatable to cis people. Palatability is always an issue for marginalised groups like neurodivergent people who are expected to mask to not look « weird ».
Hi! Thank you for clearing that up!! I saw a few posts about similar things I was trying to engage for more info but definitely felt like it was becoming a moot point! If you don’t mind, could I possibly ask some more follow ups? I’m neurodivergent and non binary but that never quite felt quite right with the language we have now. I kinda always use doctor who quotes sometimes to describe my gender but felt shunned a bit by community for similar reasons
Imo, xenogenders and neopronouns push the boundaries of how we percieve and talk about gender. If anything it's doing a good thing by challenging our perception of things.
Ableist or not, putting the blame on a marginalised community is absolutely ridiculous. Xenogenders and neopronouns aren't hurting anyone, so the idea that somehow it's acceptable to be disrespectful is wrong to begin with. Even if someone thinks it's weird, it costs nothing at all to just say nothing. People, especially fellow trans people, who think that people harmlessly living their lives as best as they see fit are somehow making trans people look bad, are just shoving people under the bus for the sake of their limited acceptance. If they want to blend into society perfectly so they can be seen as acceptable, they can go ahead and do that. But there's no valid reason to cross the line and turn into a bully to pay for your acceptance.
I think the backlash towards xenogenders and neopronouns is misguided but understandable, speaking as a neurodivergent non-binary person. I think what would help is if we did more to differentiate between the trans, non-binary, and xenogender communities so that people could learn by degrees. I've met no people who accepted xenogenders but not NB and trans people, but quite a few who accept only binary trans or NB and binary trans people. Part of the problem is that we're expecting people to step far beyond their own life experiences and worldviews, for an already relatively small and misunderstood portion of the population. I think there is merit to the concern, but that it can be reasonably worked through.
Practical question, I dont mean this as an attack but simply want to understand: don't neopronouns kind of destroy the point of pronouns, linguistically? Just from a grammatical standpoint, the purpose of a pronoun is to allow you to refer to someone without having to specify or know their name, and to allow ease of use to language. He/she/they cover the vast majority of use cases, and strictly speaking I admit I don't see how ""they"" doesn't work for everyone not under he/she. After a certain point, doesn't it cease to be a pronoun and just become another name?
I completely understand that. Maybe you could use non-binary as the basis and xenogenders as a better way to explain them? I’m autistic and have adhd and I’ve found that it’s easier to say non binary and then go off onto xenogenders to help explain it a bit more
I definitely feel wibbly-wobbly-gender-wender
Respectfully, I don’t think that the fact that some people can’t comfortably understand it should mean that the queer community should also be exclusionary. It comes down to whether being palatable to society is our goal, or whether supporting people in living authentically is. Those things will inevitably come into conflict with one another.
Ok, yeah, I have the same actually lol and it definitely seems easier to just say that! So is xenogenders like when I feel like todays gender is just a madman with a box (that’s a doctor who quote so like I’m not really attached to man, but the implication of that quote, I think? But also I do enjoy the play on words a little bit if I’m honest, if you think about some weird gendered/sexualized terms of yore)
It’s a complexity that’s odd to explain lol uhhh think cuppa soup?
Respectfully, the level of palatability of certain gender, romantic, and sexual minorities (or as you put it, ""queer people"") is a matter of personal safety... frequently to the extent of being a matter of life or death... for a great many people. With the atrocities that the larger communities face, this arguably becomes a question of the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few. In an ideal world that would not be the case, but the world we live in is so far from that. How many transpeople, especially Latinx and Black transwomen, lose their lives in a year because society will not yet accept them for who they are? You and I have no desire to see anyone do anything but be free to live authentically to who they are, but we clearly disagree on how that is to be pursued.

Are xenogender people and neopronoun users being mistreated and marginalized? Absolutely, that goes without question. However the same can be said of all people who are not cisgender. At the end of the day, you are not being killed on a regular basis for who you are...but you can't the same about other groups under the trans umbrella. I'm not asking that you hide or change who you are, only that you consider yourselves in contest. The proverbial ""oppression Olympics"" need not be held, but we should all remember that we stand to gain more by keeping forward progress being made. I strongly believe that a better result will be obtained more quickly if we do not add more fuel to the fire.

Gender disphoria is like having an open wound on your body, and no one can see it.	It's large and always hurting, and people keep bumping into it on accident, scraping against it and making it bleed. And some days it's just aching too much to handle. You can't tell anyone what's bothering you if they ask, because they can't see it and they won't believe you. How could you explain it? You know it's there but the only visible symptom is your pain.	"I'm like, why do I feel so shitty all the time? Oh yeah, because I'm constantly experiencing trauma over my gender identity. God, I need to come out. And then transition.

But I just know people are gonna be shitty about it. My parents' main concern is gonna be ""but what are we going to tell our friends"" and I just wish I could get across an ounce of the pain I've experienced, so they understand that I need to do this.

I find it too difficult to talk about for the most part. Unprocessed trauma just shuts off my language processes.
There is a constant cognitive dissonance between how I present on the outside and who I am on the inside. Something inside me has been telling me that something is wrong, screaming that who I am to the world is not right. I cannot control it, I cannot silence it, I cannot explain it. I just KNOW that my gender is different from the one I was assigned at birth. Its hard to explain, because other people are either so comfortable in their AGAB, or so repressed, that they cannot relate. I just tell people that I was miserable pretending to be a man, and that I have discovered the will to live as transgender.
And I keep picking at it.
The thing is though, you can't find your tribe until you let your song be heard! I know what you're feeling and it's terrible, but guess what? The people who bump up against your wound *may also have the same type of wound.* And what's more, they'd HAPPILY help you heap your wound if they simply knew about it, since they can relate and they are your tribe, but we all just hide it all the time.

Do on your own time and terms, but come out! And transition! And find your tribe who will love and support you as the badass, worthy person you are. 💕"	etcz8d	NonBinary	59	0.99	2020-01-24 16:50:53
Hi I’m a queer person having some thoughts. Please let me know if these thoughts are problematic 💛	Hi I am a queer person who’s having some thoughts. Somebody I know identified as a cis gendered man until 2 days ago. This persons reasoning they communicated was that they no longer wanted to be associated with toxic masculinity or the oppressor. They didn’t explain anything about how they felt internally about their gender rather than not wanting that association due to men having a bad rep. It seems to me that they aren’t taking responsibility or really doing anything to dismantle the power imbalances that they’re supposedly against? Aside from just wanting to set themselves apart from the “bad men”. I am gender queer as are half my friends.. I’m just feeling a little off about what might be behind this person coming out? I’ve never felt this way about anybody else. Please let me know your thoughts and help me. I hate TERFS and I’m scared I’m having TERF thinking? Help me !	"I mean main thing is regardless of what they told you, you have no way of knowing the truth of how they feel re: gender. 

I dont think your thoughts are problematic but if you act on them and try to undermine this persons identity-that would be the problem.
it sounds very possible that your friend is changing their gender for political reasons.


this is atypical, but still valid. additionally, this could very well be their way of cracking their egg. 


at the end of the day their gender is like anyone else's: utterly inconsequential but still deserving of respect regardless of their journey
Whilst ""changing your gender for political reasons"" is valid, I can say from my own experience that ""All men suck, masculinity is inherently toxic, I wish I could just walk away from it all"" is, er, egg behaviour.

Like, most feminist cis men who hate toxic masculinity also don't actually hate that they themselves are men. I expect your friend is actually experiencing dysphoria and ""not wanting to be associated with toxic masculinity"" is how it's manifesting.

Just be supportive. Policing who is and isn't valid-ly nonbinary is good for nobody.
They might be using politics as a cover for their change? 

Sometimes, people are in denial for the ""reason"" they feel a different gender. Or they label themselves a ""safer label"" until they figure themselves out.

Like others said, give them time and space and see. If anything, I'd say they're in the questioning phase right now.
Ngl I’m guessing that’s a pretty bogus reason. Idk but I’m guessing they just feel uncomfortable being associated with men cause they aren’t one. It’s pretty hard to wrap your head around being nonbinary at first because you know you aren’t your agab but you don’t know any other option.
Some people change their gender for political reasons. The terms non-binary and genderqueer are, specifically, inclusive of that, but so are most of the other labels people can use. I, personally, have used genderfucker to signify that I'm making a specific kind of political statement in addition to my other reasons for IDing as trans.
Similarly to cis people using they/them or neopronouns purely to normalise it, I expect there are people who call themselves non-binary or similar purely for political reasons or to push against restrictive societal norms. If this person is doing that but also does absolutely nothing to fight against misogyny or oppressive things, then I can understand feeling weird about it. But if that person speaks out against harmul laws or views then I think it doesn't matter whether they do it from the inside or outside (with regards to being a cis guy I mean).

That said, there are probably a lot of people out there that start off saying they're going by x or y label for some uncommon or arbitrary reason that it turns out makes them realise this is right for them. Sometimes you just feel an inexplicable pull that doesn't even make sense to you...until it does. So I can understand you feeling off about it because of how it sounds on the surface, but it doesn't make you a hateful person as long as you respect what they go by.
My humble input on the matter :

I started my gender identity quest by this exact same reason some years ago. I didn't identify and/or came out  as non-binary because it was unknown to me at the moment, coming from a strongly religious and conservative background.

I was ashamed of men, and ashamed to be linked to them. It staid loke this for a while, until I took a step further and accepted that I am not like them, still identifying as a male at the time, but engaging in a more positive masculinity. Then I asked myself for a long time if I wanted to be a woman...

Well now everything make more sense now and I fully embraced my bigender identity.

Just a small input, saying this maybe a start as some other persons here said.
This was one of the first steps for me when I came out. I was always aware of how toxic traditional mascilituy is and never quite felt like I belonged. When I first started experimenting with gender, a lot of it was because I did not want to associate with that ideal of masculinity, but found that there were a lot more reasons than what I had originally thought. Through a lot of self reflection I've found that even if I were born AFAB I would still be non-binary, albeit a lot happier with my physical attributes. 
I guess what I'm trying to say is this is likely their first step out of the cave. Let them see the outside world for what it is. We can't know where a person will go, nor is it really our business unless they make it ours. And you're not a TERF for thinking this. We’be been conditioned through oppression and infighting to be suspicious. While I don't think it's the healthiest, it is valid. I just try to remember that the average queer person would not come out unless they are truly queer.
Gatekeeping is a major obstacle in our community. I think I understand why, but turning away someone who may need some assistance coming to terms with their gender identity is not the way.
Your friend sounds eggy
Gender is very hard to express so it may just be them not finding the right words to express to you that they feel trapped and uncomfortable being a man but it came out wrong. You may not have the opportunity but if they further bring up the subject then you can ask if sexism wasn't real would you still feel detached from being a man? Personally I feel all genders need to be involved in deconstructing the patriarchy so they should still be held accountable for their actions and beliefs regardless.
My spouse's egg cracked initially in response to trying to distance himself from all the toxic masculinity he saw around him. There is more underlying why he identifies as nonbinary but that was the first reason. This may just be the reason your friend can articulate for now.
Give them a few weeks to a month. Of course respect their pronouns and such if they have a preference.

If they completely backpedal or don't seem to care too much about trans stuff after a month they might just be doing this for non-identity related reasons.

It's probably not a bad idea to ask them various questions. Especially if they're a friend and they need someone to help them work things out.

On the more devil's advocate side of things:

Being ""trans"" politically sounds an awful lot like ""political lesbianism"" and those of us who know the history of that know how bad assigning innate traits to politics can be. It becomes more about some form of ""moral purity"" in a space and less about being who you actually are; which later leads to a lot of really unhappy people pretending to be someone they aren't.

Ultimately it's still their choice and their problem. But if they're promoting it as a political thing it's probably not something I'd personally tolerate in my social circles. Just reminds me a lot of that one shool shooter who killed LGBT people, and self-id'd as nonbinary in a bad faith way to stir shit up. And honestly, we should be cautious, but also we don't have to tolerate people like that in our spaces and in our friend groups.

***TLDR: Err on the side of cautious optimism. Maybe they are trans. If they aren't and show that they're doing this as a joke or to ""troll leftists"" then deal with that if they start being hostile.***
This makes me think of nick diramio on YouTube, they're a very openly political person and would often talk about how how he feels, being subjected to people's political ideologies in relation to being a cis man. I think she identifies as non binary and (of course i can't know for certain) but it seems their gender identity may be related to both their politics and their personal identity. I think it may be the same with your friend here. Again, no one except for them can know for sure how they feel about their gender, but changing your gender identity for personal reasons can also be used as a political statement or political choice. I do understand what you mean about avoiding responsibility and all that, but personally, when I think of that, I think of people who are very transphobic and have a blatant disregard for trans issues and aren't actually trans even though they pretend to be. Though, I doubt this is how your friend is like this and I doubt that this is one of their reasons for coming out as a non-man.

At the end of the day, gender identity is merely a social construct and inconcrete in its definition so anyone can identify with and relate to the concept of gender in however way feels right for them. So if your friend's gender is influenced or related to their political ideology in some way, that's totally valid. As long as their not being a dick and not hurting anyone, then I don't so any issues here.
Hi. I'm a cis male and I actually went through a very similar thing as this person you know. I identified as nonbinary for around a year on and off due to my struggles with wondering if I was real or just faking it or perhaps identifying that way for the wrong reasons. My conclusion was the latter, and I was doing it for the wrong reasons. (Still consider myself an ally though. Love you all and every single one of you is valid).  


I was always frustrated with masculinity and how so many men acted in regards to women, power and other things that I no longer wanted to be a part of it. I convinced myself that there were signs there all along that I wasn't actually male and was perhaps something else entirely. The more I sat on these feelings though, the more I realized I was just afraid of committing to being an example of a man who was different. I eventually realized that being nonbinary was me running away still, and I couldn't keep doing that.  


All this said, my story isn't the same as this person you know. Maybe they're going through something similar or maybe it's completely different. Maybe they're seeing signs that were there all along and for them, they're incredibly real. A lot of people realize they're nonbinary much later in life and it isn't always something they can feel from an early age.   


I think you should ask them how they actually feel about it. You don't need to be confrontational or anything. Just genuinely show an interest and see what their side of it is like, and what they're feeling deep down. That way you can try to understand them a bit better.  


Hope that helps!
idt those thoughts r problematic, but prbbly give them some time, check in later abt how they're feeling bout their gender. experimenting w prns is cool tho, but maybe talk 2 him after some time abt his rzns. it seems like hes uncomfortable w gender stereotypes and not his gender tbh, not trying 2 judge him but thts wat it seems like from j my pov. like if he wants 2 show outwardly tht he doesnt support toxic masculinity, he could like show tht hes an lgbt+ ally thru pins and stuff or in his bios and like work w organisations tht help women and lgbt+ ppl. u dont hv 2 id as nb 2 show tht ur a good person, j do good things lol. but ofc he can use any prns he wants, watever makes him comfortable
I think your friend's words can be interpreted as a journey towards discovering their own gender.

They feel uncomfortable being identified as a man. They don't know their own gender yet, but they do know that one of the reasons they feel uncomfortable about it is men being aggressive and dominant. 

I didn't think I was trans or non binary for years, I just thought I was a feminist. I knew about gender queers but I didn't realise I was one. I was really angry about all that being a woman entailed, and I thought that calling myself a feminist justified my feelings. I didn't realise that calling myself a man justifies them much better.
I think you made a very good connection between your discomfort and TERF ideology. The reasons this person gave for no longer being cis sound like they came straight from a TERF manifesto. What TERFs don't get, though, is that you don't need perfectly articulated reasons to want to explore gender. And the reasons tend to reveal themselves in hindsight. I'd much rather give people the benefit of the doubt than accidentally cause harm to someone whose only crime was not having the right words.
If your friend feels bad about being a man. Even if it is because of other’s mind. Let them be non-binary. If it is more comfortable for them, they’re 100% valid.
I'm going to rub people the wrong way, but NO. If they're just changing gender because of political reasons then that's is totally not okay and should not be validated! Why should they validated? It's not fixing the problem ITS AVOIDING THE PROBLEM. Which a lot of people now days are doing and I think a lot of people are being validated for and it's WRONG. 

Call me a TERF all you want I don't care, but it's taking away from ACTUAL trans individuals and is just proving the point in transgender being a fad!
I met someone in a seminar who identified as non-binary because they wanted to hold against the multiple oppressions held against people (they’re poc as well). They’re an activist as well and they told that many of their friends with the same issues do that. I found that weird at first but because they’re an activist, maybe that’s only part of the reason of how they identify. I can understand if you feel weird but maybe there’s more behind it.

Edit: typos
That's a valid reason. Part of my journey into being genderqueer was an exodus from masculinity. It's more about embracing fluidity and feminity at this point.
Something that takes a while to come to terms with is that gender is a construct.

You don't really have a way of knowing this person's relationship with gender, but even if their identity is changing due to political reasons, all in all it's all labels.
This. So much this. For myself I have found that trying to police my own thoughts just make them louder. Letting it pass is the best way.

ETA Nothing you've said makes you a TERF btw. Even if it turns out you just aren't ok with this and need to limit exposure to this person (not that I recommend that) that's a specific  situation. It's not the same as wholesale denying the existence of an entire group of people.
Oh absolutely I agree. I would never undermine, invalidate or question their identity or reasoning. I just had some internal thoughts about it and wanted to exercise / challenge  those thoughts. Thankyou for your response !
Absolutely.

I am very much GNC/NB for social reasons. I'm afab but I am very much not any type of stereotypical woman and have some pretty intense anger when people try to squeeze me into that box. I am not even a fan of labels, in general, and grew up in a pretty liberal household where Gender wasn't really introduced as a set of likes and dislikes I was supposed to have but once I hit the outside world, those expectations hit me like a freight train and I want none of it.

How is OP's friend any different? They have some privilege that they did not earn and would like to shed- if that's not dismantling the patriarchy, I don't know what is.
I don't know how valid I think it is.  I feel like the number of people claiming trans identities for political reasons troubling.
i had a similar experience
That's really interesting to know! It makes a lottt of sense. Just sharing but interestingly/similarly as someone who is afab, a lot of my enby vibes manifested as feminism ""how can you expect women to be one way"" (and what I thought was internalised misogyny ""God I hate that I look womanly there"")
this is a good point. Before I fully realized I'm enby, I used to feel like I didn't belong with typical men and wanted to distance myself from them/that atmosphere. You could say I was slightly misandrist, but it was simply because I'm not a man myself, yet I felt like I had to pretend to be one.
I love this
Thankyou so much for sharing
Thank you for sharing!
>They have some privilege that they did not earn and would like to shed- if that's not dismantling the patriarchy, I don't know what is.

That is a really good point. Thanks for that insight!
why though? if we start drawing a meaningful border between ""real trans"" people that transition based on feelings and ""political trans"" people, we wind up sounding a little TERFy.


Gender is just who and what you want to be. your reasons for wanting it don't matter. fundamentally, that's what the trans rights movement is all about.
I hear that... but I'm still trying  to wrap head around being trans without dysphoria.   I do understand that gender is expansive, gender roles are overly narrow, etc, and I cant know flagging! gender unless they tell me... but if every amab person who doesn't like patriarchy changed pronouns, it sort of proves the right wingers right, that it's just a trendy social trend - a political movement,  not a genuine experience of gender.  I understand that gatekeeping trans identities is problematic and frowned upon, but I don't think we should shy away from having hard conversations with our friends about these things.
I feel similar in some ways - namely that choosing an identity for political reasons doesn't feel genuine to me...which I think is part of what OP is expressing if I understand correctly. It reminds me of people I used to know who chose what they liked or didn't like based almost solely on whether it was popular or not, rather than because they genuinely liked (or disliked) the thing for what it was & whether it actually appealed to them or not.

That said I would never question someone's reasons for why they identify how they do, or refuse to respect their pronouns. For me respect comes first, and if I'm lucky, understanding will come later. :)
it's worth noting that I 100% want a world where genders are essentially treated as trends that come and go and aren't tied to sex. so my take is a tad radical."	11w2bq5	NonBinary	58	0.91	2023-03-20 00:04:27
y'know what? fuck being a demiboy. I'm a neurogender boyflux. (both are under the non-binary umbrella and I suggest doing your own research cause idk how to explain it)		"congratulations on finding your labels! i've never met someone who uses a neurogender before, so that's interesting :D
 This is the attitude!
Oh man, finding out/accepting I was nonbinary took a long time. I can't even imagine narrowing down my gender further lol
Maybe someday.

Good for you btw!!
Purr! /posC
love this. i'm boyflux too!
What in the absolute fuck
^ ^

Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Awesome!
Awesome!
by this I mean how I identified changed because I wasn't comfortable with the demiboy label anymore sorry I worded it wrong-
No, what I mean is, none of these words make sense to someone who isn't balls-deep in the latest trans-adjacent terminology.

Came out to my boyfriend!	"I [19NB] told my boyfriend [19M] a few weeks ago that I was experimenting with they/them pronouns and the idea of being nonbinary (I guess I qualify as a demigirl, but I prefer the term nb). As of tonight, I've concluded I really do identify as nonbinary. I love using she/they pronouns and presenting myself in a gender nonconforming way. Honestly, the only things that changed were my labels, pronouns, and clothing (started wearing boxers instead of girl underwear, it makes me euphoric asf 😎). Deep down, I've always been nonbinary. 

Tonight, I told my boyfriend that this was a permanent change. He was straight ever since we met, so I was anxious about the idea that he might break up with me for not identifying as a woman anymore. But he had the best possible reaction. He's so proud of me for finding my true self, and my identity doesn't change anything- he loves me for me. He immediately started using ""they"" for me more often. He even joked about how this makes him ""fruity"" since he loves an nb person 😂☺️

It's crazy. I remember when we first got together, the topic of nonbinary came up randomly and I was the first person to explain it to him. He was confused and needed some time to learn more. Now, a year and a half later, he's accepted me fresh out of the closet, validated my identity and his love for me, and is using my pronouns 😭❤️ I couldn't be happier rn. Just had to share somewhere!!"	Congratulations!! These kinds of stories are so encouraging to hear☺️	pkr969	NonBinary	57	0.98	2021-09-09 05:09:15
I came out to my mom as Non-Binary and she got really worried.	"She though I said was that I was Bipolar!
When I explained that I, in fact, was just not a guy, and also not a gal, her face practically lit up and we had a long discussion about gender and identity.
She disclosed that she also was very much nonbinary but that she didn't like the lable because she is from a different time. We ended the discussion and agreed that nothing was to change as I am just me."	"*cries in bipolar 2*

Edit: this is actually a pretty funny story
Congrats! Also, I hope maybe your mom would embrace their identity as well, they are no longer in a different time, but a current one! Absolutely no rush of course, I just think your mom would be so comforted to realize how accepting the world is now.
Congrats!
Thank you!"	m55d0q	NonBinary	56	0.97	2021-03-14 21:57:43
Got attacked for using the term “womxn” in a comment	"Kind of having a bit of an anxiety attack with how hostile this person was out of nowhere for a reason I never imagined (was already having a **really** bad month). I use both *women* and *womxn* but used *womxn* as a blanket term and this person told me to fuck off and that *woman* isn’t a dirty word that needs to be censored when I was censoring nothing. I tried explaining a lot of us feel *womxn* is more fitting for ourselves personally, hoping that might explain things even better, but I got downvoted more.

I truly hate being nonbinary sometimes. I just wanna exist without people making strange and hostile assumptions. I’ve started avoiding even making (clearly not transphobic) jokes about being nonbinary because it’s led me to being dog-piled by transphobes.

EDIT: btw not saying all nonbinary people fall under the women/womxn umbrella. I’m just frustrated I can’t use an inclusive term that usually fits me (genderfluid) without some people getting angry over it.

EDIT: so I’ve read here some people have genuine problems with the term. I’m looking at alternatives… Maybe Galactian Alignments or something?

EDIT 3: Hi, everyone. First I wanna apologize that I was so bad with my explanations and ended up saying things that turned out to be triggers for people. I had been skipping sleep and having anxiety attacks and I shouldn’t have been online at all. I’m sorry I tried touching on such complicated topics when in such a bad mindset. Although I got some sleep I’m still not feeling very good due to accumulated sleep deprivation/fatigue and recent stresses, I’ll try to explain things better really quickly. I’m so sorry if it still is clumsy and hurts anyone but hopefully it’ll prevent more harm.

I was thinking about nonbinary/trans people who *they themselves* identify with the term using it for the most part and not applying it to all nonbinary people; nonbinary people can sometimes be feminine-aligned (might use those terms in the future—trying something hopefully understandable) but not all are and none of us are “woman lite.” Also, I want to say that woman *is* a term that can apply to more than just cis women; although I’m (multigender) not quite comfortable with the term on its own for myself I’ve seen plenty of nonbinary and of course trans women who like to use it for themselves. Also, I’m sorry I used a term TERFs have been using… I heard it was created and used for the reason I used it but didn’t do any research on it and I feel so fucking awful I triggered people. I’m so so sooooo very sorry. I really hope not to hurt anyone and I will absolute avoid it and any other terms that you say could be harmful. I think I might not be in a place to do much serious discussion but I’ll try to respond to a couple comments. I’m so sorry again and thank you for your patience with me."	"As a non binary person I hate womxn. It’s completely fine if you were using it for yourself. But if you’re using it for others who don’t identify as women it’s misgendering.
I think womxn has unfortunately been kind of messed up by saying it’s to be inclusive towards ‘trans women’ not fem-aligned non-binary/gender fluid/genderqueer people- this latter usage (which sounds like what you are using) makes a lot more sense and is actually inclusive, but the former is just transmysogeny. But saying “women and fems” is also problematic in its own way. So idk about the most inclusive way to say what you were saying. 🤷

Either way, the person didn’t need to be a jerk about it. I’m really sorry they did that. You don’t deserve that negativity for speaking to your own experience ❤️
I think why they reacted the way they did was because a lot of terfs have claimed the word and will use it to describe all afab non-binary people.
I've seen womxn used much more as a way for feminists who identify with the term to refer to themselves without including the word ""man"". I've never really thought of it as a term for trans or nb people. That said use whatever words you want to describe yourself. It's easy for people to get their knickers in a twist on the interwebs.
So I used to use this term because lol overt misandry was my brand in high school. I also have an awesome habit of being friends with trans women. I used this word via text with a couple of them early on into our friendships and both of them expressed not only discomfort but also gave me historical context for the word. The Term womxn has roots in TERFism, which is trans-exclusionary radical feminism (not really that radical if it doesn't support all women but whatever lol). Once these two amazing women educated me on the word I was ignorantly using cuz it looks cool, I stopped using it because I didn't want to invalidate their existence.

I'm sorry to hear your anxiety alarms are going off; that's valid. Now you need to work through it and come back to things with a clear mind once the feeling is manageable again. One thing I notice a lot of people get wrong when it comes to conflict resolution is that they allow their emotions keep them from directly addressing or analyzing the situation, thus keeping them stuck in a state of anxiety with no resolution - and oftentimes further making the person who brought up the issue feel invalidated or manipulated by the reactionary emotions of the person they're addressing.

So, vibe. Take care of your immediate needs. Get out of panic mode; you're safe. Consider the possibility that, while you're having a bad day (or week or month or even your yeeeearrrrr), that other person might be having a bad time too. Trauma responses are everywhere. All we can do is control how we act. Even when people are mean to us we have to maintain responsibility for our actions and reactions.
I'm not sure you should use it. If you want to refer to people with uteruses just say that.
Changing the spelling or the meaning of established words is fine in exclusively LGBT circles. However, outside of those, it's usually better to write 'women' than 'womxn'.

People get upset quite easily when they feel the language they use is being appropriated or re-defined by others. Same goes for the word 'lantinx' which most latin people find offensive.

I appreciate that womxn is supposed to be inclusive, but it probably does more harm that good the LGBT movement.

Still, its no excuse to be an asshole to people over.
Saying you were censoring the word is...kinda silly? Don't most people use the star (\*) to censor words? I've never seen someone use an x to censor a letter. I have no opinon on the term 'womxn' other than it doesn't fit me. Seems like it a word you find comfort in though, so that matters. Sorry you went through this.
do you mind if i ask what the context was? were you using womxn in place of women in general or referring to yourself…?
I was under the impression it's taken from feminist graphic design where e is crossed out red to ""remove men from women"" and it's used by man-hating radical feminists in English...

For an inclusive term it feels a bit too supportive of NBi being ""quirky woman lite"", but you do you, some of us NBi people are, in fact, quirky woman light, regardless of assigned sex. You should be allowed to use your own labels.
Womxn is unfortunately so widely misused that I'm not sure it's recoverable.  My understanding is that it was originally coined by black feminists to mean ""woman but specifically not talking about the predominant white supremacist patriarchal concept of womanhood"". It was then (as I understand it) explicitly expanded by its original coiners to be available for any woman who is actively excluded from the prevailing concept of womanhood.

Then white cis people started using it in two different new ways, 1: as ""women and trans women"", and 2: as ""afab people""- both obviously transphobic.

Not sure I've seen your use of the word anywhere before- it's clearly far from the transphobic which cis version but it's also not quite the same as what I understand is the original meaning.

Also to note: ""womyn"" is the radfem/terf-coined term \*not\* womxn. (Though I have seen some terfs use womxn in the same way they use womyn- but that is just another example of misuse.)
I understand that a label can help someone feel more comfortable with their identity, but for me, I don’t like them. I’m queer, and I’m nonbinary. For me, going beyond that seems unnecessary. No matter what I call myself, I am the same person. A label won’t change my gender or orientation, so why use them?
You have the right to use whatever terms you like for yourself. However, it is important to note that womxn, like womyn, has roots in transmisogyny, and is pretty popular with TERFs. Like a trans woman identifying as a ""trap"" or a gay man as a ""faggot,"" you still have the right to use the term for yourself, just probably not for others, and odds are you will still get people lashing out because of the associations.
I hate the term because it feels like I’m just considered “woman lite” but if it fits you, I don’t think people should be policing that
Heard the phrase “marginalized genders” used recently as a sort of umbrella inclusive phrase (referring to women and nonbinary and/or trans folks), could be a good alternative?
That word makes me uncomfortable. I consider myself feminine aligned because of my presentation and similar societal experiences to woman but I don't indentify as a woman at all, so I like Lunarian. Its not problematic at all and sounds nice.
I hate it. Transwomen are women, so there is no need for a magic de-womanising ‘inclusive’ word for women. And if anything womxn is only suitable for demigirls as even I, feminine a lot, would hate to be referred to as anything remotely woman-y
The person going off about ""censoring"" the word woman was probably a TERF or at least regurgitating TERF bullshit.

But there are some genuine issues with using ""womxn."" For starters, it doesn't really mean anything definitively.

People who use ""womxn"" could be talking about

• cis women and trans women

• Fem aligned Nonbinary people

• AFAB people

• people who look somewhat feminine.

So it's just not a very good term. It's a situation of 'just say the people you mean.' it's like when people say ""femme presenting"" when they mean ""AFAB."" I'm not femme presenting, but people usually mean me when they say that. Womxn is similar. I'm not woman lite, or woman adjacent but someone would say that expecting me to fit into that box.
Hi, y’all. I just left an edit in my post apologizing for my blunders yesterday and trying to explain things better; I hope it will prevent more harm from potentially happening. Despite getting some sleep I’m still physically exhausted and not in a good place mentally so I think that I will have to take a break from serious/complicated discussion but if there’s any problems I promise I will work on them. I feel so horrible I said things that were triggers for people and I don’t want to do that again. Thanks for all your input and patience and I’m so so sooooo sorry for my ill-considered and harmful words.
Okay so I know I should have been sleeping hrs ago and I’m too tired to really read this but this Galactian Alignments post looks super promising for inclusive but not problematic alternatives. Hopefully my tired brain isn’t being weird, does this make sense?

https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignments
Okay a) yes yes yes. The only place I typically comment about being NB is on this sub. People are dumb and it reeaaallly shows how new NB/queerness in gender is in our culture still.

B) I had not heard of womxn but I really like it. But also I typically identify more masculine and I kinda like wxman better…huh. Might need to play with some language some more!

Thank you for bringing this word to my attention.

Fuck the haters. 💖 You are awesome just the way you are!
Shitty people sound loud because they're shouting, there aren't many of them
I've never seen this word before. People seem to hate change, and find introducing concepts that go against their world view akin to hostility. Words become a battlefield, instead of being what they should be: A bridge between us that creates understanding.
People are weird on the internet. It's not you. It's them.
Why do you feel more conformed to womxn rather than women? Obviously we all know the stereotype and characteristics of a women and obviously you dont feel like you fall directly under that term, but what is womxn and why does do you feel that this womxn umbrella covers u?
Oh yeah I meant women/womxn for people who feel it fits. Definitely not all enbies are womxn. Fuck, at certain times I’m not sure it quite fits me in the moment lol
This, basically.

Womxn being used to mean ""inclusive of trans women"" is problematic in that it implies that ""women"" is *not* inclusive of trans women.
Thank you I appreciate it 😭
Can you please explain why ""women and femmes"" is problematic? 
It's my understanding that some people identify as femme but the word ""woman"" doesn't feel good for them, such as nonbinary femmes who don't quite feel like a woman
Seconding this. I've also seen them spell it womyn
It’s super weird I always heard it as word meant to be specifically trans-inclusive. I don’t know if maybe there’s some sort of subculture overlap that made my experience different but hearing that some people have used it in a bad way is…oof. Like based on the person telling me to fuck off’s comment I highly doubt that’s what they were concerned about but will be looking for other alternatives.

ETA: I’m now aware it sounds like could be considering trans people including trans women as specifically being womxn instead of women. Before learning radfems have used the term (now don’t plan to use it) I was meaning it to include people who identify with the term womxn especially some nonbinary. I am very sorry for not explaining myself well and **especially** sorry to anyone I hurt with my problematic words.
Same here
Thank you, I will finally go get some rest and hopefully feel better and see things better. Been dealing with grief coming back string today so I think I’m panicking easy, like even when something falls off my table. Thank you for your kindness and wise words! It actually made me feel a lot better! 💕
Ahoy greencraft96! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

So me used t' use dis term because blimey overt misandry be me brand in high school. me also have a awesome habit o' being crew wit' trans beauties. me used dis word via text wit' a couple o' 'em early on into our friendships n' both o' 'em expressed nay only discomfort but also gave me historical context fer thar word. Thar Term womxn has roots in TERFism, which be trans-exclusionary radical feminism (nay verily that radical if it doesn't support all beauties but whatever blimey). Once these two amazing beauties educated me on thar word me be ignorantly using cuz it looks shipshape, me stopped using it because me didn't want t' invalidate their existence.

I be yarr t' hear yer anxiety alarms be going off; that be valid. Now ye need t' duty through it n' come back t' things wit' a clear mind once thar feeling be manageable again. One thing me notice a lot o' scallywags get wrong when it hails t' conflict resolution be that they allow their emotions keep 'em from directly addressing or analyzing thar situation, thus keeping 'em stuck in a land o' anxiety wit' nay resolution - n' oftentimes further making thar scurvy dog who brought up thar issue feel invalidated or manipulated by thar reactionary emotions o' thar scurvy dog they're addressing.

So, vibe. Take care o' yer immediate needs. Get out o' panic mode; you be safe. Consider thar possibility that, while you be having a bad day (or week or moon or even yer yeeeearrrrr), that other scurvy dog might be having a bad time too. Trauma responses be everywhere. All our jolly crew can d' be control how our jolly crew act. Even when scallywags be mean t' us our jolly crew have t' maintain responsibility fer our actions n' reactions.
I wasn’t using it to mean people with uteruses, though. I was talking about anyone who feels woman or womxn fits them with how their gender works.
(Psst, this isn’t 100% directed at you but at anyone who wants to know. Many Latin people find lantinx offensive it’s because it just feels like it was made by a nonLatin person. As a person who is Latin and Hispanic I use lantine, it flows better. I don’t speak Spanish fluently but I believe there is a movement to use ‘e’ as the gendernuertal replacement over ‘a’ and ‘o’)
I know this whole thread is about pedantic dogpiling, and this is slightly off topic, but could you please consider not using ""triggered"" in the context of getting offended or upset? That's not what being triggered is to a person (like myself) who struggles with PTSD
Sadly, I still worry about how that feels for other people like me who don’t exactly feel women exactly fits us. Maybe I should just write women/womxn next time?
Thank you so much and yeah I did find it weird they though x was for censoring instead of *. I can’t recall anyone ever censoring their swear words by writing fxck or shxt lol
Well, I was basically using it as an umbrella term for women/womxn to save time but also be inclusive of those womxn fits but not women. Didn’t even think it would be taken the way it was and I definitely didn’t think a simple polite explanation would piss them off still at least in that sub. I don’t know if this is important (I’m half asleep) but basically it was a comment about fetishization especially affecting certain people and I did specifically mention trans and nonbinary people specifically in that comment along with other groups.
Well, it wouldn’t exactly be what I meant the term as (feminine-aligned might be the closest and easiest to understand term…I’m sorry my post/comments were not clear at all) but in the comment I was attack for I also mentioned trans people who aren’t women or feminine-aligned (trans men and many enbies) so it sounds like could have been useful an umbrella term in that and many other conversations about marginalization. I may ask trans men if I should add “and identities,” though, since they may not feel oppressed for their gender but just being trans. Thank you so much for your help. 💕
why would you go to such lengths to learn and use terms most people would have to google anyways? why do you need an alternative to woman when it includes trans women already? many non binary people don't want to be lumped in with men or women, that's why they are non binary. if you need to refer to them just call them non binary people ffs, this is just another weird round about way of gendering people who don't want to be gendered.
read the rest of the comments. it's a TERF term.
Hey you might want to read all the other comments explaining why the word is misgendering and how it has terf origins.
Yeah I mean there are definitely transfeminine who prefer womxn (especially some nonbinary transfeminine people and even many cis feminists prefer it for themselves now) but if someone is using women solely for cis people and womxn solely for trans/nonbinary people that’s a problem.
That people who can be fem like femboys aren’t necessarily women aligned and feminine non-binary people can feel it may be another way to set them as “women lite”. Also I know people who are like “I don’t even know what that means” and like how fem do you have to be to be included. I think most things people can say to divide people into groups can be potentially problematic and you just have to make your choice and be ready to explain. 🤷
This spelling has transphobic roots. I can’t remember exactly what but I think if you google it it would come up
Their reaction is definitely problematic and I'm sorry for how they reacted. I do want to let you know you're getting downvoted for this comment likely because it's really problematic segregating trans people to their own term when women already encompasses anyone who identifies as a woman, including trans people. I understand why you use womxn but keep in mind that it shouldn't be used to isolate trans women or any other trans people who identify as women.
Reiterating, the word has a history of violence toward trans women. Unless you're a trans woman I'd highly encourage you don't try and reclaim it. Ultimately, your choice. Just know you risk making people feel unsafe by using the term. And I promise you will find more descriptive words for yourself. Don't sweat it. Just make choices you're proud of.
well if you're referring to everyone who idenitfies with the term woman just say woman, spelling it weirdly just sounds like there are women and then these other people whom you could count in. but people either are or aren't women (not necessarily exclusively of course) and if they are, they don't need a weird spelling to fit in.
Why don't people just use Latin? Is there a reason?
I... actually didn't realise that word has connotations with PTSD. I'm sorry, and I'll be more careful using it in the future.
you should just write women if you aren’t in any gender related subreddit, due to the fact that most people (not even just cis, even other queer folk) perceive “womxn” as erasing womanhood in general/as a censored word.
what sub? why did you expect no pushback? was it a queer sub??

but, there’s your issue. you felt the need to say “womxn” when referring to trans/nonbinary people. trans women are women. not womxn. as others have said, this word is fine if you use it only for YOURSELF, because it is:

- used by terfs to exclude trans women
- used by radfems who want to take “man” out of “woman” (censoring the word basically)
- hardly ever used to refer to otherness, most queer people who aren’t women but are fem just say… they’re fem. its unusual to use “womxn”.

so yeah your issue was using it blanketly for everyone and not just yourself.

edit: to add, im a femby. i personally would HATE being called a “womxn”. id rather just be called a woman because to me, “womxn” is dehumanizing as it’s not even pronounceable as a word and puts me into some weird box.
Ah I see what you mean and I’m sorry I’m not very good at writing out my thoughts right now. Nonbinary people who aren’t specifically aligned with stuff are totally valid but I was thinking of this for people like myself who feel aligned in certain ways (I get what you mean about people having to Google it so this would only be in queer circles). I’m so sorry I’m so bad at explaining things. Please let me know if my words still doesn’t make sense and I’ll try to write them better when I back up.
Oh dang it. Oh well.
Good on you for looking at the info provided and being willing to adjust, lots of people just stick their fingers in their ears instead.

I find it's important to be aware of the history of a word, not just the original meaning. Many words which were originally straightforward later become slurs, meanings change, usage changes. Some really common ones for example are any word used to describe people of below average intelligence.

It is occasionally possible for marginalised communities to reclaim these words. But it is critically important not to describe *others* with such words if they do not explicitly identify with them, because the line between reclaiming a word and using a slur is razor thin.
Kinda rubs me the wrong way like the rest are ""men"" outside that group too. I don't know, maybe I'm looking too much into it.
I’m sorry to ask you this but does the edit for the comment make sense? I don’t want to upset anyone and I’m getting super worried.
Ah understood I’ll edit to explain I didn’t mean trans people as a whole only being “womxn” but any people who felt it fits them (especial nonbinary people). Thank you so much for the explanation.
Yikes I didn’t know that until today tbh. I’ve seen it used in my circles but will look for an alternative since there’s apparently people with genuine reason to hate it.

Edit: clarity (hopefully clarity? I need to go to bed so pretty tired)
Unfortunately, I am multigender and have had a lot of people say I’m “a woman, not nonbinary” so many times so I can get dysphoria with the term woman on its own. I start to think about people not denying the existence of other important parts of me and transphobic harassment I’ve gotten. As I mentioned in the edit to my post I think feminine-aligned might be a good possible umbrella term for those of us who feel it applies to them (women and some enbies.)

Btw I’m so sorry if my comment still isn’t very clear. This will probably be the last more complicated comment I can leave for now since I’m still not feeling very capable today and I think trying to answer many comments might cause me to stress out and get more muddled and say more clumsy and triggering things. I don’t want to hurt anymore people’s feeling like I did yesterday when I shouldn’t have been talking about such potentially triggering topics in such a state of mind. Thank you for your input and your patience with me.
Latin is the English word for Latino/a/e. I’ve only heard the people around me say they are Latin when speaking English.
No worries! Thank you, I appreciate it
I *do* use the term trans woman, but was just trying to be fast and inclusive. Tbh I’ve never heard of womxn being used in a TERF way before but I’ll try looking up some alternatives. Not sure I’m comfortable using fem in this case because I know a lot of people at least in my circles who find the term problematic as an umbrella term, so will have to look for something else. Also not sure I’m allowed to post the subreddit and I’m too tired to read all the rules again since I mix all the subreddits’ rules in my head but although it isn’t specifically about queer people there’s been a number of anti-transphobia posts in the past. I guess I may have gotten my hopes up too high though 😩

Edit: I’m thinking maybe Galactian Alignments as an alternative?
What is nonbinary to you?  If you identify as a woman that's fine.  But nonbinary woman seems contradictory. Imo.  I feel like most nonbinary folks don't 'align' with a male/female gender.  That's the point of nonbinary.
if you really cannot see how it’s problematic to refer to strangers with a non-pronounceable, radfem invented word, then i don’t know how to help you.
No, this is not true. I’m a genderfluid masc non-binary person with some ties to “man” as a gender, with varying intensity. Non-binary is not necessarily a third gender or 100% genderless. I’m not defending the term womxn btw, just saying that associating with a gender does not negate or invalidate someone’s non-binary identity.
There are incalculable numbers of ways to be nonbinary. Some terms that tend to fit me would be demigender, genderfluid, multigender, and lesbiangender but it’s hard explain exactly how in words. However I will say that I personally feel there’s a part to me that is basically ineffably I guess female-aligned (don’t know better terms yet) in a strong way at this point in my life. It doesn’t mean the other parts of my gender aren’t important though.

ETA: Gender Wiki lists a ton of different gender identities like these.

https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_Wiki
I understand that it’s problematic now that it’s explained. I just meant the reason I *did* use it was because I had thought the term was specifically made as a way to include nonbinary people. I’m sorry, I’m afraid I’m functioning on very little sleep after skipping sleep so I’m probably not reading or writing things out well.

EDIT: btw only meant nonbinary people who would consider themself in that category, not all or even most nonbinary people
I’m really sorry.
I'm not trying to be rude so forgive if it sounds like it.  If your identity is so heavily tied with being a woman, why not identify as a queer woman?  It still feels contradictory to me to say you're a binary nonbinary person.
yea, as a nonbinary person if you called me a ""womxn"" i would also tell you to go fuck yourself.
I’m gonna get some rest and hopefully be able to not mess up this. Again I’m sorry and thank you for your input, it is appreciated!
I’m also a sort of guy and then something I can’t even explain and the “female-aligned” part is also somewhat complicated. It changes throughout my life and definitely isn’t binary. Im not good at explaining things though so I’d suggest looking up the terms I mentioned to show how it can work for a lot of us.
I’m so sorry I mean nonbinary who put themselves in that category instead of nonbinary people in general. I’m so sorry again I’m bad at explaining this and especially that this hurt you. Please let me know if there’s any other problems and I’ll work on them.
put themselves in what category? i'm not hurt just trying to understand why you're trying to use a blanket term over multiple groups of people. is AFAB what you are trying to say when you use womxn? or women-identifying people? because for that you could just simply say women. other comments have already said this but it feels by making it different you're implying trans women aren't ""women"" but rather something separate.
Not people with uteruses/AFAB people…I suppose the best term would be woman-aligned but I’ve heard that some people use it incorrectly. But like I’ve spent all of my trans life being told I’m a woman but not nonbinary, so sometimes I can get dysphoria the term completely on it’s own. I start to think about people who deny other parts to me that are also very important. I was using womxn because I had thought until now it was especially meant for people who are in between certain genders in some way or whatnot.

I set up our pride table at work to be passively educational, I’ve seen parents explaining to their kids what they mean, adults who didn’t know there are flags for each but are excited to get their kid/grandkid the right one and adults who are asking us what these mean wanting to learn!! It’s cool!!		"I love the NB ferret. Ferrets are my 4th favourite animal!

Just another enby rant	"I’ve come out to myself about 6 months ago. I’m a 22yo AFAB who is non binary. In my mind, I am sort of just in the middle. Personality tests told me I have a masculine thought process, and I’ve always considered myself being sort of male since childhood.

Anyway that’s just a fact that I know, and I’ve always known. Still, when I have tried to tell anyone they just don’t believe me. Nobody ever have. I’ve been told I’m just another chick who wants to hang out with the guys, or that I want to be a special snowflake. 

I live in a liberal country that is not educated enough about the trans community. So everyone think they are accepting while in reality they really aren’t. At least not in my case.

But I’m okay with feminine pronouns and I can accept having a female body. At least for the most part. My true dysphoria is socially. I can’t stand it when someone expects me to act feminine, or when other people gender me socially. I live in a male dominated world (I study computer science) and I have to prove myself twice as much to earn half the recognition. And if I don’t act modest and timid then a lot of men tend to be disrespectful towards me. Asshats. They expect me to be so freakin caring and bat my eyelashes at them when I really want to call them an effin dickbag for treating me like their secretary. I’m not sure if this is a problem for all genders, or if it’s even gender related. But I hear a lot of women complaint about similiar things, so I draw my conclusions.

So just because no one believes me I’ve considered just not coming out at all. The only thing I would REALLY want to change is my name, but I can’t really do that since the name I’d choose is 99.9% male name from Finland (I wonder who that 0,1% person was) and it would be weird for other people to call me that unless I transitioned completely. So I’m going to just do my own thing, then. I’m going to act and dress masculine when I feel like it, or even feminine if I want to. I don’t need to explain myself, as it’s nobody’s buisness. Tomorrow I am going to get that tie with pineapples on it that I really want. So ha."	"Good for you! F people who treat you any differently/negatively because they perceive you to be a certain gender. 
It's not you, trust me. The IT field is full of asshats. I hope things get better for you!
This is super refreshing and relatable, so let me tell you that your feelings are valid and no one has a right to make you feel any differently! 
[deleted]
yay :) enjoy the pineapple tie
I’ve started weight training as well! It helps me deal with a lot of stuff
Oh, another Finn at nonbinary, cool :D I'm also AFAB, still questioning a lot. Not feeling female and if there was a gender scale, I'd be little over the middle on the male side (like, not very masculine male). I also live my life currently socially as a female and can't see myself verbally coming out anytime soon. But I've promised myself to represent myself more truthfully trough clothing and stuff. 

I get very much that ""everything here is perfect for LGBT+ people""  mindset. I feel like language has part on it (I suppose your native is also Finnish?). Our language is so neutral on gender, that people feel it makes us automatically ""gender-friendly"", zero effort needed. Of course that's not true, and there's still some quite strongly preserved gender stereotypes and expectations - especially between the lines. 

What's the name you're thinking of? No need to tell tho ;) Have you thought of any gender-neutral name?

Have a nice week!
Fuck yeah! Just do whatever you want to do and rock on!!
I'm feeling this so much. Like, expected to be girly, cute, weak, innocent... It's like my body at it's natural state screams for these features. I'm happy to hear you're reached what you wanted!
Thank you I will! :)
Hey there! I’m not a Finn, actually. I am a Norwegian Sami with a lot of relatives from Finland. I don’t actually speak the language, but if it’s anyhing like sami I know what you mean about it being gender neutral in a lot of ways. 

Still, it’s nice to hear from a fellow Scandinavian enby :D I hope you figure stuff out eventually. My best advice so far is to just give yourself enough time to figure out what feels most authentic and natural to you, then go for it.

When it comes to names, I haven’t actually found any gender neutral names that «feels like me», if you get what I mean. This, I believe, is the main reason I still have my birth name.

The name that I would like to have, that would feel more authentic, is Levi. It’s close to my birth name, and doesn’t (in my opinion) have a super masculine feel to it.

According to Google, however, only 0,1% of all people with that name is female. So I think it would be inappropriate to take that name :P

What about you? Have you thought of any names yet that you would like to have? 
[Gender neutral baby names from Finland](https://imgur.com/gallery/vdmjF) 

I get the feeling that finding a gender-neutral name is easier said that done
Oh, I see. The same, it's nice to hear about people who live relatively close :) Finnish is one of most gender-neutral languages, we don't have gender pronouns (just ""hän"" for every human, and often in spoken language it's replaced with ""se"", which is a pronoun for items, animals and things). So gender does not pop up that often in the language, and if it gets mentioned, it's because of we're especially talking about gender.

Thanks :) I guess I'm lost because of I have just only recently started to think about my identity (so far I've just ignored my feelings). So probably I only need some time. I haven't thought of any practical changes, like name changes. Even though my birth name irritates me a little bit because of it's super womanlike and fussy, my closest people call me with my nickname which is not gender-tied, so it's fine for now. 

Levi sounds pretty nice, and not very masculine even though I also think it's nearly exclusively men's name. So you have to weight out which is more important; to have a name close to your birth name, or have a name that describes your gender identity. Do your name have any meaning? Maybe you could find a fitting name that had similar meaning, instead of phonemic similarity? If you're interested in Finnish gender-neutral names, this is the first [site](http://causavitae.blogspot.fi/2012/08/sukupuolineutraalit-nimet.html) that pops up. In the parenthesis there's first the quantity of men having that name and then women having that name. The writer of the article has colored those names red that sound more of girls' name and blue those that sound more boys' name in their opinion. Good luck!"	7udynx	NonBinary	54	0.98	2018-01-31 22:39:10
"I just came out as non-binary. It feels liberating and terrifying. I used to tolerate the ""he/him"" pronoun because I don't have the energy to explain myself to other people and because I don't want to be offended when ppl refer me as he/him/his. But I wanted to live in my own truth and come alive."		"Super!! I am so glad you are finally free!
Jealous honestly. Congrats and good luck out there, friend :)
Heck yeah! I used to say OK to he/him because it didn’t feel as bad as she/her (I’m AFAB) but then I realized I didn’t need to worry about how other people felt about MY pronouns and went with exclusively they/them. This is my experience only, I know some nonbinary people are good with he/him or she/her.
I love that and thank you.  I have a transgender child and I apparently offended her before she ever asked me to or told me her preference.  I’m going to admit it was hard. Especially when I was angry at her because it was just my brain without thinking. I’ve come a long way in my understanding of the gender pronoun’s and what my responsibility is.  I’m not hating I’m sincerely asking how to know what’s appropriate.  Or the level. I’m definitely ok with he/ him her etc. I’m confused about the fringes that may desire the clown/ bizarre terms that we just have not been given information to understand the reason.  My personal belief is that if I know you in every day life. I’m going to try my best to use your desired term.  If we are just passing by.  I don’t mean harm. It’s not on purpose.  Anything you can share with me for my understanding of learning about how things are. I’m happy to hear.  ❤️

I don’t feel comfortable in groups of women. Need advice.	"I want to change this. 

But I feel like the way women can be afraid of men, I am afraid of women. I have been emotionally deconstructed by women in the past, that just knew the right words to say, that tore me emotionally apart. 

And I am still a decade later trying to figure out with my therapist how to move past the emotional damage I have had from the particular women I knew in my past. 

Also, I am non-binary AFAB. And I don’t feel gender affirmed by women, I feel like I a, expected to be and act like a woman. 

When I am not. I would love to know, how can I be myself, with being expect to ‘be feminine’. I don’t know how to explain it, but those expectations really screw with me. 

I would like to know, how do women treat men, differently to other women? In your experience? 

When I am around men, I always feel comfortable. Like I am one of the guys. It feels easy. IT FEELS RIGHT. In a way that’s hard to describe. 

How do I replicate that feeling in groups of women? 

It also doesn’t help I am socially blind and struggle with social cues. 

Whereas my friends, my close ones. Are always happy to explain social cues to me. 

In groups of women, I always feel like I am missing something. And having a discussion about something I don’t understand doesn’t seem as welcome. 

I am looking for advice, so I can try and process this."	"Not advice and I prob will get down voted for this but i am curious.. why is it okay for people to be uncomfortable around men but not okay to be uncomfortable around women? You can get traumatized by women just as much as you can by men (ex: all my abusers were cis white women). I am not trying to be rude or sexist i just am super confused and don't understand the social double standard of sorts
Do you want to overcome this because you want to be friends with women personally? Or do you want to overcome this because you feel like you ""should""? 

I also have a deep fear of women, for similar reasons, as an afab enby. It pains me because women are so frequently pitted against each other, societally, in media, interpersonally, and I want to do what I can to fix that, even if only in my immediate circles.

This doubly affects me as a bi person who was too afraid to ever approach a girl, let alone pursue her, and I feel like I've missed out on a ton of experiences and like I'm not a ""real"" bisexual because I've never done more than kiss a girl. 

At the same time, I'm not unhappy. The friends I do have, largely cis men and other enby folks, are wonderful, thoughtful, loving, amazing people. I have two cis female friends I adore and I trust. My male partner is the love of my life and I don't want to pursue anyone else. And I'm happy. 

There are no easy answers to getting over this. My mom, my sister, and nearly every close female friend I made K-12 bullied me, manipulated me, ostracized me, belittled me, gaslit me... it's hard to get over that. But I don't really need to fix it, IMO, because I've found fulfilling relationships elsewhere.
I don't know if I can give you advice, what I will say is this.  We are similar .  I'm an AFAB ENBY (only putting that for context) and I never EVER got a long with other girls growing up.  I was a tomboy, played sports, had a lot of guys friends and in middle school and high school because I was friends with the guys, the girls tried to be my friend so they could get closer to the guys.  I hated that being used and then insulted and discarded.  Some of my guy friends fell for it and others told those girls where to go and how to get there.

25 years later I am still uncomfortable with most girls but I have got a good set around me who are either a)NB like myself b) of the tomboy variety c) lesbians or d) just not see you next Tuesday.

There is no easy answer I spent years without any female friends, I would say dont write someone off because they are a girl.  They might surprise you.

Ultimately be friends with good people whose company you enjoy regardless of gender.  The rest will fall in place
It sounds like you're still working through your trauma. Your therapist will be the best person to help you with, honestly.

I don't have any real gender based anxiety, but I do have race based anxiety (white cisgender men and women, mainly). I keep pretty close-lipped about my personal stuff until it comes out if they have racist family members, used to be conservative or fundie, etc etc. (idk why white women love to tell me about their baggage) and kinda go from there.

I also have a tendency to be straight-faced when they talk about girl problems that I don't relate to. So, they'll try to wink and nudge me and I just am like \[TV static\] and I think they eventually get the hint.

I'm pretty good about changing subjects or tuning out until something interesting comes up, too.
Sadly, manipulation and emotional damage are the most common form of violence women do. You should not be afraid of this, because YOU are different that the person you was in the past. You are stronger. 

That said, if you like to be around men more, that's ok. That's what you like.

I'm the opposite: i like to be around women more and most of my friends are women. But this is ok. It's what i am.

The important part is the reason you do this: it's ok if you do this because you like the company of men more. But you should not do this out of fear.
I don't have advice but you're not alone. I get very uncomfortable and feel horrible when people are like ""Us""*wink* at me about periods and whatever.

Girls and women have been some of my worst bullies too. As a teen I was only ever physically attacked by girls.

I agree. My life changed for the better when I acknowledged to myself that that's how I felt. Eventually I healed enough in various ways that I could cautiously start having women as closer friends, but they'd still fairly often trigger me unintentionally and being honest with myself that that's what was going on was much healthier than just trying to push through. I still don't do group stuff where I'll be the only non-woman if I can help it. Eventually I'd like to be more secure in things like that and, for example, go to a ""mother's day"" event just like a dad might (some dads in families without moms do that where I live). But that's just a personal goal about not letting myself be held back by others' perceptions of me. I'm still much more socially comfortable around the average man than the average woman.
Well Wikipedia says ""Males were convicted of the vast majority of homicides in the United States, representing 89.5% of the total number of offenders."" So perhaps that?
I feel like you might be jumping to conclusions a bit here
This exactly. The victims of sexual assault and rape are women 91% of the time, while men are the perpetrators 99% of the time. There isn't a double standard, there is a distinct and obvious pattern."	12fnfkr	NonBinary	56	0.99	2023-04-08 14:16:41
We need more support for clean/sober non cis people	"I've been in and out of sober living since I was 21 the cis male (I'm afab) house I was first  in was amazing but ya know relapse.

I'm 24 now and I've been in this house full of cis women. It's a midsized organization 86+ split between eleven houses. The owners are as respectful as they can be but I can't expect them to use more inclusive language when I'm the only non-cis person here. But I'm tired of “You are Princess Warriors” and “Attention ladies” and “You are all beautiful”

So tired of the misgendering-even tho none of it is meant to be rude. I appear masculine and I wear skirts cause we live in the south and damn it if Imma roast. Tired of every new girl asking what's in my pants, tired of explaining my story, of educating and being tolerant all the while I'm trying to put back the pieces of my life.

I do know it's just been a hard week and I do have really supportive people who do there best to understand. I just can't help but imagine a place where there are others just like me who struggle with trying to overcome addiction. I was denied at so many places because of who I am, so I'm grateful I do have a place and that I kept trying to get help. 

There must be others like me and I just don't want them to be as uncomfortable as I get sometimes whole undergoing recovery. 

Treatment for addicts needs to improve in general but there really needs to be some focus on those who are not cis. Especially with how gendered 12 step programs can get."	"I just had a similar conversation with a friend the other day about foster care. I can see how this relates to your situation. While in one aspect I appreciate the faux-support for females, it gets manufactured too much. Like they can just buy jumbo poster pack of generic pink & flowery affirmations and it will make someone feel better. These kinds of things magnify a crappy week when you’ve been “Hallmarked” into being supported. Hear me out: consider making the type of posters with affirmations that would make you feel supported! Hang those puppies up with the women rarw stuff.
I go strictly with co-ed houses now for that reason - me being a transmasculine person in a “female” house was a mess for everyone involved. Though that comes with issues of its own, and still isn’t perfect by any means. Honestly, I plan on pretending to be binary male as soon as I’m passing bc it’s honestly such a hassle 🙄
Men's Oxford in the NW has been supportive of my transmasc friends, and it's a lot more personal and autonomous than larger sober living organizations. Perhaps try that?
Conservative AA people are how I ended up not getting the right help for my gender issues in early recovery. I had 14 years when I finally cracked. Got loaded over it. Don’t assume a bunch of addicts will understand or respect your identity. LGBT meetings exist for a reason, and even then you have to remember that too many gays and lesbians are not cool with trans or non-binary people. When they say “to thy own self be true” they really mean it, even when they completely forget what that means.
ugh pisses me off how gendered this world is, im so sick and tired of it, like what is this OBSESSION with putting people in tiny boxes???? we're all human, period. 

sorry rant lol i really hope things get better ✨
Honestly? I'm too drunk to read your post properly. Which says a lot. I'm sorry. I'm pretty lost. But I send my love and support.
Exactly!! You hit it right on the head! I’m also a former foster kid and it’s my dream to be a worker and to create policies that protect and support kids and teens.

But making my own support stuff sounds awesome thank you so much for the suggestion I really appreciate it :)
I can only speak for the NW but there are also good queer 12 step groups here. I would hope there are some where you are too.
Thank you so much 💕 Please make sure you drink some water and get food into you when you're able to!
Former foster kid here too! The idea of the poster-making comes from my non-Binary first born who makes posters to put out on the lawn that are more inclusive! We are running into the ra-ra rawr issue in Scouts where they are encouraged to make a lot of gender specific empowerment stuff and it makes them feel crappy that they aren’t so happy about the gender label!
Yes, I did. Thank you 💗"	ou9dq1	NonBinary	56	0.99	2021-07-29 23:53:11
I feel both male and non-binary?	"I'm AFAB and have been identifying as a trans man since i was 14. Since coming to that realization I've always seen myself as male, and it feels right. However, since fully coming to terms with my outer gender expression and bettering my mental health, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not quite the same as other men. It's very difficult to explain how. It's like im 100% male but also there's something else in there as well. A good analogy I saw was ""I am a man in the same way ravioli is a poptart"", it really sums up how I experience gender. I'm completely comfortable with typical masculine terms and adjectives, and I only use he/him, but the actual internal experience of my gender goes beyond just male, to the point where it just doesn't really feel like I'm being honest when I call myself a man. Like there's something more to my experience and I don't know what labels are actually accurate for this.

I am also autistic, and I believe this plays a major role in how I perceive my gender- I still desire a fitting label though.

This is extremely difficult to explain accurately, so I apologize if anyone got confused. I'm just kind of stuck and am having a hard time finding info.

EDIT: I forgot to add that the only thing making me hesitant about ID'ing as non binary is the fact that i DO feel very male, but I feel like that doesn't really tell the whole thing if that makes sense."	"Hey, so are you transmasc me? I’m 28, AMAB, non-binary woman. My sense of gender is almost exactly like yours, from the opposite end of the spectrum. Outwardly, I’m totally a woman, albeit somewhat GNC. Inwardly, I’m a woman and something else. Some combination of nature and nurture and realizing I was trans as an adult landed me with a complicated gender but a desire to present as binary.

For another data point, I have ADHD, and a sneaking suspicion about autism. Correlation?

My main point is you’re not alone, and identifying as a non-binary man is totally ok, and I’m glad to see how many more people share some of my experience of gender.
Pretty sure the term for this would be demiguy.
You can absolutely be both!

Check out Mars Wright on TikTok, he is a nonbinary man.
I'm autistic too

I consider myself gender flux, I experience my gender from male to agender. 

I'm a man a majority of the time, whether it's entirely some days, partially others, and sometimes nothing at all. 

So I typically go by nonbinary man(less specific). To me nonbinary is an adjective, man is a large part of my identity. Nonbinary modifies the term man to be most accurate for me. 

That said, socially I stick with trans man and present binary 100% of the time. Because my style doesn't change, my gender does.
Nonbinary pretty much means not 100% man or 100% woman. You can claim the label even if there's only one hour a month you don't feel 100% man. Gender is weird, and it's okay if it changes or is fluid.
I’m a trans masc enby, somewhere between guy and agender. I generally simplify it down to trans man for cis folks, only getting into the complexities with trans folks.
gender is so complicated. i relate to what you are saying. i describe myself as both a man and a woman, but at the same time i am neither. i say give it time, one day that realization might come to you. another tip is, if you were AMAB, would you question if you’re non binary? when it comes to transmasc enby people, some don’t quite fully feel male, therefore they are comfortable with IDing as non binary. unlike trans men, who are fully male.
i 100% understand what you’re saying! i’m ND, too, so it may be mostly a ND thing, idk, but i’ve been identifying as a trans guy since ~7th grade and now that i’ve really been able to grow and learn about myself and explore my gender, i don’t feel like “a man.” not fully, at least- maybe partially? i like being perceived as masculine and using masculine terms for myself, but i don’t feel fully like A Man. i’d recommend looking up demiboy and demimasc! (they’re two different things, but similar.) basically: demiboy is partially identifying as a guy and partially non-binary of some sort, and demimasc is partially masculine and partially non-binary (i think demimasc is for people who feel “boy” is too gendered and they prefer masc instead!) either way: good luck!!! i’m very horrendously shy but if you ever wanna talk i may be open (:
demiboy? maybe
this is EXACTLY my experience, right down to being autistic..... even the age 14 matches up...... are you me? (/j lmao) 

but seriously, this is how i feel. im a man but im also nonbinary and i am very comfortable with that. i wouldn't consider myself a demiboy or genderfluid/flux, bc im both fully male and nby at the same time. gender is a circular spectrum and not a line!
Yeah, I think I get what you're talking about.  At least a bit.  It feels closer to my experience than most folks anyway.

I'm male in the context of my (pretty reliably neurodiverse) family.  I'm not so comfortable fitting into a more general understanding of what 'man' is - because it feels inaccurate/misleading, even though that's always been the end of the spectrum I've identified with.  I've found transmasc non-binary really helps me to express that I'm mostly a guy - but that it's not entirely that simple.

Good luck getting a handle on this mate.  Love the poptart analogy.  :-)
Yeah I’m non-binary but I feel like either m/f, neither, or both and sometimes all three at once. Genderfluid for me but non-binary is what I stick to when talking to people outside the community.
I do too, I use demiboy (gender is part dude part anything else) and since it's fluid a bit I also use gender faunet (genderfluid but never hits girl) there's also genderfaun (genderfluid but it never goes towards feminine identity)
Can always look into gender fluid if Demi-boy doesn’t suit what you’re feeling. Also labels are just to help you don’t have to fit in one.
It's so reassuring and cool to see someone with this experience! Thanks for the input :))
Same although my adhd hasn't been formally diagnosed. I go with gender fluid non binary, it's like sometimes I'm more separate from my female side the other minutes. It's weird nd it changes quickly.
My partner gets annoyed at me for saying ""non-binary man"" lmao
I mostly just call myself a nonbinary man"	t1nss0	NonBinary	55	0.97	2022-02-26 04:17:18
