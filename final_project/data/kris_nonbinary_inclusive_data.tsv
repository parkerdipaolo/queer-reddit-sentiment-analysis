Found this gem on r/dankmemes yay inclusivity!		"War profiteering😎
The balance is important
I feel like r/WitchesVsPatriarchy would also love this but I'm too shy to repost since every time I've ever done that I've been downvoted to hell.
U made this joke on a past post of this pic but 

Bigender people have set up a mob grinder lmao
they’re dating and working to collapse the binary as a whole and i fully support it
I feel so stupid and not Enby enough, but...someone please explain the Non-Binary part? I don't understand. : /
AAA I LOVE THIS ONE
How is the bow attached to the short part of the pink-haired enby's undercut?
The nonbinary lesbian rep!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE THEM
Holy shit an actually funny meme from that place wtf
Second-hand war on gender
I am sure the comments are nice and understanding
i love this sm
I somehow look like both of the NB peeps
lol
Nonbinary lesbians??
I feel represented by the cryptid being summoned by gals, but confusing the hell out guys when I somehow keep ending up with them.
Why is this true? (At least for me)
The only one of these memes I've actually laughed at 👏
The enbies are supplying the boys with weapons and the girls with sigil making supplies. The grind never stops.
Give war a chance!
Til non binary people are war proffers
Can i get sum 22lr (40 grain) and 5.56 hollow points?
I took a screenshot bc the bottom two are literally me and my friend. I look just like the pink one and he looks like the fluffy black haired one
I love it so much

at the same time

I hate it so much.
I love this meme
Trigender people are hired mercenaries
Hey thats Rebel the Cannae pro gear Gøat of Wįsdøm
We richhhhh
ts wasn't funny inna first place dude
Go for it, chances are it will make someone smile, worst case scenario you lose useless internet points
Wish that sub wasn’t women/sometimes coven only :(
Is there a cool witchy sub for all genders?
And trigender people are hired mercenaries
OMG and they were ~~roommates~~ shady business partners
[deleted]
It's pinned directly into their flesh. Nonbinary people know no pain.
Velcro? I have some Velcro bows that I stick to my undercut once in a while, for the silly
Here? Yep, in the toxic cesspit? Nope
lol nice! also r/voidpunk moment.
From what I've seen you don't need to be a woman or witchcraft practitioner. They accept all genders and anyone who's enamored/okay with witchcraft/occult.
There are regular posts from enby people asking if they belong, and every time it's a resounding ""YES!""
I hang there often. Trans, NB, and male witches are welcome.

It's definitely open to anyone.
They don't gender witches. To them, witch is an identifier than any person of any gender can apply to themselves. They are also open to anyone who is against the patriarchy, including men, so enbies are definitely welcome there.
Nah you’re cool, it’s super accepting of everyone, it just gets worded as for women because of people not thinking things through and remembering that feminism isn’t always just women, lol. And the coven only stuff is just people who are part of the sub so that people who find it on explore don’t fill it with bigotry and stuff
It's really not though
partners in gender crime >:)
Ahhhhhhhhhh

Now THAT makes sense, thank you very much u kind stranger of the online world! 

(Hahahahaha, this meme is funny indeed.)
I wish this were the case Q_Q
Velcro sticks to hair?

Well I know what I'm doing to my partner's undercut when I next see them 😈
Well yeah obviously here, I meant that r/dankmemes consists of 90% kids under 15 so the comments when you post anything lgbt become a complete shitshow
The summery just feels like I’d fee out of place there but I like what they post/talk about :/
Even a trans guy?
Ok, good to know. Thank you!
As a trans man I am definitely against the patriarchy. And I’m a baby witch so I’d love to participate!
It’s just the summery for the sub makes it very much sound like it
Gender crime. Sure. We'll go with that. Just ignore that truckload of military weapons. The client will be here soon enough for those.
Mood 💜
Mine are specifically made for hair, idk if normal Velcro will stick as well
Nah the comments for this post on r/dankmemes was actually pretty wholesome. And r/dankmemes isn't just for teenagers. A lot of older people are on there. I should know cus I'm on r/dankmemes and I'm in my 20s.
I won’t tell you how to feel about it obviously, but in my experience they accept anyone and everyone as long as they aren’t bigoted and follow the sub rules. It *is* for all genders- they’re quite open to trans people of all sorts. It’s quite lovely actually.

Of course if you don’t want to join it, you aren’t obligated to at all. Just thought I’d share.
i’m transmasculine and can absolutely understand that, but i feel pretty well accepted there and i don’t talk much about my practice either. they’re very accepting and when i see any non-warranted hate (like anything that’s not against people acting bigoted) i often see it discussed later or taken down/deleted because of the backlash. people even post things often like “im a man/enby/etc who was wondering if this space is open to me” and all of the answers are people saying yes, normally also saying that as long as they’re open-minded as well.
Yes, they’re very accepting.
Yep! I've seen multiple posts from transmasculine folks. 

Witch is a gender neutral term, and everyone can fight the patriarchy.
shhhhhh they’re holding them for a friend
I’d love to participate! It’s just how the summery of the sub is worded that makes me feel weird when it’s called a “women-centered” sub. But if they are inclusive then thank you for letting me know.
It’s women-centered in that it is mostly based around women’s issues, but it’s absolutely open to everyone (who supports human rights and isn’t bigoted, of course). 

I’ve been a member for quite awhile and they’ve never been anything less than welcoming that I’ve seen. Really nice people, all in all."	10213hl	NonBinary	2375	0.99	2023-01-03 07:05:15
Students who identify outside of male or female can not complete the housing application, despite freshmen being required to live in residence halls. This college prides itself on being inclusive.		"Do they have a diversity and inclusion director? I would message them directly.
The person you emailed probably has no power to fix it, I'd escalate to the DEI director like ultraspiral said.

Don't be afraid to raise a stink on social media or bring it to a reporter if you don't hear back in 24-48 hours, or if they make it your problem.

Your college likely has a newspaper, and I bet they'd love to do a story on this shit. If not, reach out to lgbtq media like [www.them.us](https://www.them.us) 

And if you live in a blue state which protects trans people, this could be a form of illegal gender identity based discrimination, though obs consult a lawyer.
What's the point of having the ""other"" option if that bars a student from living on campus?
Oh, yeah. How inclusive. ""You can pick male, female, or 'other', but if you choose the last, you'll be banned, because we're very inclusive""
If you’re comfortable enough to share the name of the college, even if just through a DM, I’d really appreciate it. I work at a high school as a college counselor and would love to make sure that this college isn’t visiting our school until this is fixed. Of course I totally understand if you’re not comfortable sharing.
“We allow you to choose rooms depending on how you identify, only if you identify binarily of course !”
lmfao dont fill it out! and when they give you attitude for it, bring it up the chain of command that you were discriminated in the housing app due to your gender. i doubt the dean will want that coming out ;)) dont do anything if youre being treated unjustly. you already took initiatve to message and were given a bs answer. what i said is exactly what i have done in the past. if its \*that\* important for freshman to live on campus, they need to accommodate you, or allow you to live off campus under special circumstances. sometimes you cant make a change by being nice. you could help all the future nonbinary people that enter too.
Isn’t this considered discrimination based on *Bostock v. Clayton County Holders*? I know that applies to Tile VII, but the rule is that “discrimination based on…sex…” means gender identity. I’m pretty certain they just admitted to illegal discrimination.

EDIT: Quick edit I wanted to say, if you can and want to consider it, I recommend getting a lawyer before changing anything. I kinda think you got a case here
Sometimes choosing “other” or “non-binary/agender” feels like nothing  but outing yourself on documents . . . I’m starting to lean just toward always checking “female” just to be safe.
Ugh.  How did they answer?
Their reply was (1) very specific & (2) completely useless

I'm sorry you have to put up with their nonsense
Because nonbinaries are gods, and we must be housed in temples.
How can they require you to live in the residence halls? How is that even enforced? That whole thing is just…. really weird. I’m genuinely really sorry
Gender segregation needs to end
My former employer has an LGBTQIA+ dorm building that seems to be an acceptable compromise for students.
If this is Georgia Tech (going based on them calling themselves Tech, email policy, Res Life name, and mention in another comment about the state's history of transphobic legislation), DM me and I'll get you connected with the right resources.
So, Wait, Are You Then Not Allowed To Be A Freshman If You're Non-Binary? That's Outrageous.

Honestly, I Don't Get Why They'd Need To Separate Them Based On Gender In The First Place. Just Feels Like Pointless Bureaucracy To Me.
If this is Tennessee Tech there is a chance if you elevate it to the right people you may get put in Tech Village.
Bring to the dean bro
Then why have ""other"" if you don't allow it? I don't get that one
Office of Equal Opportunity. Should have an access coordinator. Additionally, you may find help with the dean of students office or ombud. From someone who works in a reslife position at a state uni, you really gotta work the discrimination angle to make any progress. In the end, they'll likely say you'll have to pick one for logistics reasons, but you wont have to change how you list your identity
if the school has a good independent student newspaper, I would also get in touch with them in addition to what other commenters have suggested. I worked at a student newspaper in college and this is the exact kind of thing we would've wanted to write about. that can hopefully bring some local attention to the issue
Ok from what little I know about tech, emailing from an external email isn’t a huge issue. It’s not like you sent them some file to download, so that point is moot in my eyes. Also, yeah, if you really want to drive a truck through this, I’d reach out to local media.
This is ridiculous. I went to a big tech college, and they did not segregate dorms or floors by genders (and for roommates you got to choose which genders you were comfortable rooming with, and could choose any/all). Sorry you are dealing with this!!
Why the hell do they have a “other” option if you can’t fucking  pick it?
Sad. That isn't nice. I guess pick the gender you identify with most closely, or the one where you'll get less questions/harassment.
[Inspect element](https://twitter.com/manedpup/status/1393333634694881282) the application? 😈
Ok first of all, why have the ""other"" option then???
Second, this is transphobic and discriminating. Not allowed housing just cus you're out of the binary? What absolute bullcrap
Even the fact that the floors are separated by sex is stupid. Is having a neighbor of the opposite sex really that scandalous and despicable?
Well, in Eastern Europe, it applies for all dorms. You can only choose a room fit for your agab, only with similar people (eg. if your afab, you can only live with girls).
What's the point of having other on the application then?
The college I’m going to has a similar policy, but they asked for “whichever gender I feel most comfortable sharing a bathroom” and to speak with their housing director if I needed any additional accommodations due to my gender.
Theoretically, if there are not enough non-binary roommates, do you have a preference on which gender you would want to room with? I know it's imperfect, but picking that gender will get you the result you want in the end. It doesn't matter what your AGAB is.
Did they answer what you're meant to do?
In a co-ed dorm, there shouldn't be a problem.
Bruh
What the fucking point of having an ""other"" option then?

What a joke.

MAKE THE ""OTHER"" OPTION WORK, FOR FUCK'S SAKE. IT'S NOT JUST A FUCKING PREFERENCE.
My uni was the same way, the first time we filled out the application for dorms there wasn’t an “other option”. Now there is, but if we select it we can’t choose a dorm since they’re all gender specific (my roommate and I are both non-binary so the frustration is shared)
Whoever this person is that responded doesn’t seem to understand what you’re asking, or does but doesn’t believe that there are more than two genders. Damn. 

First, so sorry you’re dealing with this right now. Starting college is already overwhelming, you have to learn so much about financial aid, choosing classes, etc. then to throw this blatant discrimination on top?? 

Second, as others have said you absolutely have a case here. I hope you can find the energy to reach out for help on this to take these mfs down. Finding a professor or instructor to take your side could be a great start because they might be able to do a lot of the difficult work for you (reaching out to orgs or people in power, advocating on your behalf to higher ups, etc)
My work, at the largest university in my state, has locker rooms and absolutely no NB option. We're more inclusive than others in that locker rooms and bathrooms are identified sex, but if you're enby? 

Good luck, hope you enjoy being naked around a group of people you probably won't feel comfortable around. There's individual changing spaces that can be used but no lockers for individuals there.
I bet it's just a software problem. They'd have to create another data set. Instead they just have you pick which one you'd be most comfortable with.

Which gender do you want to see more and house with them 🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m newly coming out as non binary trans male. I feel I’m 50/50. I’m nit linger ever depressed since accepting and want bottom surgery only and be put on testosterone. Identify male as I’ve lived just over 50 years as. Time to experience a new bottom. That means I also can’t tick male or female or both at once. Us non binary people are all different and the same. This is a good argument that the university is not practicing equality. That’s discrimination against a marginalised person. Evil really. They need to be able to provide the same things like rooms for say non binary people like us. By doing so everyone no matter of disadvantage etc can study and live the same. That’s true equality. On top of that they are basically putting you in the corner with no choice and forcing you to make a choice of male or female against your will which is a form of abuse and human rights issue. It’s clear they didn’t read your email. What I saw was you writing that you are non binary but you are not sure if both genders or no genders etc. Life’s hard enough. Mind you once I knew I was non binary I felt a little better. Added the trans and I’m fully me. I’m only just coming out and it’s about less than a week. Seriously because I’m just accepting me etc if I was In that situation it could send me over the edge.  I have so much fear people will reject me. Meaning close grit das and family. Didn’t happen but this school would force me to make a choice and that’s not right. Id seem legal advice. Good luck and know we are a family and don’t take those peoples shit on
Start seeing a lawyer
My school is the same, sort of.  We get to select our gender identity from an expansive list, but we also have to share our biological sex.  Housing assignments are based on sex only; gender is completely disregarded.
They do not know/understand the definition of gender. 😑 
I would look into a more knowledgeable institution..
Why is it an option if you can’t be there based on that what the fuck?
We'Re ToTaLlY InCLuSiVe bUt We NeEd To KnOw If YoU'rE a GiRl NoN-bInArY oR a BoY NoN-bInArY

For real, I'm sorry you got this response and I'm sorry that people do not understand what non-binary means. I am glad and proud of you for seeking ways to get this brought to the attention of people who can do something about it.
jesus and i thought my school was bad with being performative
Currently looking
Yes! Or if they don't, what I might do is find a faculty member who either teaches a subject/class related in some way to equality, or otherwise indicates they'd clearly be on the side of reason here. For example, my dad and cousin are professors. If you looked at their profiles on their colleges' sites you'd see that my dad has taught courses that clearly mention LGBT rights, and my cousin mentions his husband in his bio.
""Diversity and inclusion director""? I want to know a place/country where that things exists because I live in Italy and that sounds like sci-fi here
Yes, currently seeing what I can do.

And I live in the state with the record for transphobic legislation so… yeah lol.
Who knows. It’s really just a form design flaw at this point.
Thanks, this is so lovely and validating! Thanks
yeah i read that and went ???
I second this! I was close friends with a trans girl during my time in college (2012-2016) and she basically got her own big ass room all to herself because once her roommate(s) realized she wasn’t a guy, they didn’t wanna live with her. You might even be able to connect with all the other non-binary ppl on campus and discuss ways to further bring this to the attention of higher ups— maybe you can even request to specifically room with other non-binary ppl too! If yall have an LGBTQ club or org I’d take it to them because they should have a staff member in attendance with each meeting. The Queers & Allies club was amazing at my college and where I realized binary gender was a literal construct of society. Hoping you can have some ease in your college housing friend🤲🏽
I couldn't afford one, and I'm still living at home and a minor.
I’m so sorry you both feel this way. I feel similar at times but, thank goodness, less scared (like for my safety) and more unsure. I used to love forms - filling out information in little boxes and all that. But forms can be so dangerous and uninclusive. I feel sad when I think about that. Good news: you’re safe here!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💛🤍💜
Lately, same. I’m so scared about what could happen
Im still hitting ""male"" on job applications and housing stuff and it always makes me grit my teeth
They didn’t lmao
[deleted]
Most schools have residency requirements for traditional freshmen (18-19 year olds) who don’t live with their parents within a certain distance. That’s normal. However, the school should have gender inclusive housing.
Not necessarily. I’d say mandatory gender segregation needs to end, but there are definitely people who would be wildly uncomfortable in mixed gender residences, and that’s ok too.
It’s not Georgia
Why Do People Talk Like This? What Is Being Communicated?
seems more they didnt think about it hard enough when adding other.

They only have binary roomates allowed. this isnt too shocking as enbies are kinda rare. 

however, the numbnuts just tied it to the gender variable out of laziness, instead of giving an option when you select ""other"" of ""do you want a male or female roomate?"" they force you to pick a binary gender to identify as just to get housing
Who are the right people exactly?
Considering
I can look into it
I work in higher ed, this practice is actually very common because of FERPA regulations. It's moreso about verifying that any personal information released is going directly to the student, not a family member/other person accessing their email or attempting to make changes to their enrollment or student records.

Edit: just want to clarify I do think this dorm policy is transphobic and horrible!! Not defending them in *any* way.
I think the person they are dealing with is a dumb ass.
“Drive a truck through this” ❤️❤️❤️
They want to prevent bluetooth pregnancy
No. I’ve contacted the women’s and gender center though. If needed I’ll speak to the dean and res life head.
They should do a better job at specifying this if that’s the case. It comes off much differently.
Agreed, database changes for existing fields can be Super Messy, risky, and expensive, especially if there are multiple systems referencing the existing field for gender. Like, yeah, they may have a plan to fix it but it's not as easy as a switch to flip.

The email says that you can't use the *form* without selecting M or F, but presumably there's another way to get into the system, although it may be more likely that they'd put you either with a roommate of a gender you don't mind rooming with, or in a single room like is often done for on-campus students with some types of medical needs. Definitely get in touch with whatever DEI office is available.
Trolls will not be tolerated.
This one is free 💀 

Not like entirely but I have the most scholarships for this one. I go to almost completely free, whereas I can’t do that with the others I applied to.
Also look for the university ombudsman or human rights director. Most universities, at least in Canada, have one - they mediate and resolve conflicts like these and advocate for students' rights.
Gender Studies is also a key phrase to lookout for.
From my understanding, most schools in the US have them, not all of them (probably). Though I am unsure where else they might be commonly found.

The university I currently attend has one, and they are pretty prominent on campus
Most universities in the Netherlands have them now too, although that's a change in the last few years. So they haven't done that much yet, but at least they're trying.
In my uni (uk) each subject has an EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion) officer who helps deal with this kind of stuff, plus the university wide EDI team
My mental health clinic in the US has one!
I mean in the US they, too, still think it’s sci-fi, which is why it’s commonly uncommon. Outside of schools, some big name companies and startups have these Directors as a way to be “forward thinking”. I had one at a startup company I worked for and she was trash. When BLM broke out she outwardly admitted that she had bouts of micro-aggression that she displayed that she didn’t even *know* was her being inherently racist. So lmao. Again, in the US it’s sometimes sci-fi to us too.
Work at a school in the uk and we have an equality and diversity officer and the college I attended had a equality and diversity student team who were representatives from different minorities who would arrange outings and such.
If this is Georgia Tech, DM me and I can set you up with the right resources (posting both here and on the main thread because I know Reddit notifications can be weird sometimes).
Or it is simply performative inclusion with no intent to ever actually back it with solid policy.
i appreciate the effort but not quite inclusive enough 😅
Your state ACLU might want to hear about your situation if you want to try and challenge it.
Your state's attorney general would likely be interested regardless.
Interesting. Wasn’t the same for my college although you did lose out on certain privileges for not living on campus. Thanks for educating me
I think if you applied that sentence to race you might realize how prejudiced it is
As I Am But One Lowly Person, And Not A Hivemind Of Everyone Who Types This Way, I Unfortunately Cannot Tell You Why People Do It.
I'm not sure, I have went there in over 6 years. You could maybe contact the Lambda organization and see if they or their sponsoring professor could help.
Ohhhhhhh ok. Very interesting, and I learned something new today!! Thanks for the info!!
Hehe I got it from my dad and i love it so much! It’s such a fun phrase!! 💛💛💛
Cool! The closest thing to a Diversity and Inclusion director in Italy is my italian professor that literally said to me ""Sorry, I can't use the correct pronouns because as a teacher  I have to follow the school's rules. Maybe I can respect your pronouns outside of the school's building""
or even meant to 'weed out the undesirables' while maintaining the facade of virtue.
Also very possible.
I was thinking this too. But that just opens them up to even more controversy and backlash to have it and not honor it than to just not have it. Or to just outright ask for AGAB instead.
What's the process for that?
I might look into it
It's valid to feel uncomfortable around particular people but using trauma as an excuse for sexism should no longer be tolerated in 2023. I am a transgender man who has experienced plenty of abuse from cis men. Still I do not say that I don't trust men because, as a man, I understand how crushing and dehumanizing those kind of prejudices are.
Yes if I said that about race it would be racist. What is your point?
yes thank you for the scathing social analysis no shit you could have very easily just said why you do it.
That’s sucks. I’m so sorry your pronouns aren’t being respected. Also what the duck (typo but decided to leave it 😜) kind of post-secondary institution (or anywhere for that matter!!!) has rules saying “disrespect queer & trans people, and whatever you do, don’t even respect a person’s pronouns and use the correct ones if you want a shot at tenure here.” Are they also required to deadname or wtf?
We've got similar things in Germany beside focal points for harassment and stuff... But the politics are very complicated, if something happened you can talk to them but actually they can't do anything for the protection of the victim, they can't exmatriculate or suspend the first abuser as this can only be done by the university and they just won't do it...
I would think it could be a bad idea to put trans fems in a male only residence
Every state has its own chapter and each chapter has a contact form. I live in Oregon so mine looks like this : https://www.aclu-or.org/en/about/contact-us

I used to work in the legal nonprofit world and would reply to intake emails like these. Even if it's not something they would want to take on they should be able to point you to an organization that would.
Unfortunately I Don't Actually Know Why I Do It, So Even That I Could Not Say. I'm Sorry I'm Not Able To Be Of More Help To You.
Actually yes. Professors always used deadname with me. That sucks. It's called italian school system
It is, but this school doesn't seem like it would care or even accept that the student is trans.

Maybe the initial scenario I was introduced to the school made me a lot more cynical about it than logical.
My trans femme friend at SCAD (Savannah, GA) back in 2012-2016 was placed in dorms with males… every single guy she was roommates with ended up moving out except the one bisexual dude🤦🏽 Hopefully things have changed but who even knows! I wasn’t identifying as non-binary at the time so things like housing kinda just went over my head. I had already been conditioned into a gendered society since I went to an “all-girls” HS from 7th-12th grades…
I mean putting anyone in gendered housing that doesn't match their identity is a bad idea. Not just women in men's spaces
pensavo che da noi le cose fossero migliorate... mi spiace :( restero' in california
the letter says ""you'll go whichever you identify as"" which looks like they're inviting trans people to identify as male or female... but erasing non-binary people?

Guess who broke my schools Gender structure 💛🤍💜🖤	"My sixth form is running the yearly Head Boy and Head Girl elections soon. I was debating whether I should run for it as my birth sex or not, but I spoke to my form tutor about it (who is an absolute legend by the way). She knows that I have a lot of internalised homophobia and etc from my old school, so she told me not to be afraid of who I am and it really inspired me! 

I emailed my head of sixth form explaining that I am Non Binary and thus I would like to run as ‘Head Person’ or something along those lines instead, arguing that it was more inline with modern gender inclusivity. 

He agreed with me and promised that he would re-make the election structure to allow me to run (as usually one boy and one girl are elected). This is me coming out to my year group and teachers, and everyone that knows about it so far has been to excited that I’ve done such a progressive thing!! 

I needed somewhere to share this because I’m so excited and proud! Thank you if you read this far <3"	"That’s so awesome! It sounds like you have some really supportive people working at your school. Wishing you the best of luck in your campaign to become head person!
""Head Person"" sounds a bit clunky but ""Head Student"" would be so good! It's inclusive and more descriptive of the role. Also if they want to refer to one specific Head Student, they could just say your name
It just made my day knowing that there are people out there who are willing to break the gender norms in our schools.
Thank you so much for your contribution. I will watch your career with great interest. Please do update or make another post as to whether you get Head person or not!
(◕ᴗ◕✿)
That's great! Hope you do well in the election. And hey, even if you don't win, imagine all the other closeted enbys at your school, looking at you and thinking, ""Hey... it's safe to come out.""
Yay!

💛🤍💜🖤
What you did was brave and will help others, too.
🥺🥺❤️❤️
That's awesome!

Good luck!
Great job yo!!
That's amazing! ❤
You should be proud ,that’s awesome ! ❤️
OMG brilliant! I'm so glad your teachers and everyone is supportive! Best of luck in the elections!
I wish I could run for head person ;;-;; I’m a masc nb, but I go to an all female school and sadly they’re very big with having the Only Head Girl thing
People really underestimate how easy it is to change policy at your school. Simply asking the right people can get you very far. I remember, both at my high school and college, just asking for help or accomodations started a few great programs. 

But also remember that you're probably not the only one dealing with your issues at your school, so just by asking, you can help others who are in a similar situation as yourself. Take the steps to ask for help, and you'll be helping more than just yourself.
God your so awesome! We need people like you to speak up and spread hope!
Good work!
great, proud of you 🙈
I am sharing in the excitement! Go you! You are helping that school take the right steps! And congrats on coming out to those people! I hope you are elected Head Person!
Stuff like this needs to happen more, awesome!
We stan
I'm sooo proud of you !
Omg you are so inspiring!! Not only did you advocate for yourself, but you’ve helped with updating traditions for others. You are goals ❤️
You are amazing! So glad you've got good adult allies at your school. Keep being your awesome self!
Congrats and good luck!
Also an older Non Binary person who went through hell within the school system long ago I say thank you. Amazing!
That’s amazing and gives me hope! Well done 💕
My sister's school has 2 Head Students now rather than girl/boy!!!! It's generally understood that the two people aren't usually of the same gender but if it came down to it there's no specific rule about it. Great system.

Good luck with it!!
I'm curious how it will change the game. One head girl, one head boy, one head person, making you automatically the head person as long as you don't lose to any other non binary competitor? Only one head person? Two head people regardless of their gender?

I need answers.
All I know is the title General Secretary has no gender, comrade
Based!
Oh my goodness that's awesome! Great job!!
Omg that's great!!  Good for you 💖💖
Epic. Good luck.
That’s fantastic!! Congratulations!! 😱😱❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻🏳️‍🌈
Sooooo..... Was ""Badass in Chief"" already taken?
Thank you so much!! My philosophy teacher called me a revolutionary which I think may be the best compliment even lmao
Thank you for the advice!!
I agree, ""Head Student"" sounds less strange. I said ""Head Person"" out loud and it was kind of funny.
Of course, I’ll be sure to update!! Thank you so much for your kind words
Hello! It’s been a while until I could update because COVID held everything back, but we got the election results this week. 

And....

I was elected!!

Me and my good friend were both elected to hold the two non gender exclusive offices as created by my head of sixth form and I couldn’t be more excited!

The fact that the sixth form and teachers elected me just shows that people are getting more progressive and accepting, gives some hope :))
Thank you! I do hope that I can help other people with it <3
Thank you 🥺
Thank you so much <3
That’s so true! Hopefully by making even small changes we can help other people in the future.
I plan to run my election campaign on making the school as progressive as it can possibly be <3
Thank you so much ☺️
Thank you so much 🥺🥺❤️
I hope that all is well for you now! Sending love <3🥺
That’s the system I proposed to my head of sixth form! I think it would work great
The system I proposed to my head of sixth form was two Head Students regardless of gender, but I’ll update it if he makes a different system!
To be fair the title General Secretary is pretty cool
Thank you 🥺🥺
💛🤍💜🖤
Good job my friend I hope your new position treats you well!

Just your local enby feeling pretty good at a gender/body inclusive pole class😛		"Okay with that username and the video, I am 100% certain you are the teeny angelic/demonic creature whispering in my ear! So good to see you outside of your work hours doing something you love, awesome!
Dayum! It takes a lot of strength to hang on to those things, kudos to you and your mighty muscles
Fellow poler here! Nice spin!
Spiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnn
Hell yes!!!! I wanna go
Wowza! Holy arm and leg strength! 

I’m always blown away by pole dancers. I’d love to learn it if I had any upper body strength at all (I don’t)!
Pole class is amazing! You use muscles you never knew you had...haha. It is a great workout. Have fun.
I'm glad this is making you happy. I'm sure that's extremely hard to do.
You are awesome!!
I don't know much about pole dancing but spinning like that looks so fun!
Omg you’re doing an incredible job 😍🖤✨👏👏👏 I am both jealous of you and very happy for you!!
I've always wanted to learn how to pole dance but sadly there aren't any classes available since I live in a small town. Can't wait to move and look into it. Especially if gender inclusive classes are a thing now.
You better twirlllll 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow ! It’s soooo cool ! Knowing that there are some inclusive classes out there reignites my desire to try it. Thank you for sharing your beautiful video ✨
Awn, makes me miss pole class, I haven't been able to go to the studio since covid but I used to love it sooo much. Lucky you that you get to! Spin on!
Awesome skill.
Your thighs look so strong!!! Also, I’m impressed by your strength in general book pole dance requires strength.
How does one find such a class?🥺
that’s talent right there!
Spins for the wins! 🙌
Impressive! I got dizzy by just looking, so kudos to to you for your performance and stable inner ear.❤
Mark NSFW
This is SO IMPRESSIVE I could literally NEVER!!
Thanks friend! Definitely helps me appreciate what my body can do vs how it looks lol
Thank you😊
Training can build your strenght up! Don't give up if you really want to try!
Now in days there are tons of online classes! But you would need to get a pole which can be annoying, especially if you don't know if you even like it yet... but may be something to check out!
Yeah, our studio only has 6 people max including the instructor because of covid but normally 3. I did online classes a bit during the hard-core lockdown. I hope you're able to get back to it soon!
So I checked out all the studios near me and carefully read their reviews and ethos and whatnot. The one I go to has a policy of and focus on inclusion. They believe pole is for everyone and have lgbt+ instructors as well as a variety of students, body sizes, genders, poc, etc. I really love the community. 0 body shaming. I'd start by looking at the websites and reviews of studios around you or messaging them asking!
Not sure this is NSFW... I'm fully clothed (the pants are pole shorts) and doing a pole fitness class, not anything remotely suggestive
Theres nothing NSFW happening here hun, its not OP's responsibility to cater to your personal hangups
You definitely could! It's just practice. I've only been doing it on and off for 6 months
Honestly it looks great too
I’ve been doing a lot of strength training recently but not at that level yet! Working on it though!
that's, actually a really comprehension and thoughtful reply, thank you so much!
Even the YouTuber Markiplier has video where he tries out pole dancing with his friends. That was an experience to watch, I found it funny since they had no clue how fit someone has to be to do cool tricks. XD
Pole helps you get strong! You definitely don't need to be to start!

Hey would it be okay with you if I get this tattooed? I’ve been wanting a ufo tattoo and a pride tattoo for a long time and I’m in love with this design.
I wonder if the aliens will only take lgbtqia+ lads to space or if it's a gay-turning beam rather than an abducting one?

I love seeing surveys be more inclusive of other gender identities these days.		"It always bothers me how they put male and female separate from trans male and trans female, like at least make it cis male/female then instead of separating trans individuals from their gender
""Transgender male"" and ""transgender female"" are not gender identities tho (binary trans people's gender is either ""man"" or ""woman""). If they wanted to know if one is cis or trans, there should be another question for that.
i agree with other comments about trans men and trans women being put as separate. I understand some places might need to know for medical reason, then i suppose it is okay, and same in case there are anti discriminatory practices/needed, but it would be nice to have it as a separate question. like: cis or trans
\>decline to answer

my gender is **no**
Only nitpick is 'male and female"" are different from ""transgender male and transgender female."" Other than that it's cool
*Gender fluid is running around screaming*
A step close to the optimal answer sheet

(a fill in the blank)
I'm sad that agender or no gender isn't an option. Like.. OK I have to pick a gender now?
why even ask tho
An EXCELLENT sign!!!
Meanwhile in the UK we don't even get an ""other"" option on government forms.
I agree, but I think it might trying to distinguish gender minorities from cis folks for a reason.  The survey is about healthcare, and there's lots of questions that ask about how accessible Healthcare is to different people. Like, if you don't speak English, how hard was it to find accommodations?   Or, if an overwhelming majority of trans/gender minorities answer that their provider didn't listen to them or give adequate care, that's useful data.

But it still feels icky.
A large portion of cis people don't know that that's an accurate term for them, they wouldn't tick the box. Like before I learned about trans people I accidentally said I was on a form, several years before I realised I actually am.
[removed]
That’s fair, but it’s still a step in the right direction.
agender_irl
We agenders are still under the non-binary umbrella. At least we aren’t totally left out like enbies so often are
So the data can be divided into various data groups based on demographic information gathered from the survey.  This allows the data to be analyzed across different groups of people.  

For example, a researcher might find a trend that Hispanic respondants who don't speak English as a first language see telehealth as a barrier to Healthcare. (These are just hypotheticals).  Or, that gender minorities don't feel that their GP is trying to help them.  The data can be split more if the survey asks for geographical info.  For example,  the former statement about gender minorities may not be true for respondants on the east coast, etc.  It's a way of viewing the data from different lenses, all of which are useful when action is to be taken to fix desparities and shortcomings for certain groups, if they exist.

One can also just decline to answer, too.
Yeah I get you sometimes need the separation, but using cis-male and cis-female would make it inclusive and still just as correct, could even make * and describe cis so people outside of the loop still know what to answer
I can't tell if this is a copy pasta or you genuinely thought this was the right place to put that opinion.

SEX (if I'm not mistaken) is your primary sexual characteristics (penis and testicles or vagina and uterus).

Gender is not so rigit, and is basically (over simplified) your brains sex, transgender means your gender doesn't align with your sex assigned at birth.

After looking through your comment I don't think I can find a single correct fact, although I'd happily reconsider my definitions if you can give me some sources to scientific papers supporting your claims
wrong
I'm agender but I don't consider myself nonbinary because to me that still indicates some kind of gender, but I have none. I personally would like a no gender option, because in my eyes it's different from enby.
Oh I get what you mean now.  That totally makes sense.
My favorites are the ones that have a choose all that apply so for peeps that are transfem enby like myself you can check trans and female and non binary. Even for binary trans folks getting to check female/male and then trans separately instead of them being completely exclusive I would imagine feels better.
The issue may be that a lot of people don't actually know what cis means. Many of my friends, who never had trouble questioning their gender and don't follow the LGBTQ scene don't know what the majority of gender terms mean. If they happened not to find ""male"" and ""female"" as options, they wouldn't really know what to answer. Also they have always thought about themselves as male and female, not as cis-male or cis-female while a trans-male for example knows perfectly that he's trans. It would be necessary to put a little explanation of all the options so I guess that who writes the surveis considers it easier just to write male and female. I don't see anything bad about it as I wouldn't see anything bad if they changed it if more cis people would know what cis means and think about themselves as cis.
I honestly didn't know what cis meant for awhile lol.
This is such a great idea.
Non-binary just means you’re not one of the “traditional” cis genders though, it doesn’t imply you have a different one.
I could also see how changing it to ""cis woman"" could be a barrier to people with low literacy. I would prefer to ask one question about gender identity, and a follow-up about trans identity. That would also distinguish nonbinary vs trans nonbinary, which could offer interesting insights. Survey design gets complicated very quickly if you're actually committed to doing a good job. But plenty of researchers don't even make the effort so I give this one an A for effort and B- for execution. 🏳️‍⚧️
Most people would assume nonbinary people have some kind of a gender or a mix of genders. Sure agender is included in nonbinary, but to me it's a bit different by definition. If I were to answer this gender question it would be ""decline to answer""
100% agree it should be a separate follow-up question asking if you consider yourself trans. It should be optional and have ""unsure"" and/or ""it's complicated"" or something similar as an option. I really can't answer that with a simple yes or no and I'm sure I'm not the only one, lol.

Besides cis people not understanding that cis applies to them, I'm sure plenty of binary trans folks would like to be able to choose male/female without having to out themselves as trans, or claim to be cis. So, making the only options for male & female include cis or trans would probably not be great.
>100% agree it should be a separate follow-up question asking if you consider yourself trans. It should be optional and have ""unsure"" and/or ""it's complicated"" or something similar as an option. I really can't answer that with a simple yes or no and I'm sure I'm not the only one, lol.

Idk, I feel like this would get complicated quickly? Because what being 'trans' means to people collecting data vs. what it means to people on a personal level might differ. I'd imagine from a data collecting point of view it might just mean 'people who are a gender minority/not cis' as you're trying to ascertain the needs of that entire group, so it might not take into account personal nuances and feelings that lead people to use or not use that word even while being a gender minority. 

Like I do consider myself trans but I often run into people who think nonbinary people are 'coopting' that word or intercepting a conversation that isn't theirs, from both exclusionary binary trans people and even non binary people who have internalized that and avoid it for that reason. Or even just nonbinary people who don't feel comfortable using it because they feel ot doesn't match their experience or feel right (which is of course completely okay). And there's a lot of connotations with that word to physical transition and being binary that I think are kinda problematic but very influential. I feel like the survey would have to make clear what they mean by 'trans', or at least provide options for people to explain why they do or don't use the word ('because I am/am not transitioning', 'because I have a different gender than my assigned one', because I'm a binary man or woman', etc.). Because there's a weird thing where the technical definition of the word 'trans' is that it's essentially a synonym for 'non-cis' but the actual working assumption outside of trans spaces (and even inside of them) is that trans=binary trans and nonbinary people usually use the word 'trans' to signify a desire to transition or some experience of dysphoria or transmasculinity or transfemininity.  And as someone who doesn't fit that who *does* use that word, I wouldn't want that assumption made of me, nor would I want that problematic assumption reiterated. I think what you're saying would make sense if in the follow up trans question they made clear their working definition of 'trans', asked people whether they identified with that word, and why/why not, so there isn't an assumption that the data collectors and responders are using the same definition of 'trans' when they might not be.
Well, maybe it would be simplest to exclude the word trans altogether and just ask whether or not the gender they identify with is the same one they were assigned at birth. It's a less loaded question, and much more straight forward for me to answer (as someone who does not actively describe themself as trans, yet is non-cis and part of the greater trans community). If they tried to define trans and ask people to answer based on their definition, whatever that definition might be, someone would get pissed, and it could easily cause a shit storm.
I love this response. My personal approach is to consider the user when writing the survey, and the audience when writing the report. While what we're describing is a complicated question, it allows people to self identify in nuanced ways. This could reduce the potential number of people who say ""this research team doesn't understand people like me,"" and quit. When compiling this data, I would analyze the question responses straight up, and then aggregate trends within cis-nonbinary, trans, genderqueer, and unsure (because ""questioning"" is a distinctly queer experience which can take decades.) That way you have a clear delineation between folks with ""gender stuff"" and everyone else. 

Side note: language is important here, and also good surveys should be population specific. So because this is all hypothetical, I'm not giving my word choices a lot of thought. 

TLDR; surveys should be affirming of diverse identity without compromising data collection
That's is the literal scientific of transgender ""person who's gender identity is different from the one assigned at birth""

All other things about being trans like transition, state of genitals, their actual identity, their biological sex, their AGAB, etc. etc. are simply assumptions and wrong in many cases. Being trans has nothing to do with a lot of stuff people assume it does.
>If they tried to define trans and ask people to answer based on their definition, whatever that definition might be, someone would get pissed, and it could easily cause a shit storm.

Well I mean the generally accepted definition of trans is 'identifying as a gender different the one assigned at birth' with the choice to opt in (meaning people aren't forced to identify that way if they're non-cis but don't like the word trans) so I don't think that would be too controversial of a definition for them to work off of. To me the best approach is usually the most inclusive and comprehensive one. They could use that definition and then ask people from that point onward whether they actually use the label in a practical sense in day to day life and why (which gives room for other more personal interpretations of the word as applied to individuals). Or maybe that is convoluted and it's better to leave the word out. Idk. I don't design surveys, so I can't say what the best and most workable approach is tbh. I was just adding another perspective to the issue.
Okay, but I see people aggressively arguing against that definition all the time (both transmeds and clueless cis people alike), and a lot of people who meet that definition would not describe themselves as trans, either due to the assumptions about that word or otherwise.

I personally never call myself trans, because I don't find it a useful term when the majority of people will assume I'm binary trans and physically transitioning. I will stick up for any non-binary person who wants to use the trans label, because they should have the right to do so, but for me personally....eh, not worth it. Like a lot of agender people, I don't really feel connected to the idea of being trans. Am I? Yes, no, maybe, whatever. I don't want to argue about it either way. I find the whole concept of gender confusing, frustrating and alienating.

I don't mind being included under the trans umbrella, but I hate it when people try to force the word trans on non-binary people who don't want to use it, especially when they accuse them of being transphobic for it. It would be like insisting all pansexuals are bisexual because they fit the definition and not using the term bi makes them biphobic. Like yeah, I guess technically they could be bi, but if they don't want to call themselves bi, let them be.
I think the issue is that the people who argue against this definition are usually ignorant or using transphobia to make their arguments. They have very little valid ground for argumentation and that definition is becoming the most consistently used one. It's fine if individual nonbinary people don't identify with the word trans because of personal or social experience, it's a lot more complex on a personal level for many people, but at least to my knowledge, when it comes to research and policy and organizing, the word trans usually means 'non-cis' or people who experience gender outside of the cis norm, or at the very least it is starting to (more actively include nonbinary people). The world does assume trans = binary trans, but it also usually takes trans to mean gender minority or someone with 'gender stuff', so on a group level there is utility to having us be under that umbrella, or else our rights and concerns tend to get ignored. I know many people who are (unfortunately) only taken seriously in their search for medical or even just legal and/or social transition (with no surgery) when they use the word 'trans' because that word has more weight and more history behind it, and there is a lot of benefit to nonbinary people allying with binary trans people under the word 'trans' when it comes to fighting for rights because of the history of activism associated with it (a lot of which has also been performed by nonbinary and genderqueer people themselves! The white stripe in the trans flag does stand for nonbinary, after all). 

So on a *personal* level people should have the freedom to opt in or out but on a *group* level until there is a different word that more generally means non-cis (and until the trans/cis binary goes away) 'trans' is the best word to use collectively fight for rights that are mutual to a lot of non-cis people. I'm agender and feel alienated from gender but I also need the activism and organizing that is often performed under the trans umbrella. Even if I didn't use the word trans personally, I'd still feel that the inclusive definition is the correct and most useful one, at least for now. Because in my experience most arguments against it (as in actively exclusionary arguments as opposed to letting enbies choose to opt in or out) are not coming from people who want to give nonbinary people more room to identify outside of the rigid trans/cis binary, but from people who want to alienate us from a community that has resources we need because of their own enbyphobia.
I get where your coming from. It does make sense to be able to group all non-cis people together as gender minorities. At the moment, you're probably right that trans is the best word we have. I do hope the language we use continues to evolve in a positive way, though. I think gender non-conforming cis people deserve to be included more often, too. I personally felt more included by trans\*, but that seems to be dead and gone, and I don't think TGNCNB will ever really catch on.

Regardless of the best definition of trans we have at the moment, and the importance of being able to unite, there still are non-binary people who don't like the idea of still being boxed into the cis/trans binary, and some use terms like metagender to reject it. There are *always* gray areas. I really hate statements like, ""if you're not cis, you're trans,"" because it also implies the inverse, ""if you're not trans, you're cis."" It feels like telling people who are questioning or haven't adapted the trans label for themselves that they are actually cis.

We won't be solving the ignorance/transphobia/enbyphobia problem anytime soon, either. Most people don't want to be educated and aren't willing to change their way of thinking. There are a lot of very loud/aggressive binary trans people who reject non-binary people as trans, especially those who don't want to physically transition, because they think they somehow hurt the trans community. It's awful. And I think this attitude coming from within the community is more harmful than when it comes from the outside..."	o9eyhr	NonBinary	967	0.99	2021-06-28 07:00:32

Denied top surgery	"Went on my last meeting today where they basically told me that being nonbinary isn’t a thing and that they only treat people that are trans with gender dysphoria. Two years ago they said I’m nonbinary bc I’m obese…. then I lost 15cm in my waistline out of spite. Now they said I’m showing too much progress so I have the ”capability to live with my struggles.” Fuck Sweden. LGBT inclusive my ass lmfao

Also doesn’t help that I’m autistic so they just think I’m being confused.

EDIT; oh gosh, I didn’t really expect to get 40+ comments so this is a bit overwhelming but thank you guys for the support !!

I had been advised by most of my FTM trans friends to lie about my identity but sadly it was a bit too late for that as I was halfway through my meetings. 

The reason I didn’t lie is because after the first meeting, the doctor told me that the gov had gotten more inclusive and included nonbinary people. I had thought to myself: 
”Oh, I’m getting lucky!! Guess there is no need to lie.” 

The meeting I went to yesterday she informed me that.. the gov had removed that right once again. She really wanted to help me but she was simply just not allowed to anymore. The only other organisation that included nonbinary people is across the country and now that has also been limited by the gov.
They’re really just trying to limit us from getting help and being happy.

Next step will be time consuming or money consuming and honestly at this point I’d just want to go the money route despite how limited my wallet is. 

Oh well. I’ll get through this eventually :’)"	"Whattttt so sorry to hear this D: 
Is going private an option for you?
Lie to them I guess?
I'm sorry to hear this.
I also live in a country where they don't recognise non-binary as valid. Didn't even try it here. There's only one gender clinic with 10 years wait.

I'm getting my top surgery next week. Going abroad where you don't need any medical proof, just mutual acceptance. Downside is that you need the money for that. But I couldn't be more excited right now.

Have you looked into this possibility?
Sadly its the same thing in Canada (at least when I got top surgery). Although I do have gender dysphoria, I said I was a trans man because I heard that the surgeons will deny people who are nonbinary from getting top surgery.

I'm so sorry about that. It's not fair.
They thought your gender identity was caused by obesity? 🙄
You ""kids"" are trailblazers! Keep fighting for your right.

I'm 53. I'm nonbinary. I have always wished I could have my boobs removed. They get in the way. Bras are awful, uncomfortable and damaging. I don't use them so why have them?

But for me there was no surgery available because I was born a woman and women have boobs. You ""kids"" have changed all of that. 

Duck that. Push. Fight. Change doctors. You deserve to be the best you that you can be.

I'm proud of you. Good luck.
If you are looking for advice: lie to them

If not, man im so sorry. Its bullshit that they don’t recognize your gender or respect your wishes.
idiots will blame everything on obesity
I'm so sorry to hear this.
 I always thought if there's any country in the world, where enby top surgery would be covered it's sweden.

*Sigh.*

In germany there is the option to flat out lie to all doctors and psychiatrist/psychologists that you are a binary trans* guy (you then still may need a ""good"" reason for not wanting to go on T ; or find a doctors who is accepting and understanding and willing to lie to insurances with you )

Or

You pay for it on your own- most places I've looked into also have options for payment plans- 

I don't know if any of those things are an option for you.

I wish you all the best and hope you'll be able to find a way eventually.
Transphobia and ableism wow.
????? Goofy as hell.

Pull a fast one and just say you're a dude. What're they gonna do, put your boobs back in once they do the surgery?
You would think that they would support nonbinary people since they’re the same country that officially implemented they/them pronouns in their language
Ugh I'm so sorry. Unfortunately when I go to the Dr I have to larp the ""Hello it is me, He/Him super binary man and I love monster trucks and fishing!"" in order to get healthcare. It honestly feels impossible to force them to understand the nuances of gender, so my only advice is to just lie. It sucks but the end result made it worth it for me.
Yeah, Sweden sucks. r/transnord recommends lying about it and saying you're FtM.
🤗 (If you like)
Find a new doctor/therapist.
I feel your pain, I was denied in Germany a few years ago because I naively believed they'd accept non-binary people. I'm so sorry this happened to you.
can you go back and say, ""so after some soulsearching it turns out I'm ftm""? or can you approach a new care organization to start fresh?
I'm so sorry this happened to u

The gatekeeping system is so fucking disgusting in the EU 

This is just institutional oppression, nothing else
Pal, you better lie.
So sorry to hear this and I hope you find another way forward.

Sweden is honestly the most conformist non-affirming place I've ever been to and I'm from Africa.
Hi from Stockholm. I wanted radical reduction because my chest was giving me dysmorphia. I went to Kry to a GP ask about that. And they told me “that kind of things u do privately “.
I told her it’s not the case, that I can be diagnosed and get my surgery. So they put me in a waiting list to a clinic that does it. 2 years waiting time for the first appointment, and then it can take 2 years to be diagnosed. The GP was calling me “transsexual” coz her English wasn’t good and my Swedish isn’t enough to talk about medical issues.

I could have a regular reduction as I qualified but then they would make it just a bit smaller, “proportional to by body”, which I am sure it’s not what I need. Long story short I went privately in Dec…
Feel you 💔❤️
Lie, many Non Binary people to do it to get care. 
I was lucky i didn't need to lie, but about half of my Docters asked if i wasn't just a trans man. Because I'm really masc leaning.
So sorry to hear that.
What the fucking fuck. I’m so sorry. That’s not okay
I'm sorry you're going through this right now!! One of my partners is Swedish and they've expressed having a hard time getting trans health care. The trans healthcare system in Sweden truly seems to be garbage.
Honestly, I would send this info to the news. Read just now in DN about how a tv profile who appears to be nb (använder hen som pronomen men är fem-presenting) apparently had few problems getting breast implants to better conform to their gender. They might have done it through private means, was a long text and don't quite remember, but at least the topic is getting a bit of a spotlight at the moment
I’m so sorry your going through that, I hope something works out soon for you!
Lie. Get what you need.
i shall sprint to sweden and commit murder for you
The fact that I knew this was one of the Scandinavian countries just by reading the first few sentences omg..  
That sounds horribly frustrating and we got a pretty similar situation here in Norway from what I've heard. I'm definitely planning on just telling my doctors that I'm a trans man (technically half-true, so it's fine) because anything else is way too big of a risk. Progressive countries like ours shouldn't be this behind when it comes to trans healthcare. Super frustrating tbh
As a nonbinary person who is also seeking top surgery, this is my biggest fear and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 
You are valid in your identity, and I urge you to not give up on getting what you need to be comfortable in your body. 
Much love, friend!
I’m just stopping by to show some solidarity. This sucks, it’s wrong of them to deny you this, and I’m sorry that it’s complicating your journey even further.
Gaddam Sweden sure is handing out the backhands for troons today. In another sub a trans girl said they told her she has to be socially transitioned for a year (wearing skirts and makeup out before passing) before they allow her HRT. 

wtf I thought Sweden was like the beat place in the world to live or some shit
Jävla dårar!
That sucks! Exactly the reason I never wanted to transition medically (I'm also in Sweden).
well.. yes.
Em isbitnstill a demand that you get sterilzed before you can under go g""gender affirming care""?
I'm sorry.
it MIGHT be? There is another organisation but its all across the country. it has recently gotten a rule that I need a doctors note that my doctors arent allowed to give bc I’m nonbinary so it’ll be a bit hard
This is, sadly, the way. The amount of times I've needed to lie to doctors due to gender bias is infuriating.
What country are you traveling to?
How much does it cost? Im from the uk and the guidance says they only do top surgery on people who have been on T for 2 years. Im not interested in going on T but have a lot of top dysphoria. Cost for private surgery here is like 10000. Way outta my budget.
Good luck with your surgery btw and let us know how it went!
That's genuinely baffling to me. I'm in the southeastern US and like nobody had an issue (and I'm AFAB and generally femme presenting). Like... its your body and if you want to lob your tatas into the abyss then you should be able to lob your tatas into the abyss.
Wait, they will? :(  
I'm a Canadian enby who has thought about top surgery but never mind, I guess...
Really? I know several non binary people who got their top surgery covered by the Canadian govt in Ontario.
Anti-fatness is the real disease - it makes people act like monsters and treat those in larger bodies as less than human.  Like so what if someone’s fat?! (A word which I use in a neutral sense) If they want to chop their boobs or get any kind of gender affirming surgery, care, joint replacements, etc., why tf are they being denied - I do not buy this utter bullshit about ‘well the anesthesia is harder to do and dangerous and blah blah blah - like no, because you’re happy enough to rush someone into surgery and take their money when it’s a bariatric surgery.  But God forbid fat folks have access to life-improving care of other types.  SMH🫠  Bigotry is so gross.
Can confirm. Everything from my intelligence to my health to my gender to my sexual orientation to my political convictions is somehow caused by and/or invalidated by my weight. It's maddening.
Do you have tips for dealing with the psychiatrist examinations in Germany? I've talked to another guy about this and he said that I won't get their approval bc I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and now I'm (ironically) too scared to continue looking for one
Exactly. This makes my future look darker, too be honest
Unfortunately my understanding is that Swedish authorities work hard to shut down all providers that do not conform to their rigid rules. That sucks terribly badly but medical tourism is an option.
Ya
Barcelona, Catalonia. I have surgery with Dr. Brasó
Yeah, it's exactly the same here in Ireland.
In Barcelona you're looking at 5-6k in a good clinic, maybe less if a less known clinic. They're also more used to doing them surgeries over there, so I do trust them more than if I was to get it here.
[deleted]
It really depends where you are in Canada, don't lose hope! The place I went was fine with NB people getting surgery
Not everywhere! I've actually never heard of that, its disappointing to know parts of Canada are less progressive. But, my friend is non-binary, they're not on HRT (they dont plan to transition that way), and they recently got top surgery in Vancouver :) I believe the wait was much less than a year and it cost them like $15 lol (had to pay for anesthetic)
Not everywhere and not every surgeon! Mine was covered by OHIP and this was back in 2017-2018. Things may be different now, but back then I had to lie about being nonbinary.
Oh mine was covered too! I only paid $2000 out of pocket after the OHIP coverage.  


I'm saying moreso that I had to lie that I was a binary trans man (and also that I didn't have any mental health issues) in order to get top surgery. This was back in 2017/2018. Most nonbinary people I talked to had told me to say I was a trans man because many of them were denied for being nonbinary. Others were for being autistic.
My biggest recommendation is going to/calling/email-ing a dedicated counseling for trans*.
They know the local doctors, psychiatrists , etc and frequently deal with health insurance relate trans* issues.

Having other diagnoses does not automatically mean you can't get a diagnosis for dysphoria, being trans*, etc and medial letters and access to at least parts of trans healthcare.

There are people (even frequent psychiatry in-patients with multiple diagnoses) that get at least indication letters and HRT...

Approval for surgeries is in most cases a long and complicated process, often with rejections, for all sorts of reasons (according to my friend who was in contact with a trans counseler in a big city in NRW, she started her process in 2022)
Quite frequently only not accepting the decision of your Krankenkasse and going to court gets the final approval... 

I'm sorry I don't have more details or more positive things to share, I hope it was helpful anyways.
I hope there is some kind of support existing in your area - knowledge about who and what to look for (and what to avoid) can make daunting tasks much less scary.
Thanks a bunch! Gives me some hope for the future.
Oh I’m well aware that I’m one of the lucky people and not everyone can access care. I don’t personally have anyone telling me I can’t do what I’m doing (well nobody with the power to stop me).
This was in Ontario and back in like 2016-2018 for me. It was covered by OHIP for me besides $2000 (to make it 'look nice'). But yeah, things might be different now!  
I just know that prior to my top surgery, I had nonbinary friends who advised me to say I was a binary trans man."	10wcdoi	NonBinary	629	1.0	2023-02-07 20:36:20
Feeling Invisible and Invalid as an ABAB enby...	"AFAB enbies, I love y'all and you're valid, but there are soooo many afab enbies in public gnc spaces and I barely know any fellow amab enbies like me in person (what's interesting to me is that this particular subreddit seems to have a lot more AMAB enbies though). And lately I haven't always felt welcome or included in non-binary and gnc spaces; what prompted this post was this afternoon I was just eating lunch with a group of afab enbies and some of them started saying some pretty nasty stuff to me, including some borderline terf stuff :/ 

This kind of thing hits particularly hard when it's coming from fellow gnc and non-binary people. Pleeeeese be kind and inclusive to us AMAB enbies y'all, we exist and we're valid and deserve to be in your spaces too! ❤




EDIT: First of all, yes there is a typo and the title should say AMAB. My bad :p I don't know how to change it...

Thanks for the responses and the support!! I want to clarify something. I wholeheartedly agree that I want to remove the distinction between AMAB and AFAB. I'm a gender abolitionist who wants to be seen first and foremost as a human. The reason I bring up the distinction is because I feel like it gets assigned to me by others and used to invalidate me. So to the people telling me that I'm making an unnecessary distinction, I understand what you're saying, but I am doing it because like it or not most of society and even some trans and non binary people do see that distinction and that's what I find frustrating. Actually finding spaces where I am just seen as non binary and my assigned gender at birth doesn't come into play is EXTREMELY difficult."	"Sending love to all the amab enbies out there <3

There’s a screenshot of tumblr post that floats around sometimes. I says:

*”ever notice how all nonbinary people are afab?”*

*no but i have noticed how every single amab nonbinary person ive come across is either forcibly labeled as a trans woman or a cis guy who is just Loudly Gay*

I think about that a lot. I think there are way, way more amab enbies than we can see because of this intense societal bias. Y’all are out there. I know it. I see you. You belong.
AMAB enby/agender here and I also feel not welcome in GNC spaces since I get weird looks because I look male (I wear neutral clothing but that makes me look just like a normal man :/) and get told that ""this space is not for cismen"".

Being AMAB enby is hard, some people think that to be AMAB enby you have to present androgynous with androgyny being a very subjective definition which for me, fitting that definition in looks is quite impractical for me and tbh, not something I feel comfortable doing. 

We gotta support each other out there! All enbies should look out for each other, we're all valid.
Sometimes I feel like people don't realise an AFAB nonbinary person and an AMAB nonbinary person are the same gender. This distinction between birth sex is only harmful to the whole nb community. AFAB enbies get the whole ""you're a stereotype"" thing and AMAB enbies are straight-up ignored :(

Enbies are enbies, no matter their genitals. Why is that so easy for people to understand about binary trans people and somehow so hard for nonbinary people?

I don’t generally share my AGAB online for this reason.
I knowww it’s a typo but abab announced baby at birth

also: I have noticed personally that more afab people are more accepting of exploring this side of themselves in public spaces and possibly a space created rooted in feminism and all the discourse that comes with that. I’m sorry it seems unfair and I acknowledge it, gendered history is unfair to us all. Terfy people exist in all spaces unfortunately. You are strong for being yourself! We support you :)
Feels like queer spaces only care about AMAB enbies when they present like binary trans women or femboys. If you're masc-leaning, you're either ignored or just treated like a cis man (i.e. shunned and invalidated). It's... very demoralizing, and while I've met other folks with similar goals to me, it feels next to impossible to share them more broadly - hell, I've been told by a (now ex) friend that a character that's deeply personal to me, that represents my ideal goals, was ""enby enough"" to be passed off as a girl.
I feel you.  I'm an AFAB ENBY, with boobs that refuse to bind down.  I tend to read as butch or just a really alt femme.

I think the major problem for both AFAB and AMAB enbies is that there is a societal expectation of androgyny for enbies because OBVIOUSLY if you're non binary then if I can identify you as either gender you're not doing it right. 🙄

From within our community I don't know what the ish is.  If you're a plaid wearing, beard sporting, long hair AMAB and you tell you're NB then you're NB, it's not my place to gatekeep your identity.

It's almost like broke out of gender norms only to create Enby norms.  It's a lil fucked.
[deleted]
As a fellow AMAB enby, I’m so sorry you had to hear people you consider friends saying such horrible things! Know that you are seen and valid <3
You are so very valid one of my best friends is amab and enby and we have the exact same gender feelings and I feel no one quite understands me gender wise like they do y’all are so valid
both of my partners are amab enbies (I'm an afab enby) and I try to validate them as much as I can (without it being overkill) because I know that most enby representation is gnc afab folks and I want them to feel comfortable in their gender identity
Amab enbies are valid! 

I'm so sorry that those people were unkind and bigoted towards you. I don't understand people that think that way. Stay strong, friend.
So much, especially when I want to go to women/enby spaces and I'm told I'm not enby enough because what the mean is ""woman and woman lite""
hey there! i’m a mostly femme but very clearly AMAB enby, i started my journey as a mtf trans woman, you’re not alone in feeling this way.

more often than not, i have to remind myself that my experiences and my identity is just as valid as anybody else’s. it really sucks that even outside of the gender binary where that stuff isn’t supposed to matter, it feels like my AGAB still dictates how i’m perceived and received.
i think the reason theres more amab enbies on reddit is cuz most afabs dont end up on reddit in general, tho it does happen. but a lot of amabs are just shamed constantly abt things regarding masculinity and such that they never come out irl even if they know, i know multiple amab enbies and mtfs in my school who just never came out to their predominantly male friend groups because of how theyd be shamed for it, whereas in predominantly female friend groups are generally more accepting if someone is gender non conformist, but i am only speaking from experience so idk
I’m AMAB gender-fluid and I say life is too short to give haters any mental real estate. Damn them for being assholes. If they can’t make a decent attempt to treat strangers with respect then the universe they live in will be less kind because of it.
AMAB ENBIES UNITE ❤️
OK but I am amab and apparently I look like a lesbian that got drenched in purple (said by my best friend)
It comes from the toxic mindset that enbies are just a different subset of women. Which then goes on to invalidate AFAB enbies, AMAB enbies, and women. Yaaaay /s.
People who invalidate amab enbies are so frustrating. You are valid, you are not alone, and you are loved!! I personally know a handful of amab enbies, though y’all are definitely not as represented as you should be. Sometimes I feel like the people who invalidate amab enbies don’t even know the definition of nonbinary. Sending you so much love!!
The focus on birth sex also alienates non binary people who have transitioned medically. There are AMAB non binary people who pass as AFAB, think Indya moore. And vice versa for AFAB people. This needs to be recognized
I've noticed the opposite, and as an amab Transfemme, I feel we are pretty well represented, but I will agree, most depiction of non-binary people ends up being one way or another, but hey, at least people are trying. 

If you have friends that are speaking like that, they ain't worth your time sis!
I'm sorry they treated you like that. You're just as valid and valued as the rest of us. I see you. I hope you're able to find better people to hang out with. Sending love to all the AMAB enbys! I see you, and you're valid, and you're always welcome to chill with me. 💕✌️
I shoukd socialise more on here bc Im afab and I want to know more enbies full stop, but particularly amab enbies bc while we've had different experiences I want to share in that and find ways to lift each other up. Non-binary is a huge umbrella that's incredibly diverse within itself, and the more we share that between ourselves the better.

There's a moderately famous British amab called Jamie Windhurst, maybe you've heard of them? They wrote a book!

Also where are these terfy nbs I will crush them.
I identify as non-binary and quite honestly it fucking sucks being afab cause I can’t even escape my fucking assigned gender when identifying as non-binary. I wish I could be seen as non-binary and not “non-binary assigned at birth gender”. Good luck to you.
Out of curiosity, what borderline terf stuff did they say?
AMAB enby here, yeah. I get what you mean. Some people think we owe them androgyny or we must look some certain way but that's just not true. For myself personally there are things I want to change about myself to help me achieve the body I want and will feel more comfortable in, so I'm hopefully starting estrogen soon. Microdosing though, not what it usually takes to fully transition.
Thanks for putting this out there! You would think nonbinary people would understand more than anyone that you don't want to be judged on your assigned gender or perceived gender. We're all valid and I hope you find more friends who make you feel that way.
“ABAB” 

Me: …assigned…baby at birth?
Ugh I feel this in my core
[35, AMAB] I feel this. I'm 35 and have totally given up on ever being read, even by other gender diverse folks, as a thing beyond a cis man. I find trans and non-binary inclusive spaces to be tough because I feel like I'm being seen as an intruder / impacting people's psychological safety, especially in work groups that also permit cis women. It really sucks for a work group for underrepresented genders to be treated as a ""women's group"".

I also don't really know how to explain what is good gender-feels-wise for me (ex: I don't have any chest/breast/similar but binders feel empowering to me and more like ""my body"", and I don't know why).
I've been on T for five years, so I get read as AMAB enby more often than not. It is so frustrating how you have to perform androgyny to the point of perfection, or else you're an evil male infiltrator or whatever. 

But then if trans people do find out my AGAB, they just call me a ""theyfab"" and imply that I'm not really trans. It sucks, and I'm sorry that NB people of all birth assignments have to deal with so much shit.
I'm so sorry it is this way . I send support to all my AMAB enbies out there . You are all valid! 

It really sucks but there is this attitude towards AMAB nonbinary people and men in queer spaces that has to be address. People perceived as men get shoved aside, treated as enemies or not belonging in the space unless they are visible gnc. This is in no way okay .  

This is a problem within queers paces that has to stop occuring. You are all valid and don't need to present femme in order to be seen that way. I see and support you all of my AMAB enbies siblings
I feel
Your pain. I usually only see white Afab enbies around. I’m an amab enby of color and I always feel othered.
~~I Must Admit From The Typo In The Title I Thought This Was Gonna Be A Joke About ""Assigned Baby At Birth"" Or Something.~~

Anyway, On A More Serious Note, I Can Feel That Too. While It's Not Like There Are *No* AMAB Enbies, I Feel Like AFAB Ones Are Sometimes Overrepresented, Especially In Popular Media, So Whenever I See A Fellow AMAB I Kinda Latch Onto Them. I Don't Think I Know Any Others In Real Life Either, But To Be Fair I Know Two Non-Cis People, Total, IRL, And Don't Really Have An Easy Outlet For Meeting More, Atleast Not Right Now.

On What Prompted Your Post, That Royally Sucks And I'm So Sorry It Happened To You. I Never Understand How Members Of An Oppressed Group Can Then Just Turn Around And Oppress Other People, Let Alone Other Members Of The Same Bloody Group.
Amorphous Blob At Birth? 😁😀
[removed]
I’m sorry you faced that kind of exclusionary and invalidating behaviour 💛 It’s especially gross when other enbies engage in that kind of rhetoric, as if we don’t all know the experience of being reduced to our AGAB and knowing that’s not what we are. No one decides what body they’re born with (and I guess if that person exists they can hit me up because I have questions), and you certainly shouldn’t be erased for it.
I'm sorry it’s like this. I'm AFAB, and I've also been the target of some pretty horrible terf-y bullshit, even from other AFAB nonbinary people and supposed allies. If I'm not embodying androgyny to their standards (which I wouldn't be able to meet even with an eating disorder- sadly, I've tried), then I'm accused of being being a poser and taking up space I don't deserve. There's also a pretty pervasive belief that AFABS are trying to escape womanhood to snag some male privilege, and are actually just misguided women and bad feminists. Society still has a long, long way to go with gender stuff, unfortunately, and it really sucks out there for a lot of us.

I don't know if this is true everywhere, but in my area, older electronic dance spaces tend to have a strong AMAB enby presence. Not so much with your mainstream EDM, but like, old garage-y house and techno skews extremely gnc. These spaces feed my soul in a way that's difficult to describe, and I highly recommend looking for one. It's a great way to meet friends who 'get it,' and the music and dance experience is incredibly freeing.

Check out Resident Advisor. It may take some trial and error to get to the right spaces, but it's so worth it when you find them.
God I wish I had more AMAB enbies in my life. One of my closest friends is states away and AMAB she/they and I miss them a lot. :( I, personally, relate more to AMAB enbies in terms of transition goals. Even though I’m AFAB, I don’t wish to be more masculine or take T or get rid of my boobs to be perceived as more androgynous, so I find my transition goals alone more with AMAB enbies who also don’t tend to want to be more masculine. 

I think there’s a lot of envy that goes on with transmascs and AMABs generally.
Sending a lot of love
Same
ABAB lol. assigned born at birth
I see this in this sub so often, but my experience is there are way more amab enbies IRL and in media. I only know like one famous afab enby while i know and see way more amab enbies. I also see more amab enbies posting looks on this sub etc in general.

I don’t really get it how it could be the other way, but that’s just my perspective obviously.

Regardless, I have love for you all and your birth assigned gender makes no difference to me, as in you’re all beautiful nonbinary people and I’m proud to be a part of this community 💛🤍💜🖤
AMAB enby here. You're valid and you're seen. I've been seeing more and more people like us here lately, but most people try and fit all enbies into AGAB boxes and erase them it seems. Hang in there 🙏
I'm so sorry you experienced that! It does suck to be an amab enby in gnc spaces!
❤️❤️❤️
Fellow AMAB enby here and I completely feel you. I tend to lean masculine bc I still live with my parents and they’re transphobic. You wouldn’t believe how many times I’m misgendered at work by fellow employees. I have my pronouns on my name tag clear as day. Customers i don’t really have a problem with bc I’ll only see them once and they’re gone, but I have to see my coworkers every day and it’s super invalidating. Luckily there’s another enby at my work so there’s some solace and respect between us. Also to your point about GNC spaces, I’ve felt that too. In my schools GSA club, I’ve seen one or two men, or presumably AMAB enbys. I feel bad for putting a “assigned at birth” label on them bc they’re valid and I feel like that’s misgendering them. But for the sake of distinction. I’ve met sooo many afab enbys that I can’t count them. But instead of being ostracized and bullied into submission that I’m a cis man, I’ve made it my mission to show people that it doesn’t matter what gender you start with, if you’re nonbinary, you’re nonbinary. And that’s that. Feel free to join me in this mission.
Thank you for saying this, and for the ensuing comment thread. Feels supportive. I'm not out anywhere, so I haven't experienced this yet. But it's frustrating that something that's intended to escape gender expectations could create its own gender expectations. Good for us to keep talking about it and being visible. Actually makes me want to be more visible myself! So thanks 🙂❤
It sounds dumb but I feel like it's so much harder for one simple reason: facial hair.

No matter how you dress, act or present yourself if you have stubble or facial hair people are going to male code you.
This pretty much sums thing up. I couldnt help it but sam smith came to mind when i was reading this. No one still believes them
Yes that has happened to me. Present somewhat masculine, you must be a cis-man!
Androgyny is basically impossible for anyone to achieve yk. I j wish ppl wouldnt assume based off of someones looks. Its really exhausting
I'm late to the party... What are gnc spaces and where do you typically find them? (gender nonconforming?)
Omg so much this. In my closest group of friends/partners, agab basically doesn't matter.
Same tbh, I don't want to risk someone stereotyping me for my AGAB
This this this. It should be exactly as insignificant as the born gender of a binary trans person.
No they’re not. Or at least not necessarily. Nonbinary is a gender and it’s also an umbrella for a truckload of genders. Just because two people are both Nonbinary it isn’t automatic that they’re Nonbinary the same way.
Or the same non-gender!
My thoughts were either assigned baby at birth or assigned binary at birth, lmao
Yikes. Sounds like you made the right decision to cut ties with that person
[removed]
That’s what I’ve noticed since I came out as NB, too. Such a focus on *appearing* androgynous (or a focus on projecting that one wants to). If you don’t like part of your appearance, then that’s valid, but seeing complaints about having facial hair vs breasts in this thread and who is more “kept away” from their androgynous ideal just makes me shake my head. As an outsider (new person) looking in on this sub, it feels just like you said: people left the binary only to promptly turn around and make their own norm to conform to.
Sending you love, the transmaac erasure is real. And as a non binary transfemme ugh, I don't understand that from transfemmes at all; don't we get enough hate without fighting each other? 

The interesting thing is that I do lean more femme to the point where I sort of ""read"" as a trans woman to a lot of people, and I do use ""she"" as well as ""they,"" and I'm somewhat okay with the label ""woman"" (definitely more so than the label ""man"" at least). But in my core I'm really non binary, and I don't feel like I'm able to lean into that label nearly as much as I'd like. 

Huuuge generalization, but I think that afab gnc people and amab gnc people kinda get opposite ends of the shit stick: afab people get treated as ""fake"" and aren't taken seriously, while amab people get railroaded into the ""trans woman"" category when we express any form of gnc identity or even behavior. I think this is a big part of the reason trans women get so much attention, because to a lot of society ""trans woman"" is a catch-all for amab gnc people.
Maybe because ""female appearances/behavior"" is more ""beautiful/gentle/elegant"" so people want to focus on those ideals (expectations) they have and want to ignore the existence of masculine people because they aren't ""cute/pretty/to be protected"".

It was hard to get my point across, but I hope you get what I mean. And it's sad.
Yay for enby partners! I love this because I also have two partners, both of whom are non binary. I feel the most at home in spaces where most people are non binary and agab basically doesn't matter and almost never comes up. We may express ourselves or present differently, but at the end of the day we're all just humans and that's all anyone needs to know 🥰
WOOHOO!!
#goals!
Ooh, good point
Where at? The feeling well represented part? I am also AMAB enby and I can find almost nothing :/ maybe I’m looking in the wrong places?
And to add to this. I wish amab non-binary people stopped looking at me as if I was still female or assigned a gender. Like, we’re all non-binary, what does it matter what we were assigned at birth? I reject it vehemently
I'm confused. Why am I being downvoted for relating to OP?
Yeah, I see the frustration around it as a ""women's group"", and also the need for groups that are completely away from maleness. It's really confusing...

Say more about the binders? I'm intrigued.
Sending love and support! You belong ❤️ I'm white but I've definitely noticed the racial disparities as well. I don't understand why people who themselves experience othering and marginalization do the same to others.
I Like Your Comment, Especially The Last Bit, But Why Are All Your Words Capitalized???
This is a very judgemental take. Don't assume that you know what's in anyone else's brain, or invalidate their identity. You wouldn't like them to invalidate yours.
Dawg saying that transmascs/afab queers are just trying to do NLOG for attention is literally the most boring stock transmisandrist take out there, we're talking attack-helicopter joke levels of played out. The fact that a moderator hasn't outright deleted this post yet honestly reflects pretty poorly on this sub imo
Yes but consider this: boobs
I hate facial hair so much it just hurts having it
The thing is, you can shave facial hair, as shitty as it is that people male code you for having it. You can't shave off boobs or hips though. That's just something you have to deal with having, and as long as you have them, you will be instantly coded as female. And binders really don't do much of anything unless you're like, a B or less. Even with a binder on, they often still jiggle too, surprisingly enough.

And when you do present as andro/masc as an AFAB person, people often just immediately think of you as a butch lesbian in my experience. Due to this, people in my town literally wouldn't talk to me for months when I first moved here no matter how friendly I was. I live in rural Florida though, so... that may not be the case for everyone.

This isn't to be like ""WE HAVE IT WORSE"" or something, but I just don't think it's helpful for anyone to act like either of us are worse off when we both have struggles in our own ways, y'know? I think we should just try to be understanding of each other's struggles.
Honestly like, maybe I'm weird but what is masculine about trousers and button up shirts. Is it not possible for a cis/trans/demi girl to dress with that same fashion and still be seen feminine? We don't call women in shirts and trousers tomboys, so why do we see men doing it ""masculine"". I always see gender as what you are on the inside, not the out, but maybe I'm wrong.
For me it was uni societies, having separate events mainly for cis women and non binary people. So in essence, probably not a proper GNC but close enough. Also gender neutral toilets where I've been stared at.
I know that, I meant that AMAB and AFAB nonbinary people are not different in the same way that a cis woman and a trans woman are the same gender.
I love assigned binary at birth version :D my main problem is not that you called me a boy or a girl, but that you gave me only ONE option lol
Yeeeah, we cut ties for other unrelated reasons, but I'm glad we're not in touch either way.   
There was another person too, who just stopped replying to my messages (without blocking me, strangely) when I asked them to be brutally honest and tell me if they disliked me for how I identified... pretty telling that I never heard back.
Yeah what? This is exactly the type of crap that makes us feel like erased. I want people to not make assumptions about gender based on the way we look.
That's... not remotely correct, gender nonconforming people exist who still lean toward their AGAB.
Amazing how quickly norms get established...
Maybe people just like to see ""women"" more than men. Which is pretty sad because that probably means (mostly) cis-men again just objectify women as a source for pleasure (visual or otherwise) and (mostly) cis-women demonize every man as dangerous/aggressive/someone to be careful around.
I said cis-wo/men, because most people actually looking into these matters (like trans-people) are more open minded and most cis-people simply don't need to.

You see this everywhere in society, the toxic male stereotypes and the superficial beauty standards for women.
I'm so comfortable spending time with them! a mutual friend of ours is also nonbinary and it's nice to be with people who understand. before I met them, I was one of the only nonb people I knew besides a few internet friends and an ex of mine. but now I feel so seen and validated whenever I spend time with them 🥺❤
We're Here on HBO is wonderful, and most of the jokes and such I see on r/trans but I guess I am happy in my little world lol
Probably The Same Reason They Are In Your Comment.
I always consider boobs.

In all seriousness though yeah that must suck too, especially if they're big enough you can't hide them effectively.
I’d like to take this to gently point out a common issue. Often, when people talk about their difficulty, others take that as an opportunity to speak about theirs. This isn’t being as supportive as they think it is, and often serves to further marginalize those who feel sidelined. It’s the same concept as someone instantly trying to one up you.
Way to completely derail the issue to an afab problem, thanks
Yeah I was hoping the boobs would help - but I’m up to a D cup now and still frequently misgendered. Really thinking about hair removal for my face at this point even though it wasn’t originally in the plan.
Ikr it can be pretty horrible
Big agree - everyone has struggles with presenting the way they’d like, no matter the agab. It isn’t a contest
You absolutely can “shave off” your boobs, it’s called a breast reduction surgery and they’re very common. Some might argue that it’s actually a more simple option than having to get many rounds of laser hair removal on your face
Trousers and shirts have a long history of being masculine and generally AFAB people will wear them to look more masculine or androgynous. I agree it would be nice if people could be more open minded about an AMAB wearing them.

I wear them sometimes and will incorporate feminine elements to balance out the masculine.

Me personally, I think gender identity, presentation and perception are blurry and can’t be easily separated.
I don't get out much with 4 kids at home... Most gender neutral toilets I've seen are single occupancy rooms. I do recall a co-ed shower room at the local community center (gym and pool) but NEVER went in.
There’s a sort of idea that feminine qualities are “weak”, and masculine qualities are “strong”. A masculine woman is seen as “better” than a feminine man because a feminine man is “weakening” himself in order to present that way, when a masculine women is “strengthening” herself to present that way. It goes back to the patriarchy, the idea that men are dominant and women are submissive. Women who make steps towards masculinity are “badass” and “strong”, while men who make steps towards femininity are “spineless” and “weak”. This is also the same reason why your average person may have a better view of lesbian women than gay men - lesbian women appeal to the male gaze and by being in a relationship with another woman, are “masculinizing” themselves, whereas gay men do NOT appeal to the male gaze, and by being in a relationship with another man, are “feminizing” themselves (may have worded this poorly).

The point is that socially it is more acceptable to be masculine than feminine, in whatever form society as a whole thinks that takes.
Also *Sort Of* on HBO! AMAB non-binary POC representation

Well mine was just to mirror yours...but why are yours??
Either way its rly difficult to pass however you want to. You will likely have parts of u that u j dont like but there r ways to work with them so you get where u want to eventually
Okay I understand the criticism, but like from the neurodivergent angle it's usually from a place of like ""Oh hey, here's a similar seeming issue I've had, is this like the same thing, or like what kind of things were different about it?""

It's not meant to be like putting our experience in front of yours, it's more a way to see like ""is the situation like what I'm thinking or do I need a different flavor of empathy for this one?""
Yes I’m glad they felt it appropriate to come to a post talking about the unique struggles AMAB people go through and then immediately tell all the AMAB nb folks that they have it worse.
That costs thousands of dollars in the US. Generally up to $10,000 it seems. Not everyone can afford that. There's a good chance I will never be able to afford that.
That's fair enough. I wish they didn't have a history of being masculine, but that was a problem set up many many years ago for me to deal with now :/

I want to look more androgynous but I have kinda given up because I don't know what suits me. I've looked around but the usual advice are things I don't want (wear a skirt) or are impractical (makeup causes massive acne breakouts for me, longer hair as I get overstimulated when my hair gets in my face)

I'm trying my best to embrace I'm me gender and what I wear isn't my gender.
You are definitely right, I just thought this alone doesn't explain that trans-women are more prominent/more popular in the media than trans men.

That's more what I was trying to say
Also To Mirror Mine, It's Quite Simple Really.
Oh for sure. I just find when people see someone visibly masculine dressing in a femme way they are way less accepting than the other way round.

Shit, in school people made fun of me for having pink glasses 😅
While I understand that maybe that’s where you’re coming from, putting yourself front and center to someone else’s issues isn’t as supportive as you’re making it out to be.

You also don’t need details on what someone’s experience is to sympathize with them, and asking for them is often intrusive and unwelcome.
Lol you’re literally doing the thing the comment just said you’re doing. No need to be an input ho
And how much do you think it costs to laser a whole beard off your face? Sessions can be $2-600/session and for a full beard you can need upwards to 15-20 sessions sometimes, and insurance will never cover it because it’s not a medical procedure
Something working for me is a change in colour and styles. I wear more pastels and wear softer fabrics. Could that work for you?

Yeah your gender is deeper than what you wear on any given day.
What about earrings/piercings/necklaces/bracelets/rings/bags?

I know some of those can be uncomfortable just like high heels and ""female"" bags are often smaller but there're also some real gems out there with massive space inside ^^.

It's ridiculous how many things, associated with female beauty are just uncomfortable and impractical. Just another case of ""women should be beautiful, that's all that matters"". The only thing good about those stereotypes is that trans-/nonbinary people can use it to shift the gender they're seen as, a little bit.

Sorry for the rant.
The reason for trans women being more represented is probably because it’s more of a shock to non-LGBT+ people. “Who would ever want to go from being a man to a woman??” sort of idea. It’s a sexist concept, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t prevalent in greater society.
It’s because of misogyny, we are fine with women “acting like men” but for a “man” to lower themselves to the “lesser gender” (effeminate or female) it’s seen as wrong.
No i a thousand percent agree. Its exhausting and annoying considering clothes dont have gender and yet people link dresses with women and suits with men
Yes, getting laser hair removal is obviously expensive. But there's at least a temporary fix in shaving. There isn't really a temporary fix for boobs unless you're lucky enough to be flat-chested to begin with.
I have been trying that actually since it's a small change but does wonders in my view! I'm gonna get more softer fabric shirts and I've been getting more pastel colours since they're aesthetically pleasing c:
No need to apologise. I often feel the same, I think it's fucking wild a lot of fashion associated with femininity is so impractical. My housemate tells me how she tries her best to buy men's clothing because the pockets are unusable for women's trousers and stuff. Like god I hate the patriarchy and how cishet society enforces a certain gender role and expression on everyone.
I'd say that's part of it yes.

But part of it is also sexist attitudes towards men that paints them as perverts or predators.

A lot of anti trans-woman bullshit is about how people are worried that trans-women are just 'pretending' to be women so they can 'invade' women's spaces and prey on them.

JK Rowling for example.
Nice 😊
I bought trousers in the internet before accepting my identity (I mean accepting that women can shop in men's spaces would have sufficed but that's not important now). You obviously can't try them on, but when they came, they fit perfectly, just one problem: the pockets weren't pockets , they were just sewed to look like pockets...

I mean why?
It’s just misandry that’s hidden behind “think of the children/women!” and people eat it up like it’s bloody gold. I know most people deny that misandry exists (it does, just not systematically) but TERFs are engaging in misogyny AND misandry. They hate males so by default they hate trans women cause they consider them male (wrong) but they also hate women because they define being a woman as a walking vagina, which is misogynistic in itself. It’s basic horseshoe theory; going so far “left” that you line up with the “right”"	zkfsel	NonBinary	345	0.95	2022-12-12 23:43:52
I wish video games had NB options	I hate having to choose either male or female when I'm playing a game. I seriously wish there were options for nonbinary people. I can't think of a single game that does this. Does anybody know of any games that are inclusive to NB people?	"my partner and i were talking about this pretty recently while going through a Stardew Valley fixation. we’re both nonbinary and we lamented the fact that the game didn’t have an enby option. following that, we DMed the creator, ConcernedApe, asking for his next game Haunted Chocolatier to scrap gender and make a selection of body types & pronouns in the character creator instead.

obviously we never got a reply, but i’m crossing my fingers that the game will be more inclusive. i have faith.
In No Man's Sky, literally every single character is genderless including you. It's honestly amazing. Every single npc uses they/them pronouns too, it's a very cool game. Imo a combo of minecraft, star wars and subnautica, really fun game!
Monster Prom 3: Road Trip is a fun visual novel where you can play as/ meet non-binary characters! :)

The Arcana is also a fun story-based game / visual novel you can play on your phone. You can choose your main character’s pronouns and they/them is an option available
Pokemon Uranium had the option, but idk if that's still available to download online (2016?)
Baldur's Gate 3 (in early access still) and Sims 4 both have added nonbinary options. Not sure how well they work in gameplay because the option was added fairly recently, but I believe they are both continuing to update the games to make them inclusive. I don't want to recommend Sims (because EA sucks and the base game isn't great without purchasing a zillion expansions), but BG3's early access is incredible so far so I have high hopes for full release later this year.
Hollow Knight's protagonist is agender if that counts as an NB option

Kris from Deltarune is nonbinary

I know BitLife lets you have your character identify as nonbinary (but you can't pick it right away, you gotta wait until they're old enough for you to have access to the option)
Could be a controversial choice but South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Yeah, they make it a bit of a joke, but it still has a wide variety of options for gender and orientation, like every option under the sun. I think I played a transfeminine gynosexual last time I played, or something along those lines, which pretty much describes me now!

Only other game I know where you can be non-binary is My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist, which is more of a visual novel style game, but I found it quite endearing. Plus, your appearance is separate from gender, so I played a feminine-looking enby in my last playthrough.
Tiny Tina’s wonderlands let’s you select they/them pronouns in the character creator!
Harvestella has a non binary option I nearly cried when the characters used they/them pronouns to me
Ikr! The Sims 4 added new pronoun options (they/them and custom) but still didn't allow the player to change the gender to other than male or female. It really sucks.

Also, I tested it out and the pronouns of course aren't made to work right. They just made it that it changes the she/he away.

For ex. ""Ama isn't going to school! If they doesn't go..""
The only game I can think of recently was Black Ops: Cold War
Rocket League!!! 😂 

(You play as a car lmao)
Bugsnax! It’s more of an older kids game but it was SO FUN. 
There is also a non binary character, you yourself are not assigned to any gender (or any real characterisation beyond being a journalist - at various times you are buddy, bestie or stranger). And it isn’t tokenistic or contrived like other representations.

Coral island - if you like Harvest Moon you will LOVE Coral Island.

I supported the kickstarter campaign and afaik it is on early acess stage on steam now.

They really love their project, are open to recommendations and if I remember correctly ALL the npcs are dateable no matter what gender you are.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral\_Island/
The protagonist of Verdant Skies is nonbinary and exclusively referred to using they/them pronouns. It also includes a nonbinary ""romance"" option (they're aroace, but you can become platonic partners with them).
Tiny Tina’s Wonderland is a game made by the same people that made Borderlands but it’s very DnD-esque. Instead of “male, female, nb” they have “he/him, she/her, they/them” which is pretty cool. Their character customization only has male/female body types, but they call them “this one” and “that one” and you can change them to look less masc/femme. You can also pair a male body with a female voice and vice versa. Additionally, the NPCs refer to you as the pronouns you choose which I know is the whole idea, but it’s still pretty cool
I can think of a few games that have non-binary options, but your really gotta look into very specific niches of games to find them. Most of those I crosses were dating sims where you could be a NB protag. The one with the most options even let you pick which body parts were triggers to talk about your own body, and allows you to be pretty fluid with your gender in the game.

It's a furry porn game, but still, having the option is nice.
All of the sportsmates in nintendo switch sports are canonically nonbinary!
The closest games I can think of is Harvest Moon: A New Beginning, Story of Seasons, and Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns on the 3DS. While you do choose a gender and referred by She/Her and He/Him pronouns by the characters. The clothing and hairstyles is where you can be nonbinary or trans as you gain access to both male and female clothes and hairstyles. Of course 1 hairstyle and 1 clothing look is gender exclusive, but this doesn't matter in the grand scheme of what we are talking about.
forza horizon 5 surprisingly had an option for this and alot of other nice inclusive touches
the pokemon inspired game temtem lets you choose they/them pronouns in character creation. and iirc Todd Howard has said in an interview that starfield will have that option too.
I want this and for there to be a non-binary or trans superhero
Wildermyth. Also just a good goddamn game in general.
some that I can think of the top of my hat is Splatoon and animal crossing, and the one of puffpals Thats soon coming out 

on 1 and 2 you needed to select gender, but on 3 they got rid of that completely, and it's a game were you can dress whoever you like and I really don't remember the game using pronounce, any kind of pronounce, and the community is pretty chill and wholesome since Splatoon is pretty much on sinc with his audience 

animal crossing doesn't need introduction, is a nice game were you just have fun and relax with your neighbors, this is only on new horizons since older ones didn't have this consideration, even so, this is a pretty nice one 

as for puffpals is still on development, but I really recomend it 

on other recommendations... maybe try more story focus games were you had a set protagonist? and if you really want to feel represented, maybe look indie games, in there they really have so much variety
I think The Sims 4 does but I could be wrong.
I like the way the sims does it, where you select their sex, body type, style preferences, etc all individually, rather than it just being a ""male, female, other"" type of situation. I think more games could benefit from that
Apex legends. There’s a character called Bloodhound. They’re nonbinary but masculine presenting. They also have a trans woman they added recently. A lot of their characters are actually lgbtq+ (one gay, a few lesbian, some bi, a few pansexual I think)
I agree, I’m so fed up of it :( I like that everything is neutral on splatoon and animal crossing! I heard the new pokemon game was good for gender stuff but when I got it I realised that it actually isn’t lol
Boyfriend Dungeon lets you pick your pronouns, and your sprite isn’t detailed enough to look gendered. It’s a dating sim/dungeon crawler where you date your weapons and improve your relationships to improve their combat power. Romance options also come in male, female, and non-binary.
Animal Crossing uses they/them for all player characters.
In monster prom you can be if I’m remembering correctly
Saints row 2 kinda had that. So you still have you pick between male and female but you can customize how masculine or feminine they are and give them either a masculine or feminine voice regardless of their sex. So you could have a male character that has breasts and a feminine voice or vice versa
Thank you everyone! It's amazing to see which games actually have nonbinary protagonists or nonbinary options in character creators. I will definitely check out some of the games you guys listed!
The Harvest Moon remake is going to have a NB option!
I play a lot of dating sims on [itch.io](https://itch.io) they tend to either use they/them pronouns off the bat or you can pick. If it's a more mature one you can pick pronouns and bits. I remember one that had just the whole Barbie doll situation as an option. Besides that I can't think of anything... well besides the South Park game.
Cyberpunk 2077 has NB features.

Also, I think the new Pokemon game does.
I Was A Teenage Exocolonist. 
Even lets you change pronouns, presentation, and puberty options in the middle of the game. 
LOTS of triggers in the game so read the warnings before playing.
The new hogwarts game has a fairly inclusive character creation mode
Grow: Song of the Evertree has the option and it’s a majorly cute and non-stressful.
Sims 4 had a recent update with a whole lot of customizable gender options. It isn't fully perfect, some of the pre written language still comes up with gendered terms or the sentences don't make sense. Considering they didn't make the game with this in mind, it was more of an inclusion feature they decided to add, I am sure it is a mess. But I do know that you can report the issues, and otherwise the game plays basically as you customized it.
There's a game called Our Life New Beginnings is an otome based but they have NB options! I definitely recommend it. The base game is free and the additional DLC storyline is I believe 4 or 5 dollars.
I don't mind two genders I wish we could have the same customisation items, clothes, makeup options etc. Female characters almost always get the best hair options but I like male body more.
I just pick which ever one i think looks good, i usually try not to get mad about that because i know most developers wont give a crap but when i make my games i always make them as inclusive as possible if they have customization.
I love Stardew Valley so much, I wish there was a non-binary option. Though being trans masc as well as non-binary I’m okay with playing as a guy. I can think of a few games that have options with they/them pronouns. 

In Garden Story all of the characters use they/them pronouns. It’s a super cute game, you play as a grape and all the other characters are fruits, vegetables and sea creatures etc.

In Cozy Grove they call your character Scout, as well as whatever themed nicknames the bears on the island call you it’s one of my favorite games.

In Arcadia Fallen you get to choose between he, she or they pronouns and customize your character it’s a choose your own adventure type game with different endings about magic and alchemy. 

Like other people have said in Animal Crossing the character has gender neutral pronouns.

In Little Wood you get to choose the title they refer to you as in the town, I can’t remember if your character has pronouns or not but I kind of remember being able to pick them. It’s been a while since I played it. 

For the games I haven’t played yet- I’m guessing that the character in Forager has they/them pronouns too, could be wrong. I think in Boyfriend Dungeon you can choose the character’s pronouns too. And in Pirated Code: Admin Edition one of the characters is non-binary. I think the character in The Last Campfire uses they/them pronouns as well. I haven’t actually played that yet either I have a lot of games in my list I’ve downloaded but haven’t played. And the character in Hollow Night? Like other people said but I can’t remember. I think I’m missing some. Long comment, whoops.
Harvestella and Temtem are two games that have a nonbinary option. I think Ooblets too? I‘d have to check to be sure
Harvestella and the next Story of Seasons game. I feel like there was another one that I played, but I can’t think of it atm.
nintendo switch sports is the best video game of all time bc you just make your character you never pick a gender at all
Fallen London has a fun Non Binary option:  
*My dear sir, there are individuals roaming the streets of Fallen London at this very moment with the faces of squid! Squid! Do you ask them their gender? And yet you waste our time asking me trifling and impertinent questions about mine? It is my own business, sir, and I bid you good day.*  


Afterwards you will be referred to as 'Si-, er, Mad-, er, yes!!'  


You also have the option to change how you are addressed later, with a number of options that are gender neutral.
There's an indie open source rogue like that I play a lot called Shattered Pixel Dungeon. The creator has said that the next character they add will be non-binary. That is of course pretty niche
Coral Island has NB options! It’s kinda like Stardew but with Indonesian themes and settings. It’s still in early access, but I can’t recommend it enough.
What I hate more about those options in games is the male option is way too masculine and the female is way too feminine
The sims has options to customize pronouns and make trans characters but idk about other types of gameplay
Some video games do, including a cod game O believe, and some games have the characters gender left purposely ambiguous, such as Undertale and deltarune
Pyre (from SuperGiant Games) has light visual novel elements and you can choose they/them pronouns at the start of the story (and change them in the settings at any point). The game also doesnt have a canon depiction of the player, so you're free to imagine them looking however you like
Here Comes Niko is a fun cute platformer if you’re into that. It’s not that long of a game as well.
It will come in time, it is like all things slow small changes :(
Check out Citizen Sleeper, developed by a non-binary person. Features a butch woman and a non-binary character in the cast, and the main character (you) is ambiguous iirc
At the beginning of Shining Nikki (mobile dress up game), the main character says, ""I guess I just can't resist pretty clothes!"" and your response options are:

""As a girl, I totally agree.""
""As a guy, I totally understand.""
""As a non-binary, I feel the same.""

(There is no option to disagree.)

This choice pretty much has no consequences for gameplay since nobody refers to you with gendered language anyway. 🙃
Here are some games in mine and my friends' Steam libraries where the player character is non-binary or gender neutral (no forced male/female choice or gendered pronouns):

**Astroneer** \-- Space sandbox/survival game, very chill, very wholesome. You can choose different types of spacesuits as character customization, all are gender neutral :). It's on the Switch, PS4, Xbox, and Steam.  
**Undertale** \-- You may have already known this, though I didn't until recently. The main character, Frisk, is canonically non-binary. There's also another NB character in the game but I don't remember who. It's on the Switch, PS4, Xbox, and Steam.  
**Outer Wilds** \-- A simultaneously wholesome, sad, and just plain gorgeous game about exploring a solar system--best to go in blind. Apparently has good queer rep, and from what little I've played, the MC is gender neutral. I should note that they are an 'alien' in the sense that they're not human, but there are no humans in the game from what I've played of it, and being the MC's species of alien is what is normalized in their solar system. It's on the Switch, PS4, Xbox, and Steam.  
**In Other Waters** \-- Game about documenting an alien ocean teeming with life, and helping a woman named Ellery Vas find her ex girlfriend in said ocean. You play as a nameless A.I, guiding a xenobiologist through an alien ocean. (The A.I. you play as may get a particular name later, if you choose to accept it.) There are only really 3 characters that get more than 3 lines of dialogue/text referring to them, those being the A.I., Ellery, and Minae, so not necessarily much NB rep there. It's on the Switch and Steam.  
**Splatoon 3** \-- Game where you shoot ink and are a humanoid squid/octopus. 80 CAD and requires a Switch + nintendo online subscription bc Nintendo is greedy. BUT if you happen to be in a position to get it, there's no 'pick a gender' thing in this game and you can customize your character with whatever mix of clothing/hairstyles you see fit. There's also a really big queer community around the game, which is pretty cool since its an online multiplayer :). It's only on the Nintendo Switch, sadly.  
**OneShot** \-- rpg sort of game (think Undertale but no combat) with a heavy story/character focus. Best to go in blind. *Gorgeous* soundtrack. You play as yourself, and you are referred to with they/them pronouns. The main character Niko's gender is left ambiguous. It's on the Switch, PS4, Xbox, and Steam.  
**Stray** \-- Story-focused game about finding your way back to the surface & sun after falling a long ways, navigating a futuristic city. You play as a cat, whose gender is left ambiguous. Albeit, being that you are a cat, you're never that concerned with pronouns, and so various characters in the game may refer to you as either he, she, or they. Stray does not have any explicitly NB characters, but there are many whose gender is unknown/ambiguous. I don't remember how they are referred to in game, and cannot figure it out via the wiki. It's on the PS4, PS5, and Steam.  
**Rain World** \-- Survival game which I have not played much of. You play as one of several slugcat characters, all of which are referred to with it/its pronouns. Apparently has its own super complex ecosystems! I'm looking forward to playing more of it when I have time. Switch, PS4, and Steam.  
**Little Nightmares & Little Nightmares II** \-- Puzzle platformer and atmospheric horror game. There are canonical character genders, but since you'll want to go in blind and there's no dialogue/minimal text, you're not forced to pick anything. It's on It's on the Switch, PS4, Xbox, and Steam.  
**Overcooked & Overcooked 2** \-- Silly couch co-op game where you run around chaotically and cook food. Personally I don't really play much because it stresses me out after more than a few rounds, but if you can handle hectic and comedic multitasking it's pretty fun. Some avatars you can use are *kinda* coded to be certain genders? But there are also many neutral avatars, and gender isn't really a big deal and your character is referred to as ""you"" most of the time, when they have to be referred to at all. It's on the Switch, Xbox, PS4, PS5, and Steam.

Hope this helps!
Shovel knight only the first game will let you change characters pronouns and appearance
If you like visual novels, check out Lunaris Games! They are super inclusive.
i think many developers are catching up to this espeically the triple A
I hope it will be too!! I remember hearing about a nonbinary mod you can add to stardew Valley, and I installed that whenever I first started playing, and it made me really happy. It allows you to choose your pronouns and what people call you. It's amazing. Thinking about it again makes me want to boot up my save and start playing again, lol. The feeling I get when playing that mod is completely different from how I feel when playing a gendered game that uses pronouns that I do not use. No person in my life uses my preferred pronouns, so seeing them used in games is really important to me. I feel like developers would really benefit from adding a nonbinary option to their video games to be inclusive to everyone!
i don't suppose someone has made a mod for Stardew Valley to add NB characters?
I recently bought No Mans Sky but haven't had a chance to play it. Now I'm even more excited to play it!
just wanted to add that technically you can choose gender neutral pronouns in all 3 monster prom games! they are one of mine and my partners favorite sets of games and we are both non binary
Came here to say monster prom, all three games allow you to pick any character and give them he/him, she/her or they/them pronouns. We love monster prom ❤️
looks like the Uranium wiki on fandom still has a link to download. I can’t test it as i’m on mobile, but theoretically it’s still available
the nonbinary pronouns in Sims 4 are hilariously broken. play it for an hour with an enby sim and you’ll see just how half-assed the inclusion is

it’s better than nothing of course, but it comes off as pretty virtue-signally when you see how poorly it was done
Came here to mention BG3! I recently played through on my enby drow warlock and not all the pronouns in dialog have been adjusted to they/them just yet (especially in later-released content like the Grymforge), but it’s well on its way. I’m super excited for full release!!
I like the way it does body types too.

""This one / That one.""
Wait really? That surprises me
wait what, there's a nonbinary skin in black ops Cold War?
This made me laugh a Lil too much 😂😂
Thank you! This is a very nice list, I appreciate it!
I was thinking of Forza Horizon 5 :)
It certainly was an experience to see my self insert with they/them pronouns slowly gather more bodily mutations until they were unrecognisable.
Please elaborate on the cyberpunk 2077 part, i am thinking about buying the game today and i just heard this omg
Yeah, recommend a game from the person who's actively contributing to trans genocide. Real cool
This also applies to character portraits. You have a range of male, female, and nonbinary cameos to select from and it doesn't have to be tied to what you go by.
Hey! My friend recently gifted me stardew valley and I might actually get around to playing it if I had this mod. Do you remember what it was called/where you found it?
i’m not sure about other characters, but according to OP there’s a mod that allows the player to be nonbinary!
Here to contribute that in ACNH if a character talks about you, they only use ""they/them"" pronouns and I love it
Monster Prom slaps. Writing is great, fun to play with a group, and it’s now a staple in long distance date night with my (also enby) partner.
Pokemon Reborn has a non-binary option as well
Thanks for adding this. I haven't seen nb gameplay for either game since the updates, but I'm not surprised about Sims. I don't remember if there's any pronoun usage for the player character in BG3, so I'm not sure how impactful that option is either.
It was shocking, and their fan base was of course toxic about it. But they’re not typically smart.
I like to tell myself that the game stands with trans folks because all the “people” in the background crowd are literally just eggs. And in one of the loading screens it shows a parking lot with an egg handicap parking spot, and on one of the cars there’s a sexy egg with legs on the tire flaps. 😂 I love it lmao
In cyberpunk, you can customize your body even down to what’s downstairs, BUT there are only two versions of V, and the overall male/female choice matters in that it affects which character(s) you can have a relationship with. As for the new Pokémon, I think there’s no longer a lock on clothing or hair? But you’ll still be gendered by what I assume is the hair? Not sure actually lmao. Someone posted a link to a spreadsheet that lists games with nonbinary representation and gives the reason, which is really helpful! I still enjoyed cyberpunk but my ~nb~ picks are undertale, animal crossing, and splatoon 3 :)
Someone else commented on this already but, basically, you can make a character the way you like. Feminine body with a penis and masculine or feminine voice. Only thing I'm not positive about are the pronouns. I'd check out a YouTube video on the character creation, it's been a couple years and I'm probably not remembering everything correctly. 

 There's also romance chains and one main character that is trans, but they only mentioned it in passing. Which is nice not having it be a gimmick or main part of her story or anything.

One word of caution on the character creation is that you should be certain about your hair, makeup, and other cosmetics. When I played (at launch) there weren't any salons or any way to update your hairstyle or makeup. So I was stuck with my fingernails being painted a pretty crazy way for my entire playthrough.

I had a lot of fun playing it, tho.
It’s a game that has the features the op is looking for. I must have missed the news articles about the video game designers going around mass murdering people, could you site your source?
not sure if it’s the one that op is taking about, but i found this by googling: [gender neutrality mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/722). it’s a nexus mod that makes anything player-related gender neutral. (so all gendered pronouns and language in reference to the player character are replaced with gender neutral language) there’s also some customization or looks like?
I believe the pronouns decide the voice or vise versa
In recent updates you can customise everything at your favourite ripperdoc. Sadly, there is no pronouns option for non-binary.
This is helpful, thanks!!

I'm an NB game dev, and my partner and I wanted to make sure there were inclusive character creation options in our new game!		"Small thing, but what do you (and other folks) think about changing ""Select gender"" to ""Select pronouns""? If that's the literal effect it'll have on the game it's clearer that way, and it's a bit less ""othering"" not to make nb folks refer to their gender as ""they/them"".

Awesome to include this though, regardless! This is just meant as a constructive question/comment from an ex-web dev who has also had to discuss how to word questions like this a bunch of times 😄
Our game's called Scarlet Hollow and it's a narrative horror game— the first episode is free on Steam and Itch if you'd like to try it!

it might be nice to also include a 'custom' option for different identities and pronouns. 

I really like the art style :D
Could you include a 4th custom option?
Nice that you have a ""how does it affect gameplay"" info box. Maybe, if it's possible you could maybe change the gender later if you want to. Anyway, it is also good as it is :)
Selecting pronouns and gender as separate options is the ideal.
idea that's been floating in my mind but I'm not designing a game:

Ask the player to choose their pronouns, and if they don't choose pronouns just use their name in place of any pronouns (with apostrophes added in the grammatically correct places)

I thought it'd mess with the transphobes who don't know what pronouns are but now that I think of it it is possible for a player to prefer no pronouns
It'd be really important to many if you didn't connect gender and pronouns. If you think about it, gender is probably not important in the game, but pronouns are, right? If it is important for some reason, please try to think of another way :) Pronouns =/= gender. For example, there are cis people who use they/them pronouns and non-binary people who don't use they/them pronouns, etc. 

I'd love it if you could pick more than one pronoun, so you will get randomly referred to by two it's more pronouns. 

And if you don't give a custom option, please expand the pronoun options a lot, for example with neo pronouns
That's so awesome! I'll check it out ^_^
Y'all are heroes. Game looks hella cool too.
Hey I just started playing this game a couple of days ago! I did love the option at the begining, thanks for that! 😁
this is awesome!
An idea that probs wont work with ur game but anyway... You start the game then the first time someone talks to u they assume ur a he, then u get to choose whether to go with he or correct to whichever. Then is like u dont have to have a menu. Im a bit blazed so idk if what i said makes sense but either way good work :)
Also add neopronouns
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll look into a good way for doing that in a future update!
I'll try and figure out a good way to make it happen in a future update!
Indeed. I'm nonbinary myself, and I've often encountered nonbinary people who don't use they/them
It's important to us that you just get to exist in this universe without having your identity challenged.

“Ladies, gentlemen, (theybies?)”	"Hello. At the risk of sounding especially ignorant, I have come here in search of guidance. I am an apologetically white, cisgender, heterosexual high school teacher. As I head into my first year of teaching, I am hoping to maintain an inclusive environment within my classroom. Generally speaking, I have found myself calling for the attention of “ladies and gentlemen” in my room during my period of student teaching. However, I realize that that has fallen short of the mark of inclusivity I had hoped to achieve. 

Thus, I am here to ask a simple question: I listen to a podcast that is hosted by an individual who is non-binary and refers to themself as a “theybie.” Is this term appropriate to use in the “ladies and gentlemen” context of trying to gain the attention of a group of people? Or is it offensive? Are there other terms I might be able to use in this instance? 

Furthermore, I have seen titles of posts here on Reddit addressed to “ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary folks.” Is THAT how I should address my students? I appreciate any responses I might get. TIA
 
TL;DR: Can I call my high school students theybies? Or is that offensive? And is there some other way I may be able to address them in a group setting when calling for the attention of an entire class? 

Ex. “Ladies! Gentlemen! Theybies! Can I get your attention please?”"	"Old teacher of mine used to start every class by saying “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears”. It’s from the play Julius Caesar, and it was a nice and fun way to start off classes :)
As a grown ass nonbinary adult, I find ""theybie"" to be exceptionally infantalising and not anywhere near on the same par of respectability as ""ladies and gentlemen"".

Some students may find it acceptable and enjoy it, but that would definitely be a personal preference. ""Non-binary folks"" certainly would encompass the range of gender descriptors for your students.

However, can I ask you something? Why do you feel the need to address your students with regard to their gender at all? Could you not replace all gendered references with something equally formal but truly inclusive? Maybe ""esteemed students""? Or ""excuse me, respected learners""...

Thank you for reaching out to educate yourself further and to make your learning environment better for your students. Your effort will make a massive difference to a student, either now or in the future and you may never realise it but I'd like to thank you on behalf of all closeted queer students, past, present and future x
I prefer folks or gentelfolk if you're looking for that format. Theybies kinda sounds like babies and can be seen as a little infantilizing, idk high schoolers will find anything to make fun of different people. So I think a variation of folk is safest
I'd definitely say don't call your students ""theybies"". It's not a commonly-enough used phrase, not every nonbinary person uses they/them pronouns, and the diminutive kinda has the potential of making it sound like a joke in a way that could be unpleasant coming from a cis person whose knowledge and intentions we may not know (""are you laughing with us or at us"" kind of thing).

""Ladies, gentlemen, and nonbinary folks"" is better but the other solution is just... Skip the ""ladies and gentlemen"" entirely. For a purely neutral option, addressing the crowd as ""everyone"", ""folks"", or even ""friends"" might still work for a high school age audience. ""Esteemed guests"" is another one that's sometimes suggested for general crowds, ""esteemed students"" might also be lightheartedly over the top in a way high schoolers might find funny if that's the vibe you're going for.
Maybe stick to completely nongendered language, like “class!” or “students!” You can also set up a call and response, like say “class! class!” And they have to respond with “yes! yes!” Or “all hail the king!” Or something to show they’re paying attention
I'd feel really weird having a teacher call me that. Or anyone tbh. It plays into the whole treating being nonbinary as a ""Owo adorable poor baby"" which is yikes.

Alternatives: keep everything gender neutral.

""Everyone""

""Dear students""

""attention, everyone""

Etc
Students, in your case, would be the most inclusive imho.

I haven't heard of theybie ever and if someone would refer to me like that I would cringe tbh. That's my opinion of course but I would. Sounds a bit infantilizing. 

You can use words like ""ladies, gentlemen, and others"" or ""and distinguished individuals"" but it might come off as too long to casually say. There's a vine star that uses ""guys, gals and nonbinary pals"" but maybe it's too youtube-speak for a teacher? 

I think you should use the most inclusive and shortest words - like students, kids/teens, class - but that's my preference. You can also use fun phrases like cool cats or let the class choose how you refer to them - could be a very fun class activity.

Good luck.
Enby secondary teacher here—first of all, CONGRATS on finishing student teaching! Imo, “theybie” is fine as a self-identifier or in a joking context, but if someone were to call me that, I would feel… grossed out. It sounds very infantilizing and unprofessional. 

I usually use “y’all”, “my friends”, “folks”, or “everybody” in the classroom. Usually “friends” is better received by middle schoolers, but high schoolers may not mind it either so long as it gels with your general manner of speaking. 

Good luck in your first year teaching, and I’m sure you’ll do well. The fact that you’re thinking of these things shows that you’re reflective and thoughtful, and that you care about the students you teach.
I don’t like theybies, it gives ‘woman-lite’ vibes as well as sounding like ‘babies’, it also boils down every nonbinary person into a pronoun that not every nonbinary person uses. I think ‘everyone listen up’ or ‘good morning class’ kind of general statements better :)
J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (a fantastic chef and food YouTuber) uses the more casual ""guys, gals, and nonbinary pals.""
There are enough gender neutral terms to address folks, so I’d say it’s not necessary. I’m thinking of a TikTok I saw where someone suggested a NB person be called Themmy instead of Daddy, and the influencer responsed “Just call me hot, Themmy sounds like a slur for Goblins”
I think Folks and Students are great options, if you want the drama of Ladies and Gentlemen I think you should use the Julius Caesar quote another person suggested.  BUT for optimal inclusivity when you meet your class for the year you can add pronouns to your introductions like for my future students (bc I also plan on being a teacher) it will be “Hi welcome to *class* I’m Teacher *name* my pronouns are They/Them” and offer to do a round of names pronouns with your students.  Don’t force anyone to share their pronouns but also don’t allow students to make jokes like “I identify as an attack helicopter”. If they go “I’m a guy” make sure to clarify like “So you use he/him” to show other students you really do care about how they identify
Assuming you will teach using English I would just fully exploit the fact that non-gendered nouns are super common and use something like ""students"". I wouldn't complicate it by using specifically gendered language.
Just the fact that you care enough to ask these questions is great, in the off chance you happen to offend a student, I'm sure you'll handle it appropriately.
High school teacher and nb here.  I just say, ""folks.""

When I get tired of saying ""folks,"" I say, ""everyone.""
“Students.” Or maybe “class?” There are some nongendered choices.
Guys, gals and non binary pals
I’m a non-binary teacher, and no, definitely not. I feel like a lot of people put a lot of thought into adding in a gender-neutral option to existing phrases when they don’t need to. I call my students: Students, class, friends, pals, scientists/readers/etc related to the subject matter, etc. Sometimes I’ve gotten creative and called them “future taxpayers” if I’m trying to make them laugh
I went to a show that said ""ladies, gentleman and everyone in between."" Which I kinda liked tbh.
English isn't my first language, so have never heard ""theybies"", but it sounds a bit stange to me.
I think that ""gentlepeople"" sounds really good when you want to be inclusive. Tho you might miss the ""and x"" part.
As someone else said ""everyone"" is good too. Like ""attention, everyone"".
If you want a more fun introduction, you can play around with gender neutral versions of ""ladies and gentlemen"" such as ""barbarians and gentlepeople"", ""cat people and dog people"" or something stupid like that. The idea with ""ladies and gentlemen"" is that it's supposed to be two opposites, so you can find two other kind of opposites.
Good luck with finding something you feel comfortable with. c:
Interesting question. For me the term sounds like more of an informal term of endearment, and doesn’t seem to fit with the other two in the phrase. I’d say that even appending something like ‘and everyone else’ or ‘everyone in between’ could be an entertaining, if not explicitly inclusive option. It shows that you’re open enough to accept anyone regardless of gender identity without sounding too strange or forced in any way.
“Good morning/afternoon everyone” would suffice. You don’t have to worry about sounding awkward, it encompasses all the students, and you won’t get calls from angry parents.
Lots of good guidance here that I’ll add one thought to. Since you’re just starting out, don’t be afraid to find your own vibe. Some teachers lean serious, others are more comfortable with a professional but goofy energy. Choose things that feel respectful of them but also comfortable to you. “Fellow travelers!”The more it feels like you and that you want to be there, the more they’ll respond to it. At least that’s been my experience so far teaching grades from 4th to 12th. :)
“Folks, “everyone,” or “students” might be best here.  That way you aren’t addressing anyone’s gender or lack thereof.
I'd be a bit irked with theybies personally, more in favor of something along the lines of Ladies Gentlemen and all others, Folks, Theydies and Gentlethems, or guys gals & nonbinary pals.
Agreeing with other people here, theybies is super infantilizing. infantilization is a huge problem that non-binary people face. address the crowd as a whole, and don't separate your nonbinary student. just say ""class"" or ""everyone.""
you could say ""everyone""
While some people are fine with or use ""Theybie"", I'm pretty sure there are some folks here who don't like it that much. I'd probably recommend just not using gendered terms at all, When addressing all your students atleast, Something like ""Listen up y'all!"" or ""Alright folks!"", For example.
A theybie is a term for kids that are raised gender neutral.
I really don’t think being white or cis or hetero are things anyone needs to apologize for, first of all. Any more than you might have to apologize for not seeing stuff because you’re tall. The position you’re in naturally means that some stuff is harder for you to see. Long as you aren’t playing stupid “i cant see it so it doesn’t exist” games, you’ve got nothing to apologize for. 

That said, I don’t love “theybies” on the grounds that I am not a baby. I prefer “enbie” personally, or if you’re attached to “ladies and gentlemen,” then maybe “ladies, gentlemen, and esteemed others”? But honestly I think the question here is why you need to gender this address in the first place? “Students, please take your seats,” nice and simple and succinct. “You who have come to learn” is kind of ridiculous over the top in the way some teens will enjoy/find funny. “Y’all” has a folksie charm if its part of your dialect. “Hey hooligans” is an excellent form of address when kids get rowdy, and my kid is especially fond of it for them and their friends.
Congratulations! I've been a teacher for 10+ years and it's the greatest job In the world!

In general I recommend staring at the class until they settle down in most cases. Friendly eye contact is key. If that doesn't work I'd suggest individually addressing people who are being talked to and then speaking to the entire class once you've got the attention of those individual people. If things need to move along more quickly I'd go with e.g. ""Alright, everyone!"". 

As an nb teacher I'm also not a big fan of forcing students to publicly share pronouns with their classmates on day 1- or with me, a new teacher. Trust needs to be earned. For me in similar situations it's often a choice between being misgendered forever or announcing I'm the only nb in the room to a bunch of nervous cis people and I don't always want to do that. An introductory ""things you need to know about me""- letter I have the students write is a better way of dealing with that in my experience. Happily out people usually do share early on. I always write an example for them to answer in which I introduce myself, my interests, and my goals for our class. I don't share my gender identity but do out myself as queer and list gender/preferred name as one of the prompts.
Personally I prefer guys, gals, and no binary pals.

Friendly and inclusive. Super casual too
My teacher does a great job at using gender neutral language. She addresses us as friends, folks, students, stuff like that. I don’t particularly like theybies, it feels weird. I think rather than saying girls, boys, and non binary you can just use one word instead like folks, ya know?
Everybody's already given excellent advice on addressing the classroom and why avoiding ""theybies"" is best. Personally, I want to point out that not all nonbinary people will take it as ""infantilizing"", some people (like myself) *could* take that term as flirty instead, which would make addressing a classroom that way uncomfortable.
Just call them students, kids, youngins, folks, scholars, etc.

The proper ways for you to show inclusivity without being cringe is to ask your students for their pronouns and preferred names- and ask them (privately) if it’s safe to use these while talking to their parents ie; if you need to call home, or during parent teacher conferences. Great way to be an ally.

Also having your own pronouns in your email or in the introduction in general, and having a small rainbow and trans flag in your classroom.

Source : I teach LGBT 101 in schools all over my city.

Kudos to you for trying!
Just say “Hi, everyone!” or something that doesn’t reference gender.
Gender Rebels
How about ""students"" for them all?
as someone that uses they/them pronouns, i absolutely *hate* when people use ""they"" to replace nouns. it just sounds terrible grammatically. 

if you wanted to say something similar you could use, ""ladies, lords, gentlefolk""
I like words like everyone, people, all, everybody. That way there’s no gendering in welcoming people
Don’t say non-binary folks. It sounds awful. Something like “ladies, gentleman, and other distinguished students” or whatever version of that you like
I don't know of any english words more inclusive than ""everyone,"" ""folks,"" or ""people,"" so I default to those. My opinion as an nb person is (a)""theybies"" makes me throw up in my mouth, (b) imo a great and easy way to support nb and other gender-interesting people in general is to critically examine the way you are using binary gender/gendered terms in day to day life without really thinking about it, in my experience it frequently turns out to be completely unnecessary.
As a future nonbinary Highschool teacher I wouldn’t saying anything along the lines of ladies and gentlemen. I would say something more like “Alright class!” Or have smth (like a chime) that I would ring to signify that it’s time to pay attention
What about just “y’all,” or “folks?”
""Hey, everyone"", ""Good morning everyone"", ""Hey peeps"" (I use that last one a lot, but it might be too informal).

Or just say the thing you want to say, but without an introduction. Also, if you want quiet you can just say ""can I have quiet please?"" or do 'silent giraffe' 🦒
Also a fan of Folx and Y’all as gender neutral group pronouns
There are so many words that don’t make me feel othered. Y’all. Participants. Guests. Scholars. Students. Mathematicians. Readers. Scientists. Rockstars. As a pre service teacher, I am always trying to find more words.
Go with folks or everyone.  Please please do not address people as theybies.
I tend to use “friends, enemies and those of you still under review” but since you’re a teacher you could use “students dreamers and those of you still figuring it out”
New teacher here! I like to call my students “y’all” or “folks” or “everyone” or simply call them by the class designation (“6B” or whatever). You can’t predict who in your class will be of what identity, so just keeping it vague and general is a safe bet. 

If you’re really set on the “Ladies and Gentlemen…” thing then you could just tack on a basic “…and others” to the list, since there are other identities than just NB whom might be present. 

I also like to go around during role call and ask students what their pronouns are to try and normalise that too and avoid assumptions. 

Good luck!
You could just say folks, students, or maybe even the mascot of your school? Like “dolphins, please look up front!” 

Using inclusive language doesn’t mean creating bizarre words or using infantilizing or ostracizing language—it could simply be using more general terms like the above examples. If you want to use titles, I’ve heard “distinguished guests” used/suggested at times too.
you can always use ""hey everyone"" or ""listen up folks!"" bc it's gender neutral and sounds natural
Oh god no. I hate terms like that, along with ""gentlethems"" and all the other silly iterations that don't even fit with the tone of the other words in the greeting lol. It's like saying ""Good evening, esteemed gentlemen and chicks."" You know? Doesn't match at all. But also, apart from finding it patronising, it also kind of ties the concept of being non-binary to they/them pronouns, neutrality, etc. 

Obviously a non-binary person can call themselves whatever they want, but it's quite a personal and individual thing. I think you're better off sticking with the simple and classic ""Alright/hello/welcome everyone,"" or some other all-inclusive word of that nature.

My first paragraph isn't intended to come across as heated or anything by the way, I appreciate you asking and wanting to get various opinions from us to make sure it wouldn't be offensive.
you’ve gotten some pretty good advice here already so i just wanna say i really appreciate you educating and correcting yourself on these topics! i know it’s bare minimum but it’s still not common so i still like to give some props! it’s always nice to see as non binary/trans person :)
“Theybies,” and other nicknames are more on the terms of friends. As a professor, “Non-Binary folks,” would be more professional. We appreciate you learning and adapting!
literally just be like “kids!” or “folks!” you don’t have to list all the genders bro
Ladies, gentlemen and everyone else is one I have heard and liked.
“Esteemed guests” may not work in a classroom setting.
i agree with a lot of these comments, but just wanted to say thank you. thank you for reaching out and asking the community. this means a lot and actually brought tears to my eyes. you are going to be an amazing teacher:)
My personal favorite is “Guys, gals, and nonbinary pals.”
Turn it around to your students, and have them brainstorm gender-neutral ways to be addressed as a class. 

Maybe provide a few suggestions to get them started, but it could spark a neat conversation.
“Ladies, Gentlemen, and variations thereupon!”
I heard someone use ""ladies, gentlemen, and friends beyond the binary"" which i personally liked. But perhaps for a classroom setting just using ""everybody/class"" would be suitable?
I remember I saw I think David Bowie use ""ladies, gentlemen, and others"" and I think that the phrase is very nice, formal, and inclusive which I'm guessing is what you were going for considering the language you were using. If you want a more friendly, buddy-buddy approach I think ""ladies, gentlemen, and non binary folks"" is really good. Or (I saw some other comments mention this) just use a different phrase that excludes gender like ""students"", ""everyone"", etc.

 Ty for reading :)
as a nonbinary person, i would laugh at you if u called me a “theybie”, especially because not all nonbinary people use exclusively they/them pronouns. i for example use any pronouns. i would suggest a greeting like, “hello everyone!” “ladies, gentlemen, and (assorted) folks” “hello students”
I, as an enby, worked with a high school production team last winter. I also wanted to be inclusive and not assume anything, especially because that's how I want to be treated. For the entire semester I got their attention with ""ladies, gentlemen, everyone inbetween and/or outside of....."" It was a mouthful at first but I got the rhythm down after a few times. I didn't know until after the semester there were a couple students struggling with their identities and my phrase helped them know they have more than 2 options. 

Other gener neutral terms I like for groups are folks, pals, friends, party people, cool cats.
Guys, Gals and Nonbinary Pals has always been my favorite. My GF says ""Theydies and Gentle-thems"" as a goof and it tickles me every time.

Folks is my go-to for more professional environments.

Also, as someone who lives in Appalachia, there are a LOT of signs and bumper stickers that say ""Y'all Means All"" that absolutely warms my heart.

EDIT for additional afterthought:

I DO think sticking to gender neutral terms work best for most situations, HOWEVER! I think if I was a queer high schooler (and I WAS lol) having a teacher put an *emphasis* on the acknowledgement of the existence of more than one gender would have been an amazing first impression. It's like virtue signaling but actually genuinely sincere.
I personally really don't like this word. Why can't you use something that doesn't point out gender?
theybie sound weird asf, i would cringe everytime if a teacher said that, u could just say hey everyone or something
a host at a show I was at said “ladies, gentlemen, and those beyond the binary” and I thought it was good!
Not sure if this has been suggested, but if you're looking for a fallback for when you slip into saying ""ladies and gentlemen"", you could maybe add ""and everyone in between"". Although I'd agree with others that a single gender neutral word like ""folks"" would be preferrable

Thanks for asking these questions! People like you fill me with hope ^ - ^
I feel that theybies is a little fem cause it's basically like the end of ladies, my history teacher says '...peeps, people, whatever you want to be called' as saying he respects people's identity.

My English teacher witch is head of the GSA club at my school (I think, I've been on break)just doesn't say it, she just calls our attention other ways.

I feel like you trying a simple whistle or a gesture will work, it depends what you like
""Ladies and gentlemen and everyone else"" would make me feel good.

Glad you asked us!
I feel like everyone recommends something different for this some of the best I've seen include

Folks: this is classic and appropiate in all situations

Ladies, gentlemen, those imbetween outside and beyond : I like it but it might not be the most fitting

Boys, gals and other pals: this is great but has the same problem as the previous

My people/friends: this one is easy to change for different people

Hope these help
Depending on where you are located “hey all y’all” could easily be appropriate. Hearing that in school was very common where I’m from (Bible Belt up thru the Appalachian Mountains Usa) and it’s what most teachers used, even if they knew the pronouns of everyone and class. Even if ‘ladies and gentlemen’ woulda sufficed. 

I did have one teacher who would start class with “alright you hooligans, shut up and listen” and he always had everyone’s attention lol. RIP Mr. Lambert. I’m not saying you -should- do that, but I’m also not saying you -shouldn’t-
The best thing (imo) is something general like “everyone” but the most common gendered vernacular I hear is “guys, gals, non-binary pals”,  or just “guys, gals, and pals” but that will definitely come across as less formal than “ladies and gentlemen”. I definitely think taking the gender out all together is better, especially if you want to sound more formal and professional, idk what kind of teacher you are lol.                
But every non-binary person is different and will feel differently on what they prefer. Some might rather the gendered version as it is an active inclusion of the non-binary identity at a time when it feels like the whole world is against us (esp for young people). Where others might prefer a non-gendered “everyone” because, since non-binary isnt another gender like man or woman and is instead a gender identity of not being man or women, there are those who prefer to live a life without any gendered terms where they can help it.
Yeah I’ll echo everyone else: “theybies” is infantilizing.

How about “Hello Folks” “Okay Everyone” “Attention Students”
General note tho. As a Femme presenting NB who works in a male dominated job, the WORST thing to do is single out any “obvious” outliers. 

“Good Morning, Guys… *stumblingoverwords* …and Gals!” 🤬

The number of times I’ve been the reason some guy feels embarrassed first thing in the morning and calls me out as the “only woman in the room” is enraging. Everyone should just default to non- gendered greetings.
""what's up bitches, bros, and non-binary hoes?!""
One of my favorites is when a teacher would say something like “friends can I have your attention please” or something along those lines. It was friendly and not condescending and inclusive of any age or gender. Folks is also a good one. Party people is a fun way to address your students. You could also say students lol. Bottom line, literally any non gendered, group referring word is acceptable and I would avoid anything pertaining to the word enby because some nonbinary people find it infantilizing. Thank you for taking the time and having the forward thinking to ask a question like this. I know your students will appreciate it. :)
You can just say ‘hi folks’ ‘can I have your attention people/class/folx/students/everyone’ etc
I'd say to use something along the lines of ""ok people"". Completely removes gender, is inclusive and not infantilising. Also, thanks for your conscious efforts towards inclusivity! It will definitely help your students, even if you don't realise it!
Had a friend who'd yell out ""Scholars"" to get the attention of the class.  Given the students in his class, it was both amusing to hear walking by his room, and with a great deal of wishful thinking on his part.
Do you listen to And That’s Why We Drink? Love them so much. 

As others have said general non gendered terms would probably be best for inclusivity as it wouldn’t call attention to anything in particular. The fact that you’re having these thoughts, and willing to come to a space like this with your concerns shows that you care, which is what really matters. Good luck with your first year of teaching! Remember to take time for yourself to rest, socialize and heal.
Also start listening to the podcast Two Trans Teachers
it would feel a bit infantilizing, i’ll be honest. I’m not in high school anymore but i did just graduate last year. And as someone who was the only non binary person in my (admittedly very small) class, it would feel like i was being put in the spotlight and it would be pretty uncomfortable - you know how high school is for people who are different. A simple “attention everyone” would suffice. You’re really awesome for asking in this sub, though. You sound like a great teacher.
If you really want to use “ladies and gentlemen”, you could try “ladies, gentlemen, and others”. Not all non-binary people use they/them, and not all people aside from “ladies and gentlemen” are non-binary. Tbh just try and go with something like “everyone” or something similar :)

&#x200B;

good luck on your teaching job !
folks!
this is so wholesome
I usually say “everyone” when addressing a group. If I want to be silly, I will say “guys, gals, and non-binary pals” (this went over really well on the adolescent unit when I worked in-patient). One of my daughter’s teachers uses “scholars”.
One of my old teachers used to say ""Ladies, Gentlemen, the rest of you..."" which I thought was nice at the time, but personally now I think addressing everyone without gender is better.
i like when people say shit like “friends and enemies”
i tend to just call everyone “friend” or “bud/buddy.” my husband tends to call people “boss” as well. i always found the phrase “ladies/women, men, and nonbinary friends” fun, and it has a good cadence. i don’t find it necessary to say such a lengthy sentence too often though, i think sticking with addressing the collective via a neutral term to be the simplest way to go. friends, scholars, readers/mathematicians/historians/scientists/etc (whichever subject you teach).

you could also go with something unrelated to gender, like “friends, enemies, and those yet to be determined” but i don’t know how applicable that would be to a school setting lol.
I would avoid ""theybies"" because it sounds pretty infantilizing and not all nb folks use they/them pronouns. Personally I would go for something along the lines of ""guys, gals, and pals""
My fave - ""STUDENTS"" -my social study teacher 😂
""Everyone""?

I'm non-binary and start meetings I chair at work with ""Hi everyone, thanks for finding the time..."" blah blah blah
""theybies"" is super infantalizing imo. somebody else here said ""friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your ears"" as an option and that one is awesome! ""ya'll"" is also good. you could also call your students collectively ""class"".
You could just say ""students!"". I think you're overcomplicating this.
“Listen up, cowards!“ 

It’s the best. It’s concise, demands attention and is perfectly gender-neutral!

Edit: Or maggots, if you’re that way inclined. ‘Shit-clots’ could also work, depending.
Try, ""Guys, Gals, and Non-Binary Pals.""
Yeah I would just not use any gendered terms where they’re not necessary if I was u, just be like hey everyone or whatever
What do you teach? Maybe you can find a fun alternative related to your subject. For example, if your a history teacher the suggestion in the top comment would be great!
I personally use gentlenbie, but since there are far more then three genders (Man, Woman, Enbie) I would suggest something like ""fokes""
my circuits prof in this last sem referred to us as his “colleagues,” as in: “my colleagues, lend me your ears.” a little formal but it was validating not only in terms of being gender-inclusive, but it also made us as students feel v respected in his classes bc it made us feel like we were on the same level as him.
I listen to this wonderful podcast called Sleep With Me. Every episode, the host begins with ""Friends beyond the binary, ladies and gentlemen"" and damn if that doesn't make me feel seen every single time. Hell, it made me feel seen even before I knew I was an enby.
“everyone” “students” “class” “guys”
My teacher just does not used gender language. You could try just saying people or human, or welcome ladies, gentlemen, and gender nonconforming folks.
It seems like a lot of Redditors already helped with your original question so i wanted to mention something that you typed that is worrisome:""I am an apologetically white, cisgender, heterosexual high school teacher."" Giiiirl, I think you should be proud of who you are no matter your race, gender, and sexual preferences! You are obviously a kind person looking to make sure your students feel comfortable and included in your classroom and that speaks more volume than the way you look or who you prefer to date. In other words, STAND UP. You are beautiful the way you are because you are a great human being. now that is something to be proud of :)
""Ladies & gentlemen, and all that lieth betwixt,""
I’ve heard a good non-binary word for ladies/gentlemen is “gentlethem” and I think it sounds cool
Theydies and gentlethems. 
Hey Folks. 
Good morning Everyone.
Welcome friends. 
My esteemed coworkers.
Etc
Based on the other comments, it sounds like it would be unpopular, but ""They-dies and Gentle-thems"" is a cute option.

I've used ""Poison Gorillas"" as a substitute for ""Boys and Girls""... I am internally amused, at least.

I suppose some ~~more serious~~ other options are:

""My distinguished colleagues... and um... the rest of you...""

""My dearest friends... are not here right now, so you'll have to do...""

""Dahlings... Dahlings! Could you all be dears and SHUT THE FUCK UP! Mother has something to say...""

""Shhhh! Shhhh! Listen! Do you hear that? Anybody? It's the sound of you listening to my presentation!""

""Let's get ready to RUMBLE!""
One ASMRist I fall asleep to says, ""Boys, girls and everybody else""
""ladies, gentlemen and other assorted homo sapiens
“Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between” has a nice ring to it, and it’s what I’ve heard most often.

Alternatively, you can use theydies and gentlethems, but those words can lean a little too strongly in one direction.
I've heard 'theydies and gentlethem'. Also a fan of 'friends, Romans, countrymen'
I like ""Theydies and gentle them"".

Seriously, though, ""theybies"" sounds super juvenile. ""Folks"" is fine.
Guys, Gals, and Non Binary Pals is how my favorite food youtuber signs off his videos. I know it isn't as proffesional as you might need in a classroom setting, but I thought I'd share anyway just in case.

Personally I think addressing a room by identifying gender is a bit ehhh anyway. To me at least it feels a bit like addressing a room by listing races. Why draw attention to peoples differences like that. I am biased by having the displeasure of working in a male dominated workplace where frequently meetings will start with ""All right guys, oh and uh girl"".

Students and Folks are good neutral options. For specific subjects saying Readers, Mathmaticians, Scientists, etc. etc. etc. would be my preference.
""Ladies, gentlemen, and those of us (you) who know better"" worked for me addressing groups in a hospitality setting in Seattle
I agree with those saying that ideally you could avoid the phrase altogether, but i understand where you’re coming from.

I’m not sure if you know HasanAbi, he is a Twitch streamer, and I occasionally hear him say “ladies, gentlemen and enbies”. I’ve become quite fond of hearing that. But i also don’t know how that would be perceived in a classroom.

Other than that, “ladies and gentlemen, and everyone in between” probably sounds a bit more familiar(?)

No matter what you say, I (and hopefully your students too!) greatly appreciate your effort first and foremost and I wish I had teachers like you :)
while i agree that just ""everyone"" or ""folks"" is better, saying ""boys, girls, neithers, boths, and in-betweens"" is a will wood reference i love quoting. but it's also very niche so probably not your best option lol
It's fine I'd imagine but it's like. Gonna depend on person to person. The NB community doesn't exactly have an agreed upon term for that state. 

Although I pose this to you OP: Theydies and Gentlethems
hey theybies
You could try ""Guys, gals, and non-binary pals"". It's a fun phrase that Thomas Sanders has said for years and is my favorite way for people to include us in their sentences.
If you want to be inclusive, you’ll have to give up gendered language all together.

Instead of ladies, gentlemen you could say Folks or Gentlefolk.

Also the term Lady itself is to be seen very criticaly as it has paternalistic connotations.
enbies is great
I'd say ladies, gentlemen, and anyone in-between
I like “ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between”
personally? i am so fucking tired of people mashing they/them into other words and pretending its not reductive as fuck.

ladies are not herdies or herbies. men aren't hebies. why is it only nonbinary people who don't get to be people, and only ever get to be one particular pronoun smushed onto another word? (i forget the particular word for that phenomenon. is it portmanteau? /gen but i digress). call me any variation of the pronoun you've decided i - and every other nonbinary person - absolutely must use and im gonna start dropping kicking you atp. 

**everyone** is neutral and inclusive. **all of you** same thing. **may i have your attention?** and other calls to action require absolutely zero need for gender. and in your case in particular? **students** is right there. **class**, too. like, ""alright, class, listen up"". stop over complicating things. take gender out of your language altogether. stop making nonbinary folk a third option. it's a binary, not a ternary. we're beyond, above, and/or removed from it.
I've used ""Ladies, gentlemen, gays and theys""
“Theydies and Gentle-Them”
I LOVE this question! As someone who went to high school in a strictly binary setting, this type of consideration would’ve gone a long way for me and many others :) For better or worse, teachers make the world go round and clearly ur a good one

~however~ (lol) i would avoid theybies. Its cute and fun, but definitely a bit too silly/cutesy for anyone who arent already friends of yours. 

What about “ladies, gentlemen, and my other esteemed associates” or something like that? Still maintains a sense of humor and full inclusivity, but doesnt rely on a baby name for nonbinary ppl?

My favorite youtuber (j kenji lopez alt) ends his videos with “guys, gals, and nonbinary pals”, which i find lovely. But i also understand that “ladies and gentlemen” has a certain faux-formality which is quite fun. I have a friend who will refer to “kings, queens, and monarchs”, which is another fun option if you need variety.

Even if you do end up resorting to the slightly more condescending “theybies”, please know your efforts WILL ultimately go appreciated. Teachers are, weirdly and unfortunately, in the middle of a political firestorm around this stuff, and any extra effort you put in to preventing queer teenage suicide is (confusingly) a brave stance on your part! Keep being slay :)

edit: spelling (cuz teacher lol)
[removed]
This is a fantastic option.
That’s lovely
Stupid and weird..why bother changing something that is not broken. Minorities cry the loudest and when we pity them they get results. You don't congratulate a drug addict on the street..so why congratulate people for being gay its just dumb, pointless and a waste of time.
I love how both you and I suggested not using gendered terms at all, But while you suggested other quite formal things as examples, I gave ""Listen up y'all"".
I appreciate your response. To answer YOUR question, I don’t necessarily feel the need to address their gender. It was more of a “I know myself and my habits as a former military member. To avoid complete exclusion with the habits I am working to amend, I wonder if there is a way I can address these individuals in a respectful way.”

But I 100% see your point about it feeling as though I might be infantilizing, however unintentionally. I don’t think I’ll use that term from this point. I had only heard it on the podcast, and wanted to make sure before I adopted int into my language as I worked on myself as an educator.
I had a teacher once who referred to us as scholars when she wanted to get our attention or remind us to consider whether we were being our best selves.
I agree. Just remove the gendered language if you want to be more inclusive of NB peeps
I wouldn’t go with “theybie”, like others have said it feels kinda demeaning— I’m partial to “Hey gang/friends”
I was going to ask the same question. I would personally just say, ""listen up everyone!"" I guess that's too informal but you get the point. Using gendered terms really isn't necessary at all imo
Thank you! I will avoid the term.
I do plan to work on how I address individuals. I was just hoping to have a fallback plan for if/when I slip into the old habits instilled by the military.
Yes! I definitely planned a call and response system for certain instances in class. I just didn’t want it to seem especially elementary. They’re sophomores and juniors, so I wanted to try to be as age-appropriate and respectful as possible.
This seems to be the common thought process. And it’s exactly what I wanted to avoid. Thank you!
I'm a college professor who's openly NB with my students, and just use ""everyone.""
Yes! I appreciate your input. Thank you for the advice!
I would have killed to have a teacher willing to ask these kinds of questions growing up. I’m so happy for kids today to have authority figures who are safe and trying.
Indeed. I have issues with enby myself, because it sounds childish, I'd lose it at ""theybies"".
This is my favorite and JKL is cool as hell.
Fundie Fridays will also say this and it’s probably my favorite if you find yourself falling into the same habit OP.
A slur for goblins! 😂 oh my goodness. 

I’ve learned a lot just by asking this question. I’m so glad I did instead of just running with it. Just because I hear it on a popular podcast doesn’t mean it’ll work for everyone.
I love this. I had intended on doing notecards with them as a sort of “getting to know you” activity. That way, if there are some students who haven’t fully come out, they can feel safe and respected enough to provide that information on their own terms.
Thank you!
Future taxpayers!! Love that! 😂
I thought of this. But I was a little worried that it would sound super offensive to my students.
♥️♥️ yes!! Thank you!
I can appreciate this sentiment. Thank you for your response. That’s part of the reason why I wanted to reach out to make sure it was appropriate.
Ope. 😳 See? I didn’t know that. Thank you for the clarification.
Absolutely. I have learned so much and gained so much insight. I’m so very glad that I’ve asked!!
Oh goodness! That’s a whole new level. Definitely don’t want to do that. Thank you for this perspective.
🙌🏼🙌🏼 thank you.
Oh shit I love gender rebel as a term thank you for this
Funny. My husband bought me an attention getter, actually. It’s a bell that I just have to lift and it’ll make one of seven different sounds. I intended on using that as well.
What is silent giraffe??
Yes. And I teach English. It’s already a class that not very many students enjoy. So I wanted to make them feel as welcome and appreciated as possible. Readers works. And I appreciate your suggestion! Thank you.
I do not intend to. Especially now. All of these responses have taught me so much!
I love that!!
Oof. 😖 I feel so bad because I honestly didn’t mean for it to sound condescending. It’s definitely a term I will not be adopting.
Looking back at the videos I had to submit for my teacher performance assessments, I found that I default to “alright!” A lot. 

It’s probably something I’ll keep doing. I was just hoping for a way to remain inclusive in case I fell back into the old habits of greeting or calling for attention that I am trying to break.
I love this!! It’s definitely in line with my teaching philosophy. Thank you for this suggestion.
I think this is another reason why I wanted to have something to fall back on. To place that emphasis so my students will feel accepted. But I also want to avoid using any language that would put them in a negative spotlight. 

I think I’ll end up asking my students how they would like to be addressed, like coming up with classroom names you know??
I wasn’t sure about the term. I had only ever heard it used in the podcast. And the host is one who is a strong proponent and member of the LGBTQIA+ community. So, since they used it, I thought it would be appropriate. But, I have since changed my mind. Thank you for your suggestions!
I can understand your frustration with this! I strive to work on this and be the best version of myself for ALL people, not just my students. That’s why I ask so many questions. I want to be the best person and ally I can be. 

Living in California, the general greeting here is “hey guys!” So it’s been a work in progress to remain especially mindful of how I speak to those around me. 

I just wanted to have a fallback for if/when I fall back into the old habits I am working so hard to break. Thank you for your insight!!
This is great! But I would probably lose my job if I addressed a bunch of 15, 16, and 17 year old kids on this way! 😅
😅 oh no!! Haha there have been some students over the past year that I feel this for. But I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to make some sort of difference in their academic pursuits.
I do!! That’s where I heard it!! Em is, quite literally, one of my favorite people. They’ve used the term quite a bit, especially when Christine was pregnant and before we were introduced to Leona, so I wasn’t sure if it was a common term in the community, or if it was just part of their general, lovable quirkiness. 

So I figured, who better to ask than the people who know best?
I’ll have to look into it! Thank you for the suggestion.
I can only imagine the number of parent emails I’ll get if I call my students maggots, cowards, or shit clots. But I appreciate the attempt.
I teach English. And I feel like they would all look at me funny if I continuously called them readers or writers. 

But I know that, no matter what, I will not be using “theybies”
I like this idea a lot. It also works with my teaching philosophy.
 Thank you!!
I like this too!! Thank you.
I love this!! I think I’ll end up doing a “getting to know you activity” and, as I get to know my students, maybe see how they feel about this term too.
I truly did not mean to offend anybody with my question. 😔 I apologize for my ignorance. 

Removing gender from my language is something I’m working on, especially when trying to break some habits I learned in the military or in my upbringing. Living in California it’s a lot of “hey guys!” 

I was just looking to a way to fix my mistake in those moments that I inadvertently slip into the old habits I am trying to break.
This makes me cringe so hard. Feels like a middle schooler addressing their friend group
You're doing an excellent job, and your students are very lucky to be in your classroom. I completely understand falling back into old habits, and it's important to remember that if you do slip up, it's just part of the learning process!
The up and coming replacement for ladies and gentlemen is “distinguished guests”. IDK
how right that feels considering students are far from guests but it would be preferable to “theybies”. Personally all the silly pun words are kind of demeaning. IMO they make being nonbinary out to seem like something just as silly and quirky as those words when its really just a gender identity. Your dedication is DEFINITELY appreciated tho. Its always better to try to include us and mess up a bit then not at all in my opinion, it always feels great to know you’re included and safe.
Maybe you could just say gentlepeople or gentlepersons too, apparently gentlepeople is a real word too since it doesn’t get a red line beneath it.
I can understand falling into habits (my parents are still learning to use my name and pronouns), but using an overall non-gendered address to the class like ""ok, students"" would be the most inclusive way of doing it. Some people don't feel they fit in a label, so even using ""ladies, gentlemen, and nonbinary folk,"" might be excluding a couple students.

It'll take time, but if you're really wanting to change (which I can tell you are), it'll get easier over time.

Wish you luck!
For years, even before I knew I was queer, I would use ""folks"" instead of ""ladies and gentlemen"".

I think a gender neutral collective noun (e.g. class, folks, comrades in learning, students, etc) would be easiest.

Also, it's understandable to have habits of military life left over. But did you start teaching to carry those habits to your students? Or did you start teaching to be a guide to the next generation as they grow and better themselves?

It's time to lead by example in leaving behind the needlessly gendered examples of your military past.

A class as a unit has no gender. And high schoolers probably find ""ladies and gentlemen"" much too stiff.
I listen to a podcaster who addresses the audience “ladies, gentlemen and friends behind the binary”.
Might I suggest:. Hey Fellow Humans!

Not gendered, includes everyone and as a bonus puts you on the same level (hence fellow humans rather than just hey humans)
One of my old teachers would refer to us all as friends.
Just gentlefolk would work too. And it isn’t a neologism, just a bit older and formal, as is the formal address of ladies and gentlemen. I always thought gentlefolk was appropriate in the context of saying “ladies and gentlemen” as it matches the tone.

Now in the context of saying “young lady” or “young man” as a serious address to a mentee, I would probably go with “young human.” But that’s just me, and it would fit with my general tone and normal patterns of speech. I often greet people with a “hello fellow humans.” It makes me chuckle.
I like this one
One of my favorite high school teachers addressed us all as ""scholars"", and it just felt so cool to be referred to as a scholar. Highly recommend that one if you're looking for neutral words as you go forward!
If just by habit you say ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" while trying to use less gendered language, You could probably just add ""And everyone else"" or something similar afterwards.
I agree with them about keeping everything gender neutral. And ALL the time.!The “ladies and gentleman” part addresses two groups of genders, but then if you find a way to add a third group that encompasses everyone else, then it is like you are putting the male and female genders up on a pedestal by mentioning them specifically. While you may not be *excluding* anyone by technicality, you are showing that two groups are worth mentioning, while all other genders just get lumped together. And obviously it is impossible to specifically address each and every gender by itself, either.
Good on you for asking! Totally get wanting a term for the NB pals, but agree with the general vibe that it’s best to find a gender neutral term you can use for the whole group~
I love the notecards thing for just that reason. You’ve thought this through a lot.
It stemmed from a realization that I should stop calling them future college students or the workforce of the future as I teach SpEd and some of them will not go into college or the workforce…For some reason future taxpayers stuck in my head and they all think it’s hilarious
I wouldn’t say “everyone in between” because that is still exclusionary. There are many who don’t feel “in between” male and female.
I think the advice of just a generally non gendered intro that some folks here have given us probably best then.
No worries at all! :))
It's much appreciated! Thank you for reaching out and being willing to learn
If I were a high-school teacher I'd say, ladies, gentleman, both, neither, anyone in between, but I'm also nb so idk how that would sound coming from a cis person
Np.
You're welcome, fellow rebel.
Sorry, it's where you hold your hand up and make a giraffe / llama head with your fingers, and everyone else does the same until the whole room is quiet.
Don’t beat yourself up about it—before I learned about non-binary identities in detail I thought the same thing, that using those kinds of terms would be inclusive. But to just avoid any discomfort, it’s good to use the general terms we already have for people. But if some of your non-binary students decide they actually like those terms like “theydies/gentlethems” then it could just be a cute term that you use for that specific group of students
Awesome! Glad I could help :) best of luck with the class(es)!
Yes! I saw someone suggest that further down the thread! I love this idea!!

I will also say, my nesting partner is a TaG teacher for 7th and 8th graders who are predominantly neurodiverse and queer. He didn't initially ask everyone for pronoun preferences, but he DID start the class with interesting quotes every day, and went out of his way to highlight queer, Black, and neurodiverse intellectuals. He has had *several* students come out to him first. 2 actually asked him for advice for coming out to their family, and one sweet little trans boy who asked him for fashion advice when he was experiencing gender dysmorphia and wanted to present more masc. 
There's a lot you can do to create a safe space without having to make a big deal out of being ""down with the queer kids club"" lol

You could also maybe have a student mailbox for your kids to leave personal updates that they don't want to.actually have a conversation about? Like, if they don't want to have a full on rap with you or make a group announcement but like, change pronouns or name halfway thru the year you can keep up without asking for a lot of emotional labor. For me, that would have been a godsend to give context for my teachers during my parents divorce. ""Sorry I can't keep up with homework I'm in the middle of a custody battle and I hate my life"" would have been spammed to all my teachers.
Legit appreciate that you and other educators are asking the right questions. 

I grew up in places where “guys” and “dudes” are gender neutral lol. Now that I don’t, I’ve had to break the habit and my mega chill manager giggles at me and checks in if I forget.

It’s a tough needle to thread sometimes. Respect your students, apologize if/when you make a mistake(we all do) , and you’ll be fine.
Ahhh my love for that podcast is literally limitless! I started at the beginning and have still yet to catch up, I use it as a long drives/flights podcast and it makes the hours fly by. I’ve definitely heard Em use theybie more than anyone else lol, so I think it may just be more of a thing they adopted and thought was fun! They do also tend to say “baby” rather frequently too, which I’ve picked up on and coooonstantly am “oh who’s a baby baby babyyyy”ing my cat
Depends on your tone and delivery, I’d imagine. I’ve heard teachers say outrageous things in jest and it’s always been fine, cause it’s understood as a joke and not serious.

Edit: one of my teachers let me have a beer when I was like eleven years old, and I thought they were awesome; I’d never have told on them. All in good spirit
Depends on your tone and delivery, I’d imagine. I’ve heard teachers say outrageous things in jest and it’s always been fine, cause it’s understood as a joke and not serious.
you realize you could just say ""folks"" or ""y'all""?? why needlessly gender stuff?
no offence was caused. its just, as I said, tiring and frustrating. where you are one person with this question on your end, nonbinary folk hear this kind of thing at least twenty times a day. it's just exhausting when we've been saying for years we want people to stop reducing us to pronouns and stop doing too much; for yet another conversation ab just that to crop up, yknow? 
and to clarify when I say ""you"", I mean the royal ""you"", not like... you specifically you. 

also, im sure you're aware ""guys"" isn't neutral or inclusive, but it's still a lot better than just ladies and gents, and/or adding a third ""weird"" option. like, there aren't many folk out there who are going to be *that* bothered by that as a general collective term for the group (I'm not saying it's flawless or that people cant/won't be upset by it at all, just it's less likely to cause a major problem). as for an alternative? it's not needed - just catch and correct yourself. ""alright la- everyone"". if you want to say one thing, then say it. adding yet more phrases while you're trying to learn a different one is just going to confuse you further.
I almost followed up with “of fair Verona” so you’re not wrong….
Folks.

I started using that back in the late '80s or early '90s I forget. I don't always remember to do it. But whenever I have a question in my mind about what to say, I go with folks.

I like the word theybies though
That is my goal. But it is also a learning curve for myself. I will put in the work to be the best version of myself that shows up for them. 

I guess I didn’t think about ladies and gentlemen being too stiff though. That’s actually a very good point.
Sleep with Me Podcast?
The voidpunk community would like a word /j
I love that!!
& Enbies??
as an enby ive never thought of it that way, damn you're right!
I feel like that’s where my hesitation comes from
I am swiftly approaching 40 and your reply just made me squeal with delight like a preteen lmao
Oh! Interesting. I get it. I grew up calling it quiet coyote. But that’s a good idea.
Yes. I started listening in 2018. And it took well over a year for me to catch up. I went and saw them live in February 2020 before COVID brought everything to a screeching halt. So glad I had the opportunity. I didn’t fully catch up until after that though. Now I force myself to wait for a couple of weeks so I can binge the episodes.
You're exactly the kind of teacher I like. Your students are going to be lucky to have you!

High schoolers can be vicious and unpredictable, lol. Be yourself, stand for authenticity, and I'm sure you'll figure out what works for your class.

Good luck and enjoy! Sending you virtual apples for your desk. 🍎
Yes!
Are We Not Part Of Everyone Else?
If you would start to name every gender spectrum, it would just be ridiculous

I mean, okay, there're ladies and gentlemen, and other people on the binary, and people on the non binary spectrum and people on the a-gender spectrum

I just think that giving it too much attention will end up more ridiculously sounding than respectful, especially in front of high schoolers
I’ve never thought of it that way either. 😔 this is precisely why I wanted to reach out and ask.
Why I drink this week is to you starting school and being a dope ass teacher! Also seeing them would be incredible, I’m so jealous
Nice I love Scoots lol
well i want to thank you *so* much for reaching out and asking. as a student myself it means the world to me when a teacher outwardly supports me and my gender identity when many don't. when students aren't supported, it can make them feel isolated and depressed, and those aren't good learning conditions whatsoever. let me give some examples;

when i first entered my math class i asked my teacher if we should introduce each other with our names an pronouns. he then proceeded to make fun of me in front of the entire class, saying ""i doesn't believe in that shite, if you're a boy you're a boy and if you're a girl you're a girl that's clear, but i guess im not allowed to say that so you didn't hear me"". i was miserable and embarrassed in that class and hated every second of it the whole year.

but walking into my english teachers class, i noticed she had a pride flag sticker on her door and a few posters up with messages of kindness and understanding. she ended up being the first person i told in that school about my name and pronouns, and when she accepted me immediately i ended up crying in her arms because no adult had really done that before with me. not even my parents. she ended up being the person i went to for support, and even as my autism burnout ravaged my motivation to work, i ended up convincing myself to at least do hers since i wanted to make her proud of me. i do after school drama and take the in-school classes because i like theater which she runs both of, but mostly just so i can still have her class.

being supportive of your students means so, so much, and thank you for wanting to help yourself learn and grow. i wish i had you as a teacher, you sound like youre gonna be amazing and i wish you the best of luck at your school ☺️💜💜
I love the idea of a crowd-pleasing list of all the gender identities in attendance, a la bilbo baggins listing off the hobbit clans at his birthday.
Thank you! 🤗 This week I drink because I’m starting school and I’m feeling slightly anxious about it, because I just wanna do what’s right for these kids!!
My heart!! 😭 I am so glad you found a safe space in such a frightening world. I’m sorry that you had such a horrible experience with your math teacher. And I am 100% positive your English teacher is proud of you! 

I strive to make that sort of difference in the lives of my students.
You’re gonna be great. I have no doubt that you’ll do right by them, in part because it’s obvious that you care a lot about it even before starting. Just know that it’s ok to make mistakes! Teaching is super hard but being there and being dedicated is already so much and will help so many kids."	101jy96	NonBinary	197	0.98	2023-01-02 18:38:40
Hey folks! I work in the adult industry, not always inclusive of NB but I'm holding up. Ask away if you have curiosities.		"Hey there! I'm also a NB person interested in joining the industry. I've found that I truly enjoy sexuality and desirability in such a way that being able to express it to the world sounds really exciting to me. This is however causing a bit of a rift between my partner and I, as she is definitely less interested in sex. Any tips/advice ?
Why did you join the adult industry?
what aspect(s) do you work in specifically

Hi! I've been thinking a lot about doing some sort of camming or something just as kinda a hobby I guess, for lack of a better word  when I turn 18 (February), but I'm not sure yet. I don't want it to be a full-time job, more like a side hobby analogous to most YouTubers/streamers. Also because of the stigma I don't really want it to be traceable back to me (parents, I'm paranoid), so like I wouldn't want to show my face and might want to fiddle with some sort of voice changer (idk how practical this is). The thing I'm worried about is that I've heard stuff about the industry being unfriendly to nb people, and I've wondered if it would be a better idea to say I'm a trans woman (probably not great either, but I know a little bit about what people are like with trans women doing porn and chasers, I guess it's a situation where I'll take the devil I somewhat know over the devil I don't). That gets into some ethical questions tho, on the one hand what people don't know can't hurt them but on the other I don't want to deceive anyone. I know there's a very high probability none of this will end up mattering because my audience will be small to nonexistent and I'm not taking this all that seriously.
Hey! I had issues with my partners before and it has always been a struggle... But mainly because they were not poly, whilst I am. The fact that your partner is less interested in sexuality, or perhaps just interested in it in different ways, doesn't make it fair for you to repress yourself. I think a good talk could be the solution, or you both will end up feeling bad. Discuss boundaries, find a common ground, explain in depth what it means to you, and that it would enrich you and not take anything away from her and your relationship together. Constant reassuring.
I have two partners atm, one long term who's been supportive from the very beginning, and we started as open but still took baby steps when it came to fucking other people (on or off camera, though on camera is also my job), then eventually embraced the polyamory but we still talk our insecurities through. The other partner is also my rope partner and he even performed with me a couple of times, he never showed any insecurities in regard but we've only been dating for 2 months and a half. Boundaries have been discussed though. 
Ask her what worries her the most. Listen carefully.
Talk. Talk. Talk.
Let me know if you have any more questions.
I recommend The Ethical Slut as a book, it's helpful, whether you want to fuck for work, or just fuck other people other than your main partner :) or create entire relationships
I think I've always been curious but the stigma and misconception kept me away. At some point I just wanted to try and feel free, and it worked and I really like it. I love sex, I've always conveyed some sort of sexuality in my art, so it just felt like a natural step.
I'm a p()rn writer and filmmaker, and sex performer. Not my only activities but they take a big chunk of my life.
I've directed a couple of films for XConfessions but I prefer to work on my personal more intimate stuff :)
First of all, don't put who you really are aside for porn, it's not worth it. It's a psychological risk one can take if they want to make a career in mainstream porn, and even then it's fucking exhausting.

If you just want it as a part time, just build your own audience by selling yourself the way you want people to perceive you. If you are NB and want others to see you like that, just say that you are NB and people who are into that will follow you and who are not will either follow you pretending you're something else or will just find a male or a female identifying performer.

There is a queer and NB community out there for support too. Twitter is a good place to be.

If you want to keep it as private as possible, I suggest Only Fans, so unless someone pays they will not be able to see anything. If you show yourself with a webcam service, there is always a risk to be recognised or shared on other websites. Although, if you are not going to show your face the risk is close to zero. The chance of your moaning voice being recognised is also very low.

If it's a hobby and you just want to do it for fun, it's a nice thing, and you are in control of your own content. If you want it to be a job, it is not as easy as it looks like, it requests honesty and commitment.

Mainstream porn is not always bad but it has a lot of fetishism when it comes to POC, NB and trans folks. But that must concern you only if you perform for other companies etc, not if you create your own stuff :)

Hope that helps.
Thank you for your lengthy response! I'll definitely look into that book. Could I PM you for a few more questions :)
cool, I want to cam one day, I’m gonna get peritoneal bottom surgery then after 3-5 years of healing I’ll start camming
That's all very helpful, thanks a bunch.
Sure thing :)
That's nice! Hope you'll enjoy :)
I'm not too much into the camming idea but it can be fun, it can also be a job with enough dedication.
I’ve decided to go through with bottom surgery, now I need to know what surgeon to go to, I will not settle for anything less than cis-passing and unclockable

"(France) Politicians raging on national debate after one brand of dictionary decided to include one of the ""new"" gender neutral pronoun (iel/ielle)"	"I don't know if many non french speaker know that, but we don't actually have gender neutral pronouns, or options whatsoever in French language. Everything, down to every inanimate object or even any concept is gendered. Worse, adverbs and adjectives pronounciation changes depending on the gender of the nouns it's completing. Verbs are affected too.
Young groups of freshly diplomed language researchers came up with a few option as of gender neutral options, and a new way of ""inclusive writing"".
Our institution are all screaming bloody murder at our ""beautiful language"", deeming the new inclusive way unreadable, unteachable, and prophetising it's teaching in our elementary schools will be the reason for future failing in learning to read and to write correctly, pointing fingers at the community and accusing us of using their children as guinea pigs for ""our fantasies and whims"".
As elections are nearing, politicians are seizing the subjects to try and appeal to the majority, shutting down every budding NB friendly initiative in their wake.
And since trans right are as new as this kind of initiative, it's also thrown in the middle of it, everything is tangled and mixed up, every supposed ""expert"" invited on debate TV misgendering, misexplaining and doing a mess of all that has been constructed so far by my generation... It's so taxing.
Looks like all of my NB friends and myself will have to move to an English speaking country, after all. X)
Thanks for reading my rant, anyway, have a nice day.
I needed venting. Thanks."	"It's so frustrating, sorry this is happening. The whole ""this is ruining our language!"" is so infuriating, it's happening here in germany too. Language is always freaking evolving! It's not like you speak the same as people did 200 years ago! If changing a few words and adjusting word endings is everything it takes to make a bunch of people feel better, and you refuse to do it, then you're just being an asshole🙄 my sympathies, op. We can emigrate to New Zealand together
In German it is the same problem and in German politics too. But i guess it is just the same as with gay marriage, first there was outrage, than it got passed, and now it is pretty much accepted, in metropolitan areas at least. As someone who is studying history at uni, i like it to show these guardians of the language how much language evolved during the last two centuries, some double down in their ignorance, but some are caught off guard by it and start to think about it. 
So i guess there is a silver lining at the horizon🤷
French person here! Yep, language evolves, and honestly it's evolving in a pretty cool way - I'm all in for it!

(Also, let's not act like the way French is taught isn't already horribly confusing...)
[deleted]
Ah darn gosh. I saw the good news on a notification. But I'm not in France and not following the actuality due to depression (honestly can't take more than working and surviving) so I was not aware it became a shit show. I guess I should have known because we're always doing a shit show a everything right? No one wants to use iel for me which is actually painful :(
The fact that your language experts are looking for NB language is amazing.  I wish your politicians recognized your rights but this is just the beginning.  I imagine those language experts, hundreds of years from now, will be looked at as pioneers.  As will we all here in this subredditt for being the pioneers of a more inclusive society. Am I too much?  Lol
As usual, it doesn't affect them but they have to throw tantrums anyway.
France moment, but yeah, i hate the fact that as soon as i want to get any sort of feelsgood about my gender i have to switch to english. Good on Le petit Robert for just, adding it tho. and of course the pushback from lingual purists get pissy about it because they have to sacrifice like, 20 minutes of their time to get used to a new neutral pronoun. i have a deep disdain for the right wing leaning of France, especially considering the amount of revolutions that have been done in the past to rid the country of tyranny
I feel you. Denmark likes to pretend it's so inclusive, but the LGBT+ spokespeople of several groups and parties are outright ridiculing us when we ask them to consider making it optionable to get a gendered title on your voter registration.
I've always wondered what kind of sick fuck goes around sexing new things. I can imagine a bunch gross old dudes arguing that shagging a phone is gay because a phone is masculine, but putting their dick in the continent of australia is perfectly straight due it's feminine wiles.
Thank you for posting this; I studied French in High School and was wondering how my non-binary francophones were working their pronouns.  

It sucks how people are reacting but hopefully it will change.  Just keep being you, and keep being amazing :)
French mate here

Having a netral pronoun made me very happy, Yet I'm more tempered about the use of inclusive writing, I think that our language changing and ""Iel/Ielle"" is a good begining and a fucking good evolution but the inclusive seem so boring and not so practical that it would be bad for french. I think that NB community will found walk around and see some awsome solution; Iel is way better than ""il-elle"" when you read a text, yet they mean the same thing. (for those that never read inclusive writting it would look like ""Iel etait heureux-se de retrouvé-e son ami-e."")

Our main probleme is that french is way to heavily gendered. I mean even to our name we have to gender it (Recently learn that Morgan is neutral in english while in french it's Morgan for Boy and Morgane for women). this will be our mais obscacle, we will have to dis-gender the french language (I ain't a linguist and hell not a letter personne, so I'll just follow ppl that have greater idear)

And Yes, when I saw that Iel entered the dictionnary I wen't on twitter and god oh god was I disapointed, instead of ppl just being happy there was just a bunch of old politician just raging about a new pronoun that will never change there life, yet would do so much for other ppl. Maybe a first step to neutral genre ID card ?

&#x200B;

(I'm NB and I'm still using my old pronoun)
I feel like these French politicians would run screaming in terror if they ever saw Mi'kmaq.

There are no genders. There is only nekm. And you must figure out who's being talked about purely by context cues. Godspeed.

Jokes aside, this is such a trivial thing to get their britches up over. It's almost silly how blatant it is that they only care for election points, but it's going to have long-lasting impacts on the trans & nonbinary community in French-speaking places. That's scary.
same thing is happening on Brasil too! it is very disappointing but i hope it is normalized in the future
It's very frustrating to hear that ""kids won't be able to learn how to read"", ""they don't need to push their agenda on kids, they're not guinea pigs, they don't have to pay for this"", I just want to ask them on TV ""then what do we do ?"".
It's all label as ""fashionable"" here, like a trending coat or something, and that fricking infuriating. Add politics to the mix... 
We always say ""it's simple, just please try to use these pronouns"" so people don't feel like it's a big deal when someone comes out as NB or trans, but they're reacting as if we're demanding they all personnaly live as NB, it's ridiculous.
Dictionaries are adding 150+ new words of slang ever year here, sometimes even silly or very insulting slangs you only hear in rap music, most of it debilitating, and now that they can do something of public utility, they just feel offended, or that we will ""devalue the French language"". Our kids use more rap-issued slangs nowadays than words of 4 syllables, and we're pointing fingers at inclusivity.
I'm glad to see Germans are on the same boat as us. You're right, I hope in a few year it will be past us all.
Ouais!!!! Ça vaut toujours la peine mais tabarnac, quelle défie.
I completely agree with everything you said. It always the same in France : creating rights and opportunity for a minority to have the basic decency in their life and having everyone else that is not concerned screaming bloody murder as if we were imposing something on them. 
Of course it sounds silly for someone who can't imagine a situation where they would need to use it, but it brings so much comfort to those who need to!
>No one wants to use iel for me which is actually painful :(

C'est dommage, iel devrait avoir ses pronoms utilisés plus souvent - je suis sûr.e qu'iel rencontrera des gens qui respecteront ses pronoms!
I, personnaly, I'm not very comfortable with ""iel"", it still sounds so strange to me. 
Don't bother yourself with all of this if you don't have the energy for it, it's okay, think about yourself first.
Take Care
It is our youth that is out there making a good use of their diploma to address the issue! :)After years of being responsibilities about taking of our future, this is how our elder reacts...
Duuude you made me laugh so hard xD
 I never thought of it until Loïc Suberville started making TikToks about it (it's in English, you should definitely check it out if you don't know them)
It's not just that it's pointlessly gendered, it's also following no logic whatsoever as to how it's written ... 
Makes for great machist puns for our old humorists though, pointing at how ""all the things that are a pain in the ass have a feminine attribute"" (such as ""washing the dishes"",""a fine"", ""a calamity"", ""a catastrophe""...)
:')
That's the point : we're not xD
When we are fluent in English like my friends and myself, we resort to They/Them (my favourite pronouns so far), but that confines our binary identity within that space, and prevent us from spreading it out to our families or professional life.
Yes, thank you, I'm still hopeful ;)
I'm part Portuguese, I heard about in Portugal too.... Yes, let's hope better fays awaits us
You're right it's absolutely ridiculous and it's obvious the language isn't actually the issue. They just hate when people don't conform to their worldview.
Now that i am thinking about it anything else would have surprised me, we both have overcomplicated languages, close ties in culture, history and politics, both of our cultures were pretty heavily influenced by the catholic church and i guess the politicians we have are more or less from the same mold, so again there is much that France and Germany has in common, for the better or worst i guess🤷
Justement. Courage!
<3
Sounds weird to me too but it's a question of habits. I'm using it for myself and getting used to it progressively. I want it to get more spread because that's a first step towards non binary acceptance. Maybe there's better alternative to get there?
If there's a better alternative, it's definitely not ""ol"" or ""ul"" xD (yes, people are putting these forward too). 
""Iel"" sounds weird, but I'm willing to try it out of course, I'm already growing more accustomed to it ;) (and I just noticed that ""iel"" with a majuscule ""i"" is ridiculous ._. crap.)
Ah yeah no offense meant of course! I was thinking alternative to language altogether to get us recognised :o (Iel is like a lill' soldier with 2 spears ^^)

non-binary bodies can look like anything. how do we communicate this to the outside world?	"IMPORTANT EDIT!!: so… i do obvs want this message to reach cis people. but i also want it to be more commonplace, acceptable, & embraced knowledge among non-binary & trans people, as well!!

this desire has definitely been shaped by my experience as a non-binary person who’s been sexually-harassed, SA’d, hate crimed, & developed atypical anorexia bc of my body & my identity, & how it reads/doesn’t read to the outside world. & i know those, unfortunately, aren’t unique experiences.

obvs we can’t control the things like hate crimes, but i do also truly believe we owe it to ourselves - as a community at such a high risk for suicide, SH, substance abuse, eating disorders, etc - to make this community a safer & more inclusive & expansive place when it comes to the diversity of presentations, transitions & lack of transitions, & body types at any stage of life & any stage of transition/lack of transition. so, when i say i wanna find ways for us to communicate that a non-binary body can look like anything, i do mean that in our own community, too.

lmk if this is confusing!! i’m a really bad writer, but i do really thank y’all for reading & responding, ily!!!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

when i ever finally get the guts to tell someone i’m, in fact, *not a woman*, the first thing they throw in my face is how obvious it is that i have a woman’s body. they’ll laugh, they’ll touch, they’ll make wildly inappropriate remarks, & i know it’s a little bit my fault for not “playing the game” or “playing by the rules” (real things other non-binary people have told me) or whatever else i’m doing wrong, but it’s also in part bc people don’t associate my hyper-female extreme-pear body type with anything other than cisgender womanhood.

so… *we* know non-binary bodies can be any weight, any figure, *anything*. but the *rest* of the world doesn’t, & we’re all suffering for it. i have an ED, & i know I’m not the only one. i can’t dress the way i want without my body speaking over me, & i know i’m not the only one. i’ve been sexually-harassed & even violently hate crimed over this, & i know i’m not the only one.

so how do we functionally communicate the diversity of non-binary bodies to the rest of the world?"	"> we know non-binary bodies can be any weight, any figure, anything.

“We” don’t actually know, and it’s a common theme on this sub:

- “Do I look nonbinary enough?” / “Do I pass as nonbinary?”

- “Can I look masculine and be nonbinary?”

- “Can I look feminine and be nonbinary?”

> so how do we functionally communicate the diversity of non-binary bodies to the rest of the world?

Be yourself and be visible (if you feel safe and comfortable doing so).

Personally, I don’t mind answering questions about nonbinary identities, given that it’s in a specific dedicated space (such as on queer subs on reddit) that I have control over how much I can interact with, and that the person seems genuinely interested. But other than that, I don’t engage in conversations about the validity of my gender identity.

So put as much effort to educate people (both in and out of nonbinary spaces) as you want and are able to, but don’t feel obligated to overextend yourself. It can get exhausting. If you respond to every claim that invalidates your identity, you’re likely to burn yourself out.
I just wanna start by saying this: There is no game, there are no rules, whoever is telling you that is gatekeeping and ignorant. You’re not doing anything wrong because **there is no wrong way to be nonbinary**. (I think you know this deep down but i understand how hurtful and damaging it can be when you’re told otherwise) 

I think the only way to communicate this is to just…keep communicating it. The concept of nonbinary identities is SO new to most of the world (despite nonbinary people always existing). We just have to keep talking about it. I know it’s awful when shitty things happen but idk what else we can do. Just don’t give up, keep educating people, don’t give in to shitty people who tell you to “just play the game.” No, fuck that, we’re not playing games here, we’re just trying to live our lives. 

Another thing I think is important is emphasizing that not only can nonbinary people look any sort of way, but so can *binary* people! A woman can look like anything, a man can look like anything, and nonbinary people can look like anything! We gotta disconnect  gender from expression.
It's not your fault and there *are* no rules but I feel like a lot of folks don't know that. Hell there's a lot of that on just this sub. This is why the ""do I look nonbinary?"" and ""gender me"" posts are dangerous. They reinforce the rules (mostly binary and/or cis) people try to enforce. We have to stop it in our own communities first. The cis won't listen, they're always gonna gender you somehow because they're Like That. But we have to do better. When other trans people are spreading that bullshit, tell them they're wrong, don't let them tell the kids on here that there's only one way to be
""Playing by the rules""??? What rules?  
I am sorry you are being harrased.
We dont. This isnt something people like that need convinced of. Those people are assholes. 

We dont need (and in fact cant) to put together to perfect argument to let them know that you can be nonbinary no matter what you look like.

They either gotta start respecting people regardless of their gender etc... or they will continue being bigoted. Unfortunately theres no argument or performance we can do to make them change their mind.
Okay I want you to know that the way others touch you without permission has nothing to do with how you present at all it’s not your fault that they choose to hurt you, they should know not to touch people inappropriately but they decide to do it anyway.
The fact that you've been harrassed and hatecrimed over your body is a function of the system not your body. Being black, being queer, being nonbinary, being trans, being short, tall, skinny fat none of those things are objectively negative things. They are descriptions of a phenomenon that humans are desperate to quantify and categorize. 

&#x200B;

In all reality the only way we communicate the diversity of nonbinary bodies is by being exactly that. In our bodies by the rules WE want to live by not by the rules of anyone else. 

I didn't shave my head to look nonbinary. I shaved my head a 6 years ago because I was exhausted by the pressure of being a ""black girl"" and the pressure to grow ""long hair"". And the time energy and exhaustion hair was taking up in my life. I released myself from hair to become more real. And in doing so it was one of the first steps in freeing myself from the shackle of the gender binary (little did i know lol). 

Do what makes YOU feel good, not what makes you FIT IN to the culture of nonbinary (and YES there IS a culture because ALL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS HAVE CULTURE). Sometimes queer culture eats its own members in an effort to maintain group cohesion. But like we always say. You don't owe anyone androgyny. 

And if you want a real biological to the ground answer, the female sex is nature's default sex. Female gonads, female development, female adjacent characteristics is the baseline upon which fetal development initiates other primary and then secondary sex characteristics. So next time you think ""my body is hyper female"" remember that female is neutral. It is simply the nature of our patriarchal society which has designated the body you were born with a gender assigned at birth. It is western patriarchal ideology that has tied natal sex and secondary sexual development to gender. 

&#x200B;

Fact is we are gonna suffer for it and as any minority member we do have to develop some degree of thick skin. is it right? fuck no. But is it survival. Absolutely. 

I got mammed at the gas pump today. Do i care? Initially into my transition totally. Now. No. Why? How would I expect this person to know my name let alone my gender. Now if a close friend were to ma'am me i'd be pissed and they would defintely hear it. But if my 73 year old surrogate mom ""missy""s me am I mad. No. She's fucking 73 and I havent even come out to her yet. I've just given her a name change. But she's a very loving accepting woman and she tries her best and has been working her darnest just to get shit right with my wife's name.

&#x200B;

Change is fought for. Rights are never fully won. They are continously fought for.
Sadly, I don’t think there are any shortcuts here, we just have to play the long game. We live our truths, refuse to entertain the concept of presentation standards for nonbinary people, and wait for the world to come around. It’s going to take time. Probably a lot of it. Getting public opinion to evolve is always a slow slog.

I won’t pretend it doesn’t suck, because it does. I manage by keeping future nonbinary kids front of mind. Every time we refuse to justify our identities, apologize for our bodies, or change our presentations for the sake of others, we normalize ourselves a tiny bit more, and chip a flake off the boulder of ignorance that weighs us down. Every time we refuse to ‘play the game,’ we remove a tiny bit of its power, and inch toward a kinder, safer world for the kids who come after us.

It’s not easy to absorb the hostility we face as nonbinary people, or the particular resentments aimed at those of us who don’t fit the arbitrary expectations of the “nonbinary ideal.” It’s exhausting, it’s infuriating, and it just plain hurts. But I find it easier to keep doing it when I think about the sad, confused kid I once was, and how much it would’ve meant to meet an adult who was like me and wasn’t afraid to say so, and who knew how to keep being themself even when the world didn’t want them to.
Something I'm trying to learn and embody is the resilience and defiance that I see other queer/trans/nonbinary people navigating life with. If they don't like what you say or who you are, fuck em. You don't need to seek approval from people who fundamentally disrespect you. Wear what you want, behave how you want as long as you're not hurting anyone. Instill and strengthen your sense of self before you try to bring others to your perspective.

I think all that kind of injonctions and stupid stuff come from a very vocal minority of AFAB slim white and young enbies who want to export constant in queer spaces both gender assumption and bodyshaming they learned from the terfy cis feminist social circles they politically educated themselves in.
In my country they pushed really hard to make queer social circles formally and informally excluding of cis gays/ bi mens, hormonated and masc looking trans guys + AMAB enbies and non cispassing trans woman's because they pretend that's it's necessary to make cis heterosexual woman confortable in queer spaces.
In the end what their fighting for is re-creating very gendered norms inside queer spaces and some kind of gynocraty where AFAB highly feminine looking people are supposed to be the only possible leaders and therefore need to be highly differentiate from others queers.
I am also a VERY femme non-bean (im in my 30s for context i guess). I like cute sweaters, I have a high pitched voice, and I wear make up. Everything that screams ""woman"" to most people. I also have a pear shaped body and I mostly like my curves (except the boobs, HATE those). 

all of that is a major reason why I have only come out to one person, my partner, and thats it. largely I do think that most trans/non-cis people understand where we are coming from, but my cis het parents?? not in a million years.
that’s true, i definitely worded that incorrectly, especially as someone that’s been told by other trans & non-binary people to alter my body or face the consequences. when i point out that there shouldn’t be consequences for just having a body, i get immediately shut down & accused of being lazy & unable to accept that my body will always read as female to other people unless i make drastic changes, some of which i may not even want. but hopefully at least a number of people understand that any body can be a non-binary body.

i guess it’s a double-edged sword bc i can do everything in my power to be visible, but my body makes me invisible. i can wear pride stuff & talk about non-binary rights all day, & at the end of the day im basically regarded as just a cis ally. there’s literally no way for my to communicate my truth as a non-binary person in a non-binary body bc my body reads as a cishet woman’s body to both cis & trans people. i can put all the effort in the world into getting people to understand that i have a non-binary body, & then it ultimately doesn’t matter bc it’s a cis woman’s body to everyone else but me.
i definitely agree, it’s just frustrating bc i *can’t* communicate it. like, physically i am not *allowed* or *able* to communicate it. people have laughed in my face, people have groped my tits & ass & been like “idk, seems like a woman’s body to me”, people have slapped my ass, grabbed my crotch, pulled off my clothes, told me to starve myself & then *maybe* i’ll be non-binary enough for them…

& i know that seems like i have really bad judgement, but those were all *abrput* escalations in situations where i assumed i was safe & that everyone kinda knew anyway, i guess? i know that seems really naive, but like: some of those things happened at *work* - & i was forced to come out at work, & everyone saw & heard, & it was a whole big uncomfortable discussion, & those interactions still happened anyway. some of those interactions happened in queer spaces where i fully had pride gear on & people were just like “nah, those aren’t breastforms, kinda seems like your tiny 5-foot-something frame grew those on its own, & that checks all my stereotype boxes of what makes a ReAl WoMaN!”.

i know i’m responsible for some of that (most of that), but i also feel it would be deeply irresponsible of me - both for the sake of my own mental health, & of course for the rest of the non-binary community - to not even *try* in situations i assume are safe. but idk, i’m a little dumb, & i’m just so frustrated with my body for talking over me, & my complete inability to get a word in edgewise.
i totally agree, we do definitely need to unlearn the narrow definitions of what bodies “should” be in our own community - i think that’ll make things better for everyone.

i guess just, like… how? so, i’ve tried posting about my own experience (not excessively or anything, just here & there), & it *pisses people off* that my body doesn’t work by their rules & that i don’t have the transition goals that they have. then the conversation can’t go anywhere, bc all people see is an idiot with the wrong body that’ll either come around to full binary transition or die (that’s an *actual thing* that people have messaged me: that either i’ll realize i’m FTM & act accordingly (whatever that means), or I’ll kms. kinda dark!)

& IRL these things don’t go that well, either. even to the very few non-binary people i’ve ever met IRL, the fact that this is my natural body & i’m just “letting it happen” is a complete enigma. it’s not that i’m being an asshole about it, & i would never intentionally talk over another person’s experience, but the way that i experience dysphoria & having a body freaks people out. i’ve even been lucky enough to meet a fellow non-binary person that agrees with my woowoo “your body is a vessel for your soul 🌀” stuff, & even *they* had to slide in the little footnote of “but… i mean, if you lost your curves & built muscle, you’d be more convincing”.

at this point, is this not even a real problem? am *i* the problem?
thank you. 💞

i agree that there shouldn’t be any rules, but i’ve vented about my dysphoria & difficulty with being read  as a woman socially while not being a woman at all, & i’ve gotten DMs from other non-binary people on this website telling me that i have to “play by the rules” - meaning, if i don’t want to be referred to as a woman anymore, i need to deal with the things that make me look like one. people see not transitioning or not being able to achieve androgyny as breaking the rules, & they see the dysphoria & misgendering that may come from that as facing the consequences. for example, i had one person DM me to say that i need to acknowledge that weight-lifting & body-building is probably the only way for me to achieve a masculine or androgynous appearance, & that i need to “accept the consequences” & “take accountability” for not doing those things when i get misgendered or feel dysphoric, even though i don’t particularly wanna be all that muscular anyway.
i totally agree about the assholes & i do have to apologize for not being more specific, i wasn’t even thinking about intentionally-transphobic assholes when i was making the post, i was just thinking about people who truly don’t know & then maybe go on to say or do asshole-ish transphobic things later on outta ignorance.

for example, i had this one coworker at a previous job. she wasn’t an asshole, but she’d literally never heard of trans people before. she made a lotta uncomfortable comments about my body, like how if she looked like me she’d only wear pin-up clothes & she doesn’t understand why i’m wasting such a fertile body wearing baggy clothes & not getting with men, & that her husband would find her sexier & she’d feel so much sexier with thick thighs like mine. when i was like “uh… i mean, i don’t really see it that way”, & she asked me to elaborate & i came out to her, she threw it back in my face that i can’t *possibly* be trans (once i explained to her what trans is), because i have such an *incredibly womanly body*. it’s kinda an asshole-ish thing to say, but also of course she’s gonna say it bc she started that conversation not knowing what trans people are & ended that conversation confronted with the least-passable trans person in existence.

people may continue to uphold narrow, dangerous, & exclusionary standards of what makes a person or both feminine, masculine, or androgynous bc they don’t know any better. so i guess what i’m asking is, how do we get this conversation out there so people maybe know better?
i appreciate it. 💙

though i can’t blame them. they’ve never seen a body like mine that wasn’t for touching & grabbing. men literally lose their minds over my body, & there’s no way for me to effectively hide that this is what i look like. i’m just so tired of having this stupid fucking body, i wouldn’t wish this body type on my worst enemy.
i totally agree with everything you’re saying. 💖

unfortunately… i mean, there might medically be something wrong with me to make me look this way. people constantly ask if it’s surgery or an estrogen production disorder. biologically, there is something *majorly* wrong with me - &, if there isn’t, thatd be the most fucked up possibility of them all, honestly. 😅

i guess i just struggle with the fact that, when i live my my rules & present how i wanna present & live in the body i’m living in, it doesn’t actually… *do* anything. there’s no way that i’m making a difference or showing an example of what a non-binary person can look like bc i 100% read as a cishet woman. people read it as communicating the diversity of *women’s* bodies, which is also important, but my body makes it so i can’t physically or even conversationally express what i really am, bc nobody will ever believe me & that’s just really frustrating. 

not that i’m running around being like “oh, i’m having a fat ass, but not in a woman way, actually!”. but i think you saw my other comment on how other non-binary people IRL have told me something about my body’s gonna have to change, or else i’m just gonna have to get used to being a woman forever.

(also sorry, i think you replied to that comment, but my Reddit’s glitching & it won’t let me see it! 😢)
i think that’s all very true. 💕

but also… when i do all that stuff, there’s no way for me to communicate *that* i’m a non-binary person doing it. it’s this weird problem that feeds into itself where i can’t prove that non-binary bodies can look like anything bc i don’t have a body that people would ever remotely feel proves that i’m non-binary.

also, i know it’s gonna take forever, but it really… can’t. this shit’s been plaguing me forever. the way people talk about & perceive & interact with my body has ruined my entire life. i truly don’t want to put up with this body anymore, not the way others see it & think it’s okay to treat it.
i do believe in all that & stuff, but also…

this question was also in part about communicating it to the rest of the community. i’ve had other non-binary people - who *should know better, but don’t* - harass me about my body shape & how i “should fix it”, & then not understand why that’s inappropriate or none of their business or why my body looks different than how they’ve been told it should.

i’m also a non-binary person with an eating disorder, which definitely stems from the fact that my curves make my body read as female/woman, when i don’t identify that way & don’t think curves should be gendered that way. EDs are a huge problem in the trans community, & i do truly think expanding the understanding of what a non-binary body can look like & which traits can be what would really solve that. for example, curves can be masculine. saying that makes me sound insane, but it’s true & should be treated as such. they can also be androgynous. i guess i just want there to be more resources for body neutrality, positivity, & joy in the non-binary community - for those who transition, & those who don’t, & for anyone who looks any possible way. but idk how to make that happen or even *help*, & it literally stresses me out all the time.
yeah, i guess that makes sense.

i’ve never set a boundary without fucking it up. i’ve never set a boundary regarding my gender or my body that hasn’t caused people to react poorly or put me in danger. does that mean i’m… kinda hurting the cause? i don’t mean to piss people off, I’ll just tell them not to talk about my body in a certain way, & they’ll fly off the handle.
i checked your profile to see if we were from the same place (we’re not, i was just wondering), & completely off-topic but i *love* your forehead piercing!! 💘

where i’m from, it’s a little different, in that you can’t be a feminine-looking enby (AFAB or otherwise); you also can’t be masculine; you literally *have* to uphold the perfect stereotype of androgyny or you’re basically dogshit. that’s part of why i struggle so much, bc i’m definitely not slim enough to matter, effectively; regardless of what i wear or how much or little i weigh, my body stores it in extreme curves that make me 100% feminine & 100% invalid, no matter what.

i’m so sorry you also have to deal with gatekeeping & body-shaming & TERFy bullshit, friend. i really hope things get better for everyone, ASAP.
you deserve to be understood by other people, & i’m sorry that you don’t have that rn. 💞

nothing wrong with being very femme, though! idk if i’m *very* femme, i guess im feminine but non-traditionally, but it doesn’t even matter bc it doesn’t read right. i’m very driven by extreme aesthetics, like rave clothes or looking like an alien or goth aesthetics & stuff like that, bc it feels otherworldly & affirming to me… but i also know all people see is a curvy broad w/ a fuckable ass in terrible clothes & makeup. nothing reads right on my body, which is definitely an issue with my fucking ridiculous body that i need to fix, but i think that could *also* be fixed by not limiting aesthetics or identities to one body type, but 🤷🏼 my hips are too wide for me to be fully human, so what do i know?
who the fuck are these twats you're friends with?

They fucking suck. 

And also it really depends on where you live and where you are.Gender is one of the most fundamental constructs of the patriarchal society to reject its construct is to reject one of the core ""truths"" that holds this absolute garbage system of dominance and power together. It WONT be easy and you DO live in an alternate persepctive from the majority of society. Not gonna sugar coat that for you. the question is, do you NEED to be externally validated? are there better spaces, people and places you can interact in to be validated?
You're not responsible for any of that. The harassment and assault is not your fault, not even the tiniest little bit. I understand how it can feel that way but I assure you. It is the fault of the people who did these things to you... not yours! (And yes, you can blame the people who grabbed you w/o permission. They know better. If they say they can't help it, they're just trying to make you feel responsible for them assaulting you. It's not your fault.) 💖
fuck them.

That is all. 

Bitch (not you) no amount of ""body building"" is gonna alter the fact that i'm 5'3, got a small bone frame, oval shaped face, small hands, and 34D/DD breasts. Like my fuck ass is gonna be gendered female by society no matter if I chop off my breasts or nah. And I LIKE having a female body. I don't like my uterus, I'd prefer smaller breasts but I LIKE a lot of things about my body. But I also spent almost a decade coming to terms with my femaleness/femininty and by abandoning that I also embraced my internal masculinity. And by abandoning that I have come to a cetner pint of my own divinity. I still have dysphoria, but I treat it the way I treated my dysphoria over being ""too masculine"" in shape as a ""girl"". 

Society will never love people like us. So take time to care for yourself. And your female sex doesn't inhibit your gender. There is no REQUISITE to make your SEX and GENDER congruous. In many ways I ENJOY that my sex and gender are incongrous. It is a powerful thing to channel this much masculine energy in this much of a socially constructed ""feminine"" body. 

but i've been in therapy for a long time and have had a long time to come t terms with my ""otherness"" in every way shape or form.
As a freshly-hatched baby enby I am already sick of all the infighting that occurs in these communities.  I think that at least some of it comes from a need for self-validation and attacking others as a result, and as someone currently dealing with imposter syndrome I suppose I get that, but that still doesn't make it ok.

FWIW, though, you remind me of my wife (I will say wife as she ""loosely"" identifies as female out of convenience, and doesn't mind the term), in that she presents that way because it's what she's comfortable with but out of the blue several years ago just said ""you know what, I don't feel like much of a woman"" and like ""that part of her brain is missing.""  The fact that I completely understood and could relate to that should have clued me into something, but oh well I got there eventually after realizing that my idea of a ""man"" had been holding me back from who I actually wanted to be.  Anyways I guess my point is that our society is so binary and gendered that it's hard for people who don't really know you to see you as anything more than one or the other, but (hopefully) for those that know you, for my wife's part anyways, even before she said anything I always found it off referring to her as a ""girl"" or ""woman,"" and pretty much just always saw and referred to her as \[pet name\] and just a partner with compatible genitalia.
I mean it sounds like you approached that perfectly. And while yes, its good to be patient and gentle when people genuinely dont know abt something... her proceeding to say you cant be trans wasnt part of her not having heard abt trans people. That was her personal judgement bc shes judgy and thinks she knows best. (Also demonstrated by her comments abiut your body and abt what you should do with you life)

Though, while not an argument you can make to win people over, i find a ""what is *that* supposed to mean"" or a ""whats your problem"" maybe a ""how dare you"" and then avoiding conversation with them (provided they dont backtrack), and if asked why be honest abt what they did.

Its harder for people to belittle you when you dont flinch or look hurt and just look at them like they said some blatantly wrong and rude shit (which they did).
I’m sorry, no body is for touching and grabbing without consent but not everyone has compassion. I have a rather bubbly rear end so I can relate to some extent people really do like to touch it and it took a long time to gather the nerve to make them stop. Also my body type really can’t be hidden either, I’m not even sure if surgery will impact that very much for me but only time will tell, my voice is a giveaway for my AGAB too so people make lots of assumptions. It sucks.

i live somewhere pretty rural that skews older, & i work in places that skew *way* older (geriatric care), so i’m constantly surrounded by people that’re like “fat ass? that’s a woman!”. but that’s fine, i guess.

i don’t think this is about me “needing” any sorta validation, i just need to know what to do to make this world a more accepting place (not that i can do much, but i gotta do *something*).

i’m a non-binary person with an ED, & i’m not the only one - & my ED is directly tied to being in the wrong body, in a body that doesn’t read the way it’s supposed to, & all the traumas that’ve resulted in that. i’m also a non-binary person who was the victim of a violent hate crime that was perpetrated bc of my identity & bc of my body (don’t worry, i know this for a fact: they were very conversational while it was going on). i am also by no means the only person who’s had that experience, but i’d like to create a world where i’m one of the last, in the grand scheme of things.

i haven’t experienced every trauma possible based in the world not knowing what non-binary bodies can & do look like, & i don’t claim to. but i wanna help - bc the traumas i *did* face & *continue* to face were avoidable, or would’ve been in a world that gets it. i just dunno how to facilitate a world that gets it, so this shit (& less harrowing shit, obviously) can stop happening to us.
i’m also really tired of the infighting, but i feel like i almost kinda cause it accidentally sometimes, which is 😓

i only want to lift other people up & to validate all of our bodies, but people see my lack of a medical transition despite severe dysphoria as an attack on them & their choices. & i’ve had other non-binary people, completely unprovoked, tell me what i should do with my body according to their rules, & then when that causes me to feel bad, they treat me like i’ve completely lost my mind. & maybe i have, i’m just not able to medically transition, k i want that to be okay. & i want medical transition to be okay too. & i want all results & all ways of being to be okay. but… i guess i just kinda suck.

it’s cool that your wife thinks about those things that way! i wish i could, but if i have to be a woman by default, i’d die. i am absolutely not a woman, but i know i’ll always been one to others bc of my fucking nasty body so 🤷🏼
And of course, continuing to hsve genuine truthful answers for honest questions when you are able. But most of this has less to do with people not knowing and more with people having already made their mind up that youre wrong about your own experiences.
i’ve tried the “what’s that supposed to mean?” a few times, with horrible results. i do appreciate the suggestion, though! but i guess (most likely due to how hyper-female i am, as well as the fact that people read any gender non-conformance not as being gender non-conforming, but as being too naive to dress myself & conduct myself “correctly), when i ask people that, they assume it’s a legitimate question.

i’ve had people say *disgusting* things about my body, been like “what the hell’s *that* supposed to mean?”, & then they’ll launch into the worst possible tirade about how i’m a goddess of fertility & how much they’d love to jizz all over my thick, luscious woman curves 🤮 

i hate living.
oh yeah, i definitely don’t try to explain my identity to strangers, sorry for presenting myself as naive enough where that would sound like a good idea. 😔 but even then, nobody listens, bc my body gives them permission, in their minds.
i just think this could all be avoided if i/we, as a community, could find a way to beat it to the punch. if we find a way to tell everyone non-binary people can have any body, then hopefully people will have fewer invasive comments about our bodies.

the problems that i’ve faced in this body are a direct result of me *not* being able to communicate that i’m not a woman, people saying & doing things that make me dysphoric (& also that women shouldn’t have to go through anyway, most of the time), me trying to explain what the issue is, & my explanation not mattering bc it’s a woman’s body so there’s no way a non-woman is stuck inside it, bc a non-woman couldn’t *possibly* have a body *that feminine*.
Idk. I feel like the alternative ia go into every new room/ situation with a ""hi! My name is X i am nonbinary"". Which id hate. Both in terms of doing and in terms of hearing it. It makes people feel like they have to have a response to your gender
oh no! sorry, no, i definitely don’t do that! 😅 props to those who do/can, though! i am not that brave!

so, the way i see human bodies is inherently broken. like, there’s something wrong with me. that’s just true. & maybe i’m also trying to break other people & just not realizing it, but like… i truly don’t see other people’s AGAB, or secondary sex characteristics as meaning anything. literally. i’m just like “oh, they have a beard. that’s chill!”. it doesn’t tell me anything about them, & honestly i’ll probably also forget until i see them again.

maybe it’s selfish, but all i want is for people to not automatically see that i have an AFAB body - &, if they do, i don’t want it to *mean anytning*. i just want people - at the *very least* - to be like “okay, that body has curves. whatever”. bc it *truly SHOULDNT matter*, but it matters so much to everyone right now. maybe it won’t one day. 

& idk what to do if we never get there."	zg8945	NonBinary	168	0.99	2022-12-08 19:10:40
Gentles as a gender inclusive version of Ladies and Gentlemen.	"Was watching Perry Mason and John Lithgow addresses the the room as gentles because there is a woman on the investigation team and I was gobsmacked. I love it. Never heard it, but it is great!

I feel like it conveys the intent of saying “well gentlemen” almost better than saying “well ladies and gentlemen” because ladies can also be used derivatively against men to imply their lack of manliness.

I think they used gentles instead to avoid implying that, as he was encouraging them to get back to work despite the absolute horror of the case before them, and they did not want to imply that the characters were being weak for acknowledging that horror. 

But on top of that it is gender inclusive to all people. 

Just thought I would throw it in the ring with the other addresses people have been using.

Added bonus it is way shorter than saying “ladies, gentlemen and gentlefolk,” and other such addresses that stretch the address to three categories instead of shortening the address to just one.

Thoughts?"	"My personal favourite is “Ladies, gentlemen and those who know better”
""Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show/But wonder on till truth make all things plain"" (that's from A Midsummer Night's Dream, this is a pretty old form of address).  I am quite a fan of it.
I go with ""Gentlefolks"" but that's just me \^\^;
""Hello, beauties, and gentlebeauties!""

-Mettaton, Undertale
I think I skip over the issue with simply  ""hello"" or ""welcome.""
Gentlefolk?
Sounds a bit too much like Gentiles.
If you need to address a room you can just say *Welcome Everyone* If you need to get attention just say *Excuse me*

Gentlemen was the lowest rank of the landed gentry, the British social class that owned land. Lady was any woman of a high social class.
Although used in the English language even in countries that don’t have noble ranks they are still frequently used as classist terms today. We should just let usage of *ladies and gentlemen* die off, not add more or neutral gender signifiers to it
I usually opened up to my tables while serving with “Hey there guys, gals, and pals, what can I do for ya?” Usually worked pretty well :)
Literally just say, “Good [time of day] everyone,” that’s it.
Love that very much.
I'm sorry but... Everypony. (I'll leave)
(But in reality though I would probably just use 'Everybody')
My preference is esteemed guests, it feels fancy
This is the first Ive heard it but I love it. It has a good vibe
I say “folks” but that’s probably too southern 😭
I’m rewatching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and just watched the season 7 ep where Andrew is videotaping everything and in every scene where he is speaking to the camera he says “hello gentleviewers” “well, you see gentleviewers…” etc.

No one is filming my life for future generations but that will not stop me from incorporating gentleviewers into my vocab thanks Tom Lenk
In casual conversation I usually tend to go with ""folk"" as a way to refer to a large group of.... Well folk XD.
This is a good suggestion. I have never felt comfortable with ladies and I have cis female friends who are similarly conflicted by it. Ladies is so often old fashioned and implies a requirement to be ladylike, or it's an incel creep being slimy, or it's a basic normcore rallying for femininity which as non binary is alienating.
""friends and comrades""
It sounds too much like ""gentiles"", suddenly we'd get the anti-Semites on our asses for sounding ""too Jewish"".
When I'm with friends sometimes I'll say ""sup, bitches?"" but I think that probably won't work in most situations
Theydies and Gentlethems… or as I refer to myself “Thembo”
I use ""kitties"" in my language to refer for everyone regardless of gender if the situation is informal enough. Comrades is a good word too in my opinion
This so USA. Where I live this isn’t even a thing lol
I use folks for that reason. If I've gotta boymode for a bit then I'll confine myself to ladies and gentlemen but more often than not I'll just say folks when referring to any number of people. 
I've not heard gentles until now and I really like it. Props.
In the Society for Creative Anachronisms that's what they do already. Or ""Good Gentles"". Good Gentle is the gender neutral equivalent to Lord or Lady in the SCA ranking system.
guys gal's and pal's
Personally i am a friend of the 19th century Dearly Beloved, as it throws gender out the window, alternatively dear Attendants might work too?
I prefer ""living, dead, and undecided""
Same hehe
I like that one too. Either or.
It sounds exactly like that
It really doesn't
Why not just pals?
Ohhh I like that one
It’s definitely worse in most instances, IMO
This just creates another binary, though.
Cool
best one fr

Steven Universe's constant inclusion of nb people makes me so happy	"https://imgur.com/a/bBjvVCY

Steven Universe was quite possibly the biggest component in my journey to self-acceptance. I cannot begin to express my appreciation for this show. And as someone who still fights so much with themself over their gender, it's little things like this that make me so much happier, and truly believe that I'm alright. An openly and explicitly non binary/intersex character within the actual show, this moment from the comics, and another moment in the comics where said nb/intersex character has a meltdown while on a date because they think they're lying about their gender to the date (disguised, because it's a children's comic, and sadly we just haven't come that far yet, but you can obviously tell what they're implying with gender), and a shit-ton more queer inclusion within the show and comics. If you told me a few years ago that a cartoon would genuinely changed my life, I would've laughed. But now I fully understand why this show means so much to so many people. I only wish more struggling queer kids could have a show (or anything else) like this to impact them so positively. This is the first time I've ever wanted to genuinely thank someone for the thing they've created, and hope to one day meet the creator to do just that.

Thanks for reading this silly post about a dumb cartoon. Just needed to talk about it :>"	"It really is a great show! I would've loved to have something half as inclusive growing up, I'm so glad kids today have stuff like it.
There are some really great quotes from Rebecca Sugar regarding queer representation in kids' shows in various interviews, and they're 100% the reason I've come to support her and her creative output so fiercely. Shows like SU normalized queer identities and put it on par with heteronormative conventions without making it seem weird or different: it's just part of the world, and everyone accepts it. That's super important.
I know Steven Universe and the fandom it harbors is the reason I figured out I was enby. I got a tumblr account around the same time I really started to get into SU and being the show it was the fandom had a large queer fandom. And through that I was able to learn that nonbinary people even existed, and I finally felt like I understood a part of myself I never did before. And then through Stevonnie I really felt represented. I still cry hearing the song “Change Your Mind” because that song even by itself has helped me be ok with who I am. Without Rebecca Sugar and Steven Universe I don’t know how much longer it would have taken to understand and accept myself, but I certainly wouldn’t be at the point where I am considering hrt.
Steven Universe was also important to me for self-acceptance. At the very least, it came out at the perfect time when other things and people also helped with self-acceptance. It is actually funny how in 3 years I went from ""I don't believe the theory that this character is nb"" to ""This character is nb and so I am!"".
That's good enough to me
I started watching SU when I was around 10ish (I'm 15 now) and honestly the show has helped me so much with finding and accepting myself. I know so many trans and enby ppl who Steven university played a similar role.  this is why representation in kids media is important.
Maaaan this makes me wanna read the comics for sure. Showing Stevonnie shaving in the TV show was such a power move and the bravest nonbinary representation I’ve personally witnessed in the media, especially children’s media.
Like wtf. I've just learned about this series very recently. Wtf. It aired in 2013, back when I was a self denying complete mess. Granted, I started dating my now BF around that time, so that might have distracted me a bit. But honestly, I was so lost, I felt so weird for doubting my gender, like an alien or at best a freak. I wish I had seen this series then and came out as NB, that would have spared me 5 years of self doubt and anxiety.
I'm personally super happy that all Gems are technically Agender and Nonbinary, makes my lil queer heart happy :D
The song Change your Mind makes me cry 90% of the time I hear it because of the impact it has on me. I high key want a tattoo of the lyrics just to remind myself that I don't need to live to make other people love me. I love me and that's all that matters.
Agreeddd. I started watching when I was 14 or 15 I think, and in these past couple years, it was what genuinely taught me how to love myself.
Ikrrr. Also having an intersex character is a huge leap for not just cartoons but media in general. It even explicitely Stevonnie is non binary/intersex in one of the Dove self esteem shorts with them. It's amazing the representation this show has.

Exclusive Inclusivity	"When people say he or she, fireman and firewoman, and think they are being inclusive. Little do they know they can refer neutrally to everyone, and be the ultimate inclusive.  
Drives me a tad batty.   
I also saw a pair of socks today marked girls, 1-3 months. All baby's feet are pretty much the same proportionally. disgustang"	"Oh with baby clothes it's even worse than you're thinking. For any given size, the ""girls'"" ones are *smaller*. Like, markedly so. AFAB babies just *aren't* that much smaller that a 3mo one needs only slightly bigger onesies than a newborn AMAB baby, and they certainly don't need more *fitted* clothing, but if you lay the sizes out there's a clear progression. My baby was a preemie and we seriously had to start with femme stuff just because that was what fit, and the neutral/masc things in the same sizes from the same brands were too baggy.

But *yes* to the he/she thing. Sometimes I exempt myself from such documents because I'm not listed in them. ""Sorry, there wasn't an option so I figured you didn't want to hear from me."" Or I'll add myself by name after someone's said ""the men and women who have done this"" or whatever.
Gotta agree with you. Terms like firefighter or person exist for the same reason the pronoun „they“ exists. Also gendered baby clothes are the dumbest shit ever since babies have literally similar body types??? Like, just make one section with every color and pattern option instead of gendering the whole thing?
They could just say firefighters. Is not hard
Bought my kids pants the other day and they didn't have warm clothes in the girls section. We live where it can be In the negatives for months and clingy little leggings aren't sufficient. We bought everyone's pants from the boys section. It's not even just a fashion or body type thing, it's just safety and common sense. I appreciate that they got rid of gendered fitting rooms here. Midwest, USA.
Also I despise writings using his or hers or he/she. Theres a very simple, more inclusive and less clunky way to say that...
i was describing these boots i like to some girls and said “spaceman boots” just because i was feeling more masc and this girl went “nuh uh uh uh uh space-woman boots” and she acted like she just had a girlboss moment but she ruined my entire day, why do people feel the need to do that
Before I swore off children my plan was to just dress up my baby on Halloween costumes. So if people asked my baby’s gender I would said 

“Obviously they’re a baby spider” 

“A dinosaur…specifically a t-rex” 

“A little bumble bee” 

“A mouse duh!”

“SUNFLOWER”
In Germany,  I kinda get it. It's a lot harder to be gender neutral in german, but you still can try. In everything official you get from school, they always write ""we are ok with our son/our daughter doing X."" You know you could just write our child.
Gendered kids clothing is a scam invented by children's' clothing makers to stop handmedowns.
Why would anyone use fireman/woman over FIREFIGHTER!? Come on, that's so much cooler.

 ""And what do you do?"" ""Me? Oh, I fight fire! With my bare hands!""
It’s actually slightly triggering to me when I see people talking about groups of people & then saying men & women. It makes me feel like I matter so little to people that they forget people like me even exist.
Has anyone seen the Middleditch and Schwartz improv show on Netflix? It’s reasonably funny if you’re into that sort of thing. But there’s soooo many times were they unnecessarily say “boy or girl”, as if those are the only two options, when the options on the imaginary multiple choice “what’s your gender?” question need not be specified! So frustrating, and weird. It seems so unnatural to me when I hear it and makes me uncomfortable 🥵
Its the same like the roose of ""small bois beter dan grls"" like, uh, nah? Before puberty muscle mass averages (excluding when artficially enhanced like by exercising) is quite equal.
What do folks think about laser hair removal being gendered & more expensive for 'men'? I looked up general pricing and multiple sites separate procedures by gender. Would be great if it were on a quote basis. I'm guessing the theory is that men have more hair to remove and a different area to work with. But everyone's body is different right? Again it just feels like if they gave a general estimate with prices ranging depending on what needs doing, and then a quote based on seeing the area for procedure it would be fine.

Just some thoughts and frustrations. Probably need to find the right clinic.
i got a new cookbook for christmas and i swear every other recipe has the phrase “if the cook prefers, he or she….”. did u kno there is a more efficient and inclusive way of wording that?? am i exaggerating or is the refusal to do so in 2022 is starting to become a dogwhistle for some people?
Same struggle with my kiddo!! The stuff handed down from their AFAB cousin is waaayyyy smaller than the AMAB stuff gifted to them
Unfortunately this does not exempt you from laws. There's too much precedent from laws exclusively using ""he"".
This. I know someone who was born too early and he was really tiny because of that. The only clothes that would fit him were ‘girls’ clothes. Did his mom care? Not at all. It fits, it fits, let’s not make a big deal of this
Reminds me of people who want to know whats between your pet's legs but also for babies, just do not, nobody should want to know that or tell that publicly to others, its creepy.
Sunflowers produce latex and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing hypoallergenic rubber. Traditionally, several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a ""fourth sister"" to the better known three sisters combination of corn, beans, and squash.Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic properties.
TRUE lol
I think it's more the fact of different skin tissue arrangement. AFAB skin is far more flexible, because it evolved that way to allow women to give birth and carry a baby without the skin breaking. AMAB skin is far less flexible, because evolutionally it didn't need to be. This is one of the few times the AGAB actually makes a difference in medicine. If that also applies to or affects laser hair removal tho i admittedly have no idea.
Well yes I'm aware. Though I have occasionally wondered what a trans abortion case would look like in my state, because everything in statute says ""woman"" and I'm legally documented to not be one.

Please I really need y'all help	"Hello everyone
I'm pansexual enby from Africa, being LGBT where I'm from is practically a death sentence so I've been wanting to move to an inclusive country but I can't afford it so a friend of mine created a gofundme campaign for me but it's not getting much attention because I can't share it  on my social media, Can anyone who has alot of followers on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook help me to share the campaign link so  More people can see it? I've tried everything I can but it's not working, you don't have to donate just help me to share it with people, Thanks.
 
https://gofund.me/6875210b"	"I'll upvote and comment but that's about all I can do, I'm sorry.
Some LGBT Clinics and Centers will actually help you advertise/post Go Fund Me posts. Some of them will also help with relocating or help you find resources to help you relocate to safer areas. 

Research where you want to go and contact many places to see who can offer what to you, you may be able to find multiple places offer different services. 

Research helps a lot- what healthcare do you need, housing, lgbt laws, etc. is important so you can find out exactly what countries or places will have what you need so you don’t end up having to get up and move again because somewhere is lacking.

Example is here in the USA, California has some of the top LGBT Centers in the country, so start by emailing or calling places (if you have long distance calls available.)
Which country are you trying to get into?
If you send the link I can share it on my socials. :)
Which country in Africa, and where are you planning on moving?
If you can give me the gofundme link I can share it on social media since I cannot donate.
I have a little bit to give. Dm me the link
Check out rainbow railroad, they may be able to help you!
Edit the link in the post, we'll share it, and donate as much as we can !
Africa not safe for lgbt
It's okay, thanks 😊
Thanks I'm planning to move to Germany that is where the friend that created the campaign for me is and I've talk to some LGBT+ organization there they're not helping with relocation but they will help me when I get there
Germany

Thank you
Nigeria and I'm planning to move to Germany
I'm unable to message you and I've try to send the link to others that asked for it but it kept saying Domain filters so I can't send it in DM either
[removed]
I've checked them out, I think they only help people in an extreme dangerous situation out
Done, thank you
Yes that is why I'm trying to move.
I hope your refugee camp get all the help it needs, hopefully in  future I will be able to support as much as I can
Awesome! I’m glad to hear you have a supportive base. That helps a lot. I understand how important relocation due to lgbt violence can be, having relocated for the same reason several times. I wish you the best and hope you enjoy the journey with new friends and experiences!
Hey, I'm in Germany. 
Let me know if you need any help once you're here.

What kind of costs do you have? Visa? Flight Tickets?
i am in Germany aswell, Munich to be precise, if u need any help you can always hit me up!
Shared.! Good luck 💖
I've received the link

Edit: i got notification for it, but can't see it
I don't know what is going on
It sounds like you're in an extremely dangerous situation, no? Even if they can't help you directly, they probably have a better idea of what resources would be most relevant to your situation
Yes they've really help me alot, I don't know where I would have been today if not for their support, I've been wanting to relocate since I found out about my sexuality 4years ago, I'm glad I'm one step closer.  Thanks for the kind words
Yes I need help with those and a passport, medical  and police report
Aww cool
Thanks I will follow you
Still here
Thank you
You can see it in one of their other posts in a go fund me sub
Ok I will reach out to them And see how it goes
I hope they can do something for you :(

Why do people hate us so much?!	"I'm planning on coming out to part of my family that I know is not familiar with Nonbinary folks, so I decided to search for YouTube videos that explained the concept better than I could.

I knew that those topics always attract haters, but I swear that 9 out of 10 comments on those videos are from people saying all kinds of nasty stuff about inclusive language and non binary people! That sucks so much!

I feel like it's even worse when I'm looking for Brazilian content. Portuguese is a very gendered language and it makes people foam at the mouth just for considering the use of inclusive language. That whole experience ruined my day, all the confidence I had gathered to come out to my family vanished completely...

Anyways, just needed to vent somewhere. Stay safe everyone, take good care of your mental health 'cause the world is definitely out to get us..."	"Don't lose heart, YouTube comments have always been a cesspool of bigotry, It's just a bunch of sad losers, Alt-right bots, and 10 year old tate fans, not representative at all of the world at large.

Gendered language can be difficult, but it's the reality of the situation, any change takes time and we're unfortunately very much at the forefront of Non-Binary and Trans acceptance. But, that is our lot, we can't give up or give an inch now, or NB people will always feel as we do.  


And as far as coming out, make sure you're ready, and make sure you have a plan if it doesn't go well. If either of these are not true, It can wait. better to be safe.
i usually just stay away from comments unless i know the creator's community is very friendly/accepting. same goes for other subreddits (or other places online). unless they specifically state they're inclusive, i assume they're not.
É foda, né, xuxu? : /
We show people that there is a different way than the binary. But people don’t like this because their worldview is that men are better than women and so we show them that this is inherently wrong. Same goes for trans people.
Hi friend! I’m a native English speaker so I’ve not had to deal with gendered language very much, but I just wanted to reach out and let you know that you have support here. You are a valuable person who has lots of talent and knowledge to share with and receive from the world. Those commenters are coming from a place of ignorance and it’s sad that they would rather be fearful than curious of those who are different from them.

Maybe you could try to talk to a trusted friend and see what it’s like to explain your experience of gender with them and see what kind of questions they have before you try talking to your family. I don’t know about you, but I personally have an easier time speaking one-on-one with someone around my age than speaking to a group of people older than me. 

It is not our job to teach others to be kind and understanding, but if you are having trouble finding resources in your native language, you could always try to create a resource for others based on your experience. Also, if there’s a resource you like that isn’t in your native language, you might be able to contact the creator or author and ask if they can have it translated officially. Just some thoughts. I hope your day gets much better.
The society is built on gender roles. Patriarcal values is at the core of so much of how we are meant to live: heterosexuality, marriage, monogamy, sexism… the list just goes on. So whenever someone doesn’t fit into that ideal, people who benefit from that system, are used to it or were brainwashed into believing it’s the only functional system loose their absolute shit. This is what happened to feminists, this is what happened to gay people, this is what is happening to trans people whenever these groups started fighting for rights. 

Yes it sucks, but keep in mind: in the end, we will win :) so for now, just focus on your immediate surroundings understanding and accepting you; get yourself a reliable group of friends or family you can rely on, and you’ll be okay, I promise
YouTube comments are horrible. If you want to be sad/mad/disappointed, go there first (go to Reddit second, I’ve found, but there are some good places on both sites.) 

I tried the same thing, all I got was news articles about trans people trying to brainwash kids, getting people of different political parties to state their opinion on trans people, people explaining why transness is a pandemic, and then finally, way down at the end, like two videos from Jammidodger and an OT video (I recommend both Jammidodger and One Topic for some restored faith in humanity). 

It sucks. It feels like it’s everyone. It’s not. Two days ago I had to do the whole “introduce with your pronouns” thing because class started. The professor had misgendered me before introductions (I didn’t even notice). I had to talk to him after class about something unrelated. After that issue was resolved, he apologized for misgendering me and said “it will not happen again.” It’s not everyone. There are accepting or at least understanding people.
É foda, eu prefiro usar they/them como pronomes mas as opções no BR nem me agradam e menis gente ainda aceita...
hi! im sorry for the people that wont understand my post, i just felt like speaking to op more personally as a fellow brazilian, hope u understand...

como ume brasileire enby, eu quero dizer que o cenário realmente é difícil... mas em relação à família, normalização is the way to go 👍 nosso país passou por uma hiper criminalização e linchamento social sobre a gente por politização ferrada de transfobia. é difícil, mas não perca a fé! tem pessoas que nunca vão nos respeitar, mas comece pequeno e apresente a ideia pros seus familiares se possível de uma maneira suave, lenta e simples de entender jfndjdnenr às vezes usar metáforas ajuda bastante

eu juro q mesmo se eles tiverem uma reação ruim de início, tem a chance de eles ""amolecerem"" no futuro enquanto vc vai lentamente apresentando a ideia
tenta falar de celebridades famosas com essa identidade! amigues! colegas! enfim vai dar certo linde, #pas
Even though I knew my family would be supportive it took months to work through the anxiety to tell them.  It’s hard!

I also tried to find a YouTube video but it was kinda hard because everyone has their own spin. I almost wonder if it would be better to send a simply dry paragraph definition. And just let that be it. It will take them time to really understand it and what it means for you. 

Good luck!
os vídeos da apenascup sao bem didáticos
tem no youtube, tem uns curtos no instagram e tiktok tbm
If gender doesn't all fit into nice little boxes, then the world is a lot more complicated than some people have been taught. If people are allowed to choose their gender for themselves, then the power structures that used to have the power to enforce gender norms are losing their hegemony. They don't have any good argument for why we should go back, so the only tool they've got is violence.
I can only speck about what I see in my country but we are just an easy outsider to target, when our government needs to hide away from something or attack something they use us as a vehicle for that attack. They whip up the population with the media (or the media whips up the government etc) to achieve their aims for the day, over time these views get entrenched in peoples minds, if it wasn’t us it would be some other group, all we can do is love each other and build a strong community that can withstand the hate
It’s the same with Instagram, most social media has become so toxic and hateful. The classic “nobody cares” comment is just the tip of the iceberg and yet it makes me so angry. That’s why I deleted Instagram.
brazilian person here. DAMN YOURE SO RIGHT. PORTUGUESE IS SUCH A GENDERED LANGUAGE. I can’t imagine how much of a struggle it is to find the content to help out, from someone who never really tried but yk. good luck in your search!
Cis f here to say I love my nonbinary partner ❤️ there’s good people out there. Stay positive friend
Keep in mind that the internet is overrun with people who literally spend all day online criticizing everything. New music comes out by someone? Bunch of laugh/angry reactions. Someone comes out as queer? Laugh/angry reactions. Someone wants to provide educational material on gender? Laugh/angry reactions.

The people who are the loudest in these comment sections are doing it because in real life, they feel rejected by everyone and everything. They’re bitter, lonely, and frustrated. It helps them feel powerful to join the ranks of others like them and publicly attempt to humiliate people online, because in real life, they feel weak and insecure and don’t know how to address those feelings. And with all that being said, as upsetting it is to see people just bash people like us so much, a part of me feels bad for these people and wants to help them. They clearly need help, they clearly need good emotional support networks, and they clearly have trouble with their critical reading/research abilities/finding accurate sources of information. I wonder what it would be like if all these people got the emotional support they needed… :/
I think people are resentful of being jammed into their own rigid gender roles and are thus uncomfortable thinking about their own issues with gender, which they're forced to do when we're so free about ours. Also it's part of that ""we had it worse so you should too"" boomery mentality. So i mean on both accounts, projection. That's just one theory I have and not the only reason.
Thanks for that!

I live in a different country from my family, and I realized that coming out to some people have helped me figured thing out (I guess saying those things out loud and having people that know me react to them helps me understand how I feel).

I'm 99% sure that they'll accept me, but I want to make sure they truly understand what I mean. I'm not making any drastic changes right now, so I figure it would be easy for them to pretend they accept/understand without actually changing how they perceive me, so that's why I wanted videos, etc, to help them understand.
Terrível!! E o pior é que só de começar a pensar em pronome neutro já desvirtua a discussão, as pessoas vem com ódio!!
Thanks for that!

I've come out to a few friends/family that I was sure would be understanding (and they were!!), and with that I realized that coming out to people have helped me understand more about myself, so I wanted to try to talk to more people. I'm 99% sure that my family would accept me, just wanted to make sure that they truly understand what I mean.

Good idea about resources and all, I guess I'll try to save everything and share with others in the same position I am right now!
Yes, we unsettle their settler colonial patriarchal identities and normality 💛🤍💜🖤
Pois é!! O pior é que sei que não gosto das opções BR por falta de costume, e sem usar nunca vou me acostumar, mas ainda assim é difícil...

"Wildflower sex Shop attempts to copyright the word ""Enby"""	"Wildflower is a sex shop who has committed various gross acts like [systematically using Black femmes](https://medium.com/@evyan.whitney/dildont-disrespect-black-femmes-our-personal-experiences-with-wild-flower-sex-shop-c8d06ce7695f) to elevate their company and products without compensation, is now attempting to [own the rights to the word ""enby""](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/12/03/shop-enby-wild-flower-sex-toy-lawsuit-trademark-trans-non-binary/) so that only they can use it. They actually sued a company owned by a [Black Trans owned company](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=000f3adf-6b27-4b14-9ce5-a7c3460fd8a8) for right to the word.

Both of the owners of the shop identify as Non-Binary and it's my personal opinion that they do not care about the enby community, the sex worker community, or Black lives more than philanthropy, and growing their business on the backs of those folks.

The owners are also quick to block and edit users and their comments on Instagram and Facebook, where they successfully control the narrative that they are inclusive and about equity.

All of this is because they believe that they deserve creative rights to a genderless sex toy that they created dubbed the enby.

The idea that a sex shop would try to co opt an identity and take it for their own as if they created it is within the very definition of white supremacy.

I personally find this racist, sexist, transphobic behavior from someone in the community absolutely unacceptable"	"Ugh yeah I'd heard about these folks shenanigans before. It's >_<
Someone actually owns the sole exclusive rights to a certain reindeer that may or may not have a red nose.

They found no one had actually copyrighted the idea, et voilà! Now technically nearly every reindeer with a red nose sold is copyright theft...

Just sayin' how ridiculous copyright and intellectual property laws are... They'll probably be able to copyright it, but it means very little ultimately. 

They can't stop anyone using the word ""Enby""; there's plenty of use of this prior to any copyright application, and there's caveats within laws that basically say no one can copyright words, otherwise Coca-Cola would have copyrighted ""Cola"". 

Doesn't make it any less insultingly stupid... Feckin' copyright trolls.
They're not trying to copyright it. They're trying to trademark it. It's a different type of intellectual property. What it means is that you can't sell goods or services under a substantially similar mark within the same industry. They couldn't get random people for using the word enby, only other people selling under the enby mark. I think the court will find that ""enby"" in relation to a sex toy shop is not a protectable mark as it describes or identifies the type of good sold. This wouldn't be the case if, for example, somebody did made a software company named ""enby"" that made accounting software. That would be a protectable use. Just hoping to provide a bit of background on why this isn't as big a deal as it seems, but yeah, fuck Wildflower!
Capitalism brings out the worst in people
The legal analysis was a great read!  But the silence since Nov makes me think Wildflower got paid big $$ to settle this out of court.  Which sucks.
Yeah they know this won't work. It's free publicity - please don't help in that regard. Best thing is to actually delete this if anything.
You could click their ad on google a bunch of times without shopping there. Google usually charges per click, it’s petty but if they won’t listen to the community telling them to drop the lawsuit we could a least be annoying and hit up their ad budget.
It is absolutely silly and rediculous. 
I also wanted to point out how damaging this behavior is and  why not to support them.
This cannot be overstated

I want to wake up from this nightmare
I disagree. Their target audience is queer folks and they peddle woke culture, I'd like to think that audience would shun them
It is. It really is. 

If they get the application successfully passed in France, for instance, anyone caught using / profiting from the word Enby can serve significant prison time.

And yet, it can't be worth more than a few thousand dollars to them as a name for a sex toy...

The real value would be in chasing infringement cases and loss-of-sales cases. 

But it's unlikely any case would get tested in court. A lawyer would basically send out a demand with an offer to settle out of court for maybe 50% of the demand (still could be tens of thousands!). People get scared and intimidated by what is effectively harassment, and pay the ""fine / demand / whatever"", or negotiate down to maybe 25% plus profit-share on future sales.

Totally nefarious and totally unnecessary. Intellectual Property laws need massive overhaul and global sign-off. No country/state should be able to dilute the law, nor undermine it.

Never gonna happen though, because it's highly doubtful China would sign any global copyright laws.
I see. Thanks for the clarification.
This surely is the realm of trademark laws and not copyright laws. In which case, the way it works in France is : it prevents others from calling a similar product the same name. If it is a product from a different industry (ie not a sex toy) it won't apply. And they absolutely can't prevent people from using the word in conversations.

The reason they were able to sue another shop is because that other shop also sold sex-toys. Fortunately, they have a legitimate defence: this is a common word that describes the product or its use so it can't be trademarked (eg: a cleaning company can't trademark the word ""clean"").

We can only wait and see what the judgement will be."	ou5ci6	NonBinary	109	1.0	2021-07-29 20:15:05
I was today years old when I realized the NLOG sub is full of terfs.	"TW: transphobia

I don’t really participate in that sub, but it’s been around forever and I’ve seen funny posts occasionally. Today someone posted some trans inclusive memes to express that the sub is trans friendly, but the comments turned out to be filled with blatant transphobia and people disagree that what they’re saying is transphobic… there were a few people calling them out, but it’s just rampant. I cannot believe multiple people had the audacity to say that “some girls just claim they’re nonbinary for attention or bc they don’t like girly things and that they aren’t really nb” ….. and the worst part is they don’t realize how fked up and transphobic that is. I literally even received a classic TERF reply from an “ext-trans” person to really sell the invalidation of NB folks… I’m utterly disgusted rn. Just blatant bigotry in broad daylight. Idk why I’m surprised, but it’s shocking to say the least and mods & admins to address it asap bc that shit is hate speech."	"I find most subs that exist to ""poke fun at"" or ""call out"" people are pretty toxic.  It attracts people who want to judge and invalidate.
I don’t know what NLOG is but even in trans spaces, I’ve bumped into TERFs who are bigoted towards non-binary people. NERTs? Non-binary Exclusionary Radical Trans-binaries?
What sub? Either way sounds horrible
the entire concept of that sub is horrendously sexist anyway. i understand that many of the people posted there are saying sexiest things due to internal misogyny but it's still literally a sub dedicated to mocking women
I just looked the post up out of cururisty and omg it's disgusting how hateful people can be for no reason. I've been in the sub for a while but had no idea it was full of bigots.

Also a similar thing happened to me when someone on reddit moment posted about someone saying not to buy hogwarts legacy and all the comments were saying how dumb that is because she's rich anyway. Just don't support a transphobe it's that simple
Just something to keep in mind -- social media in this day and age is skewed towards conservative and reactionaries, they hold a lot of influencing power to be able to be seen on the internet. But that doesn't mean they are the majority of people, especially on reddit where only a small portion of the population exists. 

& they say we have echo chambers... ;)
There is absolutely zero benefits to identifying as nonbinary other than being true to yourself. A woman can get loads more positive attention than a nonbinary person, idk why this idea of ""girls just pretend to be nb"" comes from. Do they inherently believe being trans is super cool themselves and therefore think people must fake it??
I deeply hate it. It makes me even sadder that unfortunately people who detransition are so important to the trans conversation and their gender journey has value and is important to hear and listen to. 

But the very act of detransition makes them so so susceptible to being preyed upon by TERFs and conservatives. It makes me sad and angry. So many people just lost to that hate and that vitriol 😔
It’s a nice post and I think the images were funny why are people upset the sub is being inclusive 🫣
That whole shitshow yesterday was frustrating. I wanted to make a remark on it but couldn’t come up with anything substantial other than explaining in a super plain way what androgynous was to someone. It’s super insulting when people want to discredit us as “women who just want attention” or some crap like that. Damnit, I’m not a woman and I’m not a man either.
Not like other girls? Yeah I hate that place. Awful concept.
I had a coworker who I didn't even know she was Trans until she said something I came out as non binary and go by they/them but she said I had to be one or the other and I invalidate all the hard work she put into transitioning.
[removed]
I never really engaged with it before, outside of a comment or two over the years either joking about unrelated stuff or serious discussion or question. But I definitely see what you’re saying now. It’s gross and I can’t believe people who think that’s okay exist… ugh
Those types of subs need heavy handed moderation or they turn into a shitshow, the vast majority that get popular end up quarantined or banned. Even with heavy moderation the mods have to play whack a mole because the -phobes and -ists are always posting.

Granted, this typically only occurs at ones aimed in areas where the line between laughing at crazy and punching down is very thin. Subs making fun of incels for example don't have the issue as bad because there isn't as big of a line of people eager to make fun of cis-het-men.  While places like ""holdmycosmo"" ""NLOG"" ""the various cringe subs"" will quickly devolve to ""look at Minority group that does literally anything that's not ""normal"" + calling them a slur"" without mods there 24/7
Non-binary exclusion is mainly a thing with truscum/transmed people.

Seeing as non-binary falls under the trans umbrella (even though not all enbys identify as trans), wouldn't a non-binary excluding TERF just be a TERF?
/notliketheothergirls
The mods finally locked the post, but a bunch of transphobic shit is still up. That’s the worst, when it’s people pretending to not be bigoted, but they’re bigoted af still.
r/notlikeothergirls i believe
Exactly. It’s awful
Did they delete the post? Looked pretty far back and didnt see anything about nb people.
I’m 35 and my dad designed computer chips. I assure you, I was online exploring the internet since it was created and have been traumatized by vile stuff I saw on rottendotcom and similar sites like everyone else in that era, but invalidating someone’s entire gender identity was always disgusting and vile. It’s not and never was “just slightly offensive.” Transphobia has always been dangerously harmful and bigoted and it’s ignorant af and stupid for you to even defend it. Also, you apparently have no idea that digg is what inspired and ultimately became Reddit, not 4chan.
TERF is definitely still applicable, but [exorsexism or enbyphobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_non-binary_people) are generally used terms for hatred toward nonbinary people specifically

Being nonbinary at work	"Early last  year I asked HR about changing my gender on employee record to Nonbinary. They did some research and said it couldn’t be done unless I had some official document with it legally listed as my gender, which I don’t since it isn’t legally recognised in the UK.   


Since then, without me asking, the lovely company I work for have:

Added nonbinary as a choice on all the staff surveys they do.

Ran a mandatory diversity and inclusion course for all staff, with a big section on nonbinary.

And are adding pronouns to the signatures of our emails.   


Yay, for great support."	"I came out to my PI at the end of a work-related email and he just put the whole thing in quotes and answered ""OK"". I have not been deadnamed at work since and everyone in my group knew the second I stepped foot in the lab on the next monday, without me having to tell anyone.
Lovely!
Woohooo!!! I'm not out at work bc I work in a halfway house with a lot of older women but there's like a few trans clients and staff and theyre like... Hmm...u use a different name to ur legal name... and u dress like it's laundry day every day... Friend? So I'm j vibing lol
Great!"	10sjvh3	NonBinary	107	1.0	2023-02-03 13:06:26
Well, I guess I'm out now	"The company I work for has an equity, diversity, and inclusion committee. We meet monthly to discuss ways to make the company better. When we have new people, we go around the room and introduce ourselves and state our pronouns. I always lie and say ""she""... until today. I took a deep breath in and said ""they"". It was terrifying and exciting.
So now I'm fully out at work. [mild internal screaming]"	"Congrats! I’m guessing that took a lot of courage. Hope it goes well
Good for you but forcing people to say their pronouns is shitty praxis, because you may force people to out themselves before they're ready or need to lie. Give people the option and hope ""ally"" cis people do so it seems normal but not required. If you feel up to it I think that would be important to bring up next month, because the practice of the committee is doing the opposite of what it is (in a well-meaning way) trying to do. 
That's great!  Good for you for doing it.
Thanks! They're a good group, so I think it will go well. 
I agree that forcing people to say their pronouns is kinda crappy. Maybe I will bring it up before the next meeting. 
I suggest shifting from asking what your pronouns ""are"" to asking what pronouns the group may refer to you by. That takes the identity out of it, and makes it something that's allowed to be contextual.
Good :) Pins are also a good idea, I think. "	9n51v0	NonBinary	100	1.0	2018-10-11 00:19:28
Accidentally caused something amazing!	"A month ago, after some encouragement from my boss who turned out to be super supportive  I emailed my hr dept about coming out and transitioning at work. They called a week or two after to ask a couple questions that left me slightly hopeful but I wasn't sure what the future would hold. I certainly wasn't expecting what happened.

My HR dept wrote brand new policy to help my transition and to protect all other trans people that should work at my company in the future from discrimination. The language is inclusive of nb genders. I'm so touched and hopeful I don't know what to do with myself. This time next month I'll be full time me at work, complete with my they/them pronouns. My chosen name will on my nametag, on my work email, and in our records system. 

Happy Pride everyone."	"That's awesome! When I came out, I went from the golden ""boy"" who could do no wrong to the company scapegoat and was eventually fired with no reason given and no severance. Now I work jobs that pay about 1/3 of what I used to.

I'm sorry I don't mean to come across as bitter. I'm truly happy that companies like yours exist. 🖤
I'm glad things worked out so well for you, I see people like you as those that pave the way for the rest of us. Because of you the world and the future grows just a little brighter... congratulations and happy pride :) 
I'm sorry that happened to you. I'm glad that I spoke up to hr about it and it resulted the way it did. Now other trans people that may work for my company don't have to be so afraid. "	8v3mw7	NonBinary	96	1.0	2018-06-30 17:57:24
Cyberpunk 2077 character creator drops male and female options in favor of 'body type'. CD Projekt is eliminating binary gender options in order to make the game more inclusive.		"You guys should see the reactions from Gamers tm. It's so fucking funny.
I was psyched for this game just based on the strength of the Witcher. Now I'm over-the-moon. What's interesting is that gamergate chuds love this company and are largely exited for this project. What if this game turned out to be a major touchstone for both their subculture and ours? That would be... interesting.
Oh **FUCK** yes
[deleted]
Interesting perspective (Edit: interesting because I am *surprised* by this move by CDPR). I am coming form the opposite direction - after having played the Witcher for a bit, I stopped for various reasons and felt a bit torn about the (admittedly) cool-looking Cyberpunk 2077. But I have to say that this news does make me reconsider my reservations! Now I'm really interested again lol

My Workplace's Inclusivity Project is Regressive and Terrible!	"My workplace is pissing me off.  They're trying to be inclusive but they're doing it in ways that are the complete opposite!



As part of championing diversity, my workplace has begun a so-called Gender Intelligence Initiative.  Frankly, it's horrifying.  The entire premise is a gender-essentialist exercise in biological determinism - think ""men are from Mars, women from Venus"" levels of bad parading as so-called equality.  It revolves around the idea that men and women are in some ways fundamentally different and uses stereotypes as examples.  They literally included the well-debunked ""female brain at rest"" vs ""male brain at rest"" CT scans in the presentation.  The talks and information presented was so bad that it literally led to people saying things like ""so that's why my husband never listens!  Hahaha men!"" and ""see I told you women never make any sense!"".  



They presented a made-up and exaggerated example of a bell curve difference in men and women, and I don't even know how to being yelling that There Is No Single Bell Curve For Who You Are!  If you get tested for spacial awareness, visual tendencies and all the other things we bell-curve by gender you may trend in a certain direction in some of them but chances are if you average out all of them you may well end up more vaguely defined in the middle damnit!  We don't know!  And we still don't have a conclusive nature vs nurture answer on any of this!  To say nothing of Gender not being the same bloody thing as sex!


 
At first I thought it was just going to be like what most employers do around these sort of times - a bunch of talks and presentations about how We Value Inclusivity followed by business-as-usual.  So I ignored it.  But now it seems like this is something that people in my office are trying to take forward and to start building ideas around.  
 


I don't know how to explain that their attempt to be Gender Intelligent and inclusive is actually making me feel excluded and unsafe without outing myself.  If this is the direction the company is moving in then being public about my gender identity being constructed mostly from vague hand-wavey gestures and shrugging would probably be an unsafe idea.  Frankly, my RadFem Senses are tingling something fierce.


 
Can anyone suggest accessible scientific studies, literature and articles debunking this stuff?  I asked, but the people leading the initiative apparently didn't have direct links to any studies or specific scientific articles, or any recorded sources to link me to, or I'd already be sitting here with a highlighter pen working on it all!"

**Sex differences in psychology**

Sex differences in psychology are differences in the mental functions and behaviors of the sexes, and are due to a complex interplay of biological, developmental, and cultural factors. Differences have been found in a variety of fields such as mental health, cognitive abilities, personality, and tendency towards aggression. Such variation may be both innate or learned and is often very difficult to distinguish. Modern research attempts to distinguish between such differences, and to analyze any ethical concerns raised.

***

**Causes of transsexuality**

The study of the causes of transsexuality investigates gender identity formation of transgender people, especially those who are transsexual. Transsexual people have a gender identity that does not match their assigned sex, often resulting in gender dysphoria. The causes of transsexualism have been studied for decades.

The most studied factors are biological.

"""Hey Guys, Girls, and Everyone In Between"" Gets On My Nerves!"	"It drives me nuts when people say that phrase to a group of people, in an attempt to be inclusive. As an Agender person, I constantly feel excluded and invisible in this gender-obsessed world. Phrases like that leave out people like me. 'm not ""in between"" somewhere on some gender scale. If people wanna be inclusive, they can just say ""Hi everyone"". Short, simple, and actually inclusive."	"I like the Thomas Sanders one: ""Guys, Gals, and non-binary pals""
That does sound irritating. Why do we need to bring gender into a greeting at all? I’m a teacher and my professors immediately urged us to stop the “good morning boys and girls” stuff. They weren’t even thinking of inclusion, they just didn’t want us dividing our class community along gender lines.
There's a few times when I think being consciously inclusive is good. Before everything shut down I would volunteer at teen events at a library in the American Deep South where many teens did not have affirming family, so using Thomas Sanders' ""guys, gals, and non-binary pals"" may be the only time off the internet those teens had someone positively acknowledge them. Outside of a group that I know needs affirmation, though, I agree the best thing to do is just be neutral, like with ""everyone.""
I listen to a podcast where he says boys and girls and friends beyond the binary. I love it.

(Sleep With Me is the podcast, it helps me fall asleep)
I watched a YouTube video in which the intro said “guys gals and anti-gender agents” and as an agender person I was like “lol haven’t heard that before but I like it”
“everyone” is so much shorter and doesn’t make nonbinary people sound like fairytale creatures
I agree with you about the ""everyone in between""

There are other ways of phrasing it that work better though.
Yep, especially those who seem awfully proud about being inclusive too.
When i address people I usually just say “friends”, “folks”, or “everyone” depending on the scenario
I’m actually in the process of getting my masters to teach, and usually say “boys, girls everyone in between and otherwise inclined”, would that also come off badly?
How do you feel about 

Ladies, Gents, those between and beyond? 

Though honestly I just use everyone most of the time
I say 'Hello humans'.
Lads, ladies, legends tends to be what I say as a (mostly) joke in places I know are friendly...

In a more professional environment I use ladies, gentlemen and distinguished guests which seems to work
As one of my favorite youtubers from another community says ""lads, ladies, and nonbinary daisies""
i just say “hey y’all!”
id say my friends and enemies 

that includes everyone, all the people i love like and hate all in one
That's like when I have to explain what Pansexual means to my relatives.

Me: I'm attracted to every gender.

Them: but there's only two.  Isn't that bisexual?

Me: 😭😔
Yeah, it does feel a little exclusionary, but at least they’re trying. What about ladies and gentlemen, enbies and gentle-thems?
I like this one: ""Hello there, mortals... and non-mortals""
I was going to comment this.
You could go the Tik Tok route and call ourselves ""Enbies"" (NBs) because that won't confuse people.
Is there a reason to address them by gender? Just curious. I’m a teacher too, and depending on my class context, I’ve used “friends”, “scholars”, or just “everybody”. I also love calling them “writers”, “readers”, “mathematicians”, etc, based on what kind of learning we’re working on.
I say hey y'all with my friends 😊
Ugh I'm sorry 😔 they don't understand that there are more than 2 genders. And I reckon they don't know that there are more than 2 sexes. but it seems to me that those concepts would go way over their heads.
Great minds think alike!
Oh I love that I’m totally stealing the writers/scientists thing! 

And I suppose there really isn’t, if only that it’s fun to say like that, and it reinforces gender isn’t a binary? But I’m a binary trans dude so I’m no expert
Yeah they're still at the stage where gender/sexuality means the same to them.

I don't think they're ever going to get it.

My aunt who I thought was the most progressive literally thinks that a Bisexual (and I suppose any polysexual or Pansexual) person is just a nymphomaniac.

Like her reasonaning is 'they need to just pick one or the other, not both.'

I am so jealous of people with supportive family.
I haven't even explained what nonbinary is because of comments like her's.
It’s definitely cool to find ways to reinforce the expansiveness of gender. I’m not NB myself so I’m not exactly an expert either, though!
Reasons for: positive recognition in areas where students may not have supportive home lives.

Reasons against: dividing a class by gender is still division. Learning is a group effort, no need to subdivide your team. I'm pretty sure I've read studies where girls performed worse on tests when they're reminded about their gender before hand, but I'm not sure if I'm remember it right.
I haven't tried to give a Non-Binary 101 class to my parents. It's hard trying to talk to them about anything important, but I'm pretty sure that at least my mom knows I'm not a man or woman. They know enough to know not to call me ""she/her"". They tap dance around my pronouns, calling me by my chosen name so they can avoid ""they/them/theirs"". Fortunately they've been trained to use my chosen name, and they do so 100% of the time. But talking to them about sex, gender, and sexual orientation? Nah.
I’ll check that out thanks! Had no idea!
Yeah, the moment I came out I was invisible.  It's like I fell from grace or something."	gld3yr	NonBinary	84	0.97	2020-05-17 10:19:46

The most gender inclusive character creator in video games belongs to... a racing game!?	"I started playing Forza Horizon 5 today, and the character creator blew my mind. I didn't even know this racing game had a character creator; but it's amazing!

During the opening of the game you select your character from over a dozen character options, all of whom are diverse in skin tone and gender presentation. The options are presented all mixed together in one grid of images. Nothing is labeled or named.

After you pick an initial character, you select everything else about your character, from hairstyle & hair color, to prosthetics, voice, and pronouns (**YES Pronouns!)**) all without ***\*any\**** reference to sex or gender.

Lots of this has been done before, but the most amazing part is that the game has dozens upon dozens and dozens of names and nicknames to choose from for your character, which are all **included as part of the game's voiced dialogue**! But the game doesn't give you an option to pick a name at first if it finds out your name is on the list. And my name is on the list!

The game picked up my name (presumably from my Xbox account), and just put it into the dialogue! And there, on screen, was a character that appeared the presentation I want, being called **by my name**, and the dialogue is using the correct pronouns for them!

It was so euphoric I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. :-D

&#x200B;

AND, as an added bonus, the complete absence of reference to sex or gender in the character creator allowed for a teachable moment for me with my kids, as we were playing the game together. When one of them asked about the character, ""Are they a boy or a girl?"", I got to talk to my kids, albeit briefly, about gender; and how even though the character looked one way, they may be a girl, a boy, both, or neither; and it would be up to them (the character) to decide. :)"	"Wow! And here I thought Outer Worlds did a good job, this is great!
Nice! I love a good character creator. I hate racing games, though, so I'll probably miss this one. 

Another good one is Saints Row's character creator, which also has no idea of enforced gender. Chose your body, face, clothes and makeup however you like.
Battletech let's you pick pronouns including they/them and you aren't restricted in the character portrait options that you put with them
New world has a decent ENBY style to it. You can even choose they them pronouns.
Apparently the new Harry Potter MMO is going to be pretty inclusive, considering the setting and time period. Characters will be free to use voices and clothing and identify as a witch or wizard.

They're also not letting JK Rowling have any input.
I haven’t had a chance to play Outer Worlds yet. It’s installed on my Xbox, just haven’t had the time… so many great games in Game Pass!
Racing games are a mixed bag for me. Forza Horizon 5 has a lot of accessibility settings that can make the game more accessible to play. Like I could turn down the physics engine speed to make it easier for one of my kids to play a race. And you can also turn off some requirements for story progress, like having to beat certain races. So you can just enjoy the story and the cool cars.
I heard about that. Very cool. What really impressed me with Forza Horizon 5 is including the character’s pronouns and name in voice acted dialogue. That had to be so much work!
She’s still going to get money for it so like… wouldn’t recommend supporting it
Exactly she’ll still get royalties from it and use the changes she doesn’t agree with to voice her trash. 

It yet again amplifies her platform. 

If you want a truly inclusive wizarding experience check out a wizard of Earthsea and Ursulas other books as well! One of the first and foremost feminist sci-fo/fantasy authors.
Her platform is supported by hate-groups such as Twitter and the BBC. At least this makes her look foolish by attacking her own fans.

Obviously in an ideal world she'd be deported and have her IP seized and I'm still going to fight for that."	rlxxvf	NonBinary	76	1.0	2021-12-22 05:26:06
Found out today that my workplace only recognises 2 genders. Gonna initiate change and get that fixed!	"Rang HR today to get my gender changed, they put me through to payroll cause that's how they do it in the big green shed apparently (seriously if anyone around the world hasn't been to one of our sausage sizzles you haven't lived). Payroll were all like cool, we need some sort of supporting document. I said ok I'll get that, can you just tell me what gender options you have? They said male or female... 

We discussed how out dated our systems are. I told them don't worry about it, leave my gender how it is and I'll get the system fixed for you. I think they were shocked with how chill I was being about it. I'm now super excited that I get to badger HR about expressing that they're an inclusive workplace and yet only listing 2 genders. I love initiating change. I love challenging big (one of the biggest in Australia) retail to change how they operate. I'm going to have so much fun with this. 

Much love 🇦🇺🏳️‍🌈

Psi"	"Congrats, and kudos on the energy to fight! I keep going back and forth about looking forward to and dreading the day my state allows X on driver’s licenses — my workplace says you can use the bathrooms on your driver’s license (which is already an issue IMO, but a different one), but we most have binary bathrooms. The looking forward is it’ll be nice to have my real gender acknowledged, to get a more reasonable bathroom policy (that is, can use whichever you damned well want), and/or have more bathrooms designated gender-free. But I’m also dreading the fight, and what if they tell me I can’t use the binary gendered bathrooms of the gender I look like, they won’t change any existing bathrooms, and instead I have to go a long way out of my way to use gender-free bathrooms?
Have fun!
I definitely needed the sausage sizzle context  to place your employer, but I understood that reference! I’m excited for your future challenging fun times. As a person working for a (small, but rapidly outgrowing its systems) local business, I have not even begun to think about talking to anyone about gender markers. Heck, I’m not even totally out at work. (I have signs up for the observant, but I’m not exactly holding out hope) I wish you great success in your upcoming endeavour.
I am also happy and slightly disappointed haha. But then again, there's always another battle. I don't have to take on my own employer. But maybe I can find a way to help other businesses see the light?
They actually stipulate which bathroom you use? I can't imagine that.. I mean I've never tried to use the men's room but I don't think anyone would stop me. Can I fight your company as well?
I spoke in depth to a person from HR today that is actually in the LGBT+ community themselves. Apparently the person I spoke to at payroll either hasn't been informed or has no respect (They might be getting an angry phone call) but there is a way for them to leave the gender option blank and put into the notes that I'm Non-binary. They're also working on getting the whole system fixed so that anyone in the future can select 'other' and manually enter their gender.
I’m a public employee, it’s a rule for all buildings owned by the level of government that employs me, both for the employees and members of the public in our buildings. They don’t check IDs at the bathroom, like if a trans woman hadn’t corrected her license it’s not like they’d know and stop her and send her to the wrong bathroom, but it’s annoying to know this is the rule. I think their *intent* was to thread the needle between the liberal “everyone should use whatever bathroom they want” and the conservative/regressive “people should only use the bathroom that matches the genitals they were born with, and anyone who doesn’t fit those nice boxes doesn’t deserve to pee and should just hold it until they get a UTI / WHUT ABOUT THE WIMMINS AND CHILDREN AND PREDATORS IN TEH BATHROOOOOMZ??.!?!?”, but it’s really no better than “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” in effect. 

Another downside of being a public employee is that I’m going to be fighting the weight of the government to get this rule fixed once my state allows an X gender marker on licenses. But an upside is I’m unionized so if I’m not willing to fight it solo or to identify myself, I can ask the union to fight for or with me.
That’s amazing to hear. I’m both disappointed and happy for you, since you seemed totally excited to go to war and now are being deprived of that joy based on the fact that the battle has already happened.

Made a first for non-binary folks at my company	"Background: I work for an international transportation company. My division is in North America and I specifically work in their autonomous division. 




I needed to fill out a travel request form to travel for work to Ohio. The form says to use the information as it is on your legal ID. When I get to the gender part, there are only options for male and female. My ID says X. I inform my manager, he apologizes and contacts the person in charge of the form. She came back with the airlines didn't have other options. I found that hard to believe so I checked the airlines we fly with and they both had options outside of male and female, X and U for unspecified and undisclosed respectfully. I send her a message letting her know my issue and that airlines recognize my gender marker. She was really responsive and fixed the issue immediately. It's a shame I had to do the research on this simple matter myself, but hey I'm paving the way for this large corporation to being more inclusive and I think that's pretty fucking cool."	"**You** got to be the groundbreaker for your whole fucking company!

How awesome is that!?
i was informally consulted by a relative who's a funeral director about the way in which her company's registration software only allows deceased individuals to be categorized as male or female. i suggested looking into creating a third marker for 'x,' and it surprisingly went through! feels really good to be a part of this kind of change : )
You are paying the way for sure.  Just that bit of work, which will seem like a blip in time years from now, made the process easier for the thousands to come. Thank you."	pki3rq	NonBinary	62	0.99	2021-09-08 20:02:58
no you're not	"i am 60 yrs old & non-binary all my life .  my husband & kids have always known of my maleness.  however,  my mom argues with me -  bless her confused & biased heart .  
""you're not gay""-!!!!  and she is adamant.  I have tried many times to gently explain to her that my orientation isn't related to that;  she is fixated on sexuality  Personally I would love to have a female lover but that has so far eluded me.  My husband is a partner,  a business associate,  a comrade,  a trustee.  I didn't grow up in a free society.  My male/female self has been all inclusive .  I LOVE me as I am .  I am the embodiment of all gender.  I feel I am gender transcendent-  
i am not sure why I posted this except that with boobs and babies it is hard for ppl to grasp ME.  I am not angsty about their confusion but....  I suppose this is for other enby kindred out there to say it doesn't really matter what other ppl so or so not understand.  WE are amazing creatures.  We embody much magic .  Never try to stifle any part of you"	"It's always good to hear from older folks finding themselves and being happy. It's not like someone invented gender somewhere around 2010 and now suddenly every other kid is having a personal crisis because of it. We are and always have been marvelous creatures with a lot of different facets that can't be described simply as man or woman.

And there's absolutely no need to conform to people who don't understand that. Of course you can try to educate your mom, but if she doesn't get it, she doesn't get it. I tried with my parents, who are about your age, and they don't really get it either. But they're fine with me being me, if it makes me happy, and that's good enough for me.
This filled my heart so much. Thank you for this! Saved it for a rainy day when I need a little boost and this beautiful reminder 🖤

I regularly tell people ""I don't care how YOU see me I know who I am""

Agreed! Wonderful words you said. 😊
Thank you for this! What you said resonated so much with me. I love this and I love you!
To often, I feel we haven’t made much progress with gender identity. Then I read stories like this and think progress is not linear. It never was. Thank you for sharing your story.
This is a beautiful and powerful message! Thank you for sharing it with us. We are non-binary, we will not settle for a lie. We know who we are.
Thank you. Seeing older enbies makes me so happy and fulfilled because I do get down with people telling me enbies are brand new and never existed until now etc. so when older enbies come around I get to say HAH! We have been here forever!!

Should I ask my boss if I can use they / them pronouns at work before my co-workers?	"My company is generally trying to be inclusive. It’s a bigger company, and we had an event recently where I met members from another team we never interact with, and one of them uses she / they pronouns. I’ve gone by they /them pronouns for many years, but never in a workspace because it was easier not to. But two of my team members are friends of mine that have already asked about using they them because they saw my insta. 

At this point I think I am going to ask my team to start using they / them pronouns. Should I start with our supervisor though? I’m a little worried because our supervisor, very sweet lady, is also very religious (Christian). I think she would be fine, but I’ve never come out in a work space before and I don’t know what the right steps are.

I would also like to note that this is my first time not being the only gay person on my team. Nearly 1/3 of my team is gay (including me)."	"You should not ask. You should tell. You don't need anyone's permission. You just need to tell them so they know.
I agree with u/JustABabyBear. You don't need anyone's permissions to be who you are so don't ask (as that would give the impression that your boss has any say in your identity, which she most certainly doesn't have). Tell them if you feel comfortable doing so.
I announced I use they them pronouns during an introduce yourself presentation for the entire department and then put they/them in my email signature 😂. You don’t need permission for basic respect. 

If you’re really worried about your supervisor, you might want to let HR know that you’re non-binary before your supervisor just so there’s a record in case of discrimination. With how many team members are also gay I think you should be fine though.
I'd echo what others have said about ensuring gender identity is a protected category where you work. Here's what I sent to my supervisor when I did this:

""I wanted to check in with you on some best practices. In my personal life, I recently came out as non-binary and have switched to exclusively they/them pronouns. I'd like to communicate that change to our team and maybe provide some FAQ's about how to use them, what to do if you mess up, etc. Is there a preferred procedure I should use? Would you like me to loop in HR? I'd like this to be chill as possible, so your insight would be super helpful.""

Edit: To be clear, I wasn't asking permission to use them (already had them in my email signature, told my closer coworkers, etc.), I was asking about best practices for sharing them more broadly since I went from she/they to they/them. Good luck!
No.

Going to a superior who is religious to ask permission is (but shouldn't be) like asking to be denied and then constructively dismissed.

I would suggest first starting with your friends on the team who asked about using they/them. You have strong allies there, already.

Go with your team first. They'll most likely have no problem, except time to get used to it and all the mistakes that happen during that time.

Then, if your Christian boss takes issue (possible - was she at the event, did she meet/react to the person who uses she/they?) you at least have your team behind you.

A manager is not going to survive an entire team united against them. So start with your team, and don't give your manager a choice.

I'd also reach out to the other employee and ask how they did it, and if they have any tips or supports.

I'd say since you have other queer members on your team, you'll probably be just fine.

Look at it this way: if your supervisor was the homophobic kind of Christian, would she still be working for a company attempting inclusion? (And yeah sometime ppl will stay bc they think it's a fad topic to fade away or they're too old to change)
I would go to HR over your boss. You have a coworker who uses she/they pronouns so this would not be the first convo HR has had around gender identity. If your boss doesn’t handle it well, HR in theory would step in for no other reason than to protect the company and avoid a lawsuit. 

Only come out at work if you are comfortable doing so. No one can tell you whether or not to come out. It does sound like your friends at work are supportive so you do have a support system with them.
I would make sure you reach out to your HR team as well to let them know. Generally theyre not your friend, but when it comes to potential gender discrimination they can be helpful.   


All that said, you should confirm the gender identity is a protected category in the state where you work. If it isnt, and your boss decides to be an ass, you wont have any protection.
I came out to my team and asked them to use they/them pronouns for me. My manager seems to forget every time we talk even though I wear very large pronoun pins on my lab coat. (Sha had a stroke about a year ago so I’m not sure if that’s what’s up?) 

But the religious coworkers most of them are trying, and seem to have a very hard time for some reason. But most of my immediate coworkers I work day to day with are pretty good at it!
These are your pronouns, you don't need permission. Just announce it's what you want to use.
I agree with others! When I changed pronouns and my name at work I emailed my boss on a Friday after work and said that I will be going by *new name and pronouns* starting Monday morning and how did he feel it was best we alerted the office. My workplace is support supportive so he answered right away (addressing me by my chosen name) and said he would send an email out to everyone on my behalf, including our board members and people we work with outside the office). Personally, that was best case scenario since I literally did none of the work besides telling him. I hope whatever your best case scenario is, you get it ☺️
Yes, you should tell your coworkers and supervisors how to refer to you. It only makes sense. Imagine meeting someone and giving them the wrong name..also, I don't remember the Bible banning they/them pronouns...
I first told the HR leader at my job I was changing my name and pronouns, she sent an email out to all the leaders informing them of my change and gave me a new name tag w my pronouns on it. Everyone caught on pretty quick. Took the older people some time to adjust but everyone was very kind and respectful. Thankfully I work somewhere where there’s a lot of non binary coworkers so it wasn’t too abnormal for my team. (I work at Target)
So I am not a lawyer, but FYI my understanding is you don't need a union to engage in concerted activity that you can't be punished or fired for, just one other person. 

Probably more of a last resort thing. I wouldn't ask for permission first though, I'd check your employee handbook, presumably find nothing about it, and assume that it's fine since it doesn't affect your ability to do your job, and just start telling people, with the support of friends.
Agreed :-) One good reason not to ""ask"" is that it makes it very difficult to know what to do next if they say ""no"". So don't give them the choice, make it so that if they don't accept you, it's them that has the issue.
I agree with the baby bear
Normally I agree with this thinking (friends, family, etc), but gender identity is not a protected category in most US states and OP could be discriminated against or fired with little recourse if the conversation does not go well. While there are federal protections, state level laws are generally more important due to accessibility of courts and speed.

I was so relieved. Their last school did not and my poor child came home and copped off his beautiful long curly hair because the kids were ruthless, and that was kindergarten. This school district is so much more inclusive. They even left room for me to let them know that he is fine still using the boys restroom, but can get confused as a girl when he wears his dresses and has his hair braided. 

I am really hoping this year is easier for him."	Aw, I'm sorry your child had to deal with the intolerance. Since you're at a new school now, and they included that, hopefully he will have an easier time.	cqfvhb	NonBinary	55	0.94	2019-08-14 21:03:53

Got attacked for using the term “womxn” in a comment	"Kind of having a bit of an anxiety attack with how hostile this person was out of nowhere for a reason I never imagined (was already having a **really** bad month). I use both *women* and *womxn* but used *womxn* as a blanket term and this person told me to fuck off and that *woman* isn’t a dirty word that needs to be censored when I was censoring nothing. I tried explaining a lot of us feel *womxn* is more fitting for ourselves personally, hoping that might explain things even better, but I got downvoted more.

I truly hate being nonbinary sometimes. I just wanna exist without people making strange and hostile assumptions. I’ve started avoiding even making (clearly not transphobic) jokes about being nonbinary because it’s led me to being dog-piled by transphobes.

EDIT: btw not saying all nonbinary people fall under the women/womxn umbrella. I’m just frustrated I can’t use an inclusive term that usually fits me (genderfluid) without some people getting angry over it.

EDIT: so I’ve read here some people have genuine problems with the term. I’m looking at alternatives… Maybe Galactian Alignments or something?

EDIT 3: Hi, everyone. First I wanna apologize that I was so bad with my explanations and ended up saying things that turned out to be triggers for people. I had been skipping sleep and having anxiety attacks and I shouldn’t have been online at all. I’m sorry I tried touching on such complicated topics when in such a bad mindset. Although I got some sleep I’m still not feeling very good due to accumulated sleep deprivation/fatigue and recent stresses, I’ll try to explain things better really quickly. I’m so sorry if it still is clumsy and hurts anyone but hopefully it’ll prevent more harm.

I was thinking about nonbinary/trans people who *they themselves* identify with the term using it for the most part and not applying it to all nonbinary people; nonbinary people can sometimes be feminine-aligned (might use those terms in the future—trying something hopefully understandable) but not all are and none of us are “woman lite.” Also, I want to say that woman *is* a term that can apply to more than just cis women; although I’m (multigender) not quite comfortable with the term on its own for myself I’ve seen plenty of nonbinary and of course trans women who like to use it for themselves. Also, I’m sorry I used a term TERFs have been using… I heard it was created and used for the reason I used it but didn’t do any research on it and I feel so fucking awful I triggered people. I’m so so sooooo very sorry. I really hope not to hurt anyone and I will absolute avoid it and any other terms that you say could be harmful. I think I might not be in a place to do much serious discussion but I’ll try to respond to a couple comments. I’m so sorry again and thank you for your patience with me."	"As a non binary person I hate womxn. It’s completely fine if you were using it for yourself. But if you’re using it for others who don’t identify as women it’s misgendering.
I think womxn has unfortunately been kind of messed up by saying it’s to be inclusive towards ‘trans women’ not fem-aligned non-binary/gender fluid/genderqueer people- this latter usage (which sounds like what you are using) makes a lot more sense and is actually inclusive, but the former is just transmysogeny. But saying “women and fems” is also problematic in its own way. So idk about the most inclusive way to say what you were saying. 🤷

Either way, the person didn’t need to be a jerk about it. I’m really sorry they did that. You don’t deserve that negativity for speaking to your own experience ❤️
I think why they reacted the way they did was because a lot of terfs have claimed the word and will use it to describe all afab non-binary people.
I've seen womxn used much more as a way for feminists who identify with the term to refer to themselves without including the word ""man"". I've never really thought of it as a term for trans or nb people. That said use whatever words you want to describe yourself. It's easy for people to get their knickers in a twist on the interwebs.
So I used to use this term because lol overt misandry was my brand in high school. I also have an awesome habit of being friends with trans women. I used this word via text with a couple of them early on into our friendships and both of them expressed not only discomfort but also gave me historical context for the word. The Term womxn has roots in TERFism, which is trans-exclusionary radical feminism (not really that radical if it doesn't support all women but whatever lol). Once these two amazing women educated me on the word I was ignorantly using cuz it looks cool, I stopped using it because I didn't want to invalidate their existence.

I'm sorry to hear your anxiety alarms are going off; that's valid. Now you need to work through it and come back to things with a clear mind once the feeling is manageable again. One thing I notice a lot of people get wrong when it comes to conflict resolution is that they allow their emotions keep them from directly addressing or analyzing the situation, thus keeping them stuck in a state of anxiety with no resolution - and oftentimes further making the person who brought up the issue feel invalidated or manipulated by the reactionary emotions of the person they're addressing.

So, vibe. Take care of your immediate needs. Get out of panic mode; you're safe. Consider the possibility that, while you're having a bad day (or week or month or even your yeeeearrrrr), that other person might be having a bad time too. Trauma responses are everywhere. All we can do is control how we act. Even when people are mean to us we have to maintain responsibility for our actions and reactions.
I'm not sure you should use it. If you want to refer to people with uteruses just say that.
Changing the spelling or the meaning of established words is fine in exclusively LGBT circles. However, outside of those, it's usually better to write 'women' than 'womxn'.

People get upset quite easily when they feel the language they use is being appropriated or re-defined by others. Same goes for the word 'lantinx' which most latin people find offensive.

I appreciate that womxn is supposed to be inclusive, but it probably does more harm that good the LGBT movement.

Still, its no excuse to be an asshole to people over.
Saying you were censoring the word is...kinda silly? Don't most people use the star (\*) to censor words? I've never seen someone use an x to censor a letter. I have no opinon on the term 'womxn' other than it doesn't fit me. Seems like it a word you find comfort in though, so that matters. Sorry you went through this.
do you mind if i ask what the context was? were you using womxn in place of women in general or referring to yourself…?
I was under the impression it's taken from feminist graphic design where e is crossed out red to ""remove men from women"" and it's used by man-hating radical feminists in English...

For an inclusive term it feels a bit too supportive of NBi being ""quirky woman lite"", but you do you, some of us NBi people are, in fact, quirky woman light, regardless of assigned sex. You should be allowed to use your own labels.
Womxn is unfortunately so widely misused that I'm not sure it's recoverable.  My understanding is that it was originally coined by black feminists to mean ""woman but specifically not talking about the predominant white supremacist patriarchal concept of womanhood"". It was then (as I understand it) explicitly expanded by its original coiners to be available for any woman who is actively excluded from the prevailing concept of womanhood.

Then white cis people started using it in two different new ways, 1: as ""women and trans women"", and 2: as ""afab people""- both obviously transphobic.

Not sure I've seen your use of the word anywhere before- it's clearly far from the transphobic which cis version but it's also not quite the same as what I understand is the original meaning.

Also to note: ""womyn"" is the radfem/terf-coined term \*not\* womxn. (Though I have seen some terfs use womxn in the same way they use womyn- but that is just another example of misuse.)
I understand that a label can help someone feel more comfortable with their identity, but for me, I don’t like them. I’m queer, and I’m nonbinary. For me, going beyond that seems unnecessary. No matter what I call myself, I am the same person. A label won’t change my gender or orientation, so why use them?
You have the right to use whatever terms you like for yourself. However, it is important to note that womxn, like womyn, has roots in transmisogyny, and is pretty popular with TERFs. Like a trans woman identifying as a ""trap"" or a gay man as a ""faggot,"" you still have the right to use the term for yourself, just probably not for others, and odds are you will still get people lashing out because of the associations.
I hate the term because it feels like I’m just considered “woman lite” but if it fits you, I don’t think people should be policing that
Heard the phrase “marginalized genders” used recently as a sort of umbrella inclusive phrase (referring to women and nonbinary and/or trans folks), could be a good alternative?
That word makes me uncomfortable. I consider myself feminine aligned because of my presentation and similar societal experiences to woman but I don't indentify as a woman at all, so I like Lunarian. Its not problematic at all and sounds nice.
I hate it. Transwomen are women, so there is no need for a magic de-womanising ‘inclusive’ word for women. And if anything womxn is only suitable for demigirls as even I, feminine a lot, would hate to be referred to as anything remotely woman-y
The person going off about ""censoring"" the word woman was probably a TERF or at least regurgitating TERF bullshit.

But there are some genuine issues with using ""womxn."" For starters, it doesn't really mean anything definitively.

People who use ""womxn"" could be talking about

• cis women and trans women

• Fem aligned Nonbinary people

• AFAB people

• people who look somewhat feminine.

So it's just not a very good term. It's a situation of 'just say the people you mean.' it's like when people say ""femme presenting"" when they mean ""AFAB."" I'm not femme presenting, but people usually mean me when they say that. Womxn is similar. I'm not woman lite, or woman adjacent but someone would say that expecting me to fit into that box.
Hi, y’all. I just left an edit in my post apologizing for my blunders yesterday and trying to explain things better; I hope it will prevent more harm from potentially happening. Despite getting some sleep I’m still physically exhausted and not in a good place mentally so I think that I will have to take a break from serious/complicated discussion but if there’s any problems I promise I will work on them. I feel so horrible I said things that were triggers for people and I don’t want to do that again. Thanks for all your input and patience and I’m so so sooooo sorry for my ill-considered and harmful words.
Okay so I know I should have been sleeping hrs ago and I’m too tired to really read this but this Galactian Alignments post looks super promising for inclusive but not problematic alternatives. Hopefully my tired brain isn’t being weird, does this make sense?

https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignments
Okay a) yes yes yes. The only place I typically comment about being NB is on this sub. People are dumb and it reeaaallly shows how new NB/queerness in gender is in our culture still.

B) I had not heard of womxn but I really like it. But also I typically identify more masculine and I kinda like wxman better…huh. Might need to play with some language some more!

Thank you for bringing this word to my attention.

Fuck the haters. 💖 You are awesome just the way you are!
Shitty people sound loud because they're shouting, there aren't many of them
I've never seen this word before. People seem to hate change, and find introducing concepts that go against their world view akin to hostility. Words become a battlefield, instead of being what they should be: A bridge between us that creates understanding.
People are weird on the internet. It's not you. It's them.
Why do you feel more conformed to womxn rather than women? Obviously we all know the stereotype and characteristics of a women and obviously you dont feel like you fall directly under that term, but what is womxn and why does do you feel that this womxn umbrella covers u?
Oh yeah I meant women/womxn for people who feel it fits. Definitely not all enbies are womxn. Fuck, at certain times I’m not sure it quite fits me in the moment lol
This, basically.

Womxn being used to mean ""inclusive of trans women"" is problematic in that it implies that ""women"" is *not* inclusive of trans women.
Thank you I appreciate it 😭
Can you please explain why ""women and femmes"" is problematic? 
It's my understanding that some people identify as femme but the word ""woman"" doesn't feel good for them, such as nonbinary femmes who don't quite feel like a woman
Seconding this. I've also seen them spell it womyn
It’s super weird I always heard it as word meant to be specifically trans-inclusive. I don’t know if maybe there’s some sort of subculture overlap that made my experience different but hearing that some people have used it in a bad way is…oof. Like based on the person telling me to fuck off’s comment I highly doubt that’s what they were concerned about but will be looking for other alternatives.

ETA: I’m now aware it sounds like could be considering trans people including trans women as specifically being womxn instead of women. Before learning radfems have used the term (now don’t plan to use it) I was meaning it to include people who identify with the term womxn especially some nonbinary. I am very sorry for not explaining myself well and **especially** sorry to anyone I hurt with my problematic words.
Same here
Thank you, I will finally go get some rest and hopefully feel better and see things better. Been dealing with grief coming back string today so I think I’m panicking easy, like even when something falls off my table. Thank you for your kindness and wise words! It actually made me feel a lot better! 💕
Ahoy greencraft96! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

So me used t' use dis term because blimey overt misandry be me brand in high school. me also have a awesome habit o' being crew wit' trans beauties. me used dis word via text wit' a couple o' 'em early on into our friendships n' both o' 'em expressed nay only discomfort but also gave me historical context fer thar word.

Once these two amazing beauties educated me on thar word me be ignorantly using cuz it looks shipshape, me stopped using it because me didn't want t' invalidate their existence.

I be yarr t' hear yer anxiety alarms be going off; that be valid. Now ye need t' duty through it n' come back t' things wit' a clear mind once thar feeling be manageable again. One thing me notice a lot o' scallywags get wrong when it hails t' conflict resolution be that they allow their emotions keep 'em from directly addressing or analyzing thar situation, thus keeping 'em stuck in a land o' anxiety wit' nay resolution - n' oftentimes further making thar scurvy dog who brought up thar issue feel invalidated or manipulated by thar reactionary emotions o' thar scurvy dog they're addressing.

So, vibe. Take care o' yer immediate needs. Get out o' panic mode; you be safe.

All our jolly crew can d' be control how our jolly crew act. Even when scallywags be mean t' us our jolly crew have t' maintain responsibility fer our actions n' reactions.
I wasn’t using it to mean people with uteruses, though. I was talking about anyone who feels woman or womxn fits them with how their gender works.
(Psst, this isn’t 100% directed at you but at anyone who wants to know. Many Latin people find lantinx offensive it’s because it just feels like it was made by a nonLatin person. As a person who is Latin and Hispanic I use lantine, it flows better. I don’t speak Spanish fluently but I believe there is a movement to use ‘e’ as the gendernuertal replacement over ‘a’ and ‘o’)
I know this whole thread is about pedantic dogpiling, and this is slightly off topic, but could you please consider not using ""triggered"" in the context of getting offended or upset? That's not what being triggered is to a person (like myself) who struggles with PTSD
Sadly, I still worry about how that feels for other people like me who don’t exactly feel women exactly fits us. Maybe I should just write women/womxn next time?
Thank you so much and yeah I did find it weird they though x was for censoring instead of *. I can’t recall anyone ever censoring their swear words by writing fxck or shxt lol
Well, I was basically using it as an umbrella term for women/womxn to save time but also be inclusive of those womxn fits but not women. Didn’t even think it would be taken the way it was and I definitely didn’t think a simple polite explanation would piss them off still at least in that sub. I don’t know if this is important (I’m half asleep) but basically it was a comment about fetishization especially affecting certain people and I did specifically mention trans and nonbinary people specifically in that comment along with other groups.
Well, it wouldn’t exactly be what I meant the term as (feminine-aligned might be the closest and easiest to understand term…I’m sorry my post/comments were not clear at all) but in the comment I was attack for I also mentioned trans people who aren’t women or feminine-aligned (trans men and many enbies) so it sounds like could have been useful an umbrella term in that and many other conversations about marginalization. I may ask trans men if I should add “and identities,” though, since they may not feel oppressed for their gender but just being trans. Thank you so much for your help. 💕
why would you go to such lengths to learn and use terms most people would have to google anyways? why do you need an alternative to woman when it includes trans women already? many non binary people don't want to be lumped in with men or women, that's why they are non binary. if you need to refer to them just call them non binary people ffs, this is just another weird round about way of gendering people who don't want to be gendered.
read the rest of the comments. it's a TERF term.
Hey you might want to read all the other comments explaining why the word is misgendering and how it has terf origins.
Yeah I mean there are definitely transfeminine who prefer womxn (especially some nonbinary transfeminine people and even many cis feminists prefer it for themselves now) but if someone is using women solely for cis people and womxn solely for trans/nonbinary people that’s a problem.
That people who can be fem like femboys aren’t necessarily women aligned and feminine non-binary people can feel it may be another way to set them as “women lite”. Also I know people who are like “I don’t even know what that means” and like how fem do you have to be to be included. I think most things people can say to divide people into groups can be potentially problematic and you just have to make your choice and be ready to explain. 🤷
This spelling has transphobic roots. I can’t remember exactly what but I think if you google it it would come up
Their reaction is definitely problematic and I'm sorry for how they reacted. I do want to let you know you're getting downvoted for this comment likely because it's really problematic segregating trans people to their own term when women already encompasses anyone who identifies as a woman, including trans people. I understand why you use womxn but keep in mind that it shouldn't be used to isolate trans women or any other trans people who identify as women.
Reiterating, the word has a history of violence toward trans women. Unless you're a trans woman I'd highly encourage you don't try and reclaim it. Ultimately, your choice. Just know you risk making people feel unsafe by using the term. And I promise you will find more descriptive words for yourself. Don't sweat it. Just make choices you're proud of.
well if you're referring to everyone who idenitfies with the term woman just say woman, spelling it weirdly just sounds like there are women and then these other people whom you could count in. but people either are or aren't women (not necessarily exclusively of course) and if they are, they don't need a weird spelling to fit in.
Why don't people just use Latin? Is there a reason?
I... actually didn't realise that word has connotations with PTSD. I'm sorry, and I'll be more careful using it in the future.
you should just write women if you aren’t in any gender related subreddit, due to the fact that most people (not even just cis, even other queer folk) perceive “womxn” as erasing womanhood in general/as a censored word.
what sub? why did you expect no pushback? was it a queer sub??

but, there’s your issue. you felt the need to say “womxn” when referring to trans/nonbinary people. trans women are women. not womxn. as others have said, this word is fine if you use it only for YOURSELF, because it is:

- used by terfs to exclude trans women
- used by radfems who want to take “man” out of “woman” (censoring the word basically)
- hardly ever used to refer to otherness, most queer people who aren’t women but are fem just say… they’re fem. its unusual to use “womxn”.

so yeah your issue was using it blanketly for everyone and not just yourself.

edit: to add, im a femby. i personally would HATE being called a “womxn”. id rather just be called a woman because to me, “womxn” is dehumanizing as it’s not even pronounceable as a word and puts me into some weird box.
Ah I see what you mean and I’m sorry I’m not very good at writing out my thoughts right now. Nonbinary people who aren’t specifically aligned with stuff are totally valid but I was thinking of this for people like myself who feel aligned in certain ways (I get what you mean about people having to Google it so this would only be in queer circles). I’m so sorry I’m so bad at explaining things. Please let me know if my words still doesn’t make sense and I’ll try to write them better when I back up.
Oh dang it. Oh well.
Good on you for looking at the info provided and being willing to adjust, lots of people just stick their fingers in their ears instead.

I find it's important to be aware of the history of a word, not just the original meaning. Many words which were originally straightforward later become slurs, meanings change, usage changes. Some really common ones for example are any word used to describe people of below average intelligence.

It is occasionally possible for marginalised communities to reclaim these words. But it is critically important not to describe *others* with such words if they do not explicitly identify with them, because the line between reclaiming a word and using a slur is razor thin.
Kinda rubs me the wrong way like the rest are ""men"" outside that group too. I don't know, maybe I'm looking too much into it.
I’m sorry to ask you this but does the edit for the comment make sense? I don’t want to upset anyone and I’m getting super worried.
Ah understood I’ll edit to explain I didn’t mean trans people as a whole only being “womxn” but any people who felt it fits them (especial nonbinary people). Thank you so much for the explanation.
Yikes I didn’t know that until today tbh. I’ve seen it used in my circles but will look for an alternative since there’s apparently people with genuine reason to hate it.

Edit: clarity (hopefully clarity? I need to go to bed so pretty tired)
Unfortunately, I am multigender and have had a lot of people say I’m “a woman, not nonbinary” so many times so I can get dysphoria with the term woman on its own. I start to think about people not denying the existence of other important parts of me and transphobic harassment I’ve gotten. As I mentioned in the edit to my post I think feminine-aligned might be a good possible umbrella term for those of us who feel it applies to them (women and some enbies.)

Btw I’m so sorry if my comment still isn’t very clear. This will probably be the last more complicated comment I can leave for now since I’m still not feeling very capable today and I think trying to answer many comments might cause me to stress out and get more muddled and say more clumsy and triggering things. I don’t want to hurt anymore people’s feeling like I did yesterday when I shouldn’t have been talking about such potentially triggering topics in such a state of mind. Thank you for your input and your patience with me.
Latin is the English word for Latino/a/e. I’ve only heard the people around me say they are Latin when speaking English.
No worries! Thank you, I appreciate it
I *do* use the term trans woman, but was just trying to be fast and inclusive. Tbh I’ve never heard of womxn being used in a TERF way before but I’ll try looking up some alternatives. Not sure I’m comfortable using fem in this case because I know a lot of people at least in my circles who find the term problematic as an umbrella term, so will have to look for something else. Also not sure I’m allowed to post the subreddit and I’m too tired to read all the rules again since I mix all the subreddits’ rules in my head but although it isn’t specifically about queer people there’s been a number of anti-transphobia posts in the past. I guess I may have gotten my hopes up too high though 😩

Edit: I’m thinking maybe Galactian Alignments as an alternative?
What is nonbinary to you?  If you identify as a woman that's fine.  But nonbinary woman seems contradictory. Imo.  I feel like most nonbinary folks don't 'align' with a male/female gender.  That's the point of nonbinary.
if you really cannot see how it’s problematic to refer to strangers with a non-pronounceable, radfem invented word, then i don’t know how to help you.
No, this is not true. I’m a genderfluid masc non-binary person with some ties to “man” as a gender, with varying intensity. Non-binary is not necessarily a third gender or 100% genderless. I’m not defending the term womxn btw, just saying that associating with a gender does not negate or invalidate someone’s non-binary identity.
There are incalculable numbers of ways to be nonbinary. Some terms that tend to fit me would be demigender, genderfluid, multigender, and lesbiangender but it’s hard explain exactly how in words. However I will say that I personally feel there’s a part to me that is basically ineffably I guess female-aligned (don’t know better terms yet) in a strong way at this point in my life. It doesn’t mean the other parts of my gender aren’t important though.

ETA: Gender Wiki lists a ton of different gender identities like these.

https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_Wiki
I understand that it’s problematic now that it’s explained. I just meant the reason I *did* use it was because I had thought the term was specifically made as a way to include nonbinary people. I’m sorry, I’m afraid I’m functioning on very little sleep after skipping sleep so I’m probably not reading or writing things out well.

EDIT: btw only meant nonbinary people who would consider themself in that category, not all or even most nonbinary people
I’m really sorry.
I'm not trying to be rude so forgive if it sounds like it.  If your identity is so heavily tied with being a woman, why not identify as a queer woman?  It still feels contradictory to me to say you're a binary nonbinary person.
yea, as a nonbinary person if you called me a ""womxn"" i would also tell you to go fuck yourself.
I’m gonna get some rest and hopefully be able to not mess up this. Again I’m sorry and thank you for your input, it is appreciated!
I’m also a sort of guy and then something I can’t even explain and the “female-aligned” part is also somewhat complicated. It changes throughout my life and definitely isn’t binary. Im not good at explaining things though so I’d suggest looking up the terms I mentioned to show how it can work for a lot of us.
I’m so sorry I mean nonbinary who put themselves in that category instead of nonbinary people in general. I’m so sorry again I’m bad at explaining this and especially that this hurt you. Please let me know if there’s any other problems and I’ll work on them.
put themselves in what category? i'm not hurt just trying to understand why you're trying to use a blanket term over multiple groups of people. is AFAB what you are trying to say when you use womxn? or women-identifying people? because for that you could just simply say women. other comments have already said this but it feels by making it different you're implying trans women aren't ""women"" but rather something separate.
Not people with uteruses/AFAB people…I suppose the best term would be woman-aligned but I’ve heard that some people use it incorrectly. But like I’ve spent all of my trans life being told I’m a woman but not nonbinary, so sometimes I can get dysphoria the term completely on it’s own. I start to think about people who deny other parts to me that are also very important. I was using womxn because I had thought until now it was especially meant for people who are in between certain genders in some way or whatnot.

Exactly a year since I came out as non binary. After a year I can look back and see that all those baby steps add up to quite a journey.

We need more support for clean/sober non cis people	"I've been in and out of sober living since I was 21 the cis male (I'm afab) house I was first  in was amazing but ya know relapse.

I'm 24 now and I've been in this house full of cis women. It's a midsized organization 86+ split between eleven houses. The owners are as respectful as they can be but I can't expect them to use more inclusive language when I'm the only non-cis person here. But I'm tired of “You are Princess Warriors” and “Attention ladies” and “You are all beautiful”

So tired of the misgendering-even tho none of it is meant to be rude. I appear masculine and I wear skirts cause we live in the south and damn it if Imma roast. Tired of every new girl asking what's in my pants, tired of explaining my story, of educating and being tolerant all the while I'm trying to put back the pieces of my life.

I do know it's just been a hard week and I do have really supportive people who do there best to understand. I just can't help but imagine a place where there are others just like me who struggle with trying to overcome addiction. I was denied at so many places because of who I am, so I'm grateful I do have a place and that I kept trying to get help. 

There must be others like me and I just don't want them to be as uncomfortable as I get sometimes whole undergoing recovery. 

Treatment for addicts needs to improve in general but there really needs to be some focus on those who are not cis. Especially with how gendered 12 step programs can get."	"I just had a similar conversation with a friend the other day about foster care. I can see how this relates to your situation. While in one aspect I appreciate the faux-support for females, it gets manufactured too much. Like they can just buy jumbo poster pack of generic pink & flowery affirmations and it will make someone feel better. These kinds of things magnify a crappy week when you’ve been “Hallmarked” into being supported. Hear me out: consider making the type of posters with affirmations that would make you feel supported! Hang those puppies up with the women rarw stuff.
I go strictly with co-ed houses now for that reason - me being a transmasculine person in a “female” house was a mess for everyone involved. Though that comes with issues of its own, and still isn’t perfect by any means. Honestly, I plan on pretending to be binary male as soon as I’m passing bc it’s honestly such a hassle 🙄
Men's Oxford in the NW has been supportive of my transmasc friends, and it's a lot more personal and autonomous than larger sober living organizations. Perhaps try that?
Conservative AA people are how I ended up not getting the right help for my gender issues in early recovery. I had 14 years when I finally cracked. Got loaded over it. Don’t assume a bunch of addicts will understand or respect your identity. LGBT meetings exist for a reason, and even then you have to remember that too many gays and lesbians are not cool with trans or non-binary people. When they say “to thy own self be true” they really mean it, even when they completely forget what that means.
ugh pisses me off how gendered this world is, im so sick and tired of it, like what is this OBSESSION with putting people in tiny boxes???? we're all human, period. 

sorry rant lol i really hope things get better ✨
Honestly? I'm too drunk to read your post properly. Which says a lot. I'm sorry. I'm pretty lost. But I send my love and support.
Exactly!! You hit it right on the head! I’m also a former foster kid and it’s my dream to be a worker and to create policies that protect and support kids and teens.

But making my own support stuff sounds awesome thank you so much for the suggestion I really appreciate it :)
I can only speak for the NW but there are also good queer 12 step groups here. I would hope there are some where you are too.
Thank you so much 💕 Please make sure you drink some water and get food into you when you're able to!
Former foster kid here too! The idea of the poster-making comes from my non-Binary first born who makes posters to put out on the lawn that are more inclusive! We are running into the ra-ra rawr issue in Scouts where they are encouraged to make a lot of gender specific empowerment stuff and it makes them feel crappy that they aren’t so happy about the gender label!

My Partner loves hunting for inclusive kids books and she found a good one for “having the talk” with wee ones. First time I have seen intersex and trans represented and it really made my day.		"My friend had this book lol

It is very cute, but it does seem a bit confused about biological sex. It is the penis or the vulva (plus all other sex characteristics) that is the biological sex. Getting called a girl or a boy based on the birth sex is the assigned gender
It’s Perfectly Normal is another book that is great for kids, although some people find it very explicit:  it is very honest and it does include cartoon drawings of the human body (because it is perfectly normal!).  It has a whole chapter dedicated to queer identities including transgender identity.  There are some other books in the series that focus more on babies, etc., but I haven’t read them 😊
Thnxxx
Whats its name
Yeah it is far from perfect and a little clumsy in some other places too but I was impressed that they tried. 

It was really refreshing to read the line “or that they don’t belong in either” usually so much glossing over anything outside the binary in books of this type. For me (late 30s) I didn’t get exposed to anything outside of the standard gender expressions until I was well past uni and intersex was only muttered quietly in the doctors office. Having representation or even acknowledgement of our existence at an early age would have been wonderful. 

Cool, did they get it recently or has this been out for a while? I am pretty bad keeping track. 


The book also has some reasonably good representation of other families. For me the other big thing was a pretty solid bit on C sections as ours were sunroof babies.
I had a similar reaction; I think ""anatomical sex"" would be more accurate since your external genitalia is only one aspect of your biological sex (which also includes, quite critically, your chromosomes). But I did really appreciate the concept of ""they're called"" boys/girls instead of ""they are.""

people saying non binary lesbians don’t exist is transphobic right?	i’m 17F and lesbian and i posted on the subreddit r/AskLesbians about how the term wlw wasn’t inclusive of non binary lesbians and i only got backlash about how people who are not a woman can’t be lesbian. i can call this transphobia (towards non binary people) right? i thought it was so strange because i did not expect people to go against it so hard. non binary lesbians exist idk why that’s so hard to understand.	"Technically yes, but it's more about gatekeeping who is allowed to describe themselves as lesbians imo. Transphobia and gatekeeping are both asshole things to do.
Yes, it's gatekeeping and transphobic. Non-binary people can identify as lesbians, and also lesbians can be attracted to non-binary people too.
Gatekeeping annoys me so much.  If someone feels comfortable with the label 'lesbian', just let them use it even if they dont identify fully as a woman.  Just let people be peoplllllle
Well shit…I guess I don’t exist… 🤦🕵🏻
[deleted]
it’s weird how some queer people are towards non-binary ppl, they act like it’s almost a sexuality. as if the two are exclusive.  which they are not, just like there’s ppl who are non-binary and bisexual, or gay.
Wow, it's sad to see this stuff still happening within our community. Sorry you had to deal with that. You are so valid! 🥰
that's so close minded of them :(( of course we exist! (i am one too\~\~)  i do think it is transphobic because it's discriminates against those who identify as non-binary from being who they want to be.
Yeah it's transphobic! I've seen wlw/nblw used to describe it before idk how commonly used that is though
Are you saying that the definition of lesbian is not a woman who is sexually and romantically attracted to women? Is the whole point of being non-binary that you are not, in fact, a woman? I'm confused here? If you're not a woman, you're not a lesbian. I'd honestly say that it's pretty disrespectful to say that a NB person is a lesbian, you're invalidating a person's identity by doing so. That's like telling them that no matter what they identify as, they're a woman in your eyes.
you are valid <3
thank you sm 💕 i was so surprised by the backlash i received i don’t even understand
thanks for confirming!
thanks! i’m not non binary myself but i got so many transphobic comments from cis lesbians and feel like shit because i know that there is so much hate and transphobia in the lgbtq community but i hadn’t really seen it up close like this
i’m not non binary myself but was shocked to see so many cis lesbians saying so many awful things under my post :( 💕💕
i’m getting so many transphobic comments and i just want to cry because they will not even listen. they’re so close minded and i hate it so much :(
i’ve seen quite a few non binary people identify as lesbian, just because they feel more comfortable with that label.
I'm a non-binary lesbian. We definitely exist.
im so sorry this is happening to you but if the comments are really getting to you, i think it's best if you block the users or ignore their replies because some people on here are just straight up trolls and arguing with them is like arguing with a wall..
The fact that they feel ""comfortable"" doesn't mean it's right.
i know! i always heard people talk about the fact that there’s so much gate keeping and hate in the lgbtq community itself and of course i believed it but i had never actually seen it until now. i’m shocked. 💕💕
the moderator locked my post and they blocked the transphobes so it should be all good now 💕 thank you :)

Filled out paper work for work to be seen as non-binary	"I filled out paperwork at my job as I am non-binary and want to be addressed as such only for my leaders to constantly use the wrong terms even after correcting them multiple times.

""Hey Lady, do you mind doing this for me?"" And I responded with 
""Not a lady but I got you! Remember I'm non-binary and this is the fifth time you've misgendered me"" only to be apologized with

Parental pronoun switch	"Hello folks! My 9-year-old came out as non-binary to me on October 1st. Being bi and working in an inclusive environment, I've felt well versed in pronouns and non-gendered language, but to say my husband and is struggling would be an understatement. He has used their pronouns once over these three-ish weeks. I really want my child to feel safe at home. They're not out at school yet (but with their permission, I use they/them in one-on-one communications with their teacher). I want home to be the one place they know they can fully be themselves. 

This feels like another let-down in my marriage. Am I being too tough on my husband for this recent change or is this weaponized incompetence?"	"Weaponized incompetence. Doesn't matter whether dude understands it or not. If it's important to your kid, it should be important to him. =/
Keep up on the correcting and advocating for your kid! It’s not too harsh, it’s commanding basic respect for your child.
It's normal for him to screw up sometimes but it doesn't sound like he's even trying
Maybe you could sit down and talk to him about it (away from your kid) and try do a few minutes of focussed practice. Every slip up, you could repeat the sentence back to him with the correct pronouns and get him to repeat it back.

Perhaps if he’s still struggling with it after a while you could suggest he has a short heart to heart with kiddo, saying that he’s sorry he’s getting it wrong so often, doesn’t mean he doesn’t believe their gender identity, that he will try to do better (that last bit is important, and that he actually does try to improve, because it will feel like hollow excuses otherwise)

Obviously, only if he actually believes it — it might be worth asking him on his own if he’s having trouble adjusting because he doesn’t believe/‘get’ it.

Much love to you, thank you for coming here and wanting to make things right for your child x
On one hand, three weeks is not much time for people who aren't well-versed in neutral pronouns... On the other hand, your husband had better be demonstrating his progress in some way that is tangible to your child or else after a while they will lose faith in him caring at all (from my experience).
Sit down when the kiddo isn’t home and be blunt. Don’t have this convo when they are in another room because you don’t know how he will react.

“Listen, they trusted us with this. Our job is to show we are listening. If you need sticky note to remind you every morning or have me call you out on it that is fine, but we will treat this with respect because our child deserves our respect.”
This is a toughy. I also have a very young enby(they came out a few months ago), and it took my husband and I quite a while to get the hang of pronouns. Not that we weren't trying, just that it is a hard habit to break. We pretty much have it now, but are not perfect. Many, many 'oops, them' moments. Our kid goes to a very progressive school and we just hosted their first birthday party with their friends from the school. We had two trans kids, two enbys and 3 cis kids. There were many mistakes made, but we did our best and always corrected ourselves asap. The kids were very graceful and understanding. I think as long as there is respect and effort there (and the effort continues) they see that. Good luck to you, us enby moms have the most amazing kids who deserve to be heard and respected as much as everyone else! 💜💛🖤
So as someone with ADHD, I can have trouble with switching pronouns.  Hell I've misgendered cis people cause I had a thought with the opposite pronoun going through my head as I spoke.  However, even then I catch myself and apologize when it happens and  try harder next time.

Im all for giving people some slack at first, especially if they naturally have trouble with things like that but, as someone has trouble with pronouns but still try my best, it sounds like your husband isn't even trying

Edit: have you been pointing it out when he screws up and is he apologetic when you do?
Weaponized incompetence.... That is a strange phrase. Okay so your kid came out as nonbinary and your husband keeps using the wrong pronouns. Well, first remember he has been conditioned to calling them the pronoun for a while. So you have to recondition him for the new pronoun. Talk about what it means to the child for him to do that. Give him examples, like telling him about how he doesn't like being called the wrong thing. Remind him that it is an easy way to build a bond by getting it right and an easy way to break a bond by getting it wrong. There is also positive and negative reinforcements. If he gets it wrong negative reinforcement. If he gets it right positive. Pretty much, the idea of change is similar to raising a child. The work is to encourage the positive behavior.
This sounds very frustrating. Maybe some resources would be helpful for him to help him get his head around it, like reading about other families going through similar changes, with the kids being referred to by the correct new pronouns? 

I recently recommended this blog with tips and recommendations to my friend who is coparenting a child, going beyond the gender-binary. There may be some helpful resources for you and him, too: 
https://www.kylmyers.com/resources
Here’s a good podcast! The last episode the speaker (who is in their 30s) comes out to her dad and it’s very heartwarming. I’d highly recommend listening to this as I love the perspective and it’s very logical and sensical. Your husband may appreciate the perspective from an adult’s POV. 

https://open.spotify.com/show/5qbyLKdKP6xZfB02W0fseF?si=RuOdc4NYSvWCmaRCza_Vyw
Could you help him find a space to practice, and work on getting comfortable with it together? I mean. Even if you 100% get pronouns, if you’re used to using one set then getting consistent about using the others takes some practice. You could have evening conversations about kiddo while they’re asleep or at school or whenever works for your schedules. Maybe make up a secret “oops” signal for if you need to correct yourselves and haven’t noticed. Then you can work on supporting your child as a team.
100% my concern. I recognize 3 weeks is a short time period compared to their 9 years as she/her but I also don't want his inaction to create a divide in their relationship.
Effort matters so much in parenting. Like. Even if you aren’t perfect, your kids will see it and know when you are trying vs when you aren’t.
I point it out in what I feel is a nonchalant manner (just ""they"" or ""them"", not much more to take him out of his thought process). He acts disappointed in himself for getting it wrong, but I can't remember hearing him get it right at all, not even once, which prompted the post. I believe he is undiagnosed ADHD but his mom embedded it as a flaw, so he ignores it.
Oh, haha, I don't mean compared to whatever came before — I just mean it can be a hard skill to pick up, being actively thoughtful about the specific words you're using when you speak. It is something he'll absolutely need to practice, and if he isn't showing marked improvement within, say, a month or two, then I would start to be concerned. Luckily you are there to hold him accountable! Practice talking with him about your child, and be sure to correct one another any time you mess up. Encourage him to speak up when anyone else mixes it up. Share some scripts with him for how to react when he or others mix it up. If he cares, then correcting it for others so your child doesn't have to, and having a small script to explain on their behalf can be a big deal even if he isn't hitting 10/10 on use himself...
I'm healing from this trauma of emotional neglect now, so I know I'm sensitive to the subject, but you're right. Seeing effort is really what matters to kids. It's healthy to see parents grow and learn from mistakes.
> can't remember him getting it right at all, not even once

So he doesn't correct himself even when you point it out for him?"	y6vpca	NonBinary	53	0.98	2022-10-18 03:38:04
Tiny Tina's Wonderland has inclusive character customization!	"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands just released and its character customization is pretty amazing. The body types are labeled ""this one"" and ""that one"" instead of male and female, and all options for hair, voice, etc are available no matter what body type you pick. You also pick pronouns for your character, and they/them is an option. This just really made my day."	"I'm glad someone else noticed! I was making my character playing with a friend of mine and just about screamed when I saw they/them as an option 😅
How's the game and btw why are you not playing elder ring anyway?
Knowing this has honestly kind of made me love Borderlands even more-
Its actually a really fun game. Tiny Tina's DLC was my favorite part of Borderlands 2 though, so I may be biased lol. As far as Elden Ring goes, its just not my type of game. I have been enjoying watching some of my friends play it though."	togrff	NonBinary	51	1.0	2022-03-26 04:22:02
"""Take your kids to work day"" is now ""Take Our Daughters & Sons to Work Day"" and I'm kind of cheezed"	Our annual thing at the office has apparently picked up some kind of national branding this year, but less gender inclusive? I feel like dragging them on Twitter but maybe there's a better way. [https://daughtersandsonstowork.org/](https://daughtersandsonstowork.org/)	"The fuck? Why would they change that?
I'd drag the fuck outta them on twitter, but I don't really know anything about corporate policy or such so maybe there's a better way to address it?
Daughters, sons & lil ones!!!


No enby kids allowed, apparently.

Probably some mindlessly politically-correct person thinking, ""oh, hey, we have to include both men and women in everything, or we're misogynistic"", and then going ""daughters and sons"" without even thinking about the fact that some kids are neither.
Looking into it now, the foundation/brand was created in 1992 as a feminist effort and was specifically aimed at girls. They added ""sons"" later. I would hazard a guess that they would not want to un-mention ""daughters"" for that reason.
I was thinking more of dragging the foundation as opposed to my company. But given the foundation's history, which I just learned, I'm not sure the best way to go about it.
Drag them for not also adding a gender neutral ""children"" as well then if they're going to add sons. If they're a feminist org they ought to care.

I did a thing!	"Hello!

So, not sure if this type of post is allowed here, but I wanted to share some personal accomplishment and good news! Feel free to start commenting something that you’ve accomplished as well! I want to hear all about your triumphs and your ambitions. Here’s mine:

After years of second guessing and deciding, I finally got accepted into college! I start this Summer for a Medical Billing and Coding Diploma! What this means is after the program, I will be certified and able to work in a hospital building setting in Insurance Follow Up/Medical Billing/Medical Coding or even a remote profession! I am beyond excited and I look forward to starting.

What’s even cooler is the college I applied for and got accepted by updated their markers and I was able to choose the Non-Binary option! They also asked pronouns. I know it doesn’t seem like a huge deal, but, I love that so many places are becoming more open and inclusive!

I hope everyone is having a good week and I can’t wait to hear what you’ve accomplished!"	"I have an appointment with a surgeon tomorrow to talk about getting a gender affirming hysterectomy!! Very excited!!!
Sounds wonderfull!!!
A couple months ago I got my fire fighter cirtificate, so I'm officially a fire figther, and I think thats pretty cool hahah!
Good luck with college!
Congratulations!!

I finally updated my chosen name at college so when I start they won't use my dead name 🤩
Huge congrats! 
I’m going back to school after dropping out 6 years ago. I’ve done a lot of growing since then and have come to realize that I’m much better suited to learning in a hands-on environment and would love to spend as much time as possible with plants ... so in 6 days I’ll be starting the first phase of apprenticeship in horticulture! 🙂
Congratulations! That’s awesome! 

 I am traveling in another country for the first time by myself with my X gender marker on my passport, and feeling really proud of my self. 😊
Nothing as big as y’all’s but this week I got one step closer to my euphoria feels with a haircut that’s buzzed short all around (a 2) except for the chin length hair left on top that can style masc or fem depending on what I’m feeling that day. I smile every time I see my haircut in the mirror now ❤️
congratulations!!
That’s awesome! Congrats!
congrats! i moved from the US to australia a few months ago for uni, and tomorrow i have my first appointment with my new endocrinologist :)
I’ll be sending positive, healing vibes your way!
That is amazing! I’m so proud of you! That’s a huge deal. Thank you and I will be sending you positive, successful vibes as you venture more into your career as a Fire Fighter.
Love it! That’s awesome!
Thank you!

I wish you all the best and best of luck as you return to school!
Aww! Yay! Thank you for your kindness! Stay safe.
Hey, that’s still a huge accomplishment. Rock it!

"The ""please keep distance"" signs at my workplace are non binary inclusive! They are on at least every second door and we have over 40 halls and buildings! Makes me happy every time I see them."		Ich bin neidisch :(	ptdpow	NonBinary	43	0.93	2021-09-22 18:26:06
Something that shows older people have no right to misgender us	"My form teacher came up to me on Friday asked my if I’m nonbinary asked me my pronouns and then asked how he can be more inclusive to nonbinary students.
Made my heart melt"	"My friend's 90 year old grandpa is one of my biggest allies. ""Old school/Old mindset"" my ass.

Edit: also how the f*ck do people think that we got our rights, if not by those older generations fighting for what we have today? It's not like some powerful person woke up one day and said ""hey you know what? Today I feel like inventing trans people and giving them rights"". Ugh.

No gender-neutral language	"In my native language (German) basically nothing is gender-neutral. There is currently a massive societal debate going on and currently the agreement is to add an * or : which includes everyone on the spectrum.
Eg.: Student (en) is Schüler*in (de).

I work in academia and am currently trying to hand in an article at a scientific journal which explicitly states you have to use „and“ instead (so „Schülerinnen und Schüler“ „female and male students“). Which by being binary really is not inclusive language at all.

I had to correct my text accordingly and now I feel horrible and invalid (I identify as agender). Every * I erased felt like I was erasing myself. It’s like my own text doesn’t speak to me anymore and there’s nothing I can do because I have zero bargaining power. I haven’t come out at work yet and I‘m not ready either.
Anyone else has been in a similar situation and has any advice?
I guess this is just a sad rant but I needed somewhere to vent."	"Is ""Liebe Lernenden"",""Studierende"" an option? ""Studierende"" is widely used in Germany now, it kinda circumvents the whole debacle.

I guess putting enbies in explicitly like in ""Studenten, Studentinnen und nichtbinäre/diverse Studierende""
The German language sucks in this regard. Fellow German here. Can you write to the journal and call them out on their non-inclusivity? I think, the visibility is super bad in Germany and they might think, they're super progressive with their ""you need to use er und sie"". I work in scientific publishing and so many people are so not aware there's more than he and she. 😔 At least the : should be made an option. Also, don't lots of unis nowadays push for inclusive language? Students have to learn it and then the journal says ""no""? That's so bad 😞
My first language is French, everything is gendered too, i feel your pain
I'm german so I know xour feeling too well. :C
[removed]
If you would wanna see more uncessary complications of language learn some polish. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, numerals, everything is gendered
Yeah,  I only use „Studierende“ even in everyday talk but this is about middle/high school students. So there really only is „Schüler*innen“. „Lernende“ also doesn’t work in that context unfortunately.
I actually think I might write to them after a decision about my paper has been made. Before it’s just too risky. 
The journal is based on Switzerland actually. I don’t know where the debate is at down there.
Why? Neutral language is just so much more inclusive and if that argument doesn’t work for you: believe me, gender neutral language is also a lot easier when it comes to grammar.
Hm. Is ""Gymnasiasten"" gender neutral? Are there ""Gymnasiastinnen""?

""Besucher der Schule"" is gendered too.

There was an attempt to be inclusive. There was the same sign on the mens bathroom as well. I still felt dysphoric about going to the restroom...		"This made me think about truly neutral signs. First I thought just a human, but that's what they use for male! (how is that for patriarchy?) Then remembered the more old style signs ""WC"", just tell us it is a toilet/washroom rather then who is ""allowed"" to use it. 

Just need: ""toilet"", ""accessible toilet"", and ""toilet with baby changing facilities"".
This local CD/video game/whatever else store in my town has one that has the man, woman, and an alien, and it says ""Whatever, just wash your hands"", and while I get they're trying to be inclusive and funny, like, we're not aliens.......
Ugh, my job has signs like this too. On the one hand, the attempt to be inclusive is nice...on the other, what about those of us who identify with neither?
Whelp！over to the men’s I go!
A local bar's toilets are labled ""sit"" (toilet) and ""sit/stand"" (toilet and urinal)!

Wish I was an alien tho. Would be cool if I could go a wizz round other planets. 
I find myself identifying more with aliens / alienness since identifying as non-binary, but that's for me to decide and not a a sign on a bathroom door!! yeah I find that pretty insulting 
Like, it's cool that they're accepting, it's great that they're open to trans people, but stop forgetting those of us that don't fit the binary. I'm kinda tired of it.

I was at a coffee shop in Minneapolis once where the bathrooms were so confusingly labeled that I didn't know which was which, until I realized it didn't matter, because both of them had a regular toilet and a urinal, and that's what the signs on the door meant. That was definitely a better way to do it, because bathrooms are just about voiding your bowels/bladder, not being specific to what your label is. Nobody has gendered bathrooms at home, why should they do it in public? 
Agreed, it's truly bizarre and backwards. let me pee in peace please!

“Feminine-presenting people”	"Have y’all heard people say “… women and feminine-presenting people…” (often in the context of discussing misogyny)? What do they mean by “feminine-presenting people” when they say this?

It often sounds like they mean people who are assumed to be women. As an AFAM non binary trans masc person who gets misgendered, it irritates me. I’m not “presenting” feminine by any means (in terms of my gender expression). It just seems like another way cis people try to use inclusive language but miss the mark"	"I've always assumed it to mean femme nonbinary people who do actually dress and act more traditionally feminine.  I do think terms like that have a lot of potential to be misused though and I'm not really a huge fan of them myself.
I hate it so much. I understand the intention to be inclusive of non-women who are mistaken for women, and I still hate it. It includes non-binary and/or transmasc people who are just living their lives in bodies that get read as femme no matter what they do. It excludes non-binary and/or transfemme people who absolutely are presenting femme, but not so much that the cis care. ""People who are affected by misogyny"" and/or ""people who are affected by transmisogyny"" are much more pertinent descriptors that put the blame where it belongs.
Right, but someone who is nonbinary can still be affected by misogyny, if they are perceived to be a woman. The intention here is that they are trying to include nonbinary and gender non-conforming people who are affected by misogyny in the conversation, but they ddon't seem to understand that misogyny affects people who aren't fem-presenting as well. This discussion came up recently at my work when they started developing a Women's Employee Resource Group. As an AFAB non-binary person who is misgendered in the workplace 90%, I am affected by the issues brought up by the ERG and I want there to be space for me in this group. They used feminine-presenting language at first, but after talking with me about it ended up changing it to ""Women+"" with a disclaimer that this group was open to all people affected by women-centered issues. That all is to say, maybe try suggesting some different language. It may be better to just say ""women and those affected by misogyny"" to include not only fem-presenting people, but afabs and other non-women who may be affected by misogyny due to misogynist's ignorant perception
I can see what you mean. I feel like in the context of misogyny there are so many non-women who are directly affected by it and I haven’t yet come across a term that adequately encapsulates those people. Though to be honest, even “feminine-presenting people” is a step up from what I’ve seen because everywhere I go people act like misogyny is only relevant to (presumably cis) women.
I often use the phrase "" people who are perceived to be women"" instead. For a lot of reasons. I'm uncertain the source of "" feminine presenting people"" but gender presentation is often used in the context of intentional outward appearance. There's nothing intentional about my appearance, I just look very feminine and haven't done much to counteract that. I don't like being assumed to be female, but unfortunately it's a side effect of society and my appearance. So, I truly dislike the term ""presenting,"" as it often makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong for not altering my appearance to match societal notions of gender presentation. 

I'm not saying this logic applies to everyone, but it's how I personally feel about the term. I'm sure someone out there will have similar issues with the phrase ""people who are perceived to be women."" So like a lot of things take it with a grain of salt.
Yeah. By feminine presenting people they really mean anyone who is perceived to be female. Cis women, transfem people who pass, some non-binary people, transmasc people who don't pass ... Heck, even those who pass but are still categorized as women because transphobia.

I kinda hate that phrasing. I am a guy but suffer from misogyny. A lot of very butch women suffer from misogyny. A lot of non-binary people who appear fem suffer from misogyny. There are very hairy and masculine trans guy with bass voices who suffer from misogyny because they are out. 

I really find it sad when people try to be inclusive but end up just making the people they tried to include uncomfortable.
My guess is sometimes - particularly when they themselves are cis - they mean:

""Women and other people who are affected by misogyny but although I know enough to know it's not just 'women' due to the range of diversity out there, I also don't know the correct term to cover it because I was educated, brought up and largely live in a binary-gendered world, so I'm going to do my best and 'feminine-presenting' I read somewhere and sounds as if it works and doesn't seem to be offensive if I google it so let's go with that because I don't have time to spend an hour researching it before I can finish the sentence I'm writing trying to support people suffering from misogyny.""

Or in short, they're probably doing their best to be inclusive in a world where inclusive language is new and still developing, so try not to be too offended, but certainly also try to educate them on better terms, as they're likely to be the people who will bother to make the effort to use them. :-)
I would never use it without context, but do use the (slightly different) ""female / male presenting"" in the context of how other people treat a group, react etc. This is always with people who would understand the relevance.
I see it in that context as people who appear feminine/woman-adjacent being mistaken for women and treated with misogynistic behaviour.
They're not talking about you. They're talking about me: an *AMAB* non-binary trans-femme person. I'm not a woman but I *am* femme-presenting.
Well, reminds me of the time I met a ""nice guy"" on a dating app that alleged to be pansexual, but said things would never work out between us due to me being too ""male presenting"" given the fact that I go to the gym and from his perception that is a thing ""just for men"". I'm an enby athlete and proud of it, what I'm not proud of is not having kicked  that motherfucker'a ass. 

(Gosh, I hate cis people...)
[removed]
Well everyone that presents female including gnc hetero cis men. At least that is what it logically should mean.
I think it is a reductive way of looking at people. It is very binarist I think, and based in a sort of bioessentialist view, that womanhood / femininity is seen and expressed in certain ways approved by cisheteronormativity. I dont think it meets the criteria for decolonial anticapitalist transfeminism. And it attempts to shove in people who dont belong in that box, and exclude people who do want to be in there.

I shouldnt have to prove that I am not my agab, just as people shouldnt have to prove that they are women, transfem and/or non binary. Our self-determination of our selves is valid.
Oof I feel you, in francophone discourse I think the norm is women and people perceived as such which kinda makes me feel more comfortable?
Always thought it is referring to non binary women, demi girls and people who aren't defining themselves as women, but do define themselves as some feminine gender and are included in the context
I agree. I am AFAB too and not on testosterone (i dont want to be). But im not feminine presenting either. That term makes it sound like our association with feminity is intentional but its not (not for everyone). I present masculinely despite my body and hair length. I dont view my body and hair as feminine just not masculine. Its just lazyness by cis ppl.

Maybe feminine-perceived would be better but its still kind icky. TBH i feel like we need to make new words entirely but we dont have the reach for that rn. We’re in a spot where cis ppl are trying to make them for us, make bad ones, other cis ppl think using them will make them look progressive and further their use, all while ignoring actual nonbinary ppl
As a fellow transmasc who is frequently misgendered, I totally get where you are coming from. Often I think people use femme presenting to include non-binary femme folks, gender fluid folks, agender folks etc, who may experience misogyny because of the way they present, regardless of they identify as a woman or not.
I'd say it depends heavily on context. I am non-binary and genderfluid, but I definitely am ""masculine-presenting"" almost half the time and have no issue acknowledging that. Some folks are using phrases like that to refer to me when treating me temporarily as male, for instance when discussing particular issues where I can logically be grouped in with cisgender and transgender men. Other people definitely use it to refer to people like me who are read as male regardless of our presentation, but this isn't always the case
The term does include amab non-binary people who are feminine (I am one) and I am harmed by misogyny. But I do think there is a grey area around the edges because it is operating on binary assumptions of gender presentation and that causes some trans masc people to be included in the term and some trans femme people to be excluded. But generally I think it is a more effective at communicating it’s intent then “people who experience misogyny” because I clearly fall into the femme presenting people catigory and as such experience misogyny but because of transphobia/transmisogyny I have had people tell me I don’t experience misogyny because I’m “a man” so I shouldn’t talk on the subject…
A poor attempt at inclusivity
Yes!!! Perfectly said. Thank you
Thanks for the alternative!! I've always wondered why the hell there wasn't a better way to say this.
[removed]
Good points!  I feel it often goes beyond even people perceived to be female. Any kind of thing perceived to be femme: clothing, behavior, attitude applied to anyone has this affected status. 

Like it’s generally accepted for everyone to wear pants now. If’s pants are more masculine society thinks it’s desirable. But skirts?!  For someone not AFAB society is like why would you even want to go there?  It’s like just the perception of femme traits can be so threatening or hated by some in society.  

It’s so messed up. As soon as I came up with examples I also thought of counter examples that seem to disprove my original examples. But I think that just go to show how twisted misogyny is and how it makes it so everyone losses. I guess it proves the point misogyny has no logical bases for its argument of hate.
Not really. They are talking about people affected by misogyny, so, perceived as women and/or female. And that's where language fails.

Because yes, that includes you who is femme presenting, but that also very much includes me, a pre-hrt FtM person who is very masculine but still perceived as a woman and thus suffering regularly from various amounts of misogyny.
Why would you group women and all AFAB people together? What possible topic relates to all female identifying people regardless of biology/GAB, *AND* all AFAB people, regardless of how they identify?
Non-binary people who intentionally present feminine (what I'd call feminine-presenting people) as well as men who exhibit some feminine traits or behaviors can also be affected by misogyny, and I don't think ""misplaced' is good description in that case. In the case of trans masc people, one could say that.
[removed]
It's pretty much up to the individual to decide if the misogyny is misplaced or not; that's just what it's called when it's aimed at non-women. 

For some trans men (and many other non-women), calling it misogyny is extremely dysphoric. As an enby who does things that are mistaken for feminine, it's very upsetting for me to be targeted by misogyny, not just because misogyny sucks, but *I'm not a woman* and someone treating me in a negative way because they treat women that way is doubly disrespectful - to women for how that person treats women, and to me for treating me like a woman after they've been told I'm not. 

**In order to avoid the appearance of invalidating non-women, ""misplaced misogyny"" is the most common term for misogyny that is mistakenly aimed at people who are not women.** *Whether or not misogyny aimed at you or any other individual is misplaced is a different question that only that individual can answer.*
Cishet men are just as affected by misogyny as anyone else, just in different ways. 

And not all women have uteruses, so not all ""Women and AFAB people"" have uteruses. Just people with uteruses do.
I’m not saying all women and afab people have uteruses, but saying “I women and afab people” would include that group. And I don’t get your point about cishet men. I get that society as a whole is affected by misogyny but “just as much”? That’s a huge stretch.
You're also including trans women and many other people who don't have uteruses. My point is that there is no possible utility gained from referring to that group of people, and all that can come of it is making people feel uncomfortable who are included without reason. If you want to talk about uteruses and the people who have them, say ""people with uteruses"". Don't assume that everyone in a particular group all has something that's not specifically required by the definition of the group.

As a former cishet man: my worldview was shaped by the misogynistic things I was taught growing up, including but not limited too: a fear of platonic intimacy, not being taught how to deal with emotions properly, pressure to act stoic, etc. The social isolation that comes with a lot of these pressures can feel absolutely crushing. It's only now, living as a woman and not directly exposed to them, that I realise just how fucked it was.

I'm not saying that cishet men are *equally* *victimised* by it, or that they shouldn't bear responsibility for their actions in the face of these pressures (ie. violence against non-cishet men), but they do suffer from it just as much.
I do appreciate the distinction you're drawing between being affected by something and the impacts those effects have. Almost incidental to that, however, I would gently ask, are you sure you actually were a cishet man and your experiences reflect that group? Cis is not the default and just because one might have assumed they were a boy/man before understanding about gender does not mean one truly was cis during that time. I mention this mostly because it's been a weird lesson for me to learn, how different I truly always was and how non-representative my thoughts/experiences as a ""cis"" person always were. Just something to consider. I don't mean it as an attack or anything, and if you really did feel cis and do think you were having a cis experience, that's fine.

In any case. I don't disagree that even cishet men are affected by misogyny. But I do still think it's okay to have a phrase like ""people affected by misogyny"" that means something more like ""people who are directly impacted by misogyny on a day-to-day basis."" It seems like the fact that cishet men also harm themselves and their boys by perpetuating misogyny (and obviously not only cishet men ""do"" misogyny, but since we're focusing on them) doesn't necessarily need to be called out each and every time. And I mean, trans men and transmasc folks are affected in that sense too: there are plenty of people who avoid certain FTM-centric spaces because the boys and men there are much too much ""boys and men"" in that regard. Same with gay/bi/ace men, cis or trans, as well. So at that point we've circled all the way back to ""feminism is for everyone and everyone is affected by the issues with which feminism concerns itself,"" and although *true*, it doesn't necessarily help us when we're trying to improve policies or recognize harm or even just let people have some solidarity.
Sayings cishet men are just as affected by it, which is what you said, is implying that they’re equally as affected by it. I also still don’t see how saying “women and afab people” would be wrong because people in that category without a uterus would still be affected by a lot of those healthcare decisions just by having that F marker in their chart. As an example, I’ve seen a trans woman (more than one actually) be denied a medication because it’s abortive. The system saw the F and denied it without checking further. I’ve also seen cis women without uteruses or cis women who sterile be denied medication because it could be abortive. So, even though they can’t get pregnant, those healthcare laws still affected their ability to get the care they needed.
They are equally affected by it, just not equally victimised by it. Again I can't stress how crushing the social isolation is. I don't know your gender identity or where you're coming from. Do you have any sort of lived experience as someone assumed cis male by society?

Not all women are legally female, so maybe then just say people who are legally female? Just be granular about what you're talking about. Not all afab people are women, and I've seen countless times non-femme identifying afab people get VERY uncomfortable being grouped in with them. It's not hard to just make the discussion about the specific thing you're talking about."	10fnyfp	NonBinary	41	0.88	2023-01-19 00:57:18

Is using he/him and she/her pronouns greedy?	"I've only recently considered myself as non-binary (and lightblub!), and have mainly been focussing on how and when I come out, who I tell in advance and how I'll present on day 1.

Fortunately my employer is big on inclusivity and diversity, and has an LGBTQ+ employees' network that has sponsorship at board level. I spoke with a colleague who's a lead of this network, and they asked if I'd thought about my pronouns.

I really hadn't, but my initial take is that I don't like they/them that much - no offence to anybody that uses those, and if you do I'll respect that - but I find the association with the plural a bit jarring. That's maybe an age thing, as I'm in my middle-age and overly used to hearing they/them in that context.

I'm AMAB and am looking to present more fem - subtly/androgenously at first, but probably more obviously as I gain confidence and develop my style, but I'd expect that to be a fluid thing depending on my mood or the situation. So I'm thinking that he/him and she/her would be fine by me, and if people wanted to choose from those depending how I was presenting at the time, then that's be fine.

However, I'm autistic, and can miss out on the subtext of some things. I'd like to be sure that doing this wouldn't send out some message I'm not aware of: whether that's being ""greedy"" or indecisive or half-hearted or whatever. Or maybe I'm just doing myself a disservice by letting others decide?

Also, if I do go with these pronouns, how would I list them? I've not noticed others using them, so is it ""he/him she/her"" or ""he/him/she/her"" or ""he/she/him/her"" or something else, or does it really not matter?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: It's refreshing to have such a non-judgemental community here! I was concerned that I might accidentally be misappropriating the pronouns of some specific sub-group, but I get the message LOUD AND CLEAR, that these are my pronouns, so it's up to me which ones I settle on.

I think that most people got that ""greedy"" wasn't to be taken completely literally - I couldn't quite think of a word that summarised my concerns, so that was a bit tongue-in-cheek."	"No not at all! I use any pronouns. Your pronouns are your choice and yours alone! ❤️

Anyone who makes you feel bad for having them simply doesn’t get it or unfortunately doesn’t respect your wishes :(
Number one, you said “lightBLUB” and that is funny. 
Number two, anyone can use any pronouns! The “preferred” in preferred pronouns refers to you. So if your preference is he/she that’s what your preferred (and therefore correct) pronouns are. 
I also don’t care for they/them that much, so I say “any” and if I get close to someone I’ll tell them that he or she is better than they for me.
And all of that is allowed. Do it however feels good to you.
you can use whatever pronouns feel right to you, nothing greedy about that. 

as for how to list them, it doesn’t matter, but the typical way to do it would be ~~”he/her” or “she/him”~~

edit: “he/she” or “she/he” is probably a better choice
Congratulations :) and it's nice to hear you have a supportive network.

I think choosing the pronouns you've chosen for yourself are valid - I think nobody genuine on here will berate you for being a ""half-hearted"" representative or anything like that, since your pronouns are your own and for you to feel comfortable with, first and foremost. Interestingly - and this isn't to try to convince you of anything, mind you, but just an injection of my own experiences - when I realised I was NB about 6(?) years ago, I was averse to they/them for about the same reason. I've since become a little less uncomfortable with it, though I think I still prefer he/ or she/. That said, I've had less time with the plural they drilled into my mind and am coming up to 20 :')

I'd also say letting others decide your pronouns isn't a sign of being indecisive, necessarily. But we'll all agree that you're totally allowed to like some pronouns more equally than others, or just be indifferent to a bunch of them. In terms of telling, I see people listing them in the format he/she although I do rarely see he/him/she/her.

TL;DR your pronouns are for you to feel comfortable! You're not obligated to use they/ if it's not you <3
In terms of pronouns u cant be greedy. There r ppl that use all pronouns. Theyre ur pronouns so ur good. Also in terms of the list typically they’re listed from which u prefer more (for example someone going by he/they pronouns prefer that others use he/him more often than they them) but if u dont care it doesnt matter.
If I used both those sets I'd list it as he/she, but some other options are:

* He/him or she/her

* He/him/she/her

* He/her

* He/him she/her

* He or she

Pronouns are often listed in order of preference so if you like one set more than the other you should take that into account
Yes, you're being greedy. I'm using she/her right now, you can't have it!

I'm kidding. Your choice of pronouns in no way diminishes their use by others. You are free to use whatever pronouns you wish.

As for how to list them, I use they and she and he for example, in that order of preference, so I put Sarah Valentine (they/she/he). It's implied from that context that I'm providing a list of pronoun sets, so I don't have to list out all five versions of each one in order to be understood. If I only used they/them/their/theirs/themself, I might say Sarah Valentine (they/them), providing just enough to make it clear I am specifying pronouns (not just ""they"" because that's ambiguous) but not providing unnecessary information (which the reader can infer once they know it's a pronoun set). This follows the conversation pattern of only providing information relevant to the message being transmitted, the same way it is odd to say ""asbestos-free breakfast cereal."" [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJEaMtNN_dM) did a cool video on this topic.

With that said, since you're using he/him and she/her, I would recommend against signing emails with No Evidence (he/she). The reason being that he/she is a slur way to refer to trans people. That only applies to that specific combination in that specific order, so she/he wouldn't be a problem. If you want to put he first, I would recommend No Evidence (he/him, she/her) formatting.

But, I am not in charge of the rules of pronouns. If you have a specific way you want to write them, you're free to do that. My intention isn't to tell you how you *must* use them, but rather to provide social context about how they're typically used, so that you can make an informed decision for yourself.
There are enough pronouns to go around for everyone. They're an unlimited resource and you can use whatever you feel comfortable with 😊
Not at all! It's not like there's a bowl of pronouns and once they're gone they're gone 😂

I think most people list them in the order of preference.  So he/she vs she/he would be indicating which you predominantly use, if you have a primary set.  As an example I use she/any pronouns, which means I have a preference for she/her pronouns and that's what my family calls me, but other pronouns are also correct and not misgendering so I let people use whatever they assume or feel comfortable with for me.
FWIW OP, i am middle aged AMAB and i use both she/her and he/him.  I usually write ""she/her or he/him"" when a text field will allow it.

In my case it's not about the plural, it's because they/them to me reads as a statement ""i am neither male nor female"". But i am *both* male and female, so they/them doesn't feel right.
do whatever you want man the gender vault isn’t gonna run out of pronouns
Pronouns are a matter of personal preference, and going by multiple sets is not even that uncommon. It's perfectly fine to want to stick to She/Her *and* He/Him.
No.
No. I use she/they pronouns.
he/she/him/her is the only one you listed that looks weird to me, but there is no one answer. You are well within perfectly fine territory, and how you choose to list your pronouns is highly personal. I have listed mine as *they/them/e/em* in the past, or as *they/them & e/em*, and most recently I have opted for a simple *e/they*. You could certainly list yours in any of those formats.
Hey, use any pronouns that sound right to you. While I'm cool with all pronouns except He/Him, I use She/They as my main ones, and still fussing around if there are any others that sound right to me. Do you and be happy.
Not greedy! Frankly, hearing that someone uses both of these makes me go ""Ok! Nice!"" more than anything. I use almost any pronouns as well and it's not greedy or anything, it's just my preference or what makes me feel like I can express myself best. You pick the pronouns that work for you.
Absolutely not greedy. Your pronouns are your own!
take as many pronouns as you want ! there are plenty for everyone ! (:
No lol

Others may find it confusing but so long as you clearly state the options (he OR she) it's on them.
As primarily a trans woman, I use she/her exclusively at work because I want people to understand ""woman"" before getting into more complicated gender that I don't need to explain to my employers 😝    
 but personally, with friends, or when people ask and really seem like they're interested in knowing rather than asking to be polite, I use she/her and he/him because I just want to be gendered, and I don't like hearing ""they/them"" used for myself.   
Out loud, I tend to say ""my pronouns are she/her and he/him"" in those circumstances ^^
*greedily claims ALL the pronouns for myself* 

... actually you can have he/she/him/her, i'll just keep they/them
Singular they is used more often than you might think.

One example:

""I had a doctor's appointment yesterday"" ""Oh, what did \*they\* say?""
I think it's impossible to actually exercise greed when you don't actually take sole ownership of something.
Like the concept is so abstract in first place because other people still get to use the pronouns and if using both helps express your fluidity or gender in anyway, then personally I think using both is the most effective way for you to share with people who you are authentically, which is objectively a good thing imo.
Its not greedy as you arent like... stopping someone else from being able to use these pronouns. And standardly the way to list them would be he/she
You are yourself nobody has any right to tell you which pronouns you should be using ❤️
Also the listing of pronouns is really up to you :)
Aaarrrghhh! I hate getting typos in my text, but I only ever notice after I've hit ""send"", no matter how many times I check! Still, it *is* always funny when it comes out as something pronouceable. In my defense, I didn't have my reading glasses on (yep, that old), so was having to squint at arm's length...  


I've been looking for a username that's a bit more relevant than the auto-generated one, so maybe serendipity has given me something to work with!
Isn't it usually he/she or she/he? From what I've observed, people tend to use subject/object for singular pronouns like she/her, they/them etc. but subject/subject(/subject etc.) for multiple like for example he/they (I use they/she and also use the order specifically for preference).
Thanks. I maybe didn't phrase my question clearly enough, but you've picked up on my main concern - what the NB or trans community might read into using those pronouns, e.g. if it's associated with a certain subculture, rather than thinking about what any TERF or GC might think of them.  


From what I'm reading here, there's no such unintended interpretation within our community. :D

It is good that my workplace is so supportive, and gives me a ""safe space"" to experiment and find my comfort zone. My employer encourages binary associating colleagues to join these networks as ""allies"" and display their pronouns in e.g. email signatures as a sign of solidarity. I've not done that *yet*, because of, well, this \^\^\^
[deleted]
seconded on your feelings about they/them! I don't like the feeling of being read as ""nonspecific gender,"" I really prefer when someone gives it their best to figure out how they would gender me (in cases with strangers/the public, where I'm not telling people beforehand).      
As a gender-expansive trans woman, ""she"" is usually ideal with strangers because it means I'm communicating effectively with my presentation, but I still prefer to hear ""he"" over ""they"" for myself because at least they've grappled with my gender and came to a conclusion.
oh yeah you’re right, my bad! i wrote that goin on very little sleep, thanks for catching that. 

though kinda like i did say, i feel like so long as you get one of each in there, people will get what you’re saying. don’t stress it too much op!
For me it's that I like the sound and feel of she/her best just in an isolated, personal context and I prefer family call me that, but if someone calls me he or they it means they see something other than my agab and correcting them (""it's actually she"") feels dysphoric and like I'm ruining it by basically saying ""no actually I'm a woman"" when that's not the truth.  So using she/any solves that problem because while he or they aren't my usual preferred pronouns, they are not incorrect or misgendering.  No need to correct or explain - I just go with whatever people decide to use.
Yeah, ultimately it shouldn't matter anyway as long as people get what you are saying, it was just a little thing that I noticed."	10uarfg	NonBinary	40	0.85	2023-02-05 11:52:49
With Pride Month wrapping up, let us remember queer activists Marsha P. Johnson and Leslie Feinberg. We owe them both so much.	"&#x200B;

# Marsha P. Johnson (1945-1992)

Johnson was a gay transvestite, drag queen, sex worker, and gay liberation activist. Her personal mantra was ""Pay It No Mind"". She expressed herself freely without reliance on binary gender stereotypes. Johnson was co-founder of the transgender rights organization, Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. She also co-hosted STAR House in 1972, the first homeless shelter for transgender and gender nonconforming youth. She also worked as an organizer and marshal with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in the 1980s.

Johnson was an active member of the Gay Liberation Front, which formed on the heels of the Stonewall rebellion. She regularly took part in the Christopher Street Liberation Day marches with friend and colleague Sylvia Rivera, until being barred by organizers in 1973 for crossdressing. In response Johnson and Rivera, led the procession in direct defiance of the orders. She became known as the ""Mayor of Christopher Street"", for her generosity and kindness. Fellow queens would often refer to her as their Drag Mother.

# Leslie Feinberg (1949-2014)

Feinberg was a butch lesbian, transgender rights activist, author, and speaker. Ze published the manifesto ""Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come"" in 1992 and proposed the adoption of the GLBT initialism, to improve visibility of the bisexual and transgender communities. Feinberg is credited with advancing the ""transgender umbrella"", inclusive of all people that defy the ""man-made boundaries of gender"" by invoking ""freedom of gender-self-expression"", thereby celebrating gender diversity beyond the limited framework of assigned biological sex.

In Feinberg's view, there was no singular transgender narrative since any perceived incongruity from the established gender norms and ideals of society placed one at elevated risk of harassment or discrimination, even moreso in combination with homosexuality or bisexuality. Transgender liberation was thus a tacit rejection of the cisheteronormative mandate, and a rallying call for trans men, trans women, butch lesbians, femme gay men, and other gender minorities to unite in a common cause. Susan Stryker described hir as ""one of the chief architects of the new transgender sensibility."""	"noice

Call CA governor to support Gender Recognition Act signature (allows for nb marker)	"The California SB-179 bill, the Gender Recognition Act, has been sitting on the governor's desk for signature for three weeks and only has four days left to be signed into law.  This bill creates non-binary category for gender on birth certificates and driver's licenses. It also streamlines process for transgender, intersex and non-binary Californians to obtain identification documents. 

Please consider calling the Governor's office in support of SB-179,
The number is Governor Jerry Brown: 
(916) 445-2841

Here is a call script:
Hello, my name is __________, from _______________, California. I am calling to urge the governor to sign SB 179, the Gender Recognition Act. This act will increase the efficiency by which our transgender and non-binary citizens can obtain gender documents that are accurate. Also, our community members who do not identify with binary gender categories must be protected under state law. Making ""non-binary"" an officially recognized gender will enable thousands of Californians to carry identification that describes them as they identify themselves. It will send a powerful message that America's future must be one of inclusion and protection for gender and sexual minorities. Thank you!

Wholesome pronouns story while playing a game with coworkers	"My coworkers and I were staying in the building (a theatre company) overnight so we decided to play some silly games with the addition of some drinks. We  started to play sardines which is like a reverse hide and seek. One person goes to hide and then everyone else splits up to try to find them then once you find the person you join them until everyone is huddled together waiting for the last finder. 

I was the starting hider and I went downstairs and under a counter and I'm just listening to people talk about finding me and one of my coworkers says ""man she's really hard to find!"" and one of my other friends replied ""actually TheJollySwitch uses they/them pronouns!"" which was immediately followed by ""well damn they're a really good hider""

It made me feel SO validated. It's not often I hear other people asserting my pronouns and it just made my whole week. 

I love my company and how accepting and inclusive everyone is. 

End of story I'm just happy 🥰

TL;DR Playing sardines and a coworker corrected someone on my pronouns while trying to find me"	"It's really amazing how to smallest of gestures can make a world of difference <3

Feeling invisible in workplace diversity group	 As an enby employee working on diversity and inclusion in my company, I feel completely left out and invisible after a recent survey and video about workplace violence only addressed the concerns of women, leaving out POC, PWD and LGBTQ+ individuals. During the presentation, myself and another gay colleague spoke up about the lack of representation for all marginalized groups, but a cis lesbian member dismissed our concerns and  suggested that we were being overly dramatic . This made me feel even more frustrated, especially because I had given a presentation in June to senior management on the alarming rates of violence and murder experienced by AMAB fem/trans individuals in the LGBTQ+ community, which was received with tears and appreciation.  I thought that the diversity group should already be aware of the issues I presented in my previous talk, and I shouldn't have to repeat the statistics for them to understand. However, maybe sharing my personal experiences of violence could help them see things from this perspective. I am just unsure if it's the best approach, and I would appreciate any advice or feedback from you all.	"The best approach is whichever you have the energy/bandwidth for. 

If the woman who dismissed your concerns is worth having a relationship with, you can try to call her in. Educate her, work on building consensus, discuss intention v. impact, etc.

If she isn't, explain that everyone's concerns need representation and work with the group to create a pre-approval process where you offer feedback before the group's work product is shared with a larger audience.
That's what I've been thinking and maybe I don't have the energy... Trying to figure this out first.   
I did try writing her and she didn't even bother answering ok. But message wasn't the best idea.   
The approval part is the biggest problem - we don't have any power over anything we do in our group, everything goes up to the HR execs and the board of directors...
Might message Allison over at Ask a Manager, too
Perfect! I’ve already found some posts there with some interesting ideas. Thanks
Happy to help.
Good luck!"	11kzi7r	NonBinary	38	0.98	2023-03-07 13:35:00
"Front Desk called me a ""female"" in front of my client"	"For context, I started work at a franchised massage chain as a licensed Massage Therapist, and they knew from the start that I am non-binary and have they/them pronouns. 

At this massage facility, they are very accommodating when it comes to inclusivity but they have failed on a few accounts. One being, when a client requests a female massage therapist, they put them on my schedule. 

With doing that, not only do all my coworkers know my assigned gender at birth, now I have to put up a more ""femme"" mask when talking with the clients that requested a female in the first place. 

I took Testosterone for about 4 months so my voice has deepened and it puts me in difficult position when talking with my clientele. 

I'm not quite sure why I'm posting this but I feel this needs to be talked about, coming from a health care perspective.

I don't post a lot of things but I want to hear from y'all what you would do in this situation. I do want to talk to my supervisor but I am pretty nervous. 

Why can't people just be more inclusive??"	"I think it’s a very good idea to write up a formal letter airing these grievances and send it via email. 

You can keep record of emails. This is important. If it happens face to face, they can say whatever happened didn’t. Email is an insurance policy.
People aren't inclusive bc society is organized around binary genders. So we are a in  between category that is not recognized except in some progressive situations. 

Your profession involves touch and vulnerability, and some clients will want a female for what they feel is safety.  You are right to put on the safe femme persona for them, as your mission is first to make them feel safe and relax, and then to do your work. 

They are not there to affirm their therapist's gender, but to take advantage of what that gender means to them.

The office may not want to say"" is a nonbinary female ok?"" since no one will even know what that means. If you are becoming more masculine in presentation then it is going to disqualify you from some patients, but in general,  being nb is also a positive- in other words many nb patients, knowing you were available, would request  you since you would understand them and presumably touch them better! 

 Being gender vatiant is difficult, though, and it operates like race- people have strong feelings and fears that are not easy to get past.
Thank you! This gives a lot of insight.
I agree with what you're saying, but I would like to add that I have been a massage therapist for almost 10 years. I was massaging while I was even transitioning at one point. The problem isn't making sure the client is comfortable because God knows I know how to do that. 

I haven't had a client tell me that they were uncomfortable because I create a safe space for anyone (fully understanding the reason behind asking for a female therapist, not simply out of preference but possible trauma, etc) 

It's the facility around working on my clientele. My coworkers, the front desk, my supervisor. The moment they put me down as ""female requested approved"" the front desk thought it was fine to tell the client in front of me that I was a female. That was the problem. Not the client. 

As a healthcare professional my first and only priority is for the healing of my clients. 

I have massaged some very non-progressive people and that's fine, as long as I can rid their body of a tight muscle they've had for 20 years. My job is done. 

I'm just extremely tired of having to teach my coworkers what's wrong and right, and then for them to immediately call me by my wrong pronouns as if I haven't dealt with this pain for the last 7 years.
You could suggest to your job to change it from ""female request"" to ""request for not a male massage therapist"" then the staff just have to say ""here's a non-male massage therapist for you""
I'm sorry-that is a painful and lingering emblem of some combination of disrespect and ignorance and laziness,  I misunderstood the problem.
No worries! I'm just glad to discuss it with someone. It's nice when people listen. Rarely people can even do that much. And I stated my posted kinda strangely so that's partially my fault"	118ce3a	NonBinary	37	0.96	2023-02-21 18:29:45

UPDATE: Name change meeting with HR	"It could not have gone any better. This organization strives to very inclusive and supportive. She told me about the only requirements they have. First, they can't update payroll until social security is updated. However, I can change my name everywhere else prior to the official name change happens. All decisions are left up to me. She had some suggestions. So, basically she handed me the ball and said give it back when you are ready and how you would like to proceed. I could have said I was going to transition and would have gotten the same support. I really love working at this place now. My whole attitude about working and job quality has changed. Don't get me wrong. I always had a good work ethic but now I am encouraged to be even better.

I came out to her as part of the discussion. Shared my story of how I realized I was gender fluid and nonbinary.

Also, had more discussions at lunch about gender identity today. One coworker asked me about the name Riley. So, I told him about my plans and desire to change it. He offered to start calling me Riley right then. But, I asked not to until the rest of the team knows. It was so validating hearing him say my name out loud. Hearing both first and last name together sounded so right to me.

So, as far as work is concerned. My next step is I am waiting for my supervisor to return from vacation. I will then have a talk with her about my name.

Then, I will need to tell my family of my plans. After that, I will begin the legal process. I have decided to make my birthday be the day I start officially asking people to start calling me Riley. I may share with people on one to one basis before if it naturally comes up."	"Congrats! Hope next steps go just as smoothly.

College Syllabus Pronoun Policy	"  Included in my social psych class syllabus. Is this normal? Probably. Higher Ed really doesn't know what to do with itself, does it...

**""PREFERRED PRONOUN STATEMENT:** Pervasive gender normativity is reflected in our use of language, and language instruction is one of the spaces in which such traditional structures are reinforced. At Wake Tech, we strive to be respectful and inclusive. While the learning outcomes for this course require us to use language in its normative form, I encourage you to be aware of the implications of such norms and to be respectful of your classmates' and instructors' requests. Please contact me right away should you have any preferred name and/or preferred pronoun by which you would like to be addressed. Although there are limitations to what the language allows grammatically, I will try to find an appropriate solution.""

""...require us to use language in its normative form...""  - Like, as opposed to what?

""Although there are limitations to what the language allows grammatically, I will try to find an appropriate solution."" - Oh how thoughtful of you.

...ya'll... 

The thing is, I'm sure there's a Linguist out there somewhere that could tear this apart."	"That's a very long winded way to say a whole lot of nothing.
It doesn't take a linguist. There is no ""normative"" version of English, and no central authority that governs its usage. My name and pronouns are not ""preferred"", they are my name and pronouns. There's no preference involved, if you don't use them you're inaccurate.

Grammar rules for things like whether ""they"" is singular or plural are *descriptive*, meaning they describe how the words are used in common usage. They are not *prescriptive*, meaning they don't define how someone can use a word and if they don't follow the rule then they're ""englishing wrong."" Language is a collaborative experiment in passing information from one person to another, and every individual speaks their own unique dialect of their language. There is no single authority that can declare what is or is not ""proper grammar."" But, if you're interested in appeals to authority, here are a few that are widely considered the most prominent authorities on how to use English:

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.

Feel free to pass this information along to the moron who wrote that.
This is a professorial way of saying the person doesn’t believe in they/them pronouns
It honestly doesn't even matter what the current or ""traditional"" rules (I don't even know WTF that means) of English are because language changes with the people using it and the generation. Like colloquialisms are a thing, generational slang is a thing, different types of English are a thing, etc. Like if you put multiple native speakers in a room from various places, their English isn't going to be the same. 
Also language is a tool that we as humans use to communicate our experiences to others, and it changes with time. This kinda just sounds like a bunch of ""fancy"" shit with an undertone of, ""we'll try out best to respect your preferred name and pronouns unless it collides with a professor's personal beliefs, but because they aren't stupid and we don't wanna get sued, we're just going to say that it's *difficult* to waiver from *traditional* English.""
At first I thought, oh this is great! Until the last sentence, wtf. We are asking you to use the right pronouns, not bend the limitations of language. Come on now.
Hey, I'm new here but I do have a linguistics degree.

Sounds like this professor is skeptical of singular they being used as a pronoun for an individual due to prescriptivist ideas (aka ""language is static and change is ruining it"").

The truth is that language use is very descriptivist in nature (aka ""common usage makes it true""). Like how in the southeast US, if you order a Coke at a restaurant they may ask ""What kind?"" and you can answer with ""Sprite"". In that context, Coke is commonly a shorthand for soda pop.

Their statement of ""normative"" English really means ""what I perceive as typical English that doesn't make me think about my words before I use them"". English isn't standardized in the same ways other languages may try to be, no matter how rigid some people try to be about it.

If they're so insistent on rules, I have some ideas to push back at them but realistically all this does in my experience is make prescriptivists mad lol
Syllabus time is vibe check time and this one is rancid. Switch out if you can.
Getting fence sitter vibes here, it doesn't take this many words to say ""I respect your pronouns""

Its like they are afraid of hurting conservatives or something.
Other people have done a great job of tearing this nonsense apart but I want to point out a piece of context. This is a social psych class, and the professor makes reference to the 'learning outcomes.' I THINK part of what they are trying to say is that some of the actual content in the course will be taught in gendered terms.
i'm always impressed by admin's ability to take pages and pages to say absolutely nothing
Wake Tech in central NC? Yikes, but I can’t say I’m surprised. Sorry friend.
They should be using what’s normal to you, instead of misgendering you? And I think the second part is in response to neo-pronouns
It sounds like a very long-winded way of saying that they want to respect your pronouns. I'm confused about why you wanna go after someone for being an awkward but seemingly willing ally.
Would this happen to be a language class by any chance? I'm wondering if there's a genuine basis for this where it's come up before during that course so to get ahead of it the teacher warns everyone that a lot of the course content is gendered language
I think it's the last sentence that mostly gets me...the idea that the prof would 'try' to find an 'appropriate' solution...to what? It's implying that students will ask for ridiculous or impossible accommodations.
What more do you want?
Thank you. You know these things, and I know these things, but I'm thinking I'd have a reeaaallly hard time in this class if I challenged a Social Psychology prof on this, lol. But all your points are very helpful. I wish there was like, a person I could have stand up for student rights. Not a lawyer per se, just something like, ""Hey your policy is bunk, you shall be receiving a letter from my student-supporter-person who is more educated than you so we can resolve this matter promptly.""
Kinda? It's a 'professional' way of maintaining control. Like, ""we want to make sure you know that we are completely in control of which pronouns get to be used"" Whether they want extra credit for being cool and 'allowing' your pronouns, or if they want to feel justified in refusing to use them, the main purpose is to let everyone know who is in charge.
Yeah they clearly felt the need to write a policy, so they could say they had one, but they do a hard, butt-splitting straddle between, 'we support student rights' and 'we don't actually have to deal with this if we don't want to, legally, we're just being nice, ya know'
Yup exactly. The only thing a 'pronoun policy' needs to say is that the professor respects pronouns and expects other students to as well. Otherwise, it's inclusion is just to rub salt in the wound and express dominance over the perceived 'problem'. It's interesting you thought it was 'great' ... absolutely no judgement, but keep in mind it was probably written to trick you into thinking just that.
Skeptical, lazy, deeply transphobic, who knows honestly. I don't know them yet, or what the point was, it just set me off and is making me uneasy on the first day of class. I don't plan on addressing the professor personally at all. If there was a way I could address it seriously while remaining anonymous, I would, and I'd further research/expand on your ideas. Thanks!
That would be nice but, no other sections of this course and already bought the ebook. Also, I was just thinking, schools should straight up provide a list of all professors who will freely respect your identity, no holds barred. I know they never will...it'd be cool though.
My thoughts exactly. But why even write it at all.
This is how I read it too. It seemed like a thoughtful way of saying they will use peoples preferred pronouns, but a lot of the material was made/taught before that was common so expect some of it to be gendered or not fully up to date. 

&#x200B;

The professor can't do anything about important past pieces of work being conducted without thought to modern gender expression. As much I support people living how they want to live or whatever they feel is true to them, I have met individuals, especially young ones, that can't grasp this nuance.
Yeah I have to agree. It sounds like the class requires discussing pronouns and other normative gendered language, and also assessing how that normative language affects people. That makes perfect sense in a social psych class.

This reads to me like a prof who has spent *a lot* of time studying queer theory, and has lost touch with what this sounds like to a layperson. I have a feeling the “what the language grammatically allows” is less about neopronouns and more about like, nonpronouncable symbols for names and pronouns (ex. The artist formerly known as Prince).

It could turn out that this prof really is just a jerk, but I would urge OP to give them the benefit of the doubt on day 1.
Oh, you know it? Or did you do a google?
No, psychology. All classes are taught in 'normative' language, why would this 'policy' be necessary?
probably a safety valve to keep transphobic jerks from picking edgy preferred pronouns.
A pony
If your school has a DEI department or provost or something, contact them! Doing exactly what you propose is literally their job. If somehow your school doesn't have such a person, is there an LGBTQ+ group on campus who might be able to help? Failing even that, how about a queer person in the English department who can bonk them over the head with how stupid their notions of proper grammar are?
What I was referring to was the whole thing about normative language and still having to use normative language but “trying to find a solution.” For me that sounds like a fancy callout of they/them pronouns as well as neopronouns. Saying this as an instructor at a college. It’s strongly reads as gussied up bigotry from my perspective.
Yeah exactly. Very sus
Well yeah it did absolutely use language that could be used to defend against criticism.
Sorry to hear that. So weird coming from a social psych class too. :( That professor should know change and respect are parts of society and to not do psychological harm. Could maybe report and review them a ton if they don't respect you over the course.
It reads like a person who has spent a lot of time studying queer theory? How? The topic of assessing how normative language affects people does seem like a great topic for a social psych class...when we get to that lesson...but why is it written as a policy? Why is it written that they will, ""try to find an appropriate solution""? Wouldn't a person who has spent a lot of time studying queer theory know that queerness is not a problem to be solved?
Used to live there, and a number of my friends did courses or degrees at Wake Tech.
That would be nice I 'spose. I'll try to assume this was one of those awkward, ""I'm a cis person not really thinking things through about being a good ally but at least I'm trying to be a good ally"" things.
I might look into some things further, at the very least, to spread awareness. Most of the policies on syllabi are department-wide, so I'd first have to go to the department head of Psychology to ask. Then, I'm not sure pitting the English dept against the Psych department would work (fun idea, but prob not realistic.) The thing is, no one wants to play this game, so why would they bother putting a 'pronoun policy' in at all? It's like, they tryna start shit because their syllabi aren't edgy enough?
Yup. College prof of 15 years. 

OP, can you switch classes or take this class with a different prof? I like to advise my students that just like we might have red flags for relationships in dating or friendship or family or medical care, as we get older we can also assert the same agency with our professional collaborators. That includes your teachers. You can choose to not take a class with a processor asserting their (TAKE THAT GRAMMAR POLICE) bigotry in the fucking syllabus, if there are alternative routes. You can also choose to do so if you think this is the smoothest academic path for you. 

I mean I chose to not associate. One of my colleagues is deeply and openly anti-queer in every way imaginable.  A couple years ago I told my chair I wasn’t attending any college function that he was going to be at. My chair was like yup I get it and I haven’t had to see him since. It did take me like ten years of therapy to get to that point, but it did make my life a lot better when I set professional red flags and did my best to honor them in my choices, just like I did personal ones!
I doubt they will disrespect me personally, I have no intention of making myself known other than a name with a grade, it's fully online.
My guess is that they want to warn students because it’s a topic that can be really uncomfortable for some people. And again, my guess is that it’s about more complex identity situations. For example: translating names/pronouns that are not words into names/pronouns that can be verbalized in class. Maybe ‘solution’ isn’t the best possible way to talk about that, but in the context of a classroom where there will be frequent discussion, it would require some strategizing to accommodate.

I could absolutely be wrong, but I’ve had a prof who had stuff in the syllabus I thought was questionable, but when they explained it in person, it made sense. It turned out they were accounting for situations that I was previously unaware of. That might be what’s going on here.

Or they might just suck. All I’m saying is to go meet them and see what they have to say about it, and then decide if they suck.
Ah. I'm not originally from around here. As far as affordability and quality of education, it seems pretty fair if not better than other cc's I've been to. I wasn't expecting the slap in the face this morning, lol. I'm curious if your non-surprise is from this school's culture specifically, or just, you know, generally the area?
Ombudsperson (possibly ombudsman...) could be another person it might be helpful to talk to if you do want a third party! They're supposed to be like a mediator afaiu
I certainly appreciate you being a prof that sets boundaries. I've had the privilege of quitting a workplace that was religious homophobic (mostly secretly), so I understand making conscious decisions about what community I'm supporting.

But, this is not the largest school and no other sections/profs are available. I hate to say I'm \*that\* poor that I can't afford to loose textbook money but, I already paid for the ebook and can't return it. Not to mention, I just really wanted to take this subject. Online ed sucks because I don't have contact with other students/profs on campus to get a feel ahead of time which profs are red flags. I'm planning on just keeping my head down and trudging through, even if we get to the section on gender and it's all cringe."	1043oot	NonBinary	34	0.96	2023-01-05 16:49:15

Small successes	"I'll keep this brief. I work in a cishet male-dominated workplace, a small company, in the rust belt USA. I've heard all of sorts things ranging from your typical no-homo jokes to derogatory remarks about transgender people and the LGBTQIA+ community in general. This is pervasive around the main customer service department with most of the C-Suite/Team Leads either being not a part of the conversations or these conversations happening out of earshot or when they're in a meeting or out of the office.

Yesterday I had a sit down with the customer service director and brought up my discomfort. While I didn't feel like it was my time to come out, I did mention how sad it made me feel to hear disparagement and came at it from it being an unprofessional attitude. I asked if we could introduce diversity training and other forms of inclusivity around the office. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the CSD agreed and was upset to hear that these sorts of things had been going on. The CSD mentioned that diversity training is a great start and it's going to be pitched to the executive team ASAP. I was also told my honesty and concern was appreciated because they don't want that kind of toxicity to be harmful to the culture.

We'll see if anything comes of it, but it's small successes of being open and honest and not being scoffed at or sighed at helped me feel validated.

TL;DR Bigoted talk from cishets, oh my; opened up honestly and ended in a positive light"	"That's awesome!! It's a good strategy as well if one doesn't want to come out in the office for whatever reason, to cite ""unprofessional attitude"" as the reason for coming forward to address this subject.

I hope the training helps to improve the culture of your workplace.
thats so great!!!!
It's one thing that it hurts me personally, but with the kind of things I've heard folks say it is absolutely an unprofessional attitude. It's been a bit of a struggle being myself in a workplace where people are actively degrading others.
Thank you!! I want to stay hopeful it makes some sort of a difference. c:

My theater director is being super considerate of me--even though I'm not out to her!	"Need to gush!! (TLDR at the bottom)

I'm doing a production of A Christmas Carol, and I asked the directer if she could cast me as a man, and she said she would take it into account. Unfortunately because of the cast we have and time issues, she did have to cast me in a female roll. However she made a point to make sure I was okay with that and explained the reasoning, and she was so wonderul about it? I felt really respected and understood. I feel like she's guessed that I'm some form of trans, (I'm not super subtle, just not ""out"") and she's been really awesome about it. I'm starting to feel like I can come out to the group.

We recently also made an official code of conduct, and gender identity and sexuality are mentioned on the ""don't discriminate"" list. Plus the gender options on the forms now include ""other""! 

I'm nervous about coming out, but I might go for it. It's just a scary thought to be the first openly trans person the group has ever had. (to my knowledge)

TLDR: My theater group is becoming more inclusive, and the directer (who is a good friend of mine) has been super respectful of what gender of character I'd like to play"		ded8do	NonBinary	30	0.96	2019-10-07 02:21:15
Why I'm taking feminizing hormones even though I'm not a woman	"So I've been on hormones full time for about 5 months now and I felt inspired to share my story of how I got to where I am today. Not because I think it's a special story or anything, but to help myself reflect and also to write down an experience that might possibly be of help to someone here, somehow. The focus is mostly on hormones, but I also discuss the relevant parts of me realizing and accepting my identity as nonbinary as well. TL;DR at the top, text essay follows.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I am not a woman. Nor am I a man. But being on hormones makes me a happier person. That's pretty much all there is to it.

\-2 years ago: AKA La Big Crack-

I'm sitting in an auditorium as someone is giving a talk on gender inclusiveness. He puts up a slide with a definition for the word 'male' (in the most literal sense, no agenda there), and as I stare at this slide it hits me. ""I am not a man."" Something clicks. I'd always been uncomfortable to varying degrees around most other guys and with the general concept of masculinity as I'd seen most men portray it. I actually grew up specifically trying to NOT be like what I saw in a lot of other guys. And so realizing I was not a man was honestly not the biggest shock. It was more of a quiet revelation. ""Aha, that explains a lot."" After coming to accept this newfound realization however, a flood of other questions came. ""Am I woman?"" ""Do I want to be a woman?"" ""If I'm not a man, what am I?"" And really that's what most of my questions boiled down to, and I left that auditorium with one elephant of a question hanging over my head. ""What am I?"" 

I spent the next few days in a state of internal chaos, and honestly mostly searching through as many trans and gender related subreddits as I could to learn as much as I could about other people's experiences and what they'd been through. About a week later, after sponging up as much information as I could handle, I was still pretty lost. All I knew was that I wasn't a man. I didn't know how to feel like what I ""was"" though. I just knew that I wanted to be more feminine. And so I decided that I would proceed under the assumption that I was a trans woman, and if/when I hit a point where I didn't want to be more feminine I could go from there, but I honestly couldn't see where that point would be. After going out with a friend I cried to her while confessing that I thought I was trans, which I had begun to convince myself of at the time. 

Luckily my school was pretty liberal and well-off, and I actually found a program through the gender services department that matched you with a 'mentor' of your preferred gender and/or sexuality (to the best of their ability, as these people were doing this on a volunteer basis). Through this I met a non-binary mentor, and started attending a weekly support group for trans and nonbinary folk. Around the same time I was able to find an absolutely delightful therapist experienced with gender issues, who I met with every two weeks. 

As the year progressed these parties helped me to learn a lot. I came out to a couple of close friends who I knew would be supportive (again, as transgender) and - at the recommendation of my therapist - started experimenting with presentation and pronouns and names in very very closed settings. The more I experimented, the more sure I became that I was trans. I liked wearing women's clothes. I started shaving my legs and \*TMI WARNING\* pubes, and generally liked being called by other names and pronouns, although I felt mixed feelings being called them while presenting as male. Something kept sticking to the back of my mind though. Even though I wasn't a man, I wasn't particularly bothered by people treating me as one (besides the pronouns, because those were definitely wrong). To be honest I'd never really cared about how others perceived me, and as time went on it became more and more apparent that social perception was a nonfactor in how I felt about my identity. 'Passing' was a concept that started to lose its appeal at this point. Sure I would probably be happy if I'd been born with a female body, but ultimately I didn't care to go through the effort of having others perceive me as female so long as I was happy with myself. I have a surprisingly deep and booming voice for someone my size which I love, and I had no intention of going through voice training if I didn't have to. That would definitely throw a wrench in presenting female as well. At some point I thought ""I'm just me."" 

&#x200B;

\-1 year ago: AKA (Prescription) Drugs-

At this point I'm relatively comfortable with where I'm headed. I know that I like female clothing, affirming pronouns, and not having to give a hoot about the way I sit, because I like crossing my legs dammit. Still presenting as male though. I'd been using some old clothes that a friend had been kind enough to let me have, but didn't really have anything of my own besides some leggings I bought at Meijer in a spontaneous moment of societal defiance. And also because they were near the self-checkout. I definitely didn't have the money to do much to my wardrobe though, and wasn't really ready to start making waves with my presentation until I was sure of where I wanted to go with it. In light of this my therapist brought up hormones one day. ""Yeah, that actually sounds like a good idea."" At this point I'm still operating under the assumption that I'm a trans woman, although starting to realize that that's not entirely accurate. But since I was still trying to determine my 'transition' goals I figured it wasn't worth rocking the boat too much right then. Anyways, I definitely knew I wanted my body to be more feminine. Plus from what I'd read about the effects of estrogen on mood and emotions they sounded like things I would benefit from. Thus, I went to an informed consent clinic and got a prescription for estradiol (estrogen) and spiro (an anti-androgen, lowers testosterone but isn't a hormone per say). After just being on spiro for about two weeks to test the waters there hadn't been many changes, but I'd noticed my facial hair growing a little bit slower, slightly softer skin, and was starting to feel some light sensitivity in my nipples. Happy with the other changes but not quite ready to deal with the weight of having breasts (haha, get it?) I had a mild freakout and quit spiro altogether for several months. 

Fast forwarding past those months and I'm ready to give hormones another try. I hadn't been on spiro long enough to notice any significant changes, and I definitely felt like I needed to give estrogen a fair shake before making a final verdict on them. This time I took both estrogen and spiro for a month, and it was only when I actually noticed a slight (but real) amount of breast growth that I stopped, as I still wasn't ready to have anything change that could affect my day-to-day life. However, I learned a lot in that month. I definitely liked all of the physical changes. Slower facial/body hair growth, softer skin, plus the thought of having breasts was actually exciting once I realized it was close to becoming a reality. I'd also definitely had a generally increased mood. It's less like I got more emotional and more like some kind of weight I'd always felt in my head was being lifted off, and I could just breathe easier. It's hard to describe, but it was absolutely liberating. Since middle school there's always been something in my head that's made it easy for me to get depressed and start feeling apathetic. As time went on it had gotten better - mostly because I'd learned how to deal with it - but this was the first time I felt like it was actually leaving me. That was what really did it. This was what made me sure I wanted to continue with hormones full-time at some point, even though I wasn't quite ready then.

As this year progresses I'm still experimenting with things with my friends. At one point I'm with a very close female friend, and she starts talking about doing my makeup and watching Disney movies in a very well meaning and eager-to-help-with-the-female-experience kind of way (this is the person who gave me her old clothes). As she was going on I started to get uncomfortable. ""Is this what being a girl is?"" ""Do I have to start liking these things?"" ""Why can't we just hangout like normal?"" I did take her up on her offer though, as I'd had yet to do something I would consider as 'strongly feminine' as this night sounded like it was going to be. And as I'm sitting there, staring at the mascara and foundation on my face in a mirror I became afraid. Not of looking like a man in makeup, but of simply hating how I looked compared to how I wanted to look. I knew that if I was going to 'be' a woman I was always going to be unhappy with the discrepancy between my actual appearance and my desired presentation. To be happy as a woman I was going to try and reach unrealistic goals and would always be paranoid that something was off. The worst part was knowing that even if I did everything perfectly, even if I could hit all of those unrealistic goals, it might not be enough. I would not be happy as a woman, plain and simple. It was this day I accepted myself entirely. ""I am not a woman."" ""I'm just me.""

&#x200B;

\-Present day: AKA Freedom-

Today I've been on hormones full-time for 5 months. I graduated school and recently met a new endo who doubled my doses, which I've been on for the past month or so. And I am so fucking happy. Because I am not a woman and this treatment is something which is actively improving my life anyways. I'm happier with my body, I feel much more in tune with my emotions and general sense of being, and living is more enjoyable. I laugh and cry so much more than I used to, even if it's sometimes because of silly things (it is not unusual for one to cause the other either). I am on this medication because it's just that. Medicine. It makes me feel better. About myself, and about life. The ONLY time I have missed a dose this whole time is because I had to unexpectedly sleep at a friend's place once. I don't have a reminder set on my phone, and I will admit that sometimes when I'm tired I forget about it until I see it on my nightstand, but I have taken it twice a day every day because I am EXCITED to take it. It does not make me more or less nonbinary, but it does make me more me.

I am still presenting male in public, but I have a job now, and you can bet your sweet ass I have an Amazon shopping list of women's clothes I'm going to start ordering off of. Not because I want to present as a woman, but because I want to present as me. And I like women's clothes. I also like some men's clothes. Personally I do want to aim for something more androgynous, but I don't know exactly what that looks like for me yet. Odds are that hormones will naturally draw me to the more feminine side eventually (I doubt I can hide my boobs forever), but I'm prepared to deal with that when it comes. It's worth it.

After 6 months of growing my hair out, today I got it cut with an LGBT friendly stylist. To be honest I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Don't get me wrong the cut is excellent, but I also really enjoyed it being longer. It's okay though, because I know I'm learning more about what I want. Hormones were a big part of that process. And even though I don't know exactly where I'm going yet, I am so fucking excited to get there."	"Thank you so much for sharing this. It helps me to understand why people might present in some way rather than another. And it reminded me that people can be at different points of their journey. I am cis gendered and I am so thankful that I get the opportunity to read about a unique personal perspective on the non-binary experience. I am a therapist and I am trying to be open and welcoming for all kinds of gender identities. But sometimes it is hard to figure stuff out from a privileged point of view and I catch myself questioning certain non-conforming presentations or I get confused and lose empathy. Your post helped me to correct my narrow view once again. So thanks! Your post will have a direct positive impact on the future therapies of all non-binary folks who come to my practice for healing. I wish you all the best, wherever life may take you!
Thank you for sharing your story. It's reassuring to hear someone try something and learn and grow and try something else all while getting closer to being just *themselves*.
Thank you very much for sharing.
I really appreciate you sharing this. I relate to a lot of your story, and I still have a lot to go in my journey and self acceptance. I hope to get on E soon and presenting in whatever way I'm comfortable with. It's easy to forgo our own true feelings and emotions and instead fixate on the pressures of society. It's easy for me to dress somewhat femme and be myself, but when I think of ""being a woman"" it creates all these expectations for myself that are so unbearable where I am right now. And even if I do feel somewhat like a woman, but nonbinaryness is something I take a lot of comfort in.
Suuuper late to this post but this has been phenomenally helpful for me mostly because you’ve shown me that I can try hormones and then stop if I don’t like them. 
I’m in similar position of enby and have so much hesitation over starting something that’s so permanent and change making. Knowing I can actually try them and stop if I like is amazing! Thank you so much.
Please share your before and after pics, as I also want to do this
Thank you so much! Best of luck with your patients, I'm glad this was able to help!
Yeah, staying true to yourself is definitely something that can be easy to lose sight of, especially in modern society. Glad you got something out of this!
You're welcome!
Yeah, I think there's definitely something to be said for feeling comfortable with your gender in relation to yourself. So cheers to us for finding comfort in our nonbinary-ness!
Hey, I'm so sorry it took me this long to reply to this. Honestly I have a lot of reservations about linking my face to my online presence so I needed some time to think about it. I do want to post a before/after in the future, but not until things have changed some more and I'm pretty much settled into how I think I want to present. This will hopefully be within the year, but in addition to the hormones it'll take piercings, tattoos, wardrobe updates, and figuring out a hairstyle I like before I get there. 

I think it's also worth saying that if you specifically are interested in the changes from hormones rather than my personal ""transition"", I'm doing the same kind of treatment that a transgender woman would, and there are other subreddits  ( r/MtF and r/transtimelines are probably the most relevant ) where the collective experiences are probably more useful than just my own anyways."	dkdecf	NonBinary	34	1.0	2019-10-20 02:06:03
Just a little vent about trying to be in a spiritual circle but constantly running into trans-exclusive language. Looking for some solidarity. :/	"So an acquaintance of mine pos d that she was hosting a dance workshop intended for “women and non-binary people” and I was so stoked because I’ve been looking for a dance space that at least just doesn’t have cisgender men (I’m in trauma recovery for this). 

But when I dug further it turned out that she still kept using terms like “female/woman-bodied person” and “womb space”, etc and realized ultimately she actually isn’t prepared to host non-binary or trans people without using offensive / simply inaccurate language and I’m just so disappointed. 😭 I wanted it to be genuinely inclusive of trans women and enbies so bad!!!

Anyone else so tired of trying to get involved in a group spiritual practice only to find that goddess-worship seems to be the end all be all in neo-pagan / new age spaces?"	"If they mean women and nonbinary people,  would they be comfortable with a masculine nonbinary person who was amab? Or a transmasculine person with a full beard?

 Usually when people say women/nonbinary folk they mean ""people I think are women"" and they have no clue as to what nonbinary people can even look like. It fucking sucks how much terf belief seemingly regular folks have.
In my experience, ""women and nonbinary people"" really just means AFAB. That's all they care about is that fact that you have the same parts. It's a red flag honestly.
When people say ""women and nonbinary people"" or ""all genders except cis men"", they perceive everyone they're inviting as women. My university has a sorority that says it includes everyone but cis men, but they still refer to all their members as sisters.
> womb space

🤮

Ugh so tired of white cis neopagan bioessentialism erasing maGes (marginalized genders)
As a spiritual person myself, it's kinda weird how spiritualists fetishize the womb and the physical body so much.

Shouldn't spirituality be about the immaterial? The mind and the soul and the universe?

I'm not saying body appreciation has no place in spirituality, but in the end it's just a vessel.

Also they put so much emphasis on the divine feminine which is fine, but they never really acknowledge the divine masculine or divinity beyond gender. After all, God/the Universe is beyond human constructs like gender IMO.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. And I'm sorry you went through that.
YES.  SO much yes.  Almost as bad as yours, the tongue in cheek description summary: ""this course is for self-identifying women to discuss the power of our menstrual cycles, because were born with power"" 

Why even try to use the inclusive language of ""self identifying women"" when you clearly dont mean that.  Even worse when it goes on to invite men to ""discover the power of the women in their lives or learn about their own feminine energy""

Like, wtf, I may be male at birth, and dont have a cycle, but dont try and downplay it that you dont want the male-bodies there.  And sure, the patriarchy sucks, but that doesnt mean we cant at least relate a little, or want to be involved in fun discussions cis-men cant seem to fathom.  Just because I have a penis doesnt mean I want to bang you.  I want that safe space too away from YOUR judgement of my presentation.
I was in a lot of groups like that before my egg cracked and now I can’t even tolerate being around those people. Sucks to realize the spiritual groups I was part of are fundamentally incompatible with my authentic self.
Yea these are the same new age people who think womb is the root word of women.
Spiritual groups generally have a different approach towards dealing with emotions and this also creates a different viewpoint towards gender identity and transitioning. 

I think you need to start your own group!
Is female not accurate? I'm afab and when talking about ""women's"" issues and anatomy I usually say women and females or biological females. I'm confused how often I run in to the word female being used interchangeably when referring to gender and biological sex (especially when sites ask for them and include female/male when asking for gender). I personally use male/female in reference to biological sex only. I'd say words or titles referring to anatomy like wombs to be inclusive of ppl with that anatomy. Then again, idk. I don't like male/female being used to mean man/woman, it's confusing.
Yeah it definitely appears to be the latter 😏 they even said they were trying to be inclusive but weren’t up on all the “new age language” 😒. They ended up editing the post to not use the word non-binary because they realized they didn’t know what they were talking about…
This. Anyone uses that language, I'm immediately gonna assume they're a TERF or at the very least have uncritically absorbed some really TERF-y beliefs without recognizing where those originated.
This is the first time I’ve seen a local spiritualist bother offering something to “non-binary people”. Good to know it’s I guess common for these types of creators to try to use woke language without actually being educated on what they’re saying and what it means
Exactly! Such a problem. I have been in 1 environment where when they said “women and non-binary” they really meant it and that was Recovery Dharma (the wokest addiction / codependency / eating disorder recovery group out here IMHO, in case anyone’s curious!)
SO TIRED! 😭
This is so weird to say but spiritual cismen are often more accepting and lovable than ciswomen in spiritual areas for some reason?

I embody the divine masculine “mother”,  which means a masculine energy that has like mother energy also. Multiple energy readers told me this who actually were cismen! Spiritual cis women sometimes get uncomfortable by my energy since I project masculinity that feels motherly. Leading to misgendering and I guess threatened? I’ve seen so many practices where they totally ignore masculinity?? And I don’t know why? Feels good though that I have blended energy to where energy readers get confused. Sorry if this sounds dumb, I’m just heavily involved in spiritual groups and attend a lot of meetups lol.

Short version: I never fit in women spiritual spaces due to my aura/energy
This is essentially exactly how I feel! For me spirituality is about the Great Mystery. I have no reason to think such a great mysteries operate within our very limited and very binary view of gender? Do the rest of the animals on the planet need to balance their “divine masculine and divine feminine”…? (I consider all animals to be sacred and connected to source sort of… I also always feel like maybe none of it is close to real and I’m alright not knowing) anywho. A ramble for a ramble! 😂 thanks for sharing your experience
Yeah!
Yeeaahh… that’s what it’s starting to feel like for me too. I’ve even seen a lot of Instagram pages that my new age friends make start out sounding like the info and events or offerings are for any gender with like no mention of women and they keep slowly turning to this sort of situation and just majorly disappointing me
Accurate.
I think you’re probably right!
This is the vibe I’m getting!
I used to lean towards paganism but I left for a variety of reasons . It seemed like labels like pagan and terf are almost one and the same. Paganism has the same dualistic system as any other religious system and it doesn’t leave room for experienced that happen on a spectrum. 

My partner is new age( I’m an atheist now ) and he’s NB AMAB and presents very masculine, but his identity is closer to womanhood. He feels really left out of a lot of these groups. He’s personally experienced a lot of exclusionary behavior from new age people particularly women . 

Where I live has a high percentage of new age people and I get death glares from new age women a lot when I’m wearing a dress
I feel all this so deeply! Like, nature-based spirituality has been so healing to me but it feels like there’s almost no one to share how I experience it with :/ if your partner wants to connect on IG about it my account is TempleoftheMystic 💖"	vmnk6n	NonBinary	32	0.97	2022-06-28 13:41:14
a kid stopped me to ask what the button on my bag meant.	"here’s a [link](https://m.imgur.com/a/sWHxBlt) to a pic of my button, on my backpack. apologies for this being a link and for any other weirdness because of mobile. 

anyways. 

a friend and i decided to visit one of the science museums in my city and check out an exhibit she’s been interested in. it seemed like a bad time, since the museum is known as a popular destination for kids and families and my state’s schools (meaning our university and most public schools) are on spring break this week. still, we decided the brave the masses of children to find something to do on a wednesday afternoon.

in the time that we were there several kids came up to me and explained things to me or asked me to help out, which i’m used to— i work with kids often enough that i knew what to do. at one point as my friend and i were looking at one of the experiments they had out, though, i heard a quite voice behind me go, “excuse me, miss?”

i turned around (even though i don’t normally respond to miss?) to see a kid who looked to be about middle school age, who immediately asked, “what does your they/them pin mean?”

i was carrying the backpack i use at school today. it has several enamel pins on the inner part and a large-ish pin with my pronouns (as shown in the link above). i do this so that other folks can see it and hopefully they’ll address me correctly. my school my home city are pretty inclusive, so i feel comfortable doing this. 

i was a little surprised but was able to explain that it means that i want people to use they/them as pronouns when they refer to me. as i was about to explain further i saw this kid’s face light up and they immediately declared, “i use they/them pronouns too! it’s so cool to find one of my people!” 

we didn’t talk for very long, but they ended up telling me that they were in junior high (i tried to make it clear that i’m 20 and an actual adult so that they didn’t try to be friends more than that), that they had come out to their grandfather who seemed accepting, and that their father thought the nonbinary flag was for a school club or something. they seemed excited when i confirmed that i identify as nonbinary, too. 

they asked to take a selfie with me (i said yes, of course, and i’m sure it was cheesy and terrible) then went on their way. it was really nice and cool to see a younger teen so proud of their identity, and to be that kind of older, probably more “out” type of person that i was always excited to meet. idk if they’re on here at all, but if they are i hope they see it and hope they had a good day at the museum!"	"I know having a role model like you would have made the world of difference to me growing up. I’m glad you were there for them!!

"Does any other nursing parents feel weird about ""chestfeeding"" fully replacing ""breastfeeding"" instead of being co-labled?"	"Previously I always thought of ""breast"" as an ungendered word (""breast plate"", ""double breasted blazer""). To me it just refered to the tissue on top of the chest. 

But when I started seeing posts saying that ""chestfeeding"" was the better term and it was a more inclusive term it bothered me. It took me a while to identify that what bothers me is that previously I didn't feel like having ""breasts"" made me a ""woman"", because I felt like men had breasts too, just smaller ones. Now, it almost feels like the whole world is saying ""no, breasts are for women and man don't have them"". And suddenly I'm more self-conscious about my own breasts. 

So, I appreciate *including* chestfeeding in language, but feel unhappy with it being *replacing* breastfeeding... 

Am I alone in this? Should I just get over it for the greater good?"	"I kinda agree, to me, breast is just another word for the tissue above the pectoral muscles, and isn't predominantly gendered. Completely replacing breastfeeding with chestfeeding feels like a forced gendering of the word breast.

Edit: I'm not a breastfeeding parent or even a parent, this is just my opinion as a fellow afab enby.
I feel the exact same way about all of this. I continue to say that I breastfed my kid, and just basically use both words now whenever I'm talking about breastfeeding or chestfeeding in general (case in point lol). It doesn't feel perfect because yeah, to me 'breast' is anatomical and to create another word for breastfeeding makes breasts a gendered body part. But I absolutely respect those who feel dysphoric referring to 'breasts' and calling it 'breastfeeding,' so I do a little extra mental gymnastics to remind myself that the way I think about it is valid too, and that saying that I breastfed my kid doesn't de-legitimize my transness and the chest dysphoria I also experience.
putting trans and nb aside for a minute, some men do have breasts it's a thing that just happens some times. (I forget the exact percentage, above or) about 50% of men grow breast during puberty and sometimes they don't go away after it ends.
Very valid. Like cis men can get breast cancer. It's not ""chest cancer"" which is completely non-specific and could refer to anything, it's breast cancer, cancer of the breast tissue.

I completely support people who need or want to call their chest ""chesticles"" or just, their chest. I fully support people who want to call it chestfeeding for themselves. But any push to call it chestfeeding for everyone would, if successful, do actual, real, medical harm to people, above and beyond the social and emotional harms you've pointed out.
I don’t call anything on my body breasts, but I guess I will find out how it feels to call feeding my baby breastfeeding. I can get back to you then on whether it’s dysphoric or not!

We often make the mistake of assuming that others have similar hangups. If someone who is trans, binary or nonbinary, is asking you to specifically use that word around them or for them instead of the alternative, then that’s a reasonable thing to do. I’m not in a place where I think it’s a specifically helpful thing to petition that say, the New York Times change its manual of style. Clearly, the idea that some don’t like the word breast has brought up some conflicting feelings for you, and I totally understand that. We are not a monolith, and you’re perfectly right that the state of having breasts is not an issue of womanhood, it’s a human and mammalian thing.
Wow, yes, you said exactly how I feel. Thank you, all these responses make me feel validated."	pcc0zw	NonBinary	30	0.98	2021-08-27 00:16:03

How to ask a child if they use different pronouns.	"Hello r/NonBinary.

Many of this is very new for me and so my question might be silly, but I want to be as inclusive and loving as possible. Gently correct me on terms and such since I am still learning new things about gender and sex.

I am 24 and I serve in my young womans church youth group. A girl (15 yrs old) occasionally comes who is not part of our neighborhood youth. I suspect that she might have different pronouns then she/her. 
She has never corrected me when I call her 'she', but I have noticed that she goes by a more masculine name, which I suspect is not her real name, and dresses and acts like a guy. 

I have also noticed that she and another girl in my group are very close. They sometimes wear  pansexual pride flags while they hold hands and joke about another friend being their daughter. 

It could be they are just having fun as friends, but I also want to be as inclusive as possible, and if it makes her more comfortable to be called something different then I want to facilitate that.


I am unsure the best way to ask her if she uses different pronouns. Since she is so young I don't want to alienate her if she does have a different gender, but I also dont want to offend her if I am wrong. I just don't want to come across as creepy to a young teen, and the last thing I want to do is hurt her feelings.

Any suggestions? Mods if this is the wrong place for this kind of question please let me know and I will take the question down."	"First off, I’m so delighted to hear you being so loving and inclusive. It’s wonderful to know that these young people have someone who cares about them as they are and is willing to learn for their sakes to help look out for them. 

Second, a great way to get that convo started is just to offer your own pronouns, even if they seem obvious. My doctor, a very obviously femme, straight, cisgendered woman, started wearing a little lapel pin that just said she/her. Its still a little rare to see people out and about even discussing this so it was a great way to start the conversation and let me know she’d be supportive (/know what I was talking about if I asked for they/them lol). Idk if you use zoom but I’ve seen people put their pronouns next to their name on the zoom screen too. Depending on the group, there may be more unexpected pronoun preferences than you might think— its not uncommon (at least where I am) for people who feel better about they/them or neopronouns like zie/hir to just go by what you’d expect a lot in daily life just to avoid having to explain fifty times a day to potentially hostile people.
First off, thank you for creating an inclusive safe space for these kids to explore and grow. As someone who never had that growing up, it would have meant the world to me. These kids are lucky to have you.

On the topic of pronouns, in my experience kids are a lot more familiar with that type of interaction than us old folks. At this point you're presumably already introduced, so mentioning your pronouns during an introduction probably wouldn't help. It doesn't have to be something creepy or complicated. ""Hey x, I've been using she/her for you, but I noticed your pin and I was curious if you would be more comfortable with something else?"" Granted the pin is about orientation, which is different from gender, but it could be a safe way to start the conversation. Maybe she'll correct you on what the pin means if she thinks you think it refers to gender. The goal is to indicate that you've picked up on a signal related to GSRM, and you are communicating that you're a safe person to talk to about it.
Thank you for doing this! 

There are two ways I would suggest. First would be offering your pronouns, maybe in like a group activity, and ask everyone else to share theirs too. That way you can normalize asking, but also give everyone that chance to share pronouns with one another. The second way would be just coming out and asking privately. No it would not be creepy. Even if you get the response of she/her, it's respectful to ask instead of assume. 

They may be uncomfortable sharing if they aren't ""out"" yet. I would suggest continuing to be opening and welcoming and make everyone feel comfortable. 

And it's good to also consider that she may use she/her. Clothes don't have a gender so she may be a more masculine presenting girl. 

Again, thank you for being opening and welcoming. I wish more people were like you.
Thanks for existing
As an agnostic and queer butch chick (they/them) raised in a Christian atmosphere including many youth esc church groups and activities I commend your efforts in reaching out as well as exclusiveness.

If you suspect this 15 year old who is not a part of your neighborhood youth to use differen pronouns start thinking and writing about them using they/them pronouns. In fact, start using they/them pronouns when thinking, writing, and speaking of or to anyone until you know for sure what their pronouns are - the inclusiveness begins with erasing sex, gender, and orientation expectations and social constructs.

Additionally, while our 15 year old in question dresses in  a 'masculine' manner, please do not attribute that expression to ""acting like a guy"" or any notion in trying to be a ""guy"". Masculinity exist within female bodies just as femininity exists in male bodies, and masculinity does not equate to male just as femininity does not equate to female. They may just be a butch female and we are very valid, and that does not necessarily mean we are trans or even gay.

To answer your question, DO NOT single out this kid, if you want to open the door to inclusiveness simply begin any group session with your introduction, ""Hi everyone! My name is [name], she/her, and welcome to...."". This opens up what should be an introductory for all participants to introduce themselves where they can individually choose to declare their pronouns or not - do not make stating your pronouns a requirement - people will follow through as they feel comfortable, the key is to not out someone when they are not ready.

So in short, don't ask ""her"" as that singles this person out, give space for them to come out on their own terms while creating space for them do so.

P.S. The two kids holding hands, yeah probably more than friends, oddly, more so ironically, religious youth groups tend to be a safe haven for hanging out with 'taboo' friends and or lovers.
Hi! 21 yo nonbinary lesbian here who grew up in a fundamental evangelical environment - the fact you're thinking of this person at all means the world!! 

I think your question is worded in a way that is obvious youre new to gender / sexuality theory and conversation, but that's a great place to be to start! 

I agree with other comments that though there is one person who is ""obviously"" queer/appears possibly genderqueer, there may be others who are more closeted/less obvious, so wearing a pin or nonchalantly stating your pronouns at the beginning of a game/session/activity you're leading would be a blanket way of saying ""hi, I'm safe"". 

Also having conversations about gender, pronouns, and sexualities may be a great way for not only you to learn, but your other students/youth to learn too!
I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but I want to reiterate that you're a good person for wanting to be more open and accepting of these kids, regardless of gender or sexuality, and if I had someone like you in the church back when I was a kid I may not have felt so alienated and excluded.  You are awesome! Those kids are lucky to have you!
does the youth group like circle up and have discussions? or does everyone just hang out around the room? if it’s a more formal circle, i would announce at the beginning that you want the group to be more inclusive going forward, and wanted to do a name and optional pronoun check. say yours, then go around the circle.
That is a good idea! I never really grew up with these mindsets, so it never occured to me to say my own pronouns before. It seems a bit awkward, but I might try it if it makes my youth more comfortable.
please dont use the word femme for cishet people! it is an inherently queer term
Is it creepy to come right out and ask the question though? That's my only concern. I have no problem asking adults, but its the fact that I only encounter this person once a week and that they are a minor that makes me worried to outright ask. I just dont want to hurt feelings on either end.

My interactions with this person is also still very new. I've met them and talked to them, but Im still a new person to the youth group as a whole. 

Is it better to ask the person directly? or maybe the friends who are close to them?
Im not trying to attribute dressing more masculine as a indicator, but it was more so meant to bolster why I felt it was important to ask this person their pronouns (or whether or not I should at all). 

Obviously I would never single someone out, but do you see it as okay to ask if we are not in a big group. Just this person and I more off from the group?
Also, a side note, though I do 100% understand why especially older nonbinary/butch/trans folx would NOT be comfortable being asked one on one, I personally have grown up in a social setting in which everyone is asked their pronouns upon meeting. For some who did not grow up in classrooms in which the teacher has you state your pronouns, being singled out and asked is a way of someone saying to you ""you look funky, what kind of genitals do you want me to think you have, so I can know you actually have the opposite?"" which may or may not be the true intention of the person asking, but is always an uncomfortable experience for the person being asked. This unspoken disrespect is simply a fact of life for many older trans people (by older I mean over 15-20yo, not necessarily elderly) and even today is still an issue trans and nonbinary folks deal with. Though you clearly care for this young person and are (hopefully) asking from a place of wanting to authentically respect their true identity, most people in a church setting are asking with the disrespect loud and clear. 

But back to this particular situation:

So I'm introduced to a friend of a friend, Daniel, for this situation's sake, and Daniel asks me, ""Hi, what's your name? I'm Daniel, I use he/they pronouns!"" and that invites me to use/introduce mine. It is awkward for someone who isn't used to it, but I promise for your youth members it is not awkward and it will be SO welcoming. 

In situations of having known the person for a while but not having asked their pronouns, I can ask - ""Hi, it completely slipped my mind to ask, but now that I remembered, I just wanted to check - I use they/them pronouns, which set(s) of pronouns can I use for you?""

Another way to introduce this in an honest way for you would be to say to all the yourh members, ""I'm new to gender-non comforming discussion, and want to be welcoming and inclusive. If any of you would like to talk to me, ask me to use different pronouns for you, try new names, learn about gender theory and gender roles together, I'm open and excited to have those conversations."" 

That way you leave it up to each student to talk to you and ask questions / come out to you as they feel comfortable. :)
It isn't really a formal thing. We do activities together and invite all in the neighborhood often we get about 25-30 girls who come to participate. We do service activities and other fun stuff. But often we just help facilitate them getting together. 

It night be hard to do a formal circle 😣
It can be a little awkward, lol. Its definitely new to everyone. But it doesnt have to be a big thing—like I said, an unobtrusive pin or something can make a world of difference in letting people know they’re safe.
I appreciate you wanting to handle the situation delicately, but the direct approach here is the best one from my understanding of the situation. It's not creepy to ask a question about how to be respectful. That's just... being respectful. I would not ask a friend about it; assuming that x does use other pronouns or identifies differently, that puts the friend in the position of having to choose between outing their friend or misgendering their friend, neither of which is good.

Asking them directly is okay.
As a butch (48yo) married to a girl who is socially perceived as a femme, I get asked my pronouns almost on the daily whereas she does not while standing next to me and it is anakin to asking me if I am female or male which I explicitly resent. If you are only going to ask this one young person what their pronouns are you are being exclusive to all other participants due to society's perceived connotation of gender while not allowing other young people who also might use pronouns that do not fit the binary ideology of gender. Don't make this kid your pet project! Do not approach this kid to ask them what they may not be ready to express - that is like putting someone in the corner with a spot light - especially if only due to your own curiosity.

Using pronouns that do not align with sex at birth, or gender expression, or sexuality does not have a 'look', and just because they are masculine does not mean anything you assume. Create an all exclusive space for all participants, it's that simple.
Alright. I will try to ask them directly. I just wanted to make sure it was the best approach.

Thank you for your persepctive and help. I never grew up with these mindsets so I'm trying still trying to learn 😅
It isnt a pet project... Im simply trying to understand what is best for this person. Im deeply hurt that you asusme this is some pet project for me.

My impression of what you are saying is do not ask at all, which I don't think helps create a good environment..."	q5xmz3	NonBinary	30	0.98	2021-10-11 14:55:58
In an effort to be inclusive, France discriminates against non-binary people	"When a recruiter posts a job advert online, they're required by the law to add ""(H/F)"" at the end of the job's name. H/F stands for Male/Female. So it'll look something like this: ""Cuisinier (H/F)"" 

This was, of course, done in an effort to stop discrimination against women in hiring practices. But then it just shits over NB people and you can literally get fined for not including that in your job description."	"In Germany you'll very commonly see '(m/w/d)', the d stands for 'diverse'
Let's tell people it means they have to hire someone who is *both* male and female, so NBs only.
Let's invade them.
All the more reason to hate the french
Bc obviously your either male, female or other... Whenever I apply for jobs (which sadly has been a lot lately) I always pretend it stands for ""dragon"" 🤷🏼
But I'm enby and for me it means neither 🤔
I mean, are you actually mad about that lol?
Oh, I didn't say ALL enbies. I just said ONLY enbies.
Just because (almost) everyone who identifies as both male and female is nb, that doesnt mean all enbies identify as male and female. 

It's like all pears are fruit but not all fruit is pears
Well, it does make me uncomfortable that I have to apply with my AGAB because the (m/w/d) is just a placating gesture from a conservative government that even argues my existence. 
And I'm mad that even this useless gesture successfully fails at promoting more equality by othering everyone not on the binary gender spectrum and only moves the issue into the light which means that I get harassed by family and strangers alike. I could live with the latter if it meant being represented and respected but at this point I'm not even being TOLERATED. 

So yeah, I'm fucking mad about it. 

But no, I didn't expect anything positive to come of this, if that's what you wanna know.
Yeah no hard feelings I got the joke :>
Yeah non-binary is an umbrella term for a multitude of varying gender identities. Which is one more reason why putting anything like that in the job description is bonkers.
I get it if not asking for gender at all is the ideal scenario to you. But if they are gonna ask, then diverse seems like the best word to use to me
Well, let's agree to disagree then. I'm not fine with being put down as ""other"".
Alright. I think it's unreasonable to put a box for every single gender, as there's an undefined number of them. Ideally gender shouldn't matter and they wouldn't ask. If they want to know for diversity reasons, a non-binary option would be great. I get that much.
I agree with you on that much, it's neither ""logistically"" possible nor reasonable to put down an option for every gender identity. It's the first thing cis people say in defense of excluding 'trans' identities, but I do agree with the sentiment. The thing that would ensure actually equality (on paper) would be to just leave it out or put just ""diverse"" or ""any"" in it (as in ""diverse genders"" instead of male, female and diverse/other). 

But I guess you're probably right in that's idiotic to get mad about it. As harsh as it sounds, I should just get used to being othered by society. I guess I'm just having a hard time, because I'm also coming to terms with the reality that I'll be misgendered for the rest of my life, except by close friends.
:c I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get u down

I feel that as well, and even some friends I know still see me as a man. Recently I've met a lot more new friends who are knowledgeable and respectful of non binary people. But my entire family is completely fucked about anything LGBTQ 😞
Yeah. I came out to my parents a while back and while they kinda accept me being into women (so lesbian in their mind as I'm AFAB) my mum still refers to me as her daughter, despite me explicitly stating that my pronouns are they/them - arguably it's a little harder in German, but she doesn't even try. My dad does too but in his defense I never explicitly said anything about it to him regarding pronouns so maybe he just isn't entirely in the loop. 

Anyway. I hope I didn't come across as rude. It's been a day... And yeah, friends & found family are what keep us afloat - and sometimes, connecting with the community and ranting a little helps too 😊 
I hope your family will come around and treat you with the respect you deserve 😌

Hiring someone who is non-binary	"Hello all, I’m a supervisor with not much previous experience in hiring ANYONE and I just want ya’lls advice on how to go about certain things when hiring someone who is non-binary. I recognize that it’s really not any different than hiring anyone else, but I also know there may be certain problems you may encounter that I’m not aware of as a cisgender female. 

What’s the best way to confront other coworkers who use their (the new employee’s) pronouns incorrectly? How do I express my support for them without it being, idk, tacky and overdone? Should I talk about inclusion with my team beforehand? What are some things I’m overlooking that are common problems for nonbinary people in the workplace? 

I’d appreciate any advice so so much. I’d also love to hear about your experiences in the workplace, both positive and negative! Please tell me if there’s anything I’m saying that could be problematic, as well. I’d really just like to try my best to make this workplace completely inclusive. Thank you!!!"	"I know for me the worst thing was that my old boss knew me before I came out as nb and before I started working there. She still called me by my dead name for like at least a month so honestly if they just have a preferred name just called them by that and dont let other employees know their birth name even if they're nosey about it. It would be better if there was no discrepancy on the name at all.
A big thing is making sure other coworkers use the right pronouns, even if customers dont. Also, using the preferred name wherever you can. I understand you can't in legal documents if it hasnt been officially changed but nametags, schedules, etc.

Also, if coworkers are being total jerks about it, like intentionally and persistently asking personal questions, I imagine that would be treated like any other type if harassment?
First off, thanks for doing this, the fact that you’re asking is just amazing. 

In terms of pronouns, it depends on what their pronouns are, some people don’t mind, some people do, and it’s alright to ask. One suggestion would be for them to have a pronoun pin, you can get them online, which have their pronouns on if people need a prompt. People do forget pronouns, that’s alright and shouldn’t be a problem unless it’s persistent and/or deliberate. Just correcting people who don’t use them quickly and saying the non-binary person prefers they/them pronouns should be alright. 

We really just don’t want anyone to make a fuss, just tell them you want to create a safe and supportive working environment for them, and make sure they know where to go if any problems arise, and you’re already doing so much more than most employers would. 

The main issue is most likely to be bathroom based, I don’t know if you have a gender neutral bathroom or not, some workplaces do, in fact that’s the best possible scenario, but some don’t, and again that’s something that might need to be discussed at some point, basically just make sure they know they can use what’s most comfortable for them

Obviously it changes depending on the workplace but I hope that’s helpful 😅
If you can, make it clear to all employees that your company's policy is to create a supportive environment, and that you or HR will take action to maintain it. Send out a mass email or hold a meeting, whatever you need to do. 

I second the bathroom thing.

One big thing that might not be obvious, is that ""nonbinary"" is an unbrella term for a host of identities, outside of male and female. 

So your nonbinary individual probably has a more nuanced identity that you may not be privy to. And that's OK, and you probably don't need to know. But ""you've seen one, you've seen them all"" doesn't really apply here. One nonbinary person might identify as agender, use they/them pronouns and try to appear androgynous, and another nonbinary person might identify as demigirl, use she/her pronouns and dress femininely, and yet another might identify as genderfluid, use any pronouns, and do different gender presentations on different days. 

As with any person, everyone is an individual with their own unique background and story. 

On a practical scale, you probably only really need to know pronouns, other preferred terms of address, and make accommodation for bathroom preferences.
Hey! Big kudos for coming here to ask! I would say that one thing to be thinking of is how to ensure that your nonbinary employee is respected, without becoming the center of attention. For instance, I've seen places that make a really big deal when they hire someone nonbinary — even if the intentions are positive, there's a good chance the individual doesn't want their personal identity to become a huge talking point. 

Based on my workplace observations and personal feelings I would suggest not talking about how someone is ""the first nonbinary person"" at the company — in my case I heard this when they were referring to someone else being brought on and that felt super invalidating to me as someone who wasn't loudly out as nonbinary (but who still listed gender neutral pronouns). Also, most folx probably don't want to feel like they're being celebrated as a token ""first."" It means a lot if you just celebrate an individual for their strengths and what they bring to the team, beyond just their gender identity. Of course, it's also fine for an individual to *want* to celebrate and have others celebrate their gender identity, but it should be on their terms rather than, ""Rae is our first nonbinary employee, we've always wanted a nonbinary person on our staff and we will have so many questions for them!""

Regarding questions - it's pretty normal for folx to have questions about nonbinary identity.....but it's important to remember that nonbinary people are not spokespeople and do not *owe* anyone an explanation. At my work place, I heard stuff like, ""Oh, Xara is nonbinary and that's great - they'll be able to answer everyone's questions about being nonbinary and about pronouns."" It shouldn't go like this...if someone *wants* to share their story or answer questions, it should be on their terms. 

As far as confronting other staff on their pronoun slip-ups, just do it in a friendly, helpful way unless it's clearly being done with ill-intent. Screwing up is normal; I still screw up pronouns...even my own. Old habits take time and practice to kill.... Gently correct & move on. ""Actually, Ady goes by they/their pronouns.""

I think it's a good idea to talk to your team ahead of time, but not in a way that makes it a big deal or in a way that puts your new hire as an ""other"" - just something brief and along the lines of, ""We've hired a super qualified new person named Jay, and (they) are nonbinary and use X/Y/Z pronouns. If you have any questions about nonbinary gender identity, here's a great resource.""

If you don't already, it's a good idea for everyone company-wide to list pronouns in email signatures, on nametags, etc... This makes it less of an ""event"" when someone outside the binary shares their pronouns. It's also important to stress that if people feel uncomfortable sharing their pronouns, they don't have to - not all nonbinary folx are ready or willing to come out to the world, and they should be allowed to do so on their own terms. You should also let staff know that they can change their listed pronouns whenever they want - if they don't feel comfortable listing them now, they can do so later if they want.

Things I've heard that generally don't come from a place of hate but should not be said because they perpetuate problematic thinking: 

""It's going to take time to get used to using their pronouns because they present very feminine/masculine."" (Nonbinary folx don't have a ""look"" - gender identity is complicated and unique and saying things like this only helps to perpetuate myths about trans/nonbinary people who often feel judged if they don't meet society's expectations of how they present.)

""I'm just going to use their name to refer to them, because then I won't need to worry about making a mistake."" (If someone states that they use a set of pronouns, be respectful and do your best to use them. If you can use a set of pronouns like he/him/his when your friend tells you their dog is a ""boy"" you can certainly make the effort to refer to a human using the pronouns they ask you to use.)

""How can you be nonbinary if you still use he/she pronouns?"" (Lots of nonbinary folx use he/she pronouns, either in addition to other pronouns or as their personal pronouns. You can still use ""he or she"" and be nonbinary; language may frequently help to articulate our gender identity, but it doesn't define it.""


Once again, thanks so much for asking! It sounds like you're going to make a great supervisor for this person.
Eh the coworkers end up using the wrong pronouns anyways. But what’s really important to me is the overall friendliness in the air. While they always misgender me, my colleagues are still treating me the same as they would anyone else plus a little bonus of being even more kind. 
(I can feel the good intentions by them clumsily mentioning «my transformation» - them saying it carefully as not wanting to insult me since I happened also to get on HRT at some point). 

So you definitely want to nourish that overall atmosphere where a non-binary is a person before than anything else. I vote yes for mentioning this to your existing team at the next meeting if you’re about to hire an NB.

Also if your workplace have gender neutral bathrooms (with one stall) that’s gold!
This is really cool of you! 

You know your area and your staff. If they're young, hip people from a progressive area, then you might not have to do anything beyond ""This is Ash, \*they\* were just hired for our customer service department"" (assuming they use they/them pronouns, which they might not! it never hurts to ask!). A more conservative area might need a little more explanation and to be informed that it's not appropriate to ask a new employee about their genitals. 

Other than that, make sure you're respecting their pronouns and setting a good example. Make sure they know which bathrooms are accessible to them based on their gender so there's no HR problems later (and if you have an HR, make sure they're updated on the situation.)

When people mess up the pronouns, a quick, gentle correction is acceptable. ""She ate the whole muffin!"" ""Yeah, \*they\* did!"" kind of thing. Not making a big deal out of it."	eya2gc	NonBinary	29	0.95	2020-02-03 16:59:56
Gender “other” on so called inclusive forms.	"Something that has always annoyed me is when companies think they are being inclusive by listing gender (sometimes sex too) as “male, female, or other”. Other has always made me feel unnatural and unwanted. It’s like “we got the men, the women, and those…things” like they don’t even do us the honor of filling in the blank and telling them who we are, because they simply don’t care. In my opinion, they should always just have a text box for gender. “Inclusive” medical forms I’ve seen have listed “male, female, transgender” as sexes. Like yeah if you’re on hormones that complicates things, and there are certain things directly related to biological sex, but seeing the word “transgender” which literally has gender in it as a sex has always pissed me off.

Lately I’ve been feeling very dysphoric because at my university (not comfortable giving details about where) I’ve had to call myself an other on multiple important documents. To some this may seem niche and unimportant, but to me it really hurts. Does anyone relate?"	"Twice recently I've encountered Male, Female, or Prefer Not To Say.

I would *prefer* to answer correctly but apparently you don't want to hear it.
would be way better if it was just left blank for all regardless
I think I have some insight on this.

I believe that the primary reason this happens is due to research. Descriptives in research (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, experimental group, control group, etc.) are VERY rigid. They way statistical methods work, it requires very-well defined groups. There are often many subgroup analyses that are carried out in research other than the classic experimental/control analysis. Some of these might include: men vs women as a binary (often using [T-tests](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/t-test/)), caucasian vs black/brown vs middle eastern vs etc (often using [ANOVA](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/anova/)).

The problem is that when gender specifically is allowed for a wide-range of expression, you might have 4 people self-identify as non-binary and 7 people self-identify as gender fluid. Unfortunately, there is a minimum amount of people required for a high-enough resolution in subgroup analysis. The minimum number of participants/people required depends largely on the statistical resolution, or [alpha level](https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/n13.xml), you are looking to achieve--but generally, a minimum subgroup population of 100 is sought. When there are not enough people in a group for a subgroup analyses, the statistics are just simply not reliable and journals/academia will recognize it as such. When an adequate statistical resolution is not achieved, researchers will just not include these people in subgroup analyses (which sucks).

So what ends up happening is researchers lump broad groups of people and identities together into one or two kinds of ""other"" categories. This allows the researchers to carry out these subgroup analyses. And it's good in a way because it allows people to participate in that analysis. However, this also reduces the validity of this type of analysis, obviously, because you are grouping non-similar groups of people into one group for the sake of statistical analysis. In short, people's identities become watered down on a personal level (as you described in your post) and on a statistical level.

The practical problem here is that researchers would love to carry out these types of amylases. However, recruiting participants is often one of the more difficult aspects of research. So they try to balance inclusivity and an ability to include people in subgroup analyses.

**This is not a defense of inhibiting freedom of expression on forms.**

It is my belief that research *should* be as inclusive as possible. Unfortunately there is often a power dynamic in academia and it is easy to submit to people and their wishes--especially when they have more power over you and your grades, degree, career, letters of recommendation, etc are on the line.

In fact, many survey software (e.g., Qualtrics) allows for text box fields that allow people to self-describe their gender. [Here](https://imgur.com/HXLMi2e) is the gender question in the demographics section in one of my actual research studies I am carrying out. In hindsight, I would have separated NB and third gender, but I was following the practices of my university. I'm glad I added a box that allows people to self-describe though. [Here](https://imgur.com/NM7dUFE) is another question I ask about trans\* status. I don't ask about biological sex because it's just not relevant to my research.

In the end, there's no excuse for what you see happening. Responses can always be re-coded later as an ""other"" option that only statisticians would see.

If I could get an X on my driver's license in California, there's no real reason that a university couldn't adopt more inclusive markers in their research and on their student ID cards.

# I WOULD ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGE YOU TO REACH OUT TO THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) OR STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE AT YOUR UNIVERSITY OR HUMAN RESOURCES AT YOUR PLACE OF WORK TO VOICE YOUR CONCERNS. FIND SOMEONE IN THE SYSTEM WHO CAN TAKE UP THIS FIGHT FOR YOU (AND NOT JUST A GENERAL SUGGESTION/COMPLAINT BOX).

Sorry for your trouble and we are trying.

It also bothers me that is male and female. Like those are sexs not gender. It should be man and woman. I've seen male, woman, transgender. As if transgender is a gender and not an adjective of a gender. Trans woman, trans man, nonbinary. I think the best way would to have man, woman, nonbinary, other (fill in the blank), and prefer not to answer. I've also seen one form that had a fill in the blank if you clicked on nby.

This!!!

Prefer not to say literally reinforces staying closeted by assuming anyone who isn’t male or female won’t want to share it

That’s very insightful, thanks!

Frustration with erasure	"Hello! This is actually my first post here. I'd like to share a little rant if you don't mind.

So, this week a group at my school is hosting Gender Equality Week. To begin with, they had an introduction video on the announcements Monday morning. In this video, they made no mention of trans or nonbinary folks. In my frustration, I decided to write a little email to all my teachers. I stressed the importance of being inclusive of nonbinary students. My choir director got back to me; he contacted the group doing the event and urged them to be more inclusive. Hopefully, they will. Another thing got to me today. I read an article in the LA Times High School Insider about the importance of feminism. At the end of the article, the author writes, ""I want all girls and boys to know that feminism is supporting both of them,  resiliently fighting for both of them, and advocating for both of them. I want all girls and boys to know that they are validated, loved, supported, brilliant, and powerful.""

**What about me?** Do I matter? Do I deserve support? Things like this make me feel so invisible and even worthless. I hate it."	"I completely agree. And things like this are why I think I should start being more “out” about not being one of the binary genders. I just accept that everyone sees me as a girl because it would be awkward to try to explain it and I don’t want people to have to remember not to use binary pronouns on me because it’s inconvenient for them. But if everyone hid like I do then it’ll always be how it is in your post. Sorry for the mini rant I’m also trying to sort stuff out in my head >.<
Considering how I see so many binary trans people not get and not fully understand or accept non-binary trans people, I get how this could happen, so many people just don't get it, they haven't accepted it so they don't include it, it's bullshit, I literally had to deal with a friend(who is fucking cis btw) claiming that nonbinary trans people hurt binary trans people. I was trying to explain that no, they don't, are there some people who are toxic qnd problematic? Of course, but they exist in every single gender and sexuality category humanity has! It's a lazy way to not accept people, and I'm getting tired of it. (Crap, I think I'm ranting too.)

The short of it, yeah, that's bullshit, everyone should be celebrated in a Gender Equality week, I'm guessing these people don't exactly teach gender as a spectrum though, if they do, then why the fuck didn't they include it? (Okay Wrath, wrap it up, you said waaaaay more than you came here to.)

I hope they do better about it and get their shit straight(gay? Spectrumy? Whatever, you know what I mean.)
I watched an ASL video on queer signs where the person signing listed, but actively discouraged using signs for bisexual that subtly suggested there's only two genders. There were a fair amount of bi signs that did that and at the end they're like ""but these aren't inclusive, so why use them? Just spell B I""  

Could not subscribe fast enough, omg.
Thank you for writing that email! I hope you get a good response, with actions, not just words. It's hard to not be frustrated at the sheer ignorance and lack of information, even when it's not malicious.

I just don't see why anyone has to specify genders at all in situations like that. Surely just saying ""people"" includes everyone? It's been really sticking out to me lately how often phrases like ""both genders"", ""girls and boys"", and ""men and women"" are said. There are so many other more-inclusive words to use, for all levels of formality. There's no reason to specify genders when the intent is to include every person.
We've had a similar problem at my school. It takes a lot to speak up so I'm glad you did. 

As far as that whole feminist bs sticking to the binary, I've encountered that too...in my sisters. One is my support system in everything...except when I came out. ""You'll always be my sister. Maybe someday you'll be my brother. But I'm not going to call you my sibling."" The other is a pussy hat wearing, two time women's marcher, who apparently (behind my back, but in front of her kids including her closeted trans stepson and my adult neice, who both told me) that ""If [they] get to identify like that, I identify as a Queen."" So much bullshit. 

All this to vent and say, I hear you. 
I'm a big fan of formulas that take the shape of ""boys and girls and everybody else""

No need to turn every announcement into a gender inventory that can't ever be complete, and even if it doesn't go in depth, it acknowledges the fact that not all people answer to either boy or girl.

If that's not cool, the jackhammer: Kids, pupils, esteemed audience, everybody, humans, earthlings, mortals, workers, citizens, colleagues...
Yep. I chose to out myself in the hopes that it can make things better for the next generation.
Ah, nice! My language class is French, not very inclusive. :(
>There's no reason to specify genders when the intent is to include every person.

Exactly! The good thing is that it's never actually _required_ so if you want to make a point out of it, always using a context-relevant collective term instead of gender terms isn't something that can be really objected to.
Awh.. ASL is nice because no gender based pronouns. It's a lot of gesturing at the person you mean."	831exk	NonBinary	29	0.94	2018-03-08 22:00:51

"""Progressive"" workplace/colleagues invited public declaration of pronouns but fail to use mine"	"Pretty much what it says in the title. I work in the kind of place that wants to make a show of how progressive it is - the entire sector I'm in is this way. 

I've been in the process of coming out, bit by bit, for some years now. Asked not to be referred to as ""woman/lady"" a while ago, which had no effect. Attempted to change my title to Mx, which wasn't recognised on the payroll because according to HR it doesn't exist - even though the payroll goes through the same county council as my tax and the council sorted it when I asked.

Person in charge of ""communications"" sent an email round about 6 months ago asking people to put preferred pronouns in our email sig. After some difficult deliberation I decided to bite the bullet and put they/them pronouns, and sent an email out politely informing people of my non binary identification and thanking them in advance for their effort, accepting that it might take time, that mistakes are expected, trying to be as non-confrontational about it as possible.

Since then about 4 of my colleagues have made any effort to actually use they/them. Everyone else has carried on using she/her. One person was extremely angry when I corrected her and implied I should find new colleagues if I wanted to be called something different. Told me she had ""other things to worry about"". Funnily enough, so do I - but my gender identity is still important to me. This is a colleague I previously got on with. It cut me to bits.

Since then I've been reluctant to say anything. But not correcting people means nothing changes. I tried wearing a badge with they/them on it as a visual prompt, even though that sort of thing's not my scene. No dice.

What does one do in this situation? I held back from coming out or genuinely accepting this aspect of myself for such a long time feeling like there was nothing to be gained from it. Now I feel like prematurely coming out in this way was the result of a bait-and-switch. Every time I get called she, it is jarring to me. One of the colleagues that has been getting it right has told me both my boss and HR have said it's ""too awkward/too much effort"" to use they/them. I don't know what else I can practically do. They want to be seen to be inclusive of trans people but when they actually encounter someone that needs what they seem to be offering, all of a sudden the facade falls away. Nothing but hot air. 

Sorry if this is overly self-piteous and not in the celebratory nature of the sub. I'm just sad and lost. I don't know many people like me. This, and of course the pandemic, have me feeling incredibly alone."	"Also now I'm imagining your coworker calling everyone he/him because it's *just too hard* to remember that anyone who's not a man works there, and how everyone who heard about it would absolutely EXPLODE over the sexism and discrimination and hostile environment and general cluelessness... yet here we are.
No, this is real. I'm sorry. I was just thinking about how my workplace does much the same thing to people. I'm not officially out because I know people will just mess it up with zero real repercussions, just like they do to my colleague no matter how many times I correct it. But we have gender neutral single-occupant bathrooms! (In addition to multi-stall binary ones...) Or like my non-binary kid's doctors, they all hypothetically know to use they/them and it's even in their medical chart, like not written free-hand but actually picked from a list of options someone coded into the software, but *ugh* do the providers struggle with it, and the other staff at the clinics almost all seem totally oblivious. I've submitted so many comments/complaints about it and gotten so many ""sincere apologies"" but if it is getting better, it's not happening fast enough.
I had a really similar experience when coming out and work for a company that thankfully does respect people's identities and they have changed what they can for me. But a lot of my coworkers treat me completely differently. None of the ones I work closely with, but someone quit our team in the middle of training and I heard through the grapevine that part of it was discomfort caused by me. That really fucking hurt. And they misgender me daily and I see my dead name when signing in every day, but they do make an effort. 

If it's in your power to look for a more inclusive company, that may be a better bet. Because thankfully I know I have an HR partner that will back me up if I did ever feel the need to take those concerns to them. The fact that you know that basic resource is gone to you is extremely isolating and worth remedying imo. 

Fr I'm sorry this happened. It really just sucks. I hope there's a better place out there for you!
Thank you for taking the time to share and write all this out. I wish I had some useful advice, but I don’t. These type of scenarios are a factor in why I haven’t pursued changing my name. I was AFAB but surgically transitioned to my version of non-binary (DI Mastectomy, hysterectomy, on T for 9months), cut my hair short etc... but I still get “thank you for your hard work, Ladies.” At this point I think I’m in the boat where I would only change my name/pronouns before starting a new job. I’ve been at my current job for 7+ years, and they don’t even pretend to be inclusive even though we do have a few openly non-hetero employees. On our new emergency contact form it said “gender identity” instead of “sex” but I think that was less about being inclusive and more about not saying “sex.” ::::eye roll::: I wasn’t even comfortable enough to put non-binary.
In these situations its easiest if the few people who respect you also confront people who mess up. Like it’s not helpful to say “Yeah the higher ups told me they refuse to respect you and I sat there and said nothing.” They’re called allies because being queer is a battle.
Yes! I have been tempted to start misgendering other people at random to make a point but I suspect all that will come from it is I'll get reprimanded for the passive aggression!

When people change their names because of marriage nobody gets their panties in a bunch if someone gets reminded of the change, when they get it wrong. Why should this be any different?
I guess it's a ""welcome to the party"" kind of experience, eh. Funny that you mentioned doctors, I requested my title change to Mx with the NHS. It did change but when I next had an appointment it read out Mx ""Surname"" rather than ""Firstname Surname"" as it always did before, which was a bit weird. Shortly after that I saw it had reverted back to Ms. Not sure what happened but someone must have flagged it for ""correction"", whether innocently or otherwise. Why offer these things if they can't actually carry it out. It's frustrating.
Oof. I'm so sorry about your experience with the colleague leaving. That must have been painful. In a way it's better given the bigot was weeded out, but still, ouch.

I've been looking for other jobs for a while now but nothing's stuck yet. My specialism is very closely aligned to where I work at present, and it's also very niche, which limits opportunities if I want to keep doing what I care about. Our HR situation is compounded by the fact that it's a small organisation with limited finances and the person responsible for HR has taken it on as secondary to being our accountant. She has only just started training in HR. It's better than the nothing we had before, and I know she's trying hard and working hard, but I don't think she's fully equipped for that aspect of the job yet. Such is life working for a small charity.
I hate the ""thank you for your hard work ladies"" thing, and not just because of the misgendering too. My boss uses variations on it all the time. He's been to ""leadership"" courses and I'm quite sure it's part of the script. It just comes off as an insincere platitude. If you care about the hard work I'm doing, invest some time into understanding what it is I actually do and thank me in specifics rather than general terms. Feh.

And yeah I get the sex is a naughty word thing too. I recently sat through a health and safety training session which kept referring to ""gender differences"" in the spine/pelvis relating to ergonomics, lifting etc. I'm a trained anatomist... Had to bite my lip throughout.
I have an update on this! The person who told me about what HR/my boss said, has been challenging them. I failed to make that clear in my original post, but I do have allies and I'm super grateful for them :) A second colleague offered to do the correcting for me if she catches people's in meetings, after I had a long heart to heart with her yesterday. I'm feeling a bit stronger today :)

How do you feel about being invited gender-specific gatherings?	"I’m AFAB but now present mostly masc, plus I just had top surgery and have a beard from being on T.  My former college roommate invited me to her bridal shower that was today and I was hopeful that maybe it was a gender-inclusive version.  Turns out I was the only person not wearing a dress and felt really out of place.  I’m kind of torn on how I feel about being invited to these types of gatherings, since they’re obviously meant for women and I’m not that.  If she’s inviting me, does that mean she still sees me as a woman?  What are your thoughts?

Edit: I think some people are mistaking a bridal shower for a bachelorette party. A bachelorette party is usually just a small group of the bride’s friends, which is usually, but not always, all female.  A bridal shower is typically a much larger gathering that you invite aunts, cousins, grandmothers, nieces, and a few friends to, and it’s usually a pretty formal affair.  This particular event was a brunch with maybe 30 people."	"yeah i had a similar thing happen. my cousin had a baby shower and when i arrived there were male relatives there even if it was mostly women, but it turned out they were just kinda dropping off the female relatives and saying hi. when the actual shower started it was only women, not even my cousin’s husband (yknow, father of the child) stayed. so it was all women plus me and my sibling. once i realized what happened i wasnt able to have fun anymore. maybe they were just trying to be inclusive, idk, but i wasnt happy and if i was amab i doubt i’d have been on the invitation
We’ve really got to do something about this whole gender binary thing...
i’ve also been on T and had top surgery, and am happy to be invited to “women only” things because women are freaking amazing and the sacredness of women’s only spaces is something i’d hate to lose, regardless of my identity or presentation.
Ok maybe this is a cultural thing but bridal showers are usually just a party with the best friends before marriage. If you belong to those best friends, you should feel honored. Most women/féminine people tend to wear dresses for special occasions like this one but that does not mean you have to ^^ I am really sorry you felt out of place because of that.
i refuse to attend gendered events, but that's just me. as for your former roommate, maybe she sees you as nonbinary and was just tryna be inclusive or maybe she sees you as ""woman lite"" or something. you'll probably have to ask her if you really wanna know? either way, i'm sorry you ended up in such an uncomfortable situation 💚
I feel like it’s general friends and family of bride, the ones I go to the family is always women but the can be whatever gender the brides close friends are 🤷
Sorry you experienced that but glad I’m not alone in my emotional response to the situation.  Then they’re like “alright ladies it’s time for a game” and you’re sitting there like 🤡
What do you mean by that?
That’s a fair point.  I guess I just wish she’d said something like “I know you’re not a woman but I’d still like you to come” or something like that, ya know?
I think the issue is more the implication that OP is a woman because they were invited to the event and no other non-female people were. It can feel like indirect misgendering if literally everyone there is a woman and the event is culturally coded as for women and you were invited and no other non-woman was, because then it typically doesn't feel like 'we invited you because we want to share this space with you' and more like 'we invited you because we still socially categorize you as a woman'. That offer is also rarely given to AMAB masc enbies, because of the presumption that they're men. It is good that you're able to cherish these invitations, but if you're an enby with social dysphoria or even just an awareness of how AMAB enbies are often excluded then it can feel very weird lol.
This one appeared to be mostly female family members, plus a handful of her female friends, plus me.  No groom, no father of the bride, none of the family members brought husbands or sons. I mean I was touched to be asked, but it was very very obviously a women’s event.
i'm nonbinary and found this thread bc i've been invited to a bachelorette party andwas just told there is a UNIFORM for it, which includes a very feminine tanktop, and jeans... the example they sent included CUT OFF jean shorts. i know its their big day but I feel...... disgusted?  

also the idea of been seen as ""woman lite"" is just soooo uncomfortably cringy ahhhhhh
Okay so let’s say it was a different event that was specifically for women or specifically for men.  Like a ladies night or something? How would you feel in that situation?
yup yup yup yup yup. “women and nonbinary people” events or soaces are just uuuughhhhhh
I just mean that the celebration of life is often segregated by [socially assigned] gender and it’s dumb.
i was answering the title question which was “how do you feel about being invited to gender specific things?” i understand OP felt differently, but i was answering a question they posed.
regardless of how important someone is to you, you're never obligated to wear something that makes you feel so uncomfortable. have you talked to the person who invited you? are you sure you wanna go? if these folks are your friends, they should understand if you wanna sit this one out entirely (or at least wear something more affirming).
I’d probably not go because I don’t consent to being ladies. Gay men get invited to things like that but I don’t think I would vibe with that if I was a gay man. But plenty of my gay friends do so it’s up to the individual. But that’s cisheteronormativity for you.
Oh yeah! Sorry. I guess I was just adding my perspective as to why some OP may feel uncomfortable even while appreciating the space itself (seeing they replied to your comment explaining it further). I should have done that separately of your reply, or replied to their reply specifically.
Yeah I also think I’d feel weird about that as a gay man.  My sister’s ex once commented about how her son shouldn’t pretend to be a cat because ‘cats are for woman, and not even gay men like cats.’ Like wth is that supposed to mean??
i hear ya, i think it’s best if someone invites someone anyway, and makes it clear it’s up to them and their comfort level if they want to intend. i don’t think binary culture is completely “wrong”, it’s just a different culture, and mixing the two isn’t always cut and dry.
Ew. Happy they’re her ex.
Very true! I think it can be enjoyable to be a part of these experiences honestly, and sometimes the best thing someone can do is invite us with the explicit acknowledgement of their intentions (not to misgender) and give us the power to decide. Not being asked can feel like being excluded and the choice should be put in our hands. I often feel like I'd be a lot more comfortable being invited to women's events if I was AMAB tbh, so that I could just enjoy the actual event without all this self doubt and dysphoria creeping in.

Choir Teacher needs help supporting NB Student	" 

Long post warning! I want to apologize in advance if I say anything that offends anyone, that is not my goal. I am uneducated and I want to learn. TLDR just below

TLDR: A student just came out to me as NB, but isn’t open to everyone yet. I need advice to help support them, especially because they aren’t out.

I am a high school choir director (as you can probably tell by my name, I needed an excuse to make a “work” account, and this is the perfect reason) and yesterday a student came out to me as NB. I try to be supportive of ALL students in my class, and in the performing arts, I have quite a few LGBT+ students. Until now, I’ve never had a student that is NB (at least to my knowledge). When this student told me, they were understandably nervous and in tears, as they have only told a handful of people and most were not supportive (including best friend and mom).

As I sat and heard them open up about who they truly are, I tried to be careful about when and how I spoke. I wanted them to be able to explain everything, as much or as little as they wanted. You see, I’ve NEVER had to do something like this, so I can only imagine how difficult this is. I’m a straight male, I’ve never had to justify myself to anyone. I only interrupted to stop self-deprecating comments, because… well that one’s obvious. They spoke about how their mom doesn’t understand, and just wants them “to be less of a tom-boy”. I know I can’t interrupt their dynamic, because I’m a teacher, so that part is very difficult for me to help with. Then a lot of things hit me all at once.

I have been part of the problem. Like most choir programs I have gendered choir names (Men’s choir/ Women’s Choir) and I have gendered choir uniforms (tuxedos and dresses). I currently have a Trans student, and they wear their preferred uniform and sing in the gendered choir of their preferred gender. I’m being supportive and inclusive, right? Well I thought so, until this smacked me in the face. I began asking a ton of questions (in retrospect may have been poor timing on my part) like “do you feel uncomfortable with the name of your choir? Do you feel uncomfortable with your uniform? Would you rather wear the other gendered uniform? Would you rather wear something completely different as your uniform? When I say “ladies” or “girls” in class do I make you feel uncomfortable?” I wanted to know what I could do to help, then the other thing came into play. **(Are these the right questions? What questions did I miss, or shouldn’t have asked?)**

They aren’t out to everyone yet. They have only told a few people, some of which haven’t been receptive to their identity. They don’t want me to make a bunch of changes, because they feel that it will bring a bunch of attention to them, and they’ll have to deal with that. I want to be understanding of that. I don’t want them to open up until they are ready. This isn’t about me. I made it clear that if this helps them feel more comfortable I have no problem changing the names of the groups or the uniforms, and I’m willing to fight that battle against anyone else that disagrees with me because, well, this is my choir program and I can run it however I want! I am totally fine with them wearing a tuxedo in a choir full of dresses. They said that they don’t want to do any of that right now because they aren’t out, and it will only cause more problems with their mom (it sounds like mom doesn’t really understand any of this, and thinks its a phase. Dad isn’t really in their life, except for summers). I told them to think about all of these things and when they feel like they know what it is that they want to let me know. I don’t want to push that decision. The last thing I asked was “what is your preferred pronoun?” To which they quickly responded “They/Them… Woah I can’t believe I just did that!” That was an awesome thing to be able to witness.

So here is my overarching question: what can I do to help a student that is NB without drawing too much attention to it, because they aren’t out yet? They are pretty new to this Non-Binary thing, so they are still figuring them self out. How can I help them on that journey?"	"[deleted]
Your approach seems great and knowing that there are teachers like you out there makes me incredibly happy. Since they're not out there's not a lot of obvious steps you can take but it's the little things that always make my day. And language is clever, you can almost always avoid pronouns with a little bit of effort referring to this student specifically. One thing I would say is maybe tone down the frequency of ""ladies"" a little bit. It may not be the case for everyone but myself and quite a few other people I know of find being referred to as a ""lady"" the mental equivalent of a punch in the stomach.
We always say only way to be sure what will help is to ask them personally, but I understand you're not in the same position as other people.

When I was an nb kid in high school, I couldn't be out yet, so I would just look for small details in what people said to see if they were supporting or not.

Subtle things that might help be more nb affirming:

Refer to gendered groups euphemistically -- like ""the higher choir"" for the girls' group, ""the one with the urinals"" for the boys' bathroom. This stuff can be said with a bit of humor and it's still unambiguous but avoids gendering people in that group

Don't connect uniforms with genders, you may already be doing this but no need to say boys' or girls' uniform, just dress and suit gets the message across

Avoiding pronouns is my go-to for closeted people, you can use workarounds like repeating the student's name

I always enjoyed having the class addressed with gender inclusive words like ""guys, gals, and nonbinary pals"" (you can take out nonbinary to be more stealth here), lovely individuals, comrades, folks, and so on.

I already think you did well, you asked relevant and caring questions imo and I'm glad that student has you on their side. Coming out may be the only step they want to take right now, just follow up at some point and follow their lead.
I just did a google search for \`nonbinary choir\` and it looks like there's a lot of great articles and material there about how you can make a choir be more accommodating and gender-neutral.

I recommended presenting the student with options but noting some of the options may out them:

- what name and pronouns should I use when other people are present?
- what concert attire are you most comfortable wearing, and which choir?

That way your student has the agency to do what they need, but understand what that could mean for them if they are closeted
Portland State University just renamed their men's chorus and women's chorus as ""Rose Choir"" and ""Thorn Choir"", to promote gender neutrality in the names. They picked those specific names, I believe, because Portland is the ""city of roses"", you might be able to come up with a similar kind of thing based on details of your school or town/city. 

I think this is something you should do politically anyways, but doing certain things to support enbies in general--and not just your student--would have the added dimension of validating your student. 

Also, as other posters said, thanks for teaching high school choir. I sang in high school and college and I sorely miss it.
As a nonbinary school-age singer I feel qualified to say that it is incredibly hard to  navigate, but I feel like you asked all the right questions, and did so respectfully. The best advice I would give you is to make sure the student knows that you are open, accepting, and receptive, and if they tell you anything, have any questions or complaints, or otherwise feel the need to approach you, continue to be as open and receptive as you have been already.
This is literally how I came out to my first professor in school. i came out to my concert choir director after class and he was so incredibly sweet. Thank you so much for doing what you can to help them, i'm sure they're more than grateful
heya! i'm a nonbinary highschool student myself, and i'm in kind of a similar situation as your student actually, as i'm out to two of my teachers who are trying to make the way they address me in class comfortable for me. 

i think what you're doing is already really helpful- i would like to share some tips and reminders though. (note: this is all from my experience and things that i would love to tell my own teachers if i weren't so bad at talking.)

1) remember to use their pronouns whenever you reference to them in third person, **regardless of whether or not they're within your earshot.** 

2) if you slip up with pronouns, **don't make a big deal out of it.** it makes everything more awkward- if you catch yourself in time, just say ""s/he- sorry, they-"" and move on. you will slip up every now and then, more often at the beginning. that's okay. everyone does that and it simply takes time and just getting used to referring to them with their pronouns. don't beat yourself up too much if you do mess up. 

3) if they ever email you or talk to you in person about you slipping up, make sure you **apologize and don't make an excuse**. they hopefully know you truly respect them and you're trying your best to get used to it asap.

4) try and clarify with them if they prefer gender neutral terms and things along that line!

wish you best of luck! and i'm so happy that there are teachers like you in the world. we need more of them. :)

sorry for the long reply, by the way. have a wonderful day!
You rule, this is awesome. It sounds like you've done everything right so far. I know it feels contrary but of course it's very important to listen to them, and may be necessary to continue to misgender them / let them misgender themself for their safety. I think you should just keep checking up on them every once in a while to restate your support and let them know you're open to changing things within your power to make them feel more comfortable when they're ready.
Thank you! I feel that if they were out publicly it would be easier to be supportive (i.e. use correct pronouns/ preferred name once they come up with one) but its difficult since I don't want to ""out them"". I just feel like every time I say ""she/her"" I'm slighting them. It's one of those situations where I feel like I can't actually help, and as a teacher that SUCKS.

&#x200B;

And that's awesome that you sang! I hope you're still singing, it can be so healing for the soul!
I'm working on limiting the frequency of ""ladies"". It's a habit that I'm working on breaking. I apologized to my student in advance if I ever slip up pronouns or say/do anything wrong, that I am trying to get better at it. They understand, but it doesn't give me an excuse! I got into the habit of ""ladies"" with students that identify as female because ""girls"" seems demeaning, and I feel that way about ""kids"" as well. I felt that it was the most respectful way at the time, and now I know better!
Thank you for such great advice! I am going to start calling them ""The Treble Clef choir"" and ""Bass Clef Choir"" and I LOVE ""the one with the urinals""... that fits my humor. I don't (knowingly) connect gender to attire, but I will try to make sure to be aware of it now. I am going to work on implementing all of these things! Like I said, I need to be educated. I already call them ""dude"" quite a bit, (we are in Southern California ... so this is widely considered to be a gender-neutral ""pronoun"" ... I know that sounds bad but they call themself ""dude"" to their close friends, so I plan on asking if that can be our secret way of being gender-neutral until they are public)

&#x200B;

Thank you for your help, I feel that this student relies on me quite a bit as a father-figure, and I don't want to let them down or make them feel like they are alone!
Thank you! I've been doing crazy research on the entire community, in hopes to be better able to support all students, I just don't know how to support them since they aren't out publicly yet. That is my current dilemma. I'm in the process of talking with Admin about changing the titles of the classes, and I'm researching gender-neutral performance attire. I just don't know what someone would want support-wise if they aren't out publicly yet.
I asked about attire and which choir, they don't want anything to change yet, to which I replied ""when you're ready just let me know!"" I plan on having the talk about names and pronouns (when others are present) the next time I get a chance to have a conversation with them.
A different school within my school district uses ""Bass Clef"" and ""Treble Clef"" in lieu of gendered names. I'm speaking with them about their decision, and if they would rename it to something else if given the opportunity. I want to make sure to do it correctly (especially because there are people in this community that may be upset with change). 

&#x200B;

Thank you for appreciating choir! As many can understand, I feel like I have to prove why my job is necessary and beneficial to everyone. It's nice to have people appreciate what I do.
Thank you! I hope I can be supportive for this student, and all other students.
Thank you! That means a ton! I’m glad your director was sweet, we try to be positive role models (at least most of us!) I hope I can make the same impact he did for you!
I try to use their pronouns correctly when speaking about them, but it’s hard because they aren’t public about it yet. They told me they plan on announcing it to my choir class soon, so then I can be a bit more open about it. I have already apologized to them in advance if I mess up, and that I’m trying to learn. They obviously don’t know about this post, but I am trying to check up on them every so often.

Thank you for the reply! I’m just a teacher trying to help my student be their true self. I hope you feel comfortable enough to share with all of your teachers eventually. I promise we aren’t all bad!
I just don’t want to compile the problem, so that was why I posted here. I have since spoken with them, and it seems like we are on the same page, so that’s good. They are talking with the class in a couple weeks (starting in a smaller section of the class, then moving up to the whole group), then we can really be their support team!
You're doing a really great job as a teacher -- I would have loved to have someone like you in my high school! I think your student will likely remember your allyship for the rest of their life ❤️
Have you asked whether they want you there when they speak to members of the class? might be nice to have a figure of 'authority' as support (the other students might think ""well, if Mr. Davis thinks it's okay, then it's okay..."") if your NB student is comfortable with it. 

I really commend you on how you've handled / are handling all this, I honestly don't think you could be doing anything more ATM. Great to see people looking out for trans youth :)
Thats a great idea! I'll ask them when I have an opportunity.

Starting a business marketing to trans and nonbinary people- need your opinion?	"My girlfriend and I are going to start up a small business to help fight cisnormativity by providing products that are gender neutral and/or more trans inclusive.
Wedding decor, bathroom signs, greeting cards- these are a few starting points for us to open up the market to families and relationships that are not two hetero cis people.

We’ll have a specific emphasis on normalizing gender neutral language and normalizing terms like “mx.” and pronouns like “they/them” and “ze/zir”, because I have a lot of personal experience with these as a nonbinary person!

What are some things (products or markets) you’d like to see be advertised more neutrally or in a less cisnormative way? Your opinions will help us make the products you want to see and I appreciate any and all feedback!!! 
"	"Greeting cards for sure. The only option for an ungendered birthday card is usually the dumb joke genre. If you want anything more sincere or loving your choices all have daughter, son, etc on them. 

Baby stuff. Especially alternatives to ""gender reveal"" parties and stuff like ""It's a boy!"" yard signs. (I think a whole genre of ""It's a ____!"" yard signs would be hilarious but I'm also a little odd.) You might look at old fashioned independent toy shops for an avenue of distribution. The ones that have wooden trains and neutral puzzle toys and such.

Bathroom signs that literally say ""toilet"" and have a toilet graphic on them (The man/woman/alien bathroom signs are meh.)
[deleted]
There are some bathroom products I'd love to see advertised more neutrally. Wet wipes, period products, razors, deodorant, f\*ing soap or toothbrushes sometimes. I understand if it's not what you want to be selling, but I am heartily sick of trying to choose between shit that works and shit that isn't coded. Bathroom routines are hard enough as it is without being faced with the choice between the razor that's supposed to look like a race car and the razor that's supposed to look all glittery pink unicorn fantasy. It is too danged early.
Someone mentioned greeting cards and I have to second that. Looking for a Valentine's card as a non-binary person (and my spouse looking for one too) is just frustrating.
But what if I *like* to use the bathroom with the mermaid on the sign?
I agree!! Wedding stuff is so hard to find.
My take is that we are already dehumanized enough as trans/NB folks, we don't need to be compared to mythical creatures. We are REAL HUMANS and we need bathroom signs with toilets or urinals so we know what to expect when we walk in. 

Though I have been to some cons where the mermaid/alien signs would actually WORK. It's about context. 
I don't inherently disagree with you. In a ""serious"" setting, a ""Toilet"" sign is good and sufficient.

There is a book/toy/game store near me that's very LGBTQ-inclusive and the toilet has a mermaid/pirate/centaur (or something) sign that says ""Whatever. Just wash your hands."" And in that context, I think it's wonderful (also, hand-washing is important!). In a corporate office or a Target, that would be weird.

So yeah, I was being slightly tongue-in-cheek. But I have always kinda wanted to be a mermaid...
I recently saw one (online) where it was also a lot of different figures with 'whatever' underneath... but all the figures (with exception of the one in a wheelchair) were *very obviously gendered* (like a feminine mermaid, a manly pirate, etc...). To the extent that it gave me the impression of being deliberate... which just confuses me. "	9en6bl	NonBinary	25	0.94	2018-09-10 13:33:21
Just thinking about the time I was at a college party and my friend changed the rules of a drinking game everyone always played from “drink if you’re a man/drink if you’re a woman” to “drink if you’re queer/drink if you’re not queer” to make it inclusive for me.	And it was amusing that we had about 50/50 queer and not queer people so the game was still even. That was a good time.

Just transferred into the gender inclusive dorm and I’m scared people won’t accept me	Hello I’m (19 AMAB NB) a student, and after a week of classes I realized I wouldnt be able to handle using the men’s bathroom and my school was great and they said since it was early enough in the year I could transfer in the gender inclusive dorm. I moved in today and I’m sort of scared that people on my floor won’t accept me because I still look so cis. I was able to get a pronoun sticker and put my preferred pronouns on it and I finally shaved my beard off but I’m really scared that i look so cis. I was going to paint my nails for the first time but I wasnt able to and I look like a regular cis guy and I fear they won’t accept me	"I'm sure you're not the only one in this situation. I bet there are a lot of other people there who are only just now being open about their identities, or who are still very new to it. And college is a time where everyone's identity is shifting in big and small ways anyway.

More importantly, though, there's no one, single look for nonbinary people. Lots of us ""look cis"". If that's how you prefer to present, that's totally valid. And if it's not and you haven't figured out how you'd like to present, that's fine too. In that case, if you ask around, I bet you'll find a lot of people there who would be enthusiastic about helping you come up with a new look!
There is no one way to be Nonbinary. Just be the best you you can be. The whole point of a gender inclusive dorm is to be inclusive, everyone belongs. So if people there are excluding you because of the way you dress, then they’re the ones who are wrong. 
The other part of that is that it’s a dorm, and there are people there to support you, including RAs and housing staff. Use those support systems. 

You got this <3
We love our baby gays. You'll be just fine <3
They've all either already had this exact experience or are having it right there, right now with you!

Ask around, I guarantee one of them will be willing to share nail polish. If you have a hall meeting (which you probably will) it's a good opportunity to get to know people.
Ideally I’d want to look perfectly androgynous 
Keep in mind that looking perfectly androgynous is nearly impossible. Like others have said, your identity is how you identify. If someone tries to tell you that you're not really non-binary, that's not there place. 

I imagine what you'll find is a lot more acceptance than otherwise. Obviously I cant speak for everyone, but the non-binary people that I've met have been some of the most accepting and inclusive people I've met.
I’m realistic in the sense that I know it wont ever be perfect but I really don’t want to look like a guy anymore, and I dont want to look too much like a girl either

Starfriends! This very nonbinary-inclusive social network is approaching beta, and we've had an influx of new users in the past couple of days!		"Basically, my girlfriend and I were fed up of nonbinary people (and our pronouns) being relegated to ""other"" options under cis and binary people, so she started coding a site that makes all genders and pronouns equal. That was about a year ago, and we're still in alpha but we've come a long way.

The **[pronoun system](http://strfrnds.tumblr.com/post/156950927612/how-to-starfriends-alpha-pronouns)** is particularly impressive, I think. Instead of just he/she/other: they, you can add your custom pronoun set and it gets added to the database for anyone else to use. Plus lots of other cool things, just about pronouns.

There's no gender field, but it still optionally [matches you up based on gender](http://strfrnds.tumblr.com/post/156953165542/how-to-starfriends-alpha-tags) if you want it to, and you can be extremely specific (and [rule out people of one particular gender from your Starfriends experience entirely](http://strfrnds.tumblr.com/post/156971894192/how-to-starfriends-alpha-block-report-and), if you feel inclined).

I am excited about it and I think it's awesome. It's not very polished and there are bugs, but it basically works and there are many improvements and new features in the pipeline. :D
Why did you decide to include a ""block this gender entirely"" option? 
Whatever happened to purpl? Were you involved in that? Someone here was.
A user suggested it after the tag system had grown to include everything you could want to tag yourself with or want to search for in potential matches, not just gender or sexuality. It was proposed as a very powerful way to filter your matches with very little effort, and wasn't particularly intended just for gender filtering.

Basically, a lot of people are pretty much not interested in being matched up with one entire gender - but because tags can be for *anything*, you can also block people with *any* tag.

So, for example, one of my ""I am"" tags is !pro-life, which means people searching for pro-life friends won't be able to find me. It's a way of filtering matches to rule out anyone you know you definitely don't want to connect with. The !not tags are kinda complicated, and entirely optional.

I'm poly so I'm also aware that, for example, there's probably a bunch of women who're bi and monogamous and want to hide from unicorn hunters - so they could probably use a !not tag to do that.

We think that being able to hide from people is a good thing, mostly.
Oh, I've not heard of that one, I should go have a look for it. Nope, it wasn't me!

Edit: http://purpl.co/ goes to a blank page. :( Sad times.
What was purpl? It sounds familiar but I can't remember!!
Now I'm confused is this a social network or a hookup site? Because not wanting to be with poly people doesn't mean you can't be their friend. I was under the impression this was like just a forum type thing with a nice GUI like social media is.
Bummer. I'm checking yours out now!
There's a match tab for finding people to befriend/woo, with age and location filters, and the tag system lets you find people with similar interests or hide people you don't want to see.

And if you want to you can ignore that tab, and treat it like a social network: whitelist people you know and like, and use the Feed page like twitter (where you can make your individual posts visible to all, or just whitelisted people, or just mutually whitelisted people), use the messaging and IM tabs to chat, etc.
Awesome! :) I hope you like!
Yeah it is just a people chatting thing then I don't see the function of blocking people with tags. 

Idk I guess that just means I wouldn't use that.
Yeah, I'm imagining most people will not feel they need to use the !not tags! They're like... powerful and very good if you need them, but entirely optional. :)
I just thought it was weird cause like what reason would people have to block an entire type of user. I can't really think of any reasons are valid. 
Well, one example I can think of is that someone has invented a [dating app just for women](https://weareher.com/) and it's apparently doing pretty well, so there are women who seem to want that! So if you want to use Starfriends as a dating app and you're not interested in men *at all* you could easily filter all men out of your Starfriends experience, as an example.
So it is like both? Maybe make a separate block list for interested in / don't walk to interact with. 
Can you explain a bit more what you mean by a separate block list?

At the moment we have blocking, which kind of erases a person from your Starfriends experience. That's independent of the *!not* tags. Do you mean you'd like a way to say ""not interested in"", that reduces your match score with people who fit that description, but without blocking a whole group of people?

My Queer Wedding - HELP PLEASE	"Me (nb, afab, them/them) and my beautiful fiancé (trans ftm, he/him) are getting married and holy shit am I frustrated. Not at with him, our live, or his proposal, I am frustrated with GENDER (I know nothing new). 

Planning a wedding with a partner and a husband but also not genderless requires an incredible amount of DIY and creativity. Currently we are struggling with titles, manly the ""bride"" ones. 

I want to ask my chosen to be in my wedding party, However I am hitting a wall. Both myself and fiancé don't want to completely remove gender because we also respect our party members pronouns and gender identify as they do for us.   This being said, what on earth should I call me bride's maids and bride's man when I'm not a bride. I would love to keep the maid and man but not the bride!

I am so open to any and all ideas this beautiful community has to offer! 

\*all of our wedding party currently identifies male or female all using he/him or she/her, of course if this changed we would want an inclusive titles for them as well. Any ideas for gender neutral  titles please do include them! Thank you!"	"""Attendants."" ""Wedding party."" ""Standing for [name].""
What about ""bee"" for the enbees 🐝 ?

You could have bee's maids and bee's mens (edit) and bee's bees if you get an enby pal in your wedding party
You're keeping groom, right? So you technically could use any term, it would be clear that these refer to your side of the party.

Betrothed's maids? Fiancé(e)'s maids? Future spouse's servants?
Well typically a groom doesn't have a groomsman/maid he has a best man. Couldn't you just have a best woman/person/man as well?
Just call them your attendants. That’s all the bridal party is. Or the [whatever you call yourself instead of bride] maids/men.
In my cultural traditions, we don't have bridesmaids or groomsmen. We have a potluck where our community all brings food to celebrate the marriage and the couple exchanges vows to each other. I'm Quaker but feel free to borrow inspiration from any if this (I left out the religious parts that are specific to our religion.)
I feel you on this. I have a mixed gender wedding party and I feel… conflicted… about the term bride, but I use she/they and haven’t found a good enough reason to skip it. My attendants are being called bridesmates, since I’m Australian and mate isn’t really that gendered here, and that covers all my friends - but I understand that that’s kind of the inverse of what you’re looking for. 

I hope you find a term that feels more comfortable than “bride”!! I like partner, but if you want to emphasise the wedding part of your partnership, what about newlywed or nuptial? 

There’s also the more fun route, you could play with alliteration like “admirer’s assistants”, “beloved’s buddies”, “couple’s colleagues,” “dearest’s delightful deputies”, “engagees’ engineers”, “affianced’s adjutants”, and so on.
Hmm . . . you're the one getting married, so that makes you the chosen one, the beloved, the betrothed. You could do something with one of those. Or maybe there's term you can use based on their role - supporter, protector, inner circle, advisor, sanity saver, witness. You could  take the royal route and refer to each of them as Lord/Lady + name for the day and you could be your majesty, highness, or grace for the day. 

In Star Trek (I'm a Trekkie), there's a hetero couple that calls each other ""Imzadi"" which translates to ""beloved."" You could use that, or make up your own word. 

Those are my thoughts, shooting from the hip, as I eat my overnight oats.
r/lgbtweddings may be able to help you!

Spouse servants is now high on the list
That’s a great idea for a maid of honor or groom’s men but can’t use that for everyone though because the terms groom’s men and bride’s maids are different from the best man and maid of honor. Thank you so so much!
This thing I’m stuck on is the whatever you call yourself please
My partner and I are NB and calling ourselves the marrying couple.  That could be an option if your partner is up for not necessarily being referred to as groom all day?

And instead of having titles at dinner you could just have your names?  

For the bit when the MC would usually announce the couple’s arrive to dinner with something like “Please welcome, for the very first time, Mr. & Mrs. O’Brien!” We’re instead doing “Please welcome, for the very first time, the newlyweds!”
Spouse or partner are the only established ones i can think of. But since hes using groom, you could use p much *any* noun n ppl would know what it meant. 

Is just using your name on the table?"	vuncay	NonBinary	23	0.97	2022-07-08 23:00:53
Anyone else dread the pronoun circle?	"I’m really glad that asking pronouns has become more common, I’m not complaining about it because I really am happy for the progress. But as someone who is only out to one or two close friends, it stresses me out to have to participate in the whole pronoun ritual of “everyone state your pronouns!” It feels like it’s often led by cis people who have nothing at stake and are just performing their good ally duties. It’s great that people are trying to be inclusive but it just bugs me when I have to be on the spot in front of strangers and if I don’t pick a pronoun then I’m assumed to be a bad lgbt hating person. I like when people offer their pronouns and leave it open for others to share if they are comfortable, but when they start to require you to share, it feels invasive and counterproductive.

One of my professors is openly gay so I understand that he wants to make a safe space for all identities. But I’m always stressed because he talks about it all the time and reminds us every day to please write our pronouns on all our work and introduce ourselves with them for presentations. To be honest I haven’t even figured out what the fuck I am yet so I never know what to do. Do I misgender myself with my own mouth in front of everyone? Or do I out myself and then it becomes a ~Thing~?? But if I don’t say one then suddenly it feels like everyone thinks that I am a pronoun hater. I’d rather people just assume that i am cis or better yet just don’t talk about me ever don’t perceive me thank you

tldr pls don’t be angry at me- yeah i think it’s super great that people are trying to b more inclusive but when it starts to become an expectation it is not gr8 for closeted/questioning friends or just people who don’t want to share that info"	"The whole pronoun thing is one of the points that got me seriously questioning gender identity, because I liked that there was a convention of sharing or posting pronouns in a bio, but never felt compelled to put mine in any of my bios. It wasn't until I was in a situation where everyone else was introducing themselves with pronouns that I ever felt the pressure to declare my own, and though I hadn't been seriously questioning things up to that point, putting down ""he/him"" just felt wrong. So that's nothing compared to being in a place where you are deeper into questioning or just aren't ready to come out yet, but being put on the spot to declare pronouns. It all strikes me as surface level allyship, a one-step-forward-two-steps-back kind of situation. I'm sure it comes from seeing things from the outside, of only noticing trans and non-binary people once they decide to become noticeable, and never giving a thought to the process and struggles prior to that point. But yeah, I don't think it should ever be compulsory, or even socially pressured, to share pronouns if you don't want to provide them.
Could you say you're pronoun neutral/indifferent? Or would that still be outing yourself too much?
Yea… I get that, that sounds super stressful. 

Maybe you could email your professor about how uncomfortable it makes you? Or suggest a different, more private way of being supportive like the ones I see online where they provide a form with questions like “what are your pronouns” “can I use these pronouns in front of ____?” Etc. Maybe even draft out a form like that and send it to him as an example. 

If your professor has good intentions he would likely be willing to listen to your feedback and make changes. All the best, whether you decide to do anything about it or not. The struggle is real :’)
Yeah, that super stressed me out before I was out too
Omfg I had the same experience. I’m glad that prns are more respected but anytime a teacher or whoever says “say your name and pronouns” they should always add “if you want”
Omg I feel this too… my professors do the same thing. I myself am genderfluid, and I haven’t quite figured out how to communicate frequent pronoun changes, but that aside, liiiiiiike….. using they/them just feels like I’m outing myself in a not potentially safe space? I absolutely love the normalization of asking peoples pronouns. But in public settings or at work… I never know what to do. I feel like I will be looked down upon and I absolutely loathe correcting people/ “making things awkward”…… I guess I gotta work on that tho lol
Yeahhh I feel you there, especially like when you're not out and just use the pronouns presumed for your agab, then when you feel uncomfortable in those pronouns but not ready to come out yet, you just kinda get reminded of the fact that it's kinda your own doing (even though it's not really) Just kinda make it more difficult for me to come out or like just feel bad in general
I'd personally send him a message/mail like ""hey, I know you're doing this to be a trans/NB ally, but it's making me really uncomfortable to have to pick pronouns, so I'm just going to abstain from that, until further notice."" Plus maybe think of a few joke responses for if people question it, like ""I have no pronouns, do not refer to me"" or ""That sounds like a you problem, what you want to call me"". Or even something like ""the factory default works.""
You could try saying you’d rather people just call you by your name for now maybe? Idk if that would work for you
It's a sticky situation, for sure. On the one hand I don't want to tell everybody that I use they/them if I don't feel completely safe in the space, but on the other hand I don't like to start people down one road then tell them differently later. The other issue is that if I'm out to folks in one place, they often interact with me in another place where the name and pronoun aren't something I'm out about. I prefer to deal with it one-on-one, but if pressed I'd probably say ""I'll answer to anything polite that you feel like calling me"" and move on. Here's the tough part in my case...the name isn't a gender thing. I'm different levels of out to different people, and almost none call me by my legal name. Most of them would use they/them for me if they knew, but I don't trust them not to accidentally put me at work or around people I can't take the risk with right now. I think what I'll do is start hanging a name tag and pronoun pin on my backpack and telling people to go by whatever it says when they see me.
Used to dread it when I wasn't sure what pronouns I wanted, but now that I know I love it. I will also say that everyone should know that some people simply don't know the pronouns they want and you can introduce yourself with your name.
Yeah it fucking sucks when you’re closeted. I wish they said if you want to you can share."	swk4yc	NonBinary	23	1.0	2022-02-19 21:16:14
What are your thoughts about cisgender people using he/they or she/they pronouns?	"I'm part of a community where a lot of cisgender people are using he/they or she/they pronouns. I've asked one person and they said it was to be more inclusive, which I understand and respect. 

However, I use she/they pronouns because I'm not cisgender. I'm proud of my nonbinary identity, and don't want to be seen as just another cisgender girl using she/they to be inclusive. I've gone from gender euphoria from incorporating gender neutral pronouns into my life, to gender dysphoria thinking everyone is going to think I've jumped on some inclusive bandwagon and I'm actually just cis.

She/they pronouns no longer signal me as being not cisgender in that community. It really bothers me, because this community is one of the only places I have in my life that I can talk about being LGBT+ (I'm bi too) and not alienate myself. So their inclusiveness has backfired, at least in my case. 

What would you do in my position? I'm not going to speak to every person who does this in the community and get them all to change, especially since it may actually be helping some people. I'm asking more for advice on how to not feel invalidated or overshadowed by cis people when I share my pronouns. Thank you for your help in advance.

Edit: this community also generally refers to a significant other as a partner. This, coupled with the pronoun thing, means I often meet someone who uses he/they or she/they pronouns, who refers to their partner, and I'm thinking oh cool! Someone LGBT+ like me! Only to find out more often than not they are cisgender and straight. It's very disillusioning and I am getting tired of getting my hopes up to meet another LGBT+ friend there, when most people there seem cishet after a bit of conversation."	"So hard truth, I'm not a fan of cis people who aren't GNC using they/them pronouns. It's like you said, it's a way for us to show that we're not cis, and it feels bad that cis folks would take those pronouns to be ""supportive"". In a way that appropriation. In a way it's forcing conformity on us (our pronouns could become cis pronouns).

That said, none of us are the gatekeepers of pronouns, nor should we be. So cis folks are welcome to use whatever pronouns they want. It just makes me a little salty. 

But whatever. We're nonbinary and proud as hell about it. If they take away our pronouns we'll find other ways to outwardly share that we're not cis.
I honestly love it from a linguistic and cultural standpoint. In the big picture, a move towards non gendered language is so cool and could eventually loosening the gender binary if we got to the point where we just didnt use gendered language. I get that it can also feel like a cis invasion of queer space, but personally i just think its worth it for the possibility of cultural change
pronouns are a part of gender presentation. gender presentation is different than gender. it's completely valid that your pronouns feel like an expression of your nonbinary identity, but they're not inherent to nonbinary-ness. 

also, I find it helpful to understand these people as cis-for-now. I think a lot of people add they to their pronouns to test the waters. I know I did and I know other folks have too. 

as for how to signal your nonbinary-ness, there's always pfps, usernames, just, bringing it up a lot, and others. 

at the end of the day, pronouns don't mean anything other than what other people should call you. in most conversations, that's all most people need to know
As a gender abolitionist, I think its an important step to a better, more egalitarian society and I wish the rest of them would just hurry up. That being said, I do understand other enbies' hesitancy to accept that, as it _almost_ seems like a sort of cultural appropriation. But I also think we would just find another way to recognize and identify one another, tbh
i believe a lot of people will use she/they or he/they to express to their followers that they are okay with being referred to has both he him or they them, because some people get really aggressive toward others who default to they them, “my pronouns aren’t they don’t call me they!!” stuff like that.
i think everybody should be allowed to use the pronouns they feel comfortable with, or experiment and figure out what pronouns feel right to them.

a few months ago i told some friends ""i think i'm cis but i really prefer they/them, is it ok if i use those pronouns or is it disrespectful?"" they were all extremely supportive of it and after a few months of using they/them i began to realize i think i actually am nonbinary. 

not saying that this would happen to everyone but if i hadn't had the permission to safely explore my pronouns without negative judgement, i don't think i would have ever figured out that i'm nonbinary and have been experiencing dysphoria for my whole life without realizing that's what it was.
I don't have any good answers for you, though, I am curious when you talk to these people, how do you determine that they are cisgender and straight? It makes me feel uneasy as I am very cis-passing and straight-passing myself (also very introverted and private, which is another story). 

In another sense, what could I do to convince people I wasn't faking things, because I don't look androgynous or have LGBTQ flags/pins (or other visual signifiers) to 'prove' I'm not cis/straight?

(Apologies if anyone reads this as confrontational; it is not meant to be)
Thats definitely reasonable but honestly, the only advice i could give to that is to work on self confidence and confidence in your identity. And finding a good support system lmao
I have never questioned it,  I assume if somebody says ""he/ they"" that they aren't male. And I'm not going to police somebody to be like ""you look too masculine for that word.""
You dont know why someone identifies as cis, they might not be cis. However, there also isn't one right way to be trans or cis. Nonbinary people shouldn't be the only ones who can choose their pronouns, if people are doing it for themselves and not just to be performative. I think gender is a sliding scale. You are still not cis. There are plenty of people who use she or he and are nonbinary, so people shouldn't assume ur gender based on your pronouns either. You are enough. You are nonbinary enough. No one can change that.
I'm not out and it makes me personally feel safer.
Im not nb but I am queer/bi, but Im not sure if using they/them, pronouns would make me feel more comfortable. I don’t want to invalidate anyone but I honestly would like to give them a try and see what happens, could anyone maybe refer to me with they/them pronouns here?
So, I'm a lesbian who has been trying out she/they pronouns even though I would say that I am a cis-woman because I'm not sure how I feel about the binary she/her when I feel that does not represent my experience of womanhood. I know that myself and some others who I have spoken to (who are also other queer women) see pronouns as a form of gender expression and a way to make their experiences of womanhood more expansive and not limited to the binary. Maybe this means that I am questioning my gender identity? But regardless, I agree that I don't think that cishet people should be using gender neutral pronouns only for the sake of being more inclusive without their own personal reason relating to gender identity and/or expression for doing so. Like others have said, they might be quietly exploring their gender and are never obligated to make disclosures that they don't feel comfortable with, but if their legitimate reason is to seem more inclusive then that's seems more like performative allyship.
I could care less wtf someone else wants to be or be called but at some point it becomes a conflict when I’m having to call myself a cismale when I don’t really like that term. 
I can call you whatever you want me to, it really doesn’t matter to me but why do I also have to play along with another person’s self image by changing my own in the way they see fit? 
It’s like the pot calling the kettle black. 

You wanna be gay? Go be gay and happy just don’t expect me to give a fuck cuz I don’t just like you don’t give a fuck if I like women or aliens. 

Everyone wants everyone else to bow down to their way instead of just living a real meaningful life.
I personally don’t like that cis gendered people use they/them pronouns. They don’t have to worry about being misgendered meanwhile non binary folks on a daily basis struggle with this. I guess folks are trying to be “progressive” but it does feel like they are op-opting? I get it she/they or he/they means you don’t care with either, but then again it’s saying they don’t struggle with being misgendered meanwhile that’s not the case for us. I think they should stick to he/him and she/her if they are cis. 

Also folks say “maybe they are in the process of coming out”, ok maybe a few but you know majority of these people are cis gendered lol. I don’t think they understand the harm they inflict on folks who are under the trans umbrella...
[deleted]
it’s kind of confusing i didn’t rlly know people did that to be inclusive :p
I agree wholeheartedly. My next question is how to change my perspective and stop my own feelings of invalidation, without changing the actions of anyone else?
That's how I imagine most people feel, so I'm not going to make any statement about it there. My question is, how do I stop feeling like people are grouping me in with the cis she/theys? For my own dysphoria, how do I feel better using she/they as someone nonbinary without feeling invalidated? This is more of a ""changing my perspective"" question than a ""changing other people's actions"" question
I hear what you're saying, and you do have a point. My next question is how to change my perspective and stop my own feelings of invalidation, without changing the actions of anyone else?
I agree! I think if nobody was gendered at all the world would be a much better place. However... As a nombinary person living in a gendered world, essentially making everyone functionally genderless, at least from a social standpoint, I would feel that my identity as a non-gendered person would disappear in a non-gendered world. I see both sides. 

Also, I'm not sure if I'm making sense anymore, I've taken my meds and my brain gets a little scrambled after so sorry
No worries, I'm in the same boat as you. For the most part I'm very straight passing and cis passing. I want everyone to know I'm Not A Girl but at the same time I don't want to be obnoxious... Same for when people automatically assume I'm straight when I'm Hella Bi. But when they see someone AFAB with long hair and no girlfriend (I'm single rn) dressed somewhere between androgynous and femme, most people wouldn't label me as anything other than cishet. 

The LGBT+ people who wear flags and whatnot are (I think) what makes homophobes and transphobes start on their ""LGBT+ people are shoving their agenda down our throats"" bullshit. So it's kinda lose lose the way I see it. Either I outwardly announce somehow that I'm bi and nonbinary in order to get treated correctly, but doing so invites ridicule... Or I say nothing and people treat me like a cishet girl. I don't like either. Wish I could be more help. 

And to answer your first question, I only know one person I spoke to who said he was cis and was using he/they to be inclusive. That's what sparked the whole post. But to have 2/3 of the people there using some form of they pronoun makes me suspect most of them are doing it to be inclusive. I'm sure some of them aren't cis, and so I'm not assuming who is and isn't cis. The issue I have is that anyone cis is using them, and I can't identify my LGBT+ peers by pronoun anymore, and also that my using she/they doesn't automatically label me as not-cis. 

Sorry if I rambled
Hi having to call myself a cismale when i don’t really like that term, I'm dad.
Literally every progressive cis person I know uses they pronouns so it is a thing also the term cis passing is... like what? There is no way to pass as trans and that itself is problematic....
I'm a bit late to the party, but I almost imagine they/them like a favorite hat (I know that sounds dismissive, but hang with me here). It really helps express yourself, and you feel more *you* when you wear it. Occasionally, it even keeps the rain off. Some people are *defined* by their signature hat! But there's a problem -- other people bought the same hat from the store, and they're not wearing it like you are. Even if they're wearing *their* hat, it feels like they've stolen yours!

But you are not your hat. You're wearing your hat to express *something*; it's the difference between having a sense of fashion and having a ✨style✨. Even if they've got their version of your hat, you're still wearing *your* hat, and you're rocking it in a way they might never. You ***live*** your nonbinary life every day. The words are signifiers for something bigger within you. And if someone sticks around long enough to be important, they'll figure that out.

Just because someone's bought a copy of your hat doesn't mean they've bought *your* hat, your sense of ✨style✨, or that you live any less yourself.

&#x200B;

Hope that helps? Makes sense??
it's easier to conceptualize with clothes maybe. I like wearing flannels a lot. so do butch lesbians. sometimes, because of this, I am mistaken for a butch lesbian. so, I can wear something else, or I can correct people. I probably have a very similar experience, understanding of my gender, and expression as many butch lesbians, we just use different labels because it's what makes us most comfortable. there's no like, formula for gender. you aren't less valid as a nonbinary person just because some cis people have some of the same ""ingredients"" as you. you're nonbinary because you're nonbinary, and nothing cis people can do will change that
You make total sense! I struggle with the same paradox - dreaming of a genderless utopian society where everyone is just who they are without the social expectations attached to gender but also still feeling personally connected to a gender identity. I feel that if people didn't assume my gender when they looked at me, they'd be more open (whether they realize it or not) to really getting to know who I am but I also feel connected to the sense of community, mutuality, and acceptance in the queer community and especially when I am around other gender non-conforming folx.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I appreciate it. In my (online) circle, I see people use she/her and he/him, so my own assumption when I see she/they or he/they is that the primary intention is to signal the person is not cis (vs it being an inclusive gesture). I don’t usually have to meet people in an offline situations (esp. now!) so I really don’t know what to do in such circumstances. I do empathize with the whole lose either way thing. I am bi too but am married to a cis het guy (he says he is), on outward appearance I know how it looks. 

For now the best I can do is just be ok with it for myself. Least in my case I’m sure people (including myself) assumed I was cis & straight for a long time. It’s only more recently, I think, that it’s become easier to identify as not straight or cis even if one is still rather straight/cis-passing. 

Hope that makes sense and may possibly be remotely helpful. It’s late, I’m finger typing, and my cat is sitting on me, so...bit hard to concentrate 😅
It’s also really looked down upon in trans and non binary circles to imply someone “passes as cis”
[deleted]
This was a fantastic analogy!
That's a great analogy, thank you! I also wear a lot of flannels and I do it mostly because I like them, but partly because it's associated with lesbians and if I'm going to be seen as cis, at least I won't be seen as straight (I hope). But the message is deeper than that. I am who I am simply because I am, not because of what people call me or what I dress like. It's something I've always known deep down, and it's hard to hold onto when I'm feeling like I have to prove my gender/sexuality identities to everyone. But I'll try to reconnect with that message and hopefully let go of my need to prove myself
Well said! It's definitely a dilemma
That's good to know. In most areas it would be the same for me. It's really just in the one community that she/they or he/they doesn't automatically mean not-cis. And I have no intention of leaving this community. So as an across-the-board thing I agree with you. But in this one place I'm still struggling with the social validity of my identity... Or something... Idk how to phrase that. But year I totally agree with you. Tell your cat I love them!
Yeah a surprisingly a lot of cis people use she/they and he/they pronouns which imo causes harm towards non binary people especially folks who are not “out” yet. I just wish cis people understood their actions more because a lot of people and not including myself now see so many cis people using she/they that if I see someone using she/they majority of the time now I presume they’re cis, unless they mention they’re non binary or in a group for specifically non binary people. 

Maybe neopronouns are what non binary people have to use to emphasis to the world that “we aren’t cis”, but those eventually maybe co-opted by cis people too (.-.). Neopronouns alongside she/he etc can also be a way to not be out tho too. If that makes sense."	k0khfg	NonBinary	23	1.0	2020-11-25 03:45:13
"I'm an ""Elder Gay"" (GenX) ... and I'm exhausted."	"DISCLAIMER: I smoked several marjuanas tonight.

All y'all in here are amazing. I feel kinda like a proud parent. But I just don't know where you get the energy to do all this cool shit. 

I get tired just scrolling through Reddit some days. Fuck.

How do *actually* elderly people do .. anything? I just want to melt into my couch most days. I am *not* looking forward to declining further.

Things were different, way back at the turn-of-the-century - and I love that we're finding havens like this online.  I'm seeing cultural shifts IRL too, which is really cool.

Anyway. Millennials & GenZ have really picked up our (Boomers/GenX) slack. A+ job. 

So I've been educating myself on xenogenders, and boy did that take me down a rabbit hole. 

And part of me just keeps thinking, ""I'm too old to go through this shit again.""

Then I remember: what was once the (less-than-tolerant) ""gay and lesbian community"" has transformed into an incredibly inclusive network of amazing young people who picked up my fight when I got ground down.

I should be damned grateful. Thank you for creating an online world where I can learn about myself all over again. 

And thank you for helping create a world where people in my small town *are starting to casually & commonly* use labels like ""enby"" & ""demisexual.""

Sorting myself out. Uncertain.	"Thank you to anyone reading. I'm wondering if others have thoughts or similarities on how I’m experiencing gender. I'm struggling with words and terms a bit and hope this is ok to ask for some help with. 

I’m attracted to the term “nonbinary” as I’m pretty sure I don’t think there is much distinction of value or meaning in “male” and “female” and this these are both inadequate, oversimplifying, and similar enough to be kind of irrelevant (for me).  I also reject the idea that gender always exists in relation  (inclusive, alternating, etc. ) to these two concepts. ""Genderqueer"" seems like it has angles of making sense here too. 

I was assigned male and birth and have always felt like that made enough sense. I've never felt female and despite debilitating body image challenges, have always felt like having an external appearance labeled male was close enough. 

I’m not feeling a need or interest in changing my body, etc. I'm in a relationship with another AMAB person for the past 20 years and usually identify as queer, but sometimes gay.

But in so many ways, I don’t recognize myself as  “male.” I don't feel connected to other men through a gender lens, don't feel at all like I am part of the conversation when people talk about men*, and have never been interested in gendered spaces or activities for men. I’ve rarely felt men see me as one of them either. This includes gay/queer men as well.  I’ve even noticed in my closest peer group that the “men” connect with each other and are referred to as “the guys,” etc. This never includes me. It’s just understood that this is not me. 

At this point – it’s like I look male, I have male-male seeming romantic and sexual relationships, but I’m otherwise not male internally. 

I remember bristling in childhood when a peer called me ""dude,"" couldn’t understand why boys and girls had different clothes, shirts on or off when swimming, and frequently have to remind myself that I am male when people are speaking about men. I don't feel comfortable being called ""sir.""  Many of the stories I read and a few of the folks I know have similar dissonance with these things, but I see them express a connection to or an identity reflecting “femaleness”. 

*I think one of the complicating factors is that I believe that male and female are political and social groupings and that my expression of maleness (especially my appearance)  has brought various unearned privileges including forms of safety, being listened to, employment privileges, and more.

Is this non-binary? A form of gender ambivalence?  Ami Just a a male that doesn’t relate to maleness on many levels?  

Thank you for any thoughts.

"	"I absolutely suck at talking about nb stuff but alot of what you say makes sense to me. I'm afab and haven't really felt female like ever. I don't really care about pronouns but do bristle abit if I have to be referred to as female for long periods also. I do consider myself nb though just purely because I don't feel male or female. If you feel the same then maybe you are nb. Just as long as you're comfortable with it is what I think matters.
Hey, I can relate to this a lot too!

AMAB here too, but I'm mainly into girls and somewhat slightly uncomfortable with my male presentation (just want to tweak it a bit), and I don't really care much which pronouns or other gendered words are used on me.

Otherwise what you say resonates quite a lot with me, and I almost never fit in all-male spaces either anyway. I like your view on these things too. 
A person who PM'd me is talking about spectrums of gender (and I'm thinking that and spectrums of nonbinary). I have what seems to be social dissonance being identified as male, but am comfortable presenting as male and with male parts, etc. But, as you say, ""I don't feel male or female.""  

Interesting to hear folks say they have some familiarity with this. Thanks for your response. "	7e3z46	NonBinary	22	0.93	2017-11-19 22:15:21
"Can ""woman-lite"" be my actual gender?"	"I know lots of AFAB enbies are very specifically not woman-aligned, sapphic, femme or anything else that might suggest they're any kind of connected to women. ""Nonbinary people aren't woman-lite"" is a talking point for expressing this, and I get where the sensitivity comes from. That's all fine and good.

That said, I'm an AFAB butch lesbian and I feel like I am primarily nonbinary but also at least sort of a woman. So ""woman-lite"" is actually something that resonates for me. Is that ok? 

I sometimes hear ""nonbinary doesn't mean woman-lite"" lodged as a complaint about lesbian-centered spaces that are vocally inclusive of nonbinary folks. The fact is many nonbinary folks do identify as woman-aligned, lesbian, lesbian-adjacent/sapphic, etc. Many others don't, and that's fine too.

Is there a way we can celebrate and affirm the existence of nonbinary lesbians, without that being interpreted as implying that all nonbinary people are women-lite?

Is there a way we can celebrate and affirm the nonbinary folks who don't want anything to do with womanhood, without erasing those of us who do?"	"I'm a genderqueer trans guy, and that's a very very common identity ime. Genderqueer woman, or some other non-binary identity combined with woman, seems fine to me. Demigender woman?

As I understand it, ""non-binary does not mean woman-lite"" is a community organising issue, not a problem with how individuals identify. It's totally okay for your identity as a non-binary person to effectively be positioned in relationship to womanhood. The problem is that when events say they are for ""woman and non-binary people"" they're often not actually prepared for all non-binary people, they might just have in mind a stereotyped image of non-binary as afab androgynous-presenting people - this then leads to hurt feelings when a non-binary person shows up who they don't read through their cisnormative lens as ""woman-lite"", and can ironically even become a vector for transmisogyny.
https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigirl
I know Rebecca Sugar identifies as nonbinary woman. I've also heard of nonbinary lesbians.  


Personally, if it were me, because of the reasons you outlined, I would avoid woman-lite because TERFs using your gender to purposefully undermine other nonbinary folx suck... but at the end of the day, its your identity, and you describe it how you describe it.  If you know what your identity is, I'll always support and defend that. Because the problem is with people who try to undermine the words we use to describe ourselves, not the folx trying to describe their gender identity.
I'm AFAB and a mother and am pretty comfortable identifying as a woman. But I'm not comfortably with 80% of female roles and performance -- I dress in an asexual way, I work in a male industry (IT), I don't like most all-women things, I don't see why my AMAB NB partner is excluded from the women's book group I'm in... Would non-binary woman be a good self-description? I just discovered the term.
What does woman-lite mean??? I can't find a definition anywhere.
I hate that it's used as a vector for transmisogyny and I think that speaks to a more general phenomenon of transmisogyny being embedded in a lot of AFAB enbies' self-distancing from ""woman"". If anything, transfeminine enbies are more likely to feel affirmed by being included in women-centric spaces, whereas it's transmasculine ones who get offended. Any ""women and nonbinary"" space should clearly include trans women. In fact everyone I know who identifies as a nonbinary woman, was AMAB.
I was never a girl, I was a tomboy and now I'm a nonbinary woman. ""Girl"" is specifically dysphoric for me.
The phrase or the concept? I'm with you on avoiding the phrase. But I refuse to cede ""lesbian"" and ""woman"" to the TERFs.
You identify as a woman. You are not non binary. Roles and performance do not equal gender. At most you’re gender non conforming. Gender is a deeper sense of self, not a rejection of stereotypes.
How does AFAB enbies distancing themselves from “woman” speak to transmisogyny? That strikes me as kind of condescending... not wanting to be lumped in with women doesn’t mean they hate women (or fem-leaning enbies), it just means they’re... not women. I think plenty of trans-fem folks would feel similar if the situation was reversed.
I really like the term nonbinary woman myself. I don't feel female, but since I look like a woman, I get treated like a woman, and I can identify with every aspect of being a woman except having a female gender identity.

I haven't heard woman-lite before, honestly. Mostly because I'm from Europe. I don't even know what the f it's supposed to mean.

But I think you can call yourself whatever you want. If people take offense, that's their problem. Defining yourself is not an attack on someone else, and being nonbinary means not being part of an established system. You just are who you are.
Demiwoman?
You could just be a particularly feminine nonbinary person. I'm nb, but I still wear dresses and skirts and all that.
Oh the phrase! And refusing to cede ""lesbian"" and ""woman"" to TERFs is such a fucking valid mood.
Are you willing to admit that what you're doing is gatekeeping, or do you have some rationale for why telling people their nonbinary gender isn't valid, is ever not gatekeeping?
Sounds like you reject “non binary man” and “non binary woman” completely. Many do not.
It's not inherent, not all AFAB enbies. It's just a phenomenon I've noticed: AFAB enbies rejecting ""woman"" but then using some other term like AFAB-as-a-noun in a gender-esque way so that they're still defining a gender grouping in which they can be aligned with cis women but not trans women.
Thanks for the validation! I also like nonbinary woman better, I wouldn't really use ""woman-lite"" as a phrase - I just relate to the concept enough that I am not sure how to feel when people use it in a derogatory way
I identify as a non-binary woman for the same reasons. It’s completely valid.
I'm a butch lesbian. I'm more female than feminine. My connection to womanhood is not about wearing dresses.
Yes. I am non binary. My birth certificate even says so at this point. I am sure as fuck NOT my original birth gender. If the first thing out of your mouth is that you IDENTIFY as your AGAB you are cis. 

Gender roles are not gender identity. There are plenty of gender non conforming people who are not non binary. If you have the privilege of saying “you’re comfortable identify as a woman and just don’t like gender roles” then you are actively invalidating people like me whose whole experience of life doesn’t fit binary norms.
I've seen a lot more transmisogyny come from cis people policing ""women and enbies"" environments (i.e. rejecting amab non-binary people) than from non-binary people individually just not identifying as women. I think people just identifying how they personally identify is fine - it's when you're defining the boundaries of a community space that problems arise. I think this is what you're referring to here, though in my own experience it's usually not non-binary people who are making the call.
People can be idiots. Honestly, we live in a world were gay is used in a derogatory way. It literally means super happy.

People can turn anything into an insult, but you don't have to take it as one. I get called gay a lot, jokingly and not-so-jokingly, and since I am pretty gay, I don't mind it. That would be like someone calling me brunette as an insult. I am brunette. I am gay. And fuck it, maybe I'm woman-lite, whatever the hell that means. Thanks for noticing, have a nice day, if you don't like me the way I am get out of my life.

With the right tone, turnip, chestnut, daisy and unicorn are insults. Don't mind those people.
I still consider myself a lesbian, if that's what you mean.
Are you willing to engage a little? I want to understand where the defensiveness is coming from and try to see if there isn't a way to articulate our respective experiences of gender in a way that leaves room for each other's.

I identify primarily as a butch lesbian, I just don't actively reject ""woman"". I experience gender dysphoria. I get misgendered regularly. I get called slurs for how I present. I don't pass for cishet. Wearing feminine clothes feels like drag. I do not have the privilege of comfortably moving through the world without having to think about gender. Like all AFAB people, I have the privilege of being transmisogyny-exempt - but I don't experience most of the textbook examples of ""cisgender privilege"".

If gender is a spectrum, don't GNC and nonbinary lie on a spectrum with some overlap and in-between too? Is there really such a chasm between old school butches - a gender identity that has existed for at least a century - and AFAB genderqueer enbies who, to the bigots of the world, look the same? How do we name those in-betweens?

Or if you don't think there are any - if you think the world divides neatly into a binary of cis-or-trans - then where do you draw that line? Why is 100% dis-identification from one's AGAB the gold standard, rather than dysphoria or medical transition or primary identification with the other binary gender? What is the difference between ""just cis GNC"" and ""transtrender""?
Leslie Feinberg identified as female and as a butch lesbian. Does that make hir cis?
Again, I'm not saying *just* not identifying as women is in any way transmisogynistic. It's the subsequent identification as ""AFABs"" or ""socialized female"" - naming a connection to women-as-a-class, in terms that exclude trans women from that class - that's transmisogynistic. You're probably right though about the specific ""women and nonbinary"" gatekeeping coming mostly from cis people.
Not what I mean, but cheers to nonbinary lesbians! My emphasis was on the butch part - personally, I am not a particularly feminine anything. I just identify with the experience of being classed as female under the binary.

(To be clear: trans women are female)
I'm not sure what you'd be other than demigirl or just plain female then, but best of luck in figuring it out! :>"	dtsh4x	NonBinary	22	0.97	2019-11-09 06:41:54

How Do We Feel About Low-Dose Hormones and Not Transitioning?	"Hi, friends. I've been lurking here for a few months, I don't post much but try to comment often on all your stunning pictures! 


To cut to the chase, I'm an AFAB genderqueer person, and I've recently been heavily considering looking into taking low doses of T to try to feel more at home in my body. I prefer having a more androgynous look, but my face is so round and soft, as well as my body, that I have a very hard time achieving that through clothing and hair. I also go through periods of time where I just *feel* masc, I don't know how to explain it. However, I don't consider myself to be a trans person - just a genderless person who has a lot of traditionally feminine body traits (sans a big chest). My sex drive is even non-existent, which while I *do* identify as asexual, I can't help but wonder if it has to do with hormones and dysphoria.


I've been feeling very conflicted about attempting hormone therapy, however. It's not so much introspection on how I personally feel about it as it is ideological self-doubt. Things like, ""There are so many transgender people who desperately want to be on hormone treatment and aren't able to, why should I take it when my dysphoria isn't *that* bad?"" ""Do I really feel this way about myself, or am I trying to be ""T  R  E  N  D  Y?"""" 


I know some of this doubt is rooted in discussions in the LGBTQ community from less inclusive members, and some is internalized from my mother, who keeps insisting that she ""had a beautiful daughter and she doesn't make mistakes.""


How do you all personally feel about hormone therapy without transitioning? And do any of you fine folks who have or are undergoing it have any advice for me? Are the conflicts I'm having toxic or a reasonable set of questions to ask myself? 


Thank you for answering in advance."	"Hormone therapy isn't some sort of zero-sum game, where if a privileged person gets it, someone else has to be denied.  We're talking testosterone shots here--not kidneys for transplantation!

Please know that transition isn't the same for every person, and it's not a ""binary or nothing"" deal.  There are  various forms of both social and medical transition.  If you choose to give testosterone a try, that is by definition ""transitioning,"" regardless of how far you choose to go with it.  Many agender/genderqueer/non-binary folks have used testosterone for a limited time, then stopped it when they felt they had achieved the right body effects for them personally.  

As for the fear of being ""trendy,"" I can only speak from my own experience.  I began my transition at the ripe age of 49, and even I had at least one person question whether I was just following a ""trend.""  That wasn't the case, though.  Rather, I spent my whole life feeling ""not really male,"" or at least ""not really male enough,"" while knowing I definitely wasn't female.  It wasn't until I was 49 years old, that I began to hear ""non-binary"" as a label, and when I did, it was a huge ""AHA!"" moment.  

The reality is that non-binary folks have ALWAYS existed, in EVERY culture.  We just happen to have a modern Western culture that has chosen to pretend for a time that they didn't exist.  People who don't fit the binary are really lucky right now, to have increasing recognition.  Those critics (some of whom, sadly, are other transgender folks!) who accuse us of being ""trendy"" are simply trying to hold on to old ways, so they can erase us out of existence.

There's a lot going on here, so I'll try to keep myself from rambling.

In order to get access to T, most places require you to identify as not-cis in some way. Luckily the definition most medical organisations use for trans folks is reeeaaally broad. (See WPATH Guidelines for more details.) What you've described here (feeling gender neutral occasionally a bit masc) definitely fits. They will ask you to see a psychologist/psychiatrist with experience in gender issues at least once as a butt covering exercise before you get to see the person who can prescribe you T. You may need to get used to using terms like nonbinary transperson for yourself when medical folks are about, even if you don't personally like them.

As for whether T is a 'trend' you are falling into, I don't think so. Look at the reaction your mum is having to the idea of someone she perceives as female taking a masculinizing hormone. She's imagining what it would feel like to wake up looking male and hating the idea, then applying that reaction to 'her daughter.' Lots of cis folks react that way. The fact you think about the effects and conclude it might be nice to try means it's worth at least testing. The visible effects are slow, but the emotional ones can show up in a couple of weeks, so if you don't like it you can stop with no harm done. Every dose is a choice.

As for whether your dysphoria is bad enough to warrant treatment? That's like saying that a person with a broken arm doesn't deserve a cast because paraplegics exist. Or a person with a headache shouldn't get painkillers because someone else has a broken arm. You are in pain, there is treatment available, you are not in competition for that treatment, you get the treatment. End of argument.

I'm sorry you are short on supportive people in your life right now. I hope vague internet presences can fill the gap for a bit until you find your peeps IRL.
You'd still be medically transitioning, but not socially transitioning (which is common even among binary people) — though, if you can do it, some nonbinary/genderqueer people also socially transition to nonbinary/genderqueer (which is *haaaaard* in our binary-normative society).

>I don't consider myself to be a trans person - just a genderless person

I know that labels are personal, and that people could use or not use labels for a number of reasons, but the definition of ""transgender"" is *having a gender identity that does not correspond with their sex assigned at birth*. Genderless people are typically not assigned ""genderless"" at birth, and so they would fall under ""transgender"". I'm mainly saying this in case you have any mental blocks, like thinking that nonbinary people are ""less trans"" than binary trans people — or like thinking that people who experience less (or no) dysphoria are ""less trans"" than people with crippling dysphoria. The important thing is that you experiment and figure out what makes you most happy.

By the way, low-dose T (and going off and on it depending on degree of masculinity/androgyny) is fairly common among AFAB NB people, but some other regimens that may be worth investigating are ones that include things like aromatase inhibitors, SARMs, combo T with finasteride... (but do your research!)
Commenting to follow responses because /damn/ it feels like I wrote that entire post, right down to the mother whose kids are ""just fine thankyouverymuch"".
I think if you would feel better being on T it is acceptable to do so. But it is definitely worth thinking a lot about, I think you're asking yourself good questions. When you say transition do you mean ftm? Because a lot of non binary people use hormones and I guess I'm not sure how many consider it a transition. 
Just wanna say, if everyone who felt someone else was more deserving of transitioning or getting some gender affirming treatment, probably no one would be. If we could all see ourselves and our experience/feelings regularly as part of mainstream culture, maybe it would be different. Having an overbearing, narcissistic and/or addict parent can kind of bake in those feelings of never being comfortable putting your needs first too.
If it feels right for you/is something you want, there's nothing wrong with it. We should all have autonomy of our bodies, and it's not like there's some shortage of HRT and you starting T wouldn't mean someone else couldn't. There's nothing wrong with introspection of course, and it's a good thing to think deeply about it beforehand since some of those changes are permanent. But personally, I see absolutely nothing wrong ethically wrong or selfish about you starting HRT.
I think 'transitioning' can be broad enough to encompass nearly all gender-based motions for 'feeling more at home in \[your\] body'.

Also, hormone therapy is actually limited in many places because it's a ""rare"" treatment -- the more people who tell their doctors they want it, the more accessible it becomes! So actually, if you want it and you talk with a doctor about getting it, you're indirectly helping other trans people.

Finally, the conflicts that you're having are perfectly reasonable results of a toxic environment. Breathe, face them; you're doing the best you can with the hand you've been dealt. And good luck.
You said nearly everything I've felt. I've been considering seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist so I can discuss these feelings and the possibility of a low does of T. I struggled with feeling and wanting to present not necessarily masculine  but less female. I'm more so wanting to come off as androgynous with the ability to not feel out of place when I do want to be more masculine. I just have so many thoughts and feelings.
To add on, even is someone is taking T to be trendy (which sounds a bit absurd), do whatever the fuck you want. Its not hurting anyone, so why give a shit
Parts of this are not really true. You don't have to see a gender therapist or identify as trans in order to be prescribed T under the informed consent model. I've never been to a mental health professional and I still use a female name and pronouns, but I went to Planned Parenthood and got a prescription and my first shot at the first appointment. They were extremely chill about the whole thing, and it didn't matter that I don't have plans to transition further.

.....ohhhhhhhhhh.
I apologize for making assumptions. Informed consent is not available in my country so I didn't think of it. I hope it is that simple for OP. Honestly I had a really good experience with my gender therapist, it helped me find words for some things that were difficult to think about, so it might be a good idea anyway."	8xts4s	NonBinary	22	0.96	2018-07-10 22:04:11
Binary uniforms	"Been lurking here for a while working on my confidence as I am very new, but I wanted to post a small win I had this week. I work for a department in health and we have always had very binary uniforms. In the past I have asked my supervisor about getting access to the male uniforms as I have never felt comfortable in the female ones but was turned back saying they are not suited for women. The last couple weeks I had some deep conversations with a manager at another site who was so very supportive, while she’s is a very femme lesbian she is a fierce ally  to all forms of gender expression and she asked if I would be comfortable if she looked into it on my behalf. 

She spoke to someone who looks after the uniform allocation and they were actually very open to working something out. She had a lot of questions about expression outside the binary as she didn’t know anything about it but was very supportive and concerned that this is something they don’t have a plan for. They worked out between them a uniform in the men’s cut but the women’s pattern (like stripes vs checkered) so there would be less chance that I am targeted at work for the difference until they work on more inclusivity with the uniforms as a whole.

It’s a very small step as I am the first to ask about this but for me it felt really big. Thanks for reading :)"	"That's a great step! Good for you and I'm so happy you have allies at work. Hopefully there are more options in the future and more people can be comfortable in their uniforms! It benefits the company too, because if workers are happier and more comfortable, they will do better quality work.
You made history! It might not make it in the books; But, someone will someday say to themself, ""so glad there are options that are comfortable!"" and it'll be because of YOU! You'll be the reason someone feels comfortable in their own skin! You rock!!
Congrats! I’m glad you had an advocate, and I’m sure this change will benefit other in the future!!"	ldvsm2	NonBinary	23	1.0	2021-02-06 11:15:44
Does anyone else get annoyed they/them pronouns are seen as exclusively for enbies?	"I'm happy singular personal they/them pronouns are slowing becoming more normalized, but at the same time it does feel annoying many people view them as ""nonbinary pronouns"" and not just neutral ones anyone can use. This is especially apparent whenever nonbinary people are referred to as the ""theys"" or they is put into gendered words to try to be nonbinary inclusive. ie: theydies/gentlethems"	"There are plenty of things to be frustrated by. I don't like being referred to as an enby/enbie, for example; I'm a non-binary person. Enby feels infantilizing, similar to girl/boy vs man/woman. But I try not to make too much noise about it being used generally, because language is defined by how people use it, and there are a lot of more important things I can spend my energy being upset about. So yeah, people assuming they/them = non-binary or that only non-binary people can use them etc is annoying, but not to the point I'd have harsh words for someone over it. If that's where you want to put your energy, don't let me stop you, I'm not trying to disparage that idea. Just not worth it for me. I'd rather argue for basic human rights etc.
Pronouns are for everyone and anyone can use whichever pronouns they choose to use. I don’t think that they/them is exclusive to non-binary people.
I would be cool if more non enbys would use them because then they would be more/faster socially accepted
I've never had that impression but I also don't live in an English speaking country so idk how much my opinion counts. However when I don't know someone's gender on social media I also they/them them when talking about them because I don't wanna misgender them
If you're not already, you can do your little bit by using they/them yourself for cis people who haven't themselves expressed a preference for he/she. The more people who do that, the quicker it'll be normal. :-)

Awesome experience at Sh!t-Faced Shakespeare tonight!	"Three fantastic happenings at the theater tonight:

A sign between the (legally required) gendered bathrooms reading ""Bathrooms for Humans: left - general seating, right - standing room only"".

The show runner greeted the audience with ""Guys, gals, and nonbinary pals!""

In a completely impromptu conclusion (because Drunk Macbeth killed Malcolm), Banquo crowned herself the ""King...or Queen...or some non-gendered royal title - whatever, all that matters is I'm in charge now, I guess."" (Not verbatim, but pretty close)

They are playing for two more weekends. I'm going again next week! It was so amazing and welcoming to be explicitly included! Even in my crazily liberal, progressive city, (a)gender inclusiveness in language is still working to gain traction/visibility."		dke4qx	NonBinary	21	0.89	2019-10-20 03:11:54
The design of a nonbinary character for a story I'm creating, i'm not nonbinary but I really care about inclusivity and I think y'all are aweasome, the series is a space opera without humans and this character is the mentor of the protagonist and they use she, he and they, what are your thoughts?		"I'd probably ask what enby characters do justice towards representation and then study those. 

I honestly have no idea how you would approach this other than respectfully, which sounds like your plan.
As of rn, I think this is super great!! I say continue to ask the community as you develop the story more but I definitely love the character design!
The way I look into it is to treat just as I would treat any other character, they are still a complex human being, with wants, desires and dreams, a personality and a backstory.
I will do that, thank you for your reply, I'm open to learn I want to do this right.
Well they are not a human being they are alien but you got the idea, they are not in the story just to be the nonbinary character they are a character in the story who happens to be also nonbinary, but that is just their gender, it's not everything there is to them, you know how in media sometimes they will make inclusive character extremely  unidimension, I want to difer from that.
Fair warning that ""trans/non-binary character is an alien"" is considered a pretty harmful trope by quite a few people, myself included. It, quite literally, alienates us. Unless practically EVERYONE (especially the protagonist) is also an alien, I'd make them human.

In Honor of Juneteenth - Language Use	"Hello all! In honor of Juneteenth being today, I wanted to start a conversation about how we as a subreddit could be more inclusive of our African American siblings. 
I frequently see people in our community using the terms 'boi' and 'NB' when both of those terms are already used by African American communities. I used to use 'boi' to describe my gender identity until someone I follow on Instagram pointed out that this term has been appropriated by the LGBTQ+ community and originated from AAVE (African American Vernacular English). 'NB' is also already used by the AA community to mean 'non-black'.
Although it can be frustrating to have to change your language, think about how alienated someone might feel coming to this subreddit for solidarity only to be met with a community who uses language that does not belong to them.

I don't want to sound high-and-mighty. I certainly still have a lot of work to do as a white queer person to be more inclusive. I just hope to start a conversation about how we can be more inclusive in this digital space, especially as queer spaces are frequently white washed and are not inclusive of people of color."	"I’m kind of confused and don’t mean this aggressively: why is it bad for there to be multiple acronyms with the same abbreviation if they’re about different topics? When I’m talking about CSA, context will make it very obvious whether I’m talking about the Canadian Space Agency or Child Sexual Abuse.
An interesting post that addresses the use of 'boi':  https://theweefreewomen.tumblr.com/post/168190591507/boi-is-aave-and-u-are-not-black-therefore-u
Hi, I'm an African American of this community.

Now, I don't particularly use or talk to many people who use AAVE, but I figure I could throw my two cents in here.  I guess first I would say that I've never heard either of those terms used in a specifically black context.
Second, it seems like both words maybe mean something different in each context, which to me shows they might have both originated on their own. 
Third, AAVE kinda exists because of the subjugation of black folk leading to poor education.  You hear most poorly educated people talk in a similar manner, so while it's important to note its a dialect of English, it exists due to our having to teach ourselves the language in the past and passing that down.
Fourth, there are deep associations of the queer community with the African American community, the film Paris is Burning being a good example.  The ties of origin would obviously lead to similarities in language.
I guess my points here are that there's a difference between appropriation and sharing and I don't think this case is really either of those things.  To me, this case seems to be just two groups using words that are homophones.
And, not to be rude, but if you could show me where black folk are being affected by this I'd appreciate it.  I've just seen too many well-meaning, overzealous white folk try and help, but they just push back against things the African American community don't care about and end up making us look oversensitive in the process.  That might not be the case here, but I worry when I see some of this stuff.
Anyway, there's my block of text on the subject.
Thanks for listening.
I am often frustrated that queer/drag communities have appropriated SO MUCH AAVE. I've tried in the past to call it out but it falls on deaf ears. 

Thanks for pointing these things out, I'll be more mindful and use enby instead of being extra lazy and abbreviating.
I personally have zero issue with accommodating the request, but I also didn't use either before I was aware of the issue. I'm aware of the usage of ""boi"" in the lesbian AA community, vaguely, but don't know much about it tbh. I have watched a lot of conversations unfold in other groups about the use of ""nb"" and the majority seem to be in favor of honoring the request by qtbipoc people/groups to just stick with ""nonbinary"" (or ""non-binary"" if you're fancy) or ""enby"", though I've seen some comments from white and black nonbinary folks saying they didn't care. It doesn't seem worth it to alienate people in our own community over it, to me, considering how much racist push back arises within the community from a whenever poc speak up about anything important to them (just look at any time the Philly pride flag comes up or anything Islam related, fucking yikes). There's always going to be people who are just ""playing devil's advocate"" or trying to pretend everything is objective and logical when it comes to issues around race in the community and claim to not actually care or be against anyone, but that's not helpful.

&#x200B;

Considering how much of AAVE has been appropriated and had its meaning completely changed and how great the queer/trans/nonbinary communities are at creating new language to get around the limitations of existing terminology, it should be easy for us to adapt, grow and move on with this.
Got it! Thanks for letting us know!
Forgive me if I'm being ignorant here. But why is it a problem that language originating from one group is adopted by another group? Communities aren't monolithic institutions with no overlap or exchange. And it's not like language spreading from one group to the other is something new either. Just look at the amount of loan words in English, or have a look at the etymological origin of certain words in the English language. 

I guess I just find the idea that language would ""belong"" to a certain group quite strange. To me, language, just like ideas, are the common heritage of humanity. I don't think of language as belonging to one group rather to another. Now of course, the African American community has historically been disadvantaged, and it must feel frustrating to see the language of your community being used by the wider society, especially when it maintains systemic inequalities towards you. But I don't think forbidding people from using certain words is the answer. 

As for the abbreviation 'NB', it means something entirely different here. Following your rationale, New Balance shouldn't be allowed to use NB in their logo either. 

To be fair, as a white European, I imagine that there is a lot I don't know about in this debate. If anyone could explain to me why language appropriation is problematic, please, explain it to me. I'd like to get a better understanding of this topic, I really don't want to  alienate anyone here or belittle their experiences.
Thank you for bringing this up. I recently learned about NB meaning non black but I didnt know about boi so I appreciate it. I'm adopting enby to replace NB and I wil be sure to share about boi. I would hope that in a group that understands the importance of using the correct language (gender terms! Pronouns! Titles!) can see that this is important. If we want others to respect our choice in language to describe ourselves, we must offer that same respect to our siblings of color. I hope those who are uncomfortable or feeling the need to push back take a moment to reflect because we all know how frustrating it can be to be questioned and argued with when talking about our identities.
thanks, it's important to make sure queer spaces are anti-racist
I'm white as hell but live in a very diverse (but heavily segregated) area. I've spent a lot of time in places where people of color converse without code switching and what the hell, I've never heard half of this.
Outside of cases that involve intellectual property rights I generally dont see great harm in the ""approriaton"" of culture.  Also I dont think use of ""NB"" as a shorthand for nonbinary would be classified as appropriation the two uses are totally different concepts that just happen to share the sound the same.  Should we stop saying the ""San Francisco Bay Area"" because ""Bae"" is an AAVE word that sounds the same?  Those are my opinions though what are other peoples opinions;  This is a question open to everyone because we arent going to make progress in understanding each other better if we dont have a real open honest dialogue.  For the people that believe earnestly that cultural appropriation is a real concern, how would you rank cultural appropriation as an issue being faced as more or less important than any of these issues?

•discrimination in housing and employment against African Americans
•police brutality and harsher penalties for African Americans vs Whites when having commited the same offence as well as jury bias
•lower educational spending in public schools serving primarily African Americans and other people of color compared to spending in public schools primarily serving White students
•racist violence and terror perpetrated by white supremist groups
•environmenal racism where African Americans are more likely to live in areas with worse air quality or closer to toxic waste dumps.

We only have so much time, energy and resources so we need to be wise where we choose to spend them.  Like how important is it when 12 year old kids say ""iz"" instead of ""are""?
The end of this post seems particularly relevant and on point:

&#x200B;

 

*""it’s still just a word that can be replaced.* 

*It isn’t more important to me than a living, breathing person or their feelings.""*
Ok so we've said that replacing it is easier then saying ""fuck you"" to these peoples culture and language but replace it to what? I had no idea boi was AAVE and right now I feel a little lost. Could I use boye instead? And in regards to nb, I've seen it been referred to as nonblack by the black community yes, but it's also 2 letters that mean lots of things. I've seen it used as ""not bad"", ""non bordeline"" used in the bpd community to refer to those without the disorder, ""nonbinary"" as we all know, and if you search up ""nb flag"" I get the flag for the Canadian province New Brunswick. 

I can find a word for my identity to replace boi, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the acronym especially because ""enby"" comes off as very juvenile and it's very divided in the community on whether or not we want to be called enby as a whole
Drag was somewhat born out of the African American communities, so its usage of AAVE makes sense. 

See the film Paris is Burning for about the first mainstream appearance of drag and trans folk.
Think of it like music. Blues, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Hip hop, Rap; these were all scandalous music for the masses--until white people started singing it. Suddenly you have this great discovery credited to a white person. 

For context I'm white, disabled, and polyamorous;   and will admit I'm having trouble wrapping my head around NB atm.  

I can't tell you how many times I've been talking about my CP, and someone asks why I'm talking about club penguin. I'm the minority status in this one, and I'm fine with other people using the same acronym for non harmful things.

Poly was used by polynesians before polyamory exploded. The sudden popularity of the latter, was disrupting search results, so I have no problem switching to polya or spelling it out. (Idk if my post history reflects that...😖) 

My issue comes from being told that I (a minority)  should not use an acronym to describe myself, because another minority uses to describe other people.
Context is key here, nb is being used for a completely separate meaning and completely separate context while terms like boi are borrowing a concept but removing it from context, in a way that further marginalizes the people who use it. Using nb how we do doesn't hurt anyone.

And just to add to your point about abbreviations in general -- CP also means child porn and poly also means polysexual 😉"	c2jzbk	NonBinary	21	0.84	2019-06-19 17:31:16

My girlfriend is making a dating/social networking site that is *actually* gender-inclusive!	"This is a text post because there's some things you have to know first. The main thing is it's **alpha**, so it's not very polished or fully-featured yet.

http://www.starfriends.org

And like, whenever I see any statement that a site like this is gender-inclusive, that means... there are three gender options. We're still ""other: custom"". Nothing else about the site is changed to accommodate us, we're tolerated. Right?

This site has custom pronouns and your identity is just a series of tags, as many of which as you like being your gender. You get matched based on tags in ""i am"", ""you are"" and ""we'd be"". I am so excited about this site. :D

We have a telegram group for tech support and general nattering (linked on the site when you join), so that's pretty cool too. :)

So yeah, I wanted to share!

Edit to add: If you want a sneak peak at the pronouns and tags and stuff, I blogged about them and there's screenshots: http://cassolotl.tumblr.com/post/140032770025

Edit again: That blog post is kind of old, there's over 80 members now!"	"""It's okay to be cis!"" ??? cringe.

Student council	So during tutor today we were told we needed to elect two students from our form for the student council, ‘one boy and one girl’. I was really hyped up about the student council just so I could say a bit about sorting sensory issues and gender inclusivity in our school (since it recently became an academy and we’re moving to a larger site so we’re expecting a lot more students) and it just made me really sad that despite being out to a lot of people at school, and there being another openly enby kid in my class , theyre still saying we need ‘one boy and one girl’. And when the teacher was writing down the names of people who wanted to join, she put it in boy/girl columns, and didnt even hesitate putting me in the female section Which idk what I expected but it made me really sad.	"That's really unfortunate and painfully ironic, I'm sorry. It's also fundamentally a terrible way to select representatives. Can you do a petition or something to eliminate the categories and let people just be elected on merit?
I’m the other nonbinary and social anxiety and the gender stuff made me take my name off the list
I’m really hoping I cam pluck up the courage to talk to my tutor about it tomorrow , thanks for the idea :)"	na3l24	NonBinary	19	0.96	2021-05-11 18:15:17
Employer changed my preferred name on our payroll site	I guess this is just a little mini rant. I’m pretty sure they changed it because I’m in management and nobody at work really refers to me by my preferred name so they had a hard time finding me or something. I haven’t started the process to legally change my name at all. People tend to think my preferred name is just a joke. But why even have a section for preferred name if they’re just going to change it back to my legal name for their convenience. It feels like they just have that section to seem as though they’re more inclusive..	"Id suggest talking to an employment lawyer. 


Like you said 'they treat ur preferred name like a joke' thats transphobia and thats illegal.


For example at my university in australia, if you put blahaj as your preferred name.  The university teachers are required to use that name and can get in alot of trouble by not refering to u as it. 



I put blahaj as the name in the example cause i couldnt think of something gender neutral
can you send an email letting everyone know that Zenith is your preferred name and to please not introduce you or refer to you as your old name? i found that when i wasn’t firm with my preference, people felt awkward calling me the “unofficial” name. it helps to be clear i think.
That’s really annoying. If there is an EEOC rep (if you’re in the US), and there usually is, then I’d go to that person. I learned that this person isn’t always in HR, so they can be hard to find sometimes
I’ve been working for this company for 3 years and I’ve really only started introducing myself as Zenith recently but it usually whoever I’m with will say “her name is [legal name]” so that’s how everyone knows me and refers to me. I don’t really know what an end goal would be as I never came out cause I don’t really have a pull towards any gender and typically allow people to refer to me as whatever pronouns without correcting them. Everyone knows me as my legal name and I feel like the only way anyone would take my preferred name seriously is if I legally change it or get a new job.
I just feel like it wouldn’t really matter anyway. Someone would probably argue that I don’t correct people but I do introduce myself as my preferred name. Other people that I’m with are always like “her name is [legal name]”. I never felt the need to come out or anything because I just don’t see the point of it. I have no strong pull to gender and I don’t correct people on pronouns or anything cause I just don’t care either way. I’m just frustrated because it was exciting to see on my payroll website dashboard “Hi Zenith…” when I logged in. I don’t know what exactly my complaint would be or anything so it just seems like a lot of work for something I feel isn’t that important I guess
Just wanted to say that Zenith is a really cool name 😎😁
I understand. I didn’t complain at a previous job about something similar even though it was a big deal to me. But later when it came out for other reasons, I was surprised to find the EEO rep actually took it really seriously. That was working for the state though, so probably very different. Anyway, it still sucks, even if it’s not something you have the energy to pursue. I feel for you
Thank you!!
We’re the biggest franchise group for the chain restaurant I work for but it’s definitely nothing like working for the state. I don’t even know if we have a EEO rep. I’m pretty sure I’d have to talk to the head of head of HR. The company is run by a bunch of old rich white men lol not that I don’t think they’d care but I don’t think non-binary is a term they’d understand.

Cis folks are experts on trans and non binary folks	"Look, I don't want to be shitty or anything, and this sub is a super positive, inclusive space, and I try really hard to be super kind and open on the occasion that people ask questions about my gender. 
But why, every single time, is always cis folks who suddenly become experts on gender and sex - from a psychological, sociological *and* physiological point of view.

This evening I was told via text by a cis person that:
 
""Non-binary and trans are different tho. 
 Trans people think there are 2 sexes (i.e. people with a y chromosome are male, people who lack a y chromosome are female), like you can actually see for yourself.  Hence MTF, FTM.  
But non-binary is more like an expression. So wouldn't make sense to make drastic permanent changes because you could present as what you were time down the line.""

They then went on to say that my gender is not non binary, that I must mean my gender _expression_.

As a non binary person, I definitely feel comfortable using the word trans in reference to myself. I know that some folks also don't, and that's okay too. And I know a lot of trans folks mtf/ftm who also refer to themselves as non binary. Non binary does not always 100% of the time mean agender, it just means outside of the 'two binary genders'.

Also, idk about you folks, but to me, saying that being non binary is 'like an expression' comes across as likening it to a phase, or a fashion statement, and massively belittles so many people. 

Finally, why is non binary a gender 'expression' when folks who are male or female (regardless of their sex) just get a gender? Nonsensical, pick a lane.

It's just much more difficult because I have had such a great time over lockdown, not being misgendered because I've only seen my partner with whom I live, or close friends, and haven't had to feel the need to try and defend myself because these stupid, unnecessary conversations haven't come up.

TLDR: Cishet people always know more about sex and gender than LGBTQIA+ folks do, being non binary is as much of a phase as emo was, trans people think there are two sexes and we're not allowed to say that it's our gender, but that it's our gender _expression_.

EDIT: the TLDR is very very sarcastic"	"Ah, and here we have the majority stepping in to explain the minority experience *to the minority.* Ugh. I'm frustrated too, OP.

Uneducated uninformed people are uneducated and uninformed. This is dunning-kruger, plain and simple. If they want to go down the chromosome road, I'm happy to walk that road with them. I've got plenty of peer reviewed scientific papers pointing out that X and Y chromosome have very little to do with anything, and sex as a concept is a hell of a lot more complicated than that. And another stack of links on how sex and gender aren't the same thing.

As for how someone chooses to identify, ""the one who says it's impossible shouldn't interrupt the one who's doing it."" They can't see into my soul and dictate to me what my experiences are, nor the terms I use to describe my own experience.

Basically, on all counts, this person was gatekeeping. And gatekeeping is objectively harmful to everyone. And they can sod off with that, thank you very much.

tl;dr: I feel your pain. I'm glad you've avoided it for a while during lockdown.
Tbh I could tolerate it (untrained people outside of a community think they are ""experts"" regardless of whether it's a minority's experiences or anything else, it's just how asses roll), except, they put these asses in positions of power where they can gatekeep us, whether it's through policy, or through our medical care.

Like having a cis person, or a panel of cis people, sit and decide whether I am trans, and thus whether I get to transition or receive legal recognition of my gender, *should* be laughable. But it's not, it's policy.
I wish they would hurry up and breed the colonialism out of them damn selves. Cisexism is REAL.
The Dunning-Kruger effect strikes again :/
This person says 'i like genetics it's more interesting' And that 'sex is based on chromosomes, it's empirical'

I am fucking embarrassed to say that this person has a nursing degree, and is doing a PhD in fertility, but for some reason thinks that non binary/trans people shouldn't be included in this fertility study, under the assumption that no trans/non binary folks have offspring.
YES this topic came up because I said that despite knowing I was non binary for two decades (and before I knew the term even existed haha) I hadn't registered as non binary with my GP for a handful of reasons, the main social issue right now, being that folks who are registered as non binary or male (when they were afab) are struggling to get cervical screening tests done because the software system is outdated/shitty/ there is no option for 'owns a uterus' other than 'female' - which is bad for so many reasons but a big one being that HPV is so treatable and people are being declined that treatment because of crappy software, argGHHHH
They sound like a lot of the healthcare providers I've interacted with, both as a patient and as a healthcare provider myself. Trans and non-binary identities and health concerns aren't mentioned in pretty much any non-endocrine course of medical study, and it's just bloody embarrassing at this point. I find myself being the walking trans encyclopedia explaining shit to people. It's exhausting. But my trans patients love me.
I feel like I need to explain that this person never actually practiced (other than their placement) and is only doing a PhD because they can't function properly in the real world and feels safe in education. 

You sound like an absolute asset to the world, never mind the healthcare system. You are a wonderful human and I am genuinely glad you exist.
Aww, thank you! I just threw together a few links in an [unrelated thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/nhbgjj/question/gyvgyzo/) if you need something to send them. I hope they have an open mind and come around.
Oh no, you see they aren't transphobic because 'ill call people whatever they want' and to be fair to them, they *do* use correct pronouns for folks, they just think they are correct in all the bizarre statements they make - which in a way is worse than people who are outwardly transphobic, because some people might actually think this person is explaining things correctly 🤦🏻

I'm always going to be *me.*"	"I feel like this is a really reductive view of “transness”. No one is saying that trans means “you’re fundamentally different now” and I don’t know how to feel about the idea of trans people being “the opposite of who they were”. This only makes sense if you take the term “transgender” at a really surface level glance. Trans has come to mean (and tbh has always on some level already meant) so much more than just “someone who is the opposite of who they were”. If you want to have fun with “prefix fundamentalism” then you should probably also address the bias against bi people this creates. Bi means 2 which means bisexual people have attraction to exactly 2 genders, right?

Totally agreed on all points.  For the longest time I had no idea what I was, until I found ""Non Binary"" as a label, and as of now I don't think I'll use it very often, I am just me in the same manner
Agreed, trans doesn't mean ""opposite of who they were,"" and we absolutely shouldn't reduce it to that. However, I'm non-binary and not trans so I don't really like when people say that trans is a bigger category which includes non-binary, which is something I've heard in a couple of communities. I'm also bi/pan, so I've been through that whole wringer. I think everyone should be able to identify with the labels that make sense to them or choose not to without invalidating other identities.

We all need to educate ourselves and respect and support each other. Gender isn't a neat venn diagram or a gradient, it's more a multi-dimension spectrum, and I think most of us here know that and are really accepting. But having some people's idea of what trans and non-binary ""should"" look like stuck on you when you don't feel that way can be like having the binary forced on you. That's where I think the feelings in this poem might have come from, because I relate to that a lot.
But nonbinary is trans. You can choose not to partake in the larger trans community but it won’t change the meaning of the words. You are not the same gender you were assigned at birth by some cocky doctor. Acknowledgement of this is basic to understanding the flaws of current at-birth gender determination. There is no critique of the construct without this fact.
And again, you can refuse to engage with this fact and its socio-political consequences, no one is stopping you really. If you don’t want to be part of a community or engage in the politics of how people react to our existence then no one can REALLY make you. But I can’t deny that my agender never-going-to-transition-medically self is still trans in the eyes of the society which dictates the meaning of that word. We all stand under that umbrella knowing that we all have similar but unique experiences that all revolve around defying what the “current status quo” of gender is.
Maybe in a future world that is less ridiculous we won’t assign gender at birth and the word trans will have no meaning because the concept of gender will be more universally understood to the point of making it irrelevant. But we don’t live in that world. Until then we are trans so we might as well be proud."	n47fx8	NonBinary	20	0.8	2021-05-03 21:10:27

I feel inconvenient and excluded (and am sad and tired)	"I used to identify as a non-binary woman, but for years now have exclusively identified as non-binary, and basically no longer go to women's spaces (they treat me and expect me to act like a woman, and I honestly can't do it anymore) 

Occasionally if there's a space I'm really interested in checking out or joining, I'll message the organizers and ask them if non-binary folks are welcome, and if so can they reflect that in their published language. I mostly don't ask anymore, because most of the time, the answer is no. And it gets really demoralizing after a while.   
\^ ""you're okay to come, but know that people like you aren't really welcome here generally, but we'll make an exception"" or ""of course you're welcome, this is a place for women, and you definitely fit that mold! :)"" is what this feels like  
\^\^ also! if i have to ask, I've also learned that that generally means no, people like me aren't welcome :\\ cause people can change their published language about their group, but they rarely put in effort to improve their internal culture and then trans folks end up getting pushed out anyway

I basically don't feel welcome, except in explicitly queer spaces, and even then only sometimes (depending on how they handle trans and non-binary folks) :T

\---

I'm upset right now :\\ because I found a mental health community that I really wanted to join, and this played out exactly this way. They have a sub-community for women, but when I asked about being intentionally inclusive of other gender minorities, told me that it wasn't a priority and probably wouldn't happen 

I'm so tired and sad of having to expect that people like me are not welcome as default, and that we're treated as inconvenient when we ask for a little room to exist.

It feels like this: [https://webcomicname.com/post/185588404109](https://webcomicname.com/post/185588404109)

I'm so tired of feeling like I have to trailblaze making communities that welcome people like me (for all kinds of things: language learning, accountability, different hobby groups, etc), and that if I sometimes can't do it, then I just don't really get to do that thing. 

I'm just tired and sad :("	"Hugs. You're valid and I'm sorry this is happening to you. I don't feel comfortable in women's spaces either.
I only enter womens only spaces with my cis female friends and I make a point of being an escort for trans people when they need to use them too. Im at the point in my life now where I will force my way into acceptance but I had to battle for that even before I came out of any of my closets.

You might not be able to do it alone, but my group of ladies, cis and trans, all battle on everyone behalf, and the cishet lads are learning. 

Try and find yourself a group that you know will fight for you when you're too tired to fight for yourself. Its hard but once they're there you can bring more into it like I do and like my sister does with her circle
I also don't like women only spaces and hate that I keep being suggested by professionals to go to them. You're valid as all hell, my friend.
I'm sorry you have to deal with it too. It sucks so much. The main community is all genders, which would be totally fine! I usually hangout in those spaces, and just practice correcting and teaching folks how to interact with trans people

But just, dang. Making a special women's space only, and telling other gender minorities to just deal, sends a strong message :\\"	qd7lpi	NonBinary	20	0.93	2021-10-22 02:45:15
Found out tonight how amazingly inclusive and awesomely LGBTQ+ Star Trek: Discovery is	"Was reading this fantastic [interview with Michelle Paradise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/12/02/star-trek-discovery-showrunner-answers-questions-but-wont-spoil-surprises/?sh=5583437159a6), the showrunner of Star Trek: Discovery, and learned that not only is she LGBTQ+, so are ***8 Star Trek Discovery cast members!***  Ian Alexander, Blu del Barrio, Wilson Cruz, Anthony Rapp, Tig Notaro, Emily Coutts, Mary Wiseman and Mary Chieffo are ***all*** in the LGBTQ+ community! **AND** if that wasn't awesome enough, one of the show's writers ([Andrew Kenneth Walsh](https://twitter.com/AndrewKWalsh/status/1463722552639963141)) is non-binary gender fluid!

I love Star Trek. And I love Discovery. This awesome representation makes me love it even more!"	"Curious - do I need to know anything about Star Trek to watch this? Like can I go in with no prior viewership and still understand what's going on? This show looks cook but I know Zip Zilch Nada about it (other than the VERY basics)
You don’t need to know anything about Star Trek to be able to enjoy Discovery.

If you don’t want to start all the way at the beginning of Season 1, the best place to jump in now would be the beginning of Season 3. Without getting into too many spoilers, there’s a huge time jump between the end of Season 2 and the start of Season 3… Like an almost 1000 year time jump! Which essentially resets the show, to a point… it’s most of the same characters, but brand new storylines.
 
And Season 3 sees the introduction of Adira (Blu del Barrio) & Grey (Ian Alexander); who are the non-binary and transgender characters on the show, respectively.

With that being said, Season 1 and Season 2 are still good. But the setting is different, and the show is a little hemmed in by the previous canon of the era of Star Trek that it is set in. Which, honestly, is probably why the show runners jumped the show ahead 1000 years at the end of Season 2. They’re now free to do whatever they want storyline-wise."	r7thhy	NonBinary	18	0.96	2021-12-03 07:25:52
My identity is a choice.	"I know reddit doesn't like long posts, but I don't have a blog or something to put this on, so here we are.  Maybe some people will read it.  I feel like there are not a lot of voices like me on the internet, so I want to add mine to the pot.

I am posting here instead of a more general transgender subreddit because I know for certain that transmedicalists and people against non-binary genders will not hear my argument at all, and I find that there are very few here.  Also, you're my people. :)

This post will make a lot more sense in the context of the following two articles and an optional video. However, if you want to read my post to see if you're interested (or angry, as I suspect some of you might be) you could also go back and read them after.  They're way more eloquent than I am in presenting their main argument. Following is my experience.

[“Transness as a Choice”](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/1327/)

[“Choosing To Be Trans: A More Positive Construction of Trans Identity”](https://medium.com/@brianna.lain/choosing-to-be-trans-a-more-positive-construction-of-trans-identity-a7c67b779d2)

[“How do I know if I’m trans?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2kjJT8O21U)

I am a person with a relatively high “Need For Cognition.” I don't think this makes me better or smarter than anyone else (though I was super cringey in middle school when I did,) but it means I like to really think through and deconstruct things, especially my values, beliefs, and identities.  Oftentimes I really need to think about a thing *too much.*

This has been a problem for me as a burgeoning trans person, because there is a very anti-intellectual attitude in the online trans community.  *Rightfully* so, because arguing about one's own self-identity (and one’s right to have one) with dissenters is a really bad idea.  The internet says things like “All 👏 identities 👏 are 👏 valid!” and ends the discussion there.  That’s a useful, important, and necessary mantra to normalize trans identities in a hostile society, but it’s not useful to people questioning their gender who want to find out what it means to be trans for them.  The trend away from intellectual discourse, while it minimizes harm by fighting cultural hate and giving new trans people space to exist in, can actually be harmful, because it can push people like me towards the people who *do* have intellectual discussion about transness on the internet — TERFs. I was like .5 inches away from being converted by some very persuasive TERF blogs at one point. It was a bad time and I'm glad I moved past it.

Anyway, despite this effort to be all-inclusive, the trans community does seem to circulate certain narratives.  Here are some of the narratives about how to know if you’re trans:

* If you experience gender dysphoria, you’re trans.
* If you always wanted to wear <non-natal gender>’s clothing, you’re trans.
* If you were gender non-conforming in your childhood, you’re trans.
* If you THINK about being trans, you’re trans.

These and others like them — often directly in opposition of each other — were all I had to work with when I first started my research. These narratives made me tremendously anxious.

“What if I’m faking it for attention?” “What if this is actually internalized misogyny and trauma and I’m thus turning my back on women?” “What if I don’t experience much gender dysphoria?” “What if I liked being girly when I was little?” “What if I still identify with women’s issues that I have experienced?” “Am I just saying I’m trans because a friend came out as trans and I want to be cool like them?” “Am I confusing transness with gender nonconformity? Am I actually playing into gender stereotypes by removing myself from gender for wanting to not conform?” “Am I even allowed to ask these questions? Is this actually an unstoppable train that I am not in control of?” “Who am I really, *deep down?”*

And on top of it all, I couldn’t help but feel like something was off — like there was something missing at the center of it all (but of course that thought horrified me, because I did not want to become “Unwoke” about transness and be kicked out of the leftist club.)

I finally hit paydirt a few days ago and found the resources I linked above.  This made me realize that the real missing piece here, for me anyway, is that in these narratives, being trans is seen as always\* being an unchangeable identity or fact that you’re born with.  Then, these narratives are used to gatekeep “real” or “born this way” trans people from “posers” and “trenders” who just want to “jump on the oppression bandwagon.”

The “if you think about it, you’re trans” argument was created as a way to combat the gatekeeping, but it’s problematic in a completely different way. It leaves no room for cis people to explore their gender without being forced down the trans path, and can turn the question “What if I’m trans” into a scary question about an unchangeable truth.

Okay. Here's where I'm skipping all the really good arguments made by the aforementioned articles and getting metaphysical.

The reality is, when I am grappling with my gender as an unchangeable truth to be found deep within myself, I am looking for an answer that *doesn’t exist*.  There is no “true self” of any kind deep down inside, waiting to be dug out — or at least, not one supported by science.  My own religious beliefs can be best described as Atheist Buddhism, so this makes even more sense to *me*.  In Buddhism there is the concept of “no self” — there is no soul, no essence, that makes a person a person. There is only the travel of their body through time and space.  A person is like a piece of music. If I play the note C and ask you which song it’s from, you can’t tell me, because a note is not a song.  A song is the progression of many notes through time.  A song is an experience.  Life is an experience.

There is only the self at the present moment.  This explains why, no matter how many questions I ask of myself, I can’t figure out what gender I really am “deep down.”  In reality, I have been standing at a crossroads *in the present*: Will I continue to identify and present as a woman, will I identify as a woman and present more butch, or will I begin to identify and present as a non-binary gender?

The reason this has been so hard for me is that I knew the answer to that question. This is where some other trans narratives come in to play.  On some level, I *want* to be non-binary, and I had been told *by trans people* that it’s wrong to *want* to be anything other than the gender I was born as.  I was told that I should feel like I am suffering from a great affliction, the only solutions to which are death, or a fate portrayed as barely worse than death, *transition*. I was told that I should feel like I have no other option but to be trans, or die.

Well, none of this is the reality for me.  For some of my life, especially in recent years, I have felt dissatisfied with my gender.  I have never felt like I wanted to die if I had to live the rest of my life as a woman.

I *have* felt like I would be happier if I could be a different gender, but for many years I didn’t even know there were options other than male or female, and I’ve known with great certainty that I am not a man.  The idea that I was non-binary bubbled around in the back of my mind for several years after hearing about it, but I never felt like I needed to consider it because I didn’t feel like it was actively ruining my entire life.

The gender dysphoria I feel is quite minor compared to most people.  It has never made me want to kill myself. I have never even laid awake at night in misery about it.  I have never wanted to cut off any of my body parts.  I’m already a pretty mentally ill person, so the unhappiness the dysphoria adds to my life is easy to get mixed in with everything else that adds unhappiness to my life.

This is not an easy case of dysphoria = trans.  Some of the dysphoria could be (and has been) solved by dressing in a more butch manner while maintaining the gender identity of female.  And, as far as what will make me the least unhappy, it’s basically a toss up between the amount of misery that gender dysphoria adds to my life and the amount of misery that being trans in the midwest *will* add to my life.

I am really *not* definitely trans, or definitely cis.  At some point the difference between a person who identifies as a particular gender and a person who identifies as a different gender can be negligent.  Both could dress the same, act the same, have the same body parts, use the same pronouns, use the same bathroom, have the same name even, have the same sexual preferences, and have the same childhood memories, and be entirely valid in each of their gender identities.

So, I actually have a choice.  This brings us back to the question I presented earlier.  My choice is that I am trans non-binary.  Why? Because I *want* to be non-binary.  Because when *I* look in the mirror and think of myself as a non-binary person, I feel joy and kindness towards myself.  Because when I feel like I’m not being gendered, I am *more* happy. Because I feel that non-binary is a label and lifestyle more true to who I am in the present, and one of my most core values is authenticity.  And finally, because I consider myself to be a bit of a conscientious objector to the gender binary itself.  In another life, could I easily be a butch lady and get along comparably fine? Yes. But to me, these feelings of self actualization I get from being non-binary\*\* are worth the pain of living in a society that doesn’t accept me.

\* For some people, they feel they *are* “born this way” and that is 100% *not* invalidated by the folks like me who don’t.  Some people seem to be born with an inherent interest in music, and some aren’t, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t both musicians. I will reiterate what Brianna said in her article: Some trans people feel very differently about their transness than I do. They might actually be ""born"" trans, perhaps even physically or neurologically or what have you, and not have a choice.  I think these people deserve more than simply a footnote, but a footnote is all I have to offer because I do not experience transness the way they do.  Many, many other people have written about their experiences as being *born* trans.  But I want to offer the idea that those of us who don't feel that way are valid, and don't have to justify our existence.

\*\* I have used the term non-binary throughout this post instead of a more specific term like agender because I like how general and open-ended it is.  I don’t feel the need to add any more qualifiers. I want to live in the grey space.

Edit: I would just like to point out that there is already a post on /r/asktransgender ranting about how being trans is not a choice. I am super glad I didn't post there."	"I find this very intriguing, as a fellow gender-obsessed intellectual ;) This got very long and reddit is being an ass about the character limit (it's 9508/10000) so I'll split it into two.

(1/2)  
Identity, in and of itself, is a choice, the way I see it. However, one's feelings, experiences, interests, etc, that make us come to that identity conclusion, may not be. What is an identity, if not an individual person's own conclusion of their own subjective experience, which cannot be measured or proven? I don't see anything wrong with that. We need some kinda language to communicate to others what matters to us.

This is what I know about myself, in no particular order:  
\- I was born a typical female, physically. Developed in a normal, healthy way.  
\- Stylewise, I've always been the most drawn to fancy makeup, dresses, high heels, nail polish, long hair, tinsel tassel, anything sparkly, shimmery, pretty, lacey, soft and curve-hugging. This I choose to call my ""affininity for femininity.""  
\- I've always felt as though I should have male secondary sex traits, in addition to retaining all of my naturally female sex traits, and that wish has been so strong that it was unbearable. I choose to call this my ""body/sex dysphoria"" although it is not typical of binary trans men, nor of cis women.  
\- Considering my previous point, I've always been drawn to things relating to physical masculinity, such as visible muscles and beards. But not so much societal/cultural masculinity such as bulky clothes and short hair. Basically I'm not butch by any means.  
\- I've always been fine with being called/seen/treated as a girl, woman, female, etc; and equally fine with being seen/read/treated as a boy, man, male, etc. I have no pronoun preference what so ever, and don't mind going by my female birth name. Meaning I feel no distress or even the slightest discomfort, or any euphoria for that matter, in regards to how I'm perceived socially by others or myself genderwise. This I choose to call my ""total absense of social gender dysphoria.""  
\- I've always felt like my personality is an ""androgynous blob"" but I have difficulty seeing that as a gender, without attributing gender to stereotypes.  
\- I took testosterone hrt and I loved it. It actually alleviated most of my ""body/sex dysphoria.""  
\- I had my breasts removed surgically and I hate it. I miss my breasts so bad I grieve them. I'm in constant distress over my flat chest. Thus, I want to get breast reconstructed, and I opt for silicone implants.  
\- I tried living as both a trans man and as a cis woman. Both made me feel trapped and miserable, yet I loved aspects of both.

I could add more to the list, but I think that's what's most important. Then let's dive into why I choose to identify as nonbinary, with those points in mind. That I don't seem to have any social/gender dysphoria, means that I could actually be totally at peace with going about my life as a woman, sticking to she/her pronouns, referring to myself as a woman, being called a lady, Ms., ma'am, use women's bathrooms and locker rooms, etc. I feel at peace with being viewed as a member of my female sex, and I do not disidentify from my sex, basically. So then... am I even trans at all? Looking at only that ONE aspect: no, I appear pretty cis. But there isn't just that one aspect about me.

I think I clearly have body/sex dysphoria in a very trans sorta way. Being female doesn't bother me, but LOOKING clearly female absolutely does/did, so to the point that I needed to take testosterone to the point of passing as male. But I also needed to retain all of my originally female parts, so my dysphoria doesn't feel binary male. Now being transitioned (aside from my chest issue), my body finally feels like a home, and a temple.

But then... can't women take testosterone and like it and still be women? Eh, that's where it gets complicated. Technically, yes of course that is possible. No one can or should stop cis women from taking T if they truly want a beard and deep voice, right, but is it possible socially? No, frankly it is not. Because first of all, any female person claiming to want those physical features are being told they cannot then be cis women. They are told that is incorrect thinking. Furthermore, living as a male-passing woman who does not want to pass as female, was something that I found to be so difficult in practice that it became too much for me. It isn't dysphoria-inducing, not at all. But it's very, very frustrating and challenging. I can no longer access women's spaces, convincing people of my still female sex is next to impossible (even doctors!), other women view me as a threat and an imposter, I am frequently mistaken for being a non-passing trans woman, and so on. I'm simply no longer welcome into society as a woman, based on my choice of looks. 

Oh is it misogynistic? You bet your ass it is! But what can I do about it? Realistically, in actuality, what CAN I possibly do about it? Honestly, not much. I can either suck it up and ""admit"" to being a man, or I can fight and keep explaining how I'm really a woman, but I cannot win that fight. I have essentially... lost my right to be a woman. That scares me, but I have to deal with it somehow.

And that's when I realised that I just had think of a solution to that mess. Claiming that I was simply an androgynous cis woman, despite being dysphoric and medically transitioned, was very poorly understood and only made socialising more difficult for me. I then, after a lot of deep thinking, basically came to the conclusion that considering my circumstances, passing as an ambiguous, suspiciously curvy, overtly feminine male while being bio female and proud of it, and loving the way I look - nonbinary would be a more socially acceptable label for me to go by. I understand that usually nonbinary is not at all a socially acceptable label, but... then most people probably don't transition first and then try to figure out how to label their looks.

Did I double down? Well, depends on how you look at it, but I'd rather say that what I did was admit defeat because I couldn't handle the heat, and that I use the nonbinary label mostly as a shield to protect myself somewhat. A woman protecting herself from misogyny is not compliant in the misogyny that she faces. Any feminist should know that, I think. But nonbinary is not just a label out of practicality for me. As soon as I picked it up, I felt a huge sense of relief. It, as a boxless box, has no demands on me. It says I don't need to change my looks to be a socially acceptable human being. It tells me that I can just BE and there is nothing wrong with the way I am and the way I love my unconventional body. Considering myself nonbinary... made me finally feel allowed to love my beard, deep voice and body hair - as well as my vagina, curves and pursuing new breasts. As soon as I picked up that label, a sense of wholeness and self-love rushed over me. I cried. I actually did. Problem is though: why can't I be myself as freely, as a woman? WHY?!
I can relate to a lot of what you're saying. 


Several years back I would have told you I'm atheist Buddhist. I still hold on to a lot of those philosophies. So maybe my perspective is similar.


I've gone through a few existential crises. I've questioned existence and strongly focused on myself. With the single greatest question always being, Who am I? 


I've gone through a ton of self doubt about my non-binary identity. Like you, I need to analyze and logically assess things. I need to understand why I'm non-binary and have that be valid to myself. I also need to know what that means to me and how it impacts my life and sense of self.


I partially agree that this is a choice. But I say partially because I think only parts of it are a choice. 


We definitely choose to embrace or deny this identity. I think everyone would agree with that. Though perhaps for some their drive to be seen and understood overrides that choice.


I think we choose to use and identify with specific labels. These are part of language and everyone understands each label a little differently. We also understand ourselves differently and might feel that a given trait or quality pushes us one way, while someone else with the same trait or quality feels it pushes them another.


I think we choose whether or not we even ask these questions at all. Sometimes this choice is taken away or thrust upon us, too. Sometimes we're not given the space or freedom to ask these questions while staying safe.


But ultimately, who we are at any given moment, who we are as the entire being that has made the journey to this day, that's more than choice. That's also impacted by consequence and chance. We're changed by our experiences. We're changed by every person we meet, by every comment in Reddit we read and write.


So gender. We are assigned a gender at birth. Society defined what genders exist, and all of us make up that society. Society decides the traits and qualities that individuals with those genders are supposed to have.


But it's more than just driven by society. It's also in our nature. It's a sort of agreement. A way to divide things up to optimize survival.


Non-binary is a collection of refound gender identities. Identities and roles that have been missing in Western Colonial culture. As a society we've reintroduced these and we're actively defining what they mean and what it means to be outside of the gender binary. In that sense, too, it's a choice.


But, deep down, who we are is a result of past choices, past experiences, and the consequences of the journey we've been on. Who and how we are today still comes with choices, but some of those choices have already been made, or were made for us in the past. Our choices today are more about how we embrace or deny the reality that we've landed in.


So, how we react to the situation of our being is a choice. Buddhism says this is who we are. This is the only moment. But I've come to find that we are more than a moment. 


I've come to know that we are interconnected with all reality in a way that is difficult to put to words. And in that interconnectedness, we are everything and we are nothing. And time is more than a moment, but also just a moment.


Being non-binary is both a choice and not a choice. 
I'm really late to this discussion but I just wanted to thank you for posting this. I'm in a similar boat and thoughts of this nature have been consuming me lately, and everyone's discussion here has given be some great insights and resources to look into.
You used the label ""rant"". Do you only want to rant or would you like to hear also different views and thoughts about this topic?
(2/2)  
But then, what about my gender? I see it in two different ways. On one hand I'm an androgynous person with sex dysphoria, transitioned, but still a woman because ultimately I've made peace with my female sex and feel positively connected to it. On the other hand I'm a nonbinary person because of my androgynous personality and sex dysphoria, but I'm also fine with referring to myself as a woman because of my positive connection to my female sex. Both of those statements can be true... simultaneously. I see them as two different perspectives of how I can choose to interpret myself. There is no right or wrong to either. But one of those labels is more socially difficult to wear than the other.

So, is me being trans a choice? Yes and no. I chose to be gender ambiguous, but I feel like it wasn't a conscious choice. I followed my dysphoria blindly, but I'm actually surprised that it led me here. In a perfect world, I still would have wanted and needed to transition medically, but I would have been perfectly fine and preferred doing that as a woman. But instead I live in a sexist dumpsterfire of a world, and thus I have to adapt to my surroundings. I don't think my sex dysphoria was a choice, even though my transition to alleviate it most definitely was. And my label as nonbinary is also a choice. But what is it that constitutes as my presumed transness? Is it my label, my transition, or my dysphoria; or all three? And does my connection to my sex erase my transness, or merely complicate it?

I leave that up to you (general you), but in my personal opinion, I'd say I count as trans, on the basis of my sex dysphoria and that I'm happily transitioned, even though I don't actually feel disconnected from being female. Because ultimately I cannot be cis. It's been proven to me over and over. The problem though, that because I do not disidentify from my sex, I have to go by the truscum/transmedicalist definition of trans to call myself trans. But fear not, I hold all definitions of trans at once.

Was I born trans? Yes, I believe that my sex dysphoria is probably something that I was born with, to my dismay. But I have no animosity towards those who weren't ""born that way"" and instead see themselves as trans for other reasons. I'm very open-minded about definitions and the like, as long as people are being honest and real, I will listen and try my best not to judge. And I find your perspective especially refreshing simply because of how compassionately and openly you deliver it. You have my respect, and I wish you the best of luck on your trans journey through life.
I strongly agree with the choice/nonchoice dichotomy.  In my post I really focused on the choice aspect because I feel like that's not something that is really....*allowed* to be talked about in trans spaces?  But here in the comments section I will take a stab at it.

I think the idea that ""who we are is result of past choices, past experiences, and the consequences of the journey we've been on"" is definitely true, and it actually also fits in my atheist buddhist perspective quite well -- in Buddhism there is the idea that everything is a product of many other things, and that includes us.

Personally though I've actually seen things as less choice-based than your average American would for a long time before I developed my current religious beliefs, ever since I got really interested in psychology.  I realized that the mind is not necessarily something we have control over.  We are truly a collection of our genetics, experiences, etc and the line between what is and is not a choice is often very fuzzy or literally impossible to suss out.

( As a quick, philosophically interesting but unrelated aside, this philosophy has made it much easier for me to be forgiving towards people for doing ""bad"" things, because they are not only someone who chose to do a bad thing, but a victim of the conditions that led them to make that choice.  I'm also less apt to worship high-achievers and do-gooders because they are *also* someone who is a product of the conditions that led them to make *good* choices.)

Regardless of whether we are literally fatalistically doomed to make certain choices or not -- which is definitely not something I have the answer to -- I think the *heuristic* of choice is very important to the human experience.  Our experience at many points in life is that we feel we have a choice, perhaps because we cannot see the future. And that (possibly illusory?) choice is very important to the human experience of life and happiness.  People seem to suffer in environments where choice is taken away from them.

When we do not believe we have a choice at all, that can lead us down a different path than if we do believe we have a choice.  It can very easily lead us down the path of misery, because instead of actively choosing the thing that the conditions of our life has made most suitable for us, we may end up ""choosing by default"" some circumstance that does not suit us at all.  Even if we end up ""choosing by default"" the ""right"" choice for us, feeling that we were forced into a certain path can sour the entire thing.

I think some of what you were getting at, is that there *is* a very large difference between not knowing that a choice exists at all and feeling like a choice is being taken away from us.  I think this is why there are so many more trans people now than there used to be in western society.  Our greater awareness of gender has led people to realize that gender *could* be a choice, and that that choice was taken away from them repeatedly throughout their lives.  Some people are reclaiming that choice by choosing to be a different gender than they were assigned.  Is it because they were somehow all along essentially the gender they choose to ""become"", or is it because the experience of being forced into a gender has soured the experience of their assigned gender completely? Or for some other reason?  Who knows. I don't think it matters or makes any one person less valid than another.

This is why I think it's important that in the trans community we reclaim our *right* to have a choice in our gender.  The only way we've been able to seek validity in the mainstream eye is by saying ""this is just the way I am, I can't help it!"" (the articles I linked go into this more in depth.)  But when we make being trans or cis *not* a matter of choice, that's just forcing another default choice on us.  And that's a really difficult default to figure out because what makes one person trans and one person not is not in any way universal, just like ""vagina = woman"" is not universal.
I would also like to drop this link which talks about the idea of why there are more trans people now [https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/07/10/why-more-transgender-people/](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/07/10/why-more-transgender-people/)

And also this one, which talks about how the ""born this way"" narrative hurts bi people  [https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/born-this-way-narratives-hurt-bi-people/](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/born-this-way-narratives-hurt-bi-people/)

Really though just read the whole damn blog lol
You're welcome!
I switched to discussion :)
Hi, it is kinda random but can you look at your directs  please? Thanks
This was a very interesting read!  I find it really touching that you enjoyed my perspective despite it being different from yours.

Your case is very different from mine, but also similar in some ways and also seemingly unique and thus we can relate to each other.  We're both in a weird gray area that isn't easy to define.
I definitely want to read all this and talk more. But today got busy on me. I'll try to respond when I can.
The first article is great. A lot of what they wrote aligns with what I was agreeibg with. Some parts of gender are a choice. 

I still hold that parts are not choice, at least for some (most?) people, and rather something more innate. Either by nature (genetics), learned behavior, or potentially environment and experience driven. 

The second article is tougher. I want to agree that the born this way narrative is harmful. That it might not be entirely correct, and likely isn't in all cases.

But, I don't know that the world is ready for that narrative to change yet. A lot of the freedom that has been fought for was done on the premise that sexual orientation isn't a choice. Trans rights piggyback on that basis.

I think this is a taboo subject in the LGBTQ+ community because it feels like changing that narrative could jeopardize the rights we fought for. I'm not sure that fear is unfounded, either.

Personally, I do believe I was born this way. I've dug up a lot of my past and as a kid I was really damn queer. Different traumas impacted me in different ways as I got older and I repressed my queerness. 

I was that person who chose not to be themself and instead disassociated and used escapism as a coping mechanism. But eventually that had exactly the sort of impact you'd expect. So I tried to figure everything out and rationalize and use logic to explain myself to myself. 

That worked for a while, but I never came out and ultimately sunk back into my old ways. Disassociated and escaped right up until another existential crisis made me realize this can't go away by choice.

So while I chose to live as my AGAB, then chose to just not come out, ultimately that failed and left me with a type of Sophie's choice. Either try to repress all this again, which might kill me, or embrace it and be myself, come out, and stop pretending I'm something I'm not.

It's not a unique story. 

I think folks who have an experience like mine could be inclined to believe that everyone has the same sort of experience. I don't believe this. I love how beautifully diverse we all are. In all ways, but especially experience. 

I think there's room for all sorts of possibilities. 

But really, what I believe. At the core of gender, within every single person, is some sort of fluid matrix of identity. 

I don't think any person is 100% their any gender label. I think they could identify with a more fitting label if they find one (a type of choice). And I think our gender identities can and do change over time. 

I don't really think gender is necessarily a part of who we are at all, though. At least not beyond an old survival instinct that we no longer need. Society just carries it forward because it worked for such a long time, and it's a handy way to classify people.

Really, I think we're all just beautiful completely unique diverse individuals trying to survive, find happiness, and be loved.
Np!
I definitely agree that the world isn't ready for this narrative yet.  Changing the narrative out in the bigger world right now *probably would* turn the clock back.  I mean, look at the state of politics in the western world right now. Shit's crazy. We need all the ideological defense we can get.  It makes sense that going against the born this way narrative is a taboo topic in the LGBT community because the ""born this way"" defense is all we have right now.  

It does suck because it alienates people like me.  From what I've seen on other trans subreddits, I think it also really bothers some other young trans people, who struggle to find evidence that they *were* born that way so that they can feel valid.  But also those same people are only able to come out as trans at all because of the path in society the ""born this way"" narrative has created.

However I also believe that eventually we *are* going to have to accept in greater society the narrative that people are LGBT for many disparate reasons, not necessarily always because they're born that way.  It doesn't fit my narrative as discussed earlier, but I don't know that I'm part of a minority. It's impossible to know because it *is* such a taboo topic. I know that at least there are many trans people on the internet who seem to feel very insecure in their born-trans status, and that there are others out there like me.  I can at least point to the people who's articles I've cited, and to even someone as famous as Contrapoints -- whatever your opinion on her -- as someone who has said she doesn't have the typical story that she spent her childhood wearing her mom's heels, etc, and sometimes feels invalid because of that.

But we're not just going to have to change the narrative someday because it doesn't fit people like me, or bi people as presented in the article, or whatever. We also need to change the narrative because being LGBT should be a good thing and a right, not an affliction. And that will be a great thing for straight people too. There's another article I could reference for that but I won't make you read any more >.< But essentially, as long as being gay is *bad* and an *affliction*, straight men for example are very hindered in their ability to self-express, have emotions, and have close relationships with other men.  I think dismantling the ""LGBT affliction"" narrative is going to have to be dismantled as part of the patriarchy as a whole.

(We may actually have to face this much sooner than comfortable though, because the study of genetics is growing really fast, and there is a very real possibility that soon we are going to have to grapple with the fact that, at very least, not all LGBT people will have the genetic markers associated with their gender/sexuality.  And it's important that we don't just kick them out of the community for that.)
I like reading and conversing, so please feel free to share more. I don't think you're at all wrong, either. I really like everything you're saying.

My hope for the future is more inclusivity and acceptance in all ways shapes and forms. I've never been able to understand why we and other minorities had to fight for such basic rights and why these fights are still going.

I understand even less about how one marginalized group can turn and exclude and marginalize another. The infighting in the LGBTQ+ community needs to end.

One thing I absolutely love about the non-binary community is how inclusive it is. I think you posting this here is a sign of that. I think this is the community that will finally put all of it to an end and bring everyone together in the most beautiful way imaginable.

I believe the future is non-binary. And that future is full of love, compassion, understanding, and acceptance."	f0o1f9	NonBinary	20	0.92	2020-02-08 06:52:15

[Rant] Why does one identify as nonbinary, but not trans, if transitioning / dysphoria isn't pivotal to trans identities?	"CW: trans confusion, sexuality, dysphoria

As a trans femme non binary person starting HRT soon (really excited and nervous, also trying to deal with the premise \[internalized transphobia lmao\] that I'm ""only doing any of this"" because i'm a 'wristlet' and 'failed normie') i'm always confused by the differentiation between ""non-binary and trans"" people. I really dislike when people say ""nonbinary and trans."" On one hand, I appreciate the inclusion because when you just say ""trans people"" one assumes you are only talking about trans binary people, and while I find it important to actively include nonbinary people in your trans dialogue, the inherent ""othering"" makes me uncomfortable. I see a lot of binary trans women who seek to separate themselves from nonbinary femmes.

I've met two people that use the term genderqueer but also say they aren't trans. Coincidentally(?) these two individuals also struck me as pretty transphobic . One of them in particular actually told me that I should be fine using grindr and that I should be fine being referenced and seen as a man. ""Well, I'm genderqueer and I don't care when people call me a man"" telling me, a trans femme dysphoric nonbinary person that I should be content with whatever identity is bestowed upon me by grindr hookups. I know this is gross of me to think but this particular person's usage of the term struck me as a fashion statement that can be utilized whenever it suits them, almost like a trump card for clout, whereas this is my actual reality and my actual identity. All I could see was a cis gay telling me how I should be navigating hookup culture and what I should be feeling. This is the same person that wanted to go on chaturbate and pretend to be a pre HRT trans woman ""for fun,"" a response to my other friend, who is trans masculine, navigating cam modelling as a trans person. Even having sex pre HRT for me is honestly super triggering and dissociative as fuck.

Funnily enough, I actually realized I needed to go on HRT through my sexuality. When I would fantasize during masturbation, I would sort of block myself out. One day, instead of blocking myself out, for some reason, I imagined my body on HRT. It was a huge turn on and for the first time in my entire life I felt comfortable in my sexuality. I realized that I couldn't comfortably perform sex or intimacy because the body I am currently occupying isn't a body I can operate through authentically. I don't know how to slip into the role of a gay male, so I simply dissociate through the entire encounter. This realization was huge for me.

TLDR: I guess I'm wondering why people refer to themselves as nonbinary but non trans. To me, being nonbinary is solely a trans identity and people who operate outside of gender norms without being trans are simply gender nonconforming cis people, and I love and appreciate y'all. That being said, an AMAB person would never say ""I'm a woman, but I'm not trans"" I know that these are just words, but I wanna hear some opinions from nonbinary, non trans people. Thank you :)"	"I tend to define “trans” as a “a gender other than what you were given at birth.” I’m not trans because I’ve changed my name or because I’ve been on HRT for nearly two years, I’m trans because I wasn’t assigned “non-binary” at birth. Obviously, some people see it differently. 

A lot of the people I know who describe themselves as “enby but not trans” do so because they feel like they haven’t done enough to move away from their AGAB and “earn” that label, or because they’re largely gender-apathetic and that the word “trans” doesn’t really describe how they relate to their gender now vs their gender assigned at birth.
I think part of the issue is that there is ""transgender"" as an umbrella term and also ""transgender"" as a specific term meaning ""someone who is MtF/FtM"" and it isn't easy to tell which one someone means in casual conversation. 

Because of that I personally don't like using the trans label for myself. Since the MtF/FtM definition is the more commonly known one it feels like I'm appropriating an experience that is not my own since the average cishet person (or even the average cisgay person) is going to assume I mean MtF and not nonbinary (I'm AFAB and it's obvious). While I'm not offended if someone makes that assumption about me I don't want it to come off like I'm appropriating an identity that isn't mine and I also don't want to get into a 10-20 minute long discussion about my identity (or worse - a fight).  

I fully accept that nonbinary is under the trans umbrella, and don't have a problem with that at all. I just think that it ultimately ends up being less confusing to talk about ""trans"" and ""nonbinary"" as if they're two different things in casual conversation.  

In general conversation, I tend to use ""trans and non-binary"" because I know there are members of both groups who don't automatically think of enbies under the trans umbrella and I want to make it clear I mean both binary and non-binary trans people (without saying that whole mouthful and then having to go on an aside to explain WTF I mean).
I identify as a demigirl but not trans, because to me trans means you are moving in one direction, whereas I'm perfectly happy to be somewhere in between the binary identities. I feel like I can't say I'm a woman because it wouldn't be true, and if I were to transition to full femme I think it would feel a lot like wearing a costume.

At the same time I also feel, just as strongly, that a very significant part of me is not masculine, and when I can't show that part of me I feel just as much like I'm wearing a costume. I am occasionally required to do this, going full masc for business or formal affairs, and it feels so fake I always remark that I'm putting on my man costume.

In truth, I really am only totally comfortable in between. This, to me, is different from being a trans femme person. I wouldn't *mind* being called trans, and I think the two groups overlap quite a bit and are definitely closely aligned, BUT in my opinion they are not the same.

Am I GNC? I guess you could make that argument, but I don't agree with it. To me, GNC usually means you still identify with your binary AGAB, you just don't like being restricted to a certain presentation. I'm the opposite of that. Presentation for presentation's sake doesn't matter to me. It only matters as a way to show who I am inside.

(For the record, I had a phase where I was pretty much a GNC dude. I also had a phase where I thought I was trans. But since I discovered GQ/NB and specifically demigender, I feel like those are exactly what I am, and no other label fits me as well. Demigender is the ONLY label that, when I tell people it's what I am, feels like I'm actually telling the whole story.)
I actually sort of sit on the fence with this one. I didn't even think of myself as trans until recently, because I felt like doing so would take away from the narratives of trans people who are transitioning or have transitioned. At this time I don't want any surgery, other than to sterilize me (mostly because I don't want kids, but I'm sure pregnancy would make me feel dysphoric) so I haven't really felt ""trans enough"" to call myself trans and non-binary, thus I just used non-binary or other terms that fit within that (genderfluid is one that's been sticking out to me as a possible fit lately). However, I found a definition and discussion about the word trans simply meaning you are a gender(s) other than/not only the one you were assigned at birth, thus I'm beginning to accept that the term might fit me quite well. 

It's complicated - I wasn't trying to apologize for existing by not using trans, I'd just felt like it might not be fair to others if I did. But that's been in flux lately, and I'm starting to define myself as trans a bit more often.
From my experience it's because people tend to automatically assume MtF or FtM if you specifically talk about being trans. So while I do make an effort to let people know that those aren't the only ways to be trans I tend to default to just using non binary. I can definitely see the argument about the sort of ""othering"" it can bring. I don't identify as specifically trans even though I fall under that umbrella mostly because I don't really have a connection to my gender to begin with. I am trans in a sense, I do want to engage in a form of transition. But for me at least it feels weird to refer to my identity as trans because I don't feel like I have the first part of the MtF for example. It's weird to say the least but it's hard for me at least to say it when I feel about something like hrt the same way that someone might feel about going to the gym to try to lose weight for beach season. Not to say it's on that level but it just doesn't feel to me like there's a transition taking place. Just doing something to make the body match what's already there.

  


In the case of the trans women and NB femmes I can definitely understand the desire to separate though it saddens me that in some cases it leads to them being cruel to NB people. It is playing off their insecurity. These people know their women and deserve to be treated as such, but I imagine for a lot of them it's tough seeing an NB femme and probably too a certain extent leads to thinking things like ""great, another reason for people not to see me as a woman"" y'know? It's misguided and hurtful but I can see where the feeling comes from.

  


More people need to understand that just because something is a certain way for them doesn't mean it's universal. Just because one person is fine being seen as a man doesn't mean another is. Everybody's experience is going to be different that's why we all need to be understanding.
Sorry the formatting on this is kind of trash. My mind is a bit jumbled today
Oof, you're hitting me right in the gut with that stuff about dissociating during sex. A lot to think over, both alone and with my companion. Thanks and love.
I consider myself and all other nonbinary people, even agender people who reject the label, as trans. I agree that the bare term ""trans"" is often misinterpreted as binary trans, so I am reluctant to use it unqualified. I am likewise reluctant to use the blue-pink-white trans flag for the same reason.

Unfortunately, many trans people have spent so much time defending themselves against externalised and internalised transphobia that they set rigid rules that can end up excluding other trans people, transmed/truscum being the classic example. I went through this phase myself, until I realised that I was becoming just another transphobe. I look forward with hope to a future in which the trans community has less gatekeeping and more inclusion.
Recently I've heard the term gender-expansive to include all people gender non-conforming as well as anyone who isn't totally Cis.  Also, the term trans\* as opposed to trans.  The asterisk is the umbrella, whereas non-asterisk is binary trans.

This is definitely part of why I don't tend to use the label ""trans"" for myself, despite fully accepting that nonbinary falls under the trans umbrella.

Yah, that’s completely valid.
Right back at you love. 
It took us a long time to develop our trust and communication in such a way that he was ok being the center of our genital interactions, ok being the only one who gets off, ok playing with long-term chastity, ok with me keeping my parts tucked away. It's all helped a great deal with my dysphoria, but as an abuse survivor I'm intensely uncomfortable recognising forms of dissociation as my coping mechanisms. Feels like a betrayal of myself."	dajove	NonBinary	20	1.0	2019-09-28 18:19:41
What words do y'all use in place of gendered words?	"I was wondering what kind of words you all would use in place of words like ""Guys, dude, bro"" stuff like that. I want to be more inclusive, and I feel like I may offend someone by using the aforementioned terms. What would you all suggest?"	"y’all, folks, bud/buddy are the casual ones i use most often.
Y'all or my good humans
If I'm gonna refer to a number of people, I like to use guys, gals and enby pals
[deleted]
Fellow Americans /j

But for real I grew up in the south so I use a lot of y’all, folk/folks, hun, sweetie, pall.
Folks, team, friends, all
I say hey besties because it’s funny
Homie
Homie, bud, comrade, my friend, pal, and of course since I live in the southeast US, I must acknowledge our one good contribution to the culture, “y’all.”

Fun quick fact about the term Comrade: it was adopted as the only honorific in the USSR specifically because it is completely egalitarian in terms of gender, race, and class.
Folks, everyone, guys in a gender neutral sense, legionaries.
I personally use ""y'all"" and ""folk""
people, everyone, or inanimate objects (like chairs, grapes, etc) depending on context
i use friend, endearing terms like ‘love’ (which can be weird for some so be careful), and pal/bud a lot. captain and comrade is fun between friends lol

for addressing an audience:
yall, people, folks, friends, good people/humans, lads
formal “ladies gentlemen and [other] distinguished guests”
casual “guys gals and nb pals”

this is all i can think of lol
Depends on the situation.

At work on group emails ""Hey/Hi everyone""
On work chat ""@channel"" or we just start chatting, we do also use ""lads"" as inclusive of genders (I know we are odd).

Just anything like fellow humans, folks, people, assembled people. While I was an user at a wedding once I did say ""Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between that binary"" but 🤢 the cringle, I would now use different words, how little I knew at the time.
“Everyone”/“Everybody”. I’ve always felt most included when people would greet a room with “hey everyone!”

Simple but effective.
I’m from New York and we always use guys or dude regardless of gender. I’ve tried to use y’all before but everyone starts laughing because it’s just never used there
‘My friend’ rly works specially towards the latinx community 💖
People, y’all, folks, friend
my favorites for people i dont really know super well are like hi friends and hey yall 
if i know all the people i would say something dumb like hey humanoids
I tend to call all my friends ""cousin"". Other favorites: ""home slice"" and ""hey you with the face!""
Everyone and Anyone.  “It’s nice to see everyone here.“ “How is everyone doing?” “Does anyone want anything else?” “Did I miss anyone?”

Super basic.  Not sure why when gender comes up everyone forgets those two words exist.  They’re literally used on a daily basis without anyone thinking of them.

“You” can also address a group. “What can I get for you?” “Same thing for all of you?”
I usually go with folks
Saw a post once of someone saying they were gonna use party people and  I think that’s brilliant hahah, I normally just use yous if addressing a group (think that’s a mainly British thing, means the same as y’all)
It depends on how well you know the person/people tbh. In a group where you’re close and no one has told you it makes them uncomfortable, guys, dude, or bro would be perfectly fine. With people you don’t know as well or who’ve told you they don’t like those terms, ‘everyone, everybody, people, or folks’ would work. And it’s important to keep in mind that you can always ask, too! I know it’s a bit nerve wracking, but I’ve never met an enby who was offended by someone genuinely asking them what works for them. Generally, we’ll even thank you for being considerate :)
Most people of a general age are OK with these terms, but I do know people - women of all genders, especially - who do not like being called “dude” or “you guys” so I try not to default to those unless I know everyone I’m addressing is into it.
I grew up in L.A. in the 80's. Dude is okay with me.
I say gang, team, my pals, y’all, or if I’m feeling rowdy, I throw in a “What’s up dorks!”
Ah yes, the good old ""y'all"" I live in southeast US too, so it won't sound awkward or anything either.
It would sound funny up in New York. I'm from down south, so it sounds really normal here.
[deleted]
I moved here from up north when I was a kid, so it took me a really long time to embrace “y’all” as a good and cool term. Figuring out how useful it is for a gender neutral term that everyone already feels comfortable with around here really clicked for me.
Nonbinary women exist. Bigender women exist. Agender women exist. Genderqueer women exist. Genderfluid women exist. “Woman” is a term used by all kinds of people with overlapping identities, not just binary cis and trans women.

I’m not sure if you thought I was making a diminutive statement about people who don’t like traditionally male-gendered terms being applied to them, or if the idea of “women” as a term that’s not cut-and-dried is funny.

Not to be a jerk here, but this isn’t really a sub for laughing at the idea of complicated, non traditional gender identities.

Disney changes intro to fireworks show. I shouldn't have looked at the comments.	"TW bigots

From ""Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls"" to ""dreamers of all ages"" we have an inclusive intro catered to the full spectrum of Disney park goers, closeted kids of rich parents have something small to make them feel valid while their families reinforce that they can never really be themselves around their parents. The comments of every article about the intro have exploded into nothing but hate, saying transgender don't count because they were included in the classic intro only to be met with how we don't have a place. Everyone is complaining about the fact we get included. I had hoped for the comments, I wanted to see some love, my Disnerd heart is happy for the change even if the old intro is nostalgic to me. 

At the end of the day, Disney is still a monster of a company, but a tiny bit of permanent inclusion for us is getting every ounce of hate. Pride is over, back to the forgotten realms until we become money makers next year."	"You know what, though? Props to the individual Disney employees who fought to get that changed. Because you know multiple people had to have fought like hell, probably over a span of years, to make it happen. 

It's not an accomplishment for Disney as a corporation, which has the funds and power to be doing so much better. But to those individuals, who were most likely LGBT+ themselves and by all accounts in a hostile work environment? Mad respect.
Disney- ""our first openly gay character"" 

The character-* either barely mentions something in passing or is painfully flamboyant/weird*

Now, this isn't all characters but I feel like this is some of them. But, a good example of the ""barely show"" thing  is the lesbian kiss in star wars for maybe a frame or the monster girl from Onward. The flamboyant/weird thing would be from like LaFou and Artie. Cyrus wasn't horrible representation but that's barely the start. Disney doesn't care about gay people, they just want more people in their market.
why do they always need something to be mad about?
The owl house is Disney and has a bi lead. Literally the only queer Disney allows to exist with natural mannerisms.
The people who feel driven to comment are the ones who have the most hypocritical drive to preach morality. It’s people without better things to do or another platform to share and rage about us, so the least connected, most virulent bigotry spewers.
Wasn't that because the creators pushed for it?
Yes and the show is better for it. Disney is still pushing back. They keep calling the leading pair ""good friends"" like how my gay grandmas were ""sisters who lived together"".
I remember Alex hirsch also pushed for it but it ultimately didn’t go through, correct me if I’m off though, because I remember him doing something similar to Rebecca sugar when they threatened to leave but unlike Cartoon Network, Disney didn’t care as much (please  do correct me if I’m wrong, I might be thinking of another animator or director)
Alex is an easy money maker. I'm sure once he's done with owl house him and a lot of creators might just up and leave for a different platform.

"Rant about Netflix's ""Sex Education"" show"	"So this is just me being a little naive but today I finished watching season 3 and they intro a nonbinary character. Now Sex Education has a LOT of queer representation (no binary trans character yet, our nonbinary friend is the first character that falls under trans umbrella) : we have at least 3 gay male characters, 2 bisexuals, 1 ace character and a few lesbians.

I went onto r/netflixsexeducation thinking there would be lots of queer folks discussing different queer issues raised in the show, but it was really really disheartening to see almost all the discourse was about the straight couple ship (will boy end up with girl a or girl b). Which is fine, bc boy and girl a are kind of the main characters from season 1.

But almost no discussion of the bisexual characters, the gay male ships and the discussion of the nonbinary character was pretty much all negative or completely missing the point.

I understand cis people don't have much context but how can the issue of dress code come up multiple times for a nonbinary character and showing the character >!wearing a binder!< multiple times not help you draw the conclusion that >!the character is uncomfortable with the tight shirt of dress code because it makes their chest more visible which makes them uncomfortable!<?? So many comments said something along the line of 'nonbinary character had 0 depth other than bitching about dress code'.

It was just disheartening to see even a subreddit about a very queer inclusive show be dominated by straight couple shipping posts and mild transphobia."	"That is disappointing. I am waiting for my partner to get back into town to watch the newest season, but when it does, I’m down to start/continue a thread on this page! We can talk about how flat all the cis characters are. That’ll show them!
Damn that is disappointing. 
>!there was so much depth to Cal's character like their hesitancy to date Jackson. And that scene in the end with Cal showing the other NB character how to wear a binder literally made me cry seeing genuine NB joy in a show. Damn!<
her? i thought cal’s pronouns were they/them.
Agh you're right, thanks"	pv6o9u	NonBinary	18	0.96	2021-09-25 13:23:06
Any enby teachers out there?	"Some background, I’m about to start my first year of college majoring in inclusive childhood education. My dream is to teach kindergarten (but obviously I’ll take whatever I can get after school 😂). I’m non-binary, and while I do use any pronouns, I kind of like the idea of using gender neutral pronouns at work someday.

Is this a realistic goal? I know of the honorific “Mx”, and I think that could work for me, but I guess my question is would school districts still hire me if I present that way? Should I just stick to “Ms/Mrs” and deal with it? Will young students understand the concept of genderqueer, or should that be kept private?

Any advice is appreciated, thank you!"	"I’m an nb teacher though not out at my current (private school) job. I have been told by a superintendent that once I switch to public school I will be able to be out and will have protection under the law when I am
[deleted]
I'm not a teacher but a specialized EA and I work in lots of different schools. I can't speak to getting hired as enby bc I wasn't out, but I got a lot of support when I did come out. My area of Ontario is fairly progressive so anyone who doesn't support is pretty quiet about it, at least so far! My coworkers still struggle with they/them pronouns, but it's a work in progress. It can be frustrating sometimes. There are people that I suspect aren't really trying.

Idk how you present, but I get asked by a lot of kids if I'm a boy or a girl - usually kindergarteners bc they are the most open to asking those questions. I think it's a wonderful opportunity to teach them young! I would say work on a simple explanation. They pretty much accept right away in my experience.

Good luck! The world needs more teachers like you!!
A tik toker (cringy I know) is a genderfluid teacher who teaches many grades. I know he’ll use he/him pronouns, but doesn’t like the term Mr. so he goes by his first name or teacher, rather than a title.
(AFAB and she/they, for reference): When I taught elementary, I told students my full name (say, Jay Jones), and said they could call me whatever they liked. A few called me 'Jay', most called me ""miss Jones, Mrs. Jones, Madame Jones"" (taught French and English). 

For the ages you'll be teaching, I would suggest having students call you by your first name. Nearly all the kindergarten teachers at my elementary schools did that, though usually with miss or mr. in front. Younger kids will have no trouble with ""Oh, I prefer just Kai"" when they've said mrs. or mr. For pronouns, hopefully you'll have co-workers who will play ball, and can talk about you in front of students with your pronouns to reinforce that. 

Teaching secondary, I do the same, but only get called feminine titles w/ my last name. One student did call me sir, but only when she was trying to be an asshole, frankly. 

I'm not sold on Mx., and (when teaching French), 'prof Jones' sounds pretentious since it's below college level. At this point I'm happy with ""\[null\], I have a question."" i.e., just not being addressed by name or title if it means I won't be called 'miss' ten times a day. 

As for issues of school boards and hiring, that's definitely going to depend on your location.
I teach high school and have been out for about 1.5 years now at a school I've taught at for 5 years. Students use Mx. for me no problem or else just call me by my last name and try to use they/them. I dealt with Ms. way too long and am glad I don't need to anymore. I mention that I'm non-binary and that to me that means I'm not a woman or a man and keep pretty chill about it and the students have all been pretty chill in response- this may vary in grade levels where parents are more involved, I'm not sure.
I’ll probably be primarily looking for jobs at public schools, so that’s good to know! Thank you!
Wow, thank you so much for such a detailed response! 

I had never thought about having to be the advocate or defender for lgbtqia+ students, but I love that! I think it’s so important to support students, and being able to connect with them on that level is awesome.

It’s good to know that students are usually pretty accepting, but yeah, I was pretty sure parents/coworkers were going to be the main concern. I have a pretty thick skin, and I’m fairly used to people questioning me in my sexuality/gender identity, so that should be okay.

I’m glad your experience is making you happy, it’s truly inspiring to hear! Thank you!!
Thank you so much!! I’m glad to hear that people have been generally supportive so far :)
Oh, I think I’ve seen a few of his videos! That’s interesting, going by just his name or “Teacher”, I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you!
Thank you for this! I did volunteering in some elementary classrooms this past school year, and I just had the children refer to me by my first name. It worked for me, but I wasn’t sure if that would still work when I’m an actual teacher.
Thank you for your response! I’m glad your students have been chill about it too :)"	hm72yz	NonBinary	18	0.96	2020-07-06 12:52:17
Teachers responding to your email where you tell them your pronoun:	"-ignores it, genders you how they will

-“I’ll try to remember” (doesn’t remember ever)

-“I’ll try to remember” (remembers sometimes, but most of the time messes up and then profusely apologizes to you in front of the class, making things awkward)

And the best option:
-“thank you for telling me your pronoun! I love our changing world! (Has the right spirit, gets it right most of the time)


I’ve had two teachers say the last response and they were both oldish ladies who love teaching with all their heart. Even if they don’t truly understand, they get that making the students comfortable and happy are so important to learning. You can tell they probably took notes during the LGBT inclusion teacher workshop while the other teachers didn’t, haha"	"I had a math teacher who always used my right name and pronouns, hell, she even offered to email my other teachers about it since I was too scared to tell them myself. She was a teacher, who, despite not fully understanding what being nonbinary is like, did her best to listen and help me in any way she could. I graduated yesterday, and the only other teacher who used my name/pronouns, is my computer and internet fundamentals teacher.
I told my professor my pronouns and that bad periods of dysphoria can keep me from doing my best, and shrugged me and told me to leave
I'm not sure if this is the same everywhere, but it is true where I teach (and I think probably the whole US), it is actually harassment to intentionally misgender someone. So the ones who ignore it are literally harassing you and I'm so sorry. You could talk to higher ups (UGHH I know) or another teacher who is helpful to try to get them to get on board (maybe one of the last two?). I've talked to other teachers for students before, that way the painful convo isn't on the students shoulders anymore - if you have someone who can help you, that might be the way to go
I had a teacher who decided that saying birth control kills babies is an opinion, but drawing a picture of a burning american flag is hate speech. It ended with me being homeschooled.

edit: grammer
Nice!!! These kind of teachers are the best!!!!
I’m in college and on my way to becoming a high school math teacher... This is exactly the kind of teacher I hope to be! :3
Congrats on graduation, and I hope more gender validation is coming your way.
Doesn’t deserve to teach
You are completely right 

But I go to a private college full of teachers with no teaching degree and other departments have worse teachers; teachers who ignore national holidays, teachers that target students to hate, sexual misconduct teachers...but they’re still here because they’re pompous and talented I guess...
So I just feel there are bigger demons to destroy here 😔
YIIIIKES! Sorry about that, chum 😔
They really are!
Yay! We need more teachers like this in the world:)
Thank you:) I hope so too:D
ughhh I'm sorry that sucks!!!"	gpuphu	NonBinary	17	0.89	2020-05-24 18:30:55
What gender options would you like to see on a registration form?	"Asking this on behalf of my mother, who’s helping to update her workplace’s materials. She says they are adding a section for preferred pronouns, but she thinks the gender options could be more inclusive than “male/female/other.” Thank you in advance for offering your thoughts!

UPDATE: On behalf of both me and my mom, thank you so much to everyone who commented! As a majority of you suggested, they are getting rid of the gender options altogether :)"	"The fairly standard setup I've encountered tends to be along the lines of:

> Male/Female/Non-Binary/Other (with a space to give an answer)/prefer not to say
actually i never understood why that needs to be there at all

except in medical circumstances, where agab and any surgeries/hrt such should be known to the doctors
As a bare minimum I would add options for 'None' and 'Prefer not to say'. Ideally 'Other' would also include an optional write-in space for those who want to specify.
Is her workplace a hospital? If not, I'd rather it just ask for pronouns.
None

It's none of your business. Preferred pronouns yes, but that's all. You don't need to know my gender to adress me, just my pronouns, so what's the point?
So male and female only have to do with assigned sex at birth, not gender. Gender would be man, woman, nonbinary, etc. I think it’s just as important to make sure the wording is correct as it is to make sure it’s inclusive
If rather simply not be asked tbh. It's not really relevant in most contexts.
Also one thing to think:

1. Do we need to collect gender information?  I was trying to fill out an adoption for a cat from a shelter.  They asked your gender on the form.  It is not at all relevant so very intrusive and opens up bias. 

2. Why are we collecting gender information?  For example I am agender but my sex is female so I have trouble filling out these forms. I usually always have to add an additional line saying that my sex is female. 

Or another example is in Canada for reference checks it asks for your gender. However they are looking for the info that is on your other documents such as birth certificates and drivers license and passport. If you look at all these documents in Canada they list sex and not gender.  

3. Do you need gender or sex information. 

5. Make sure you tell the person you are collecting info from how and why you are collecting this info.
I agree with others here. Asking pronouns is great and is relevant any time you expect to interact with someone. Asking gender or sex when it isn't relevant though is cringe. They should consider what the purpose of collecting that information is, and if there isn't a good purpose then delete that question entirely.
First piece of advice is drop the word preferred, just leave it at “what are your pronouns”? I don’t have pronouns I prefer over others, you don’t have the options of using ones I don’t prefer,I have the ones I use just like cis people.
Meh no gender options. Pronoun options instead.
A question which should be asked, is why does this form even need a gender identifier?
Often the simplest solution is to not include them
I would rather just be asked my pronouns, but if there's no way to take out the gender question a

Prefer not to answer

Other (space to write) 

Would work

+ asking for what pronouns you use
I am totally down with “prefer not to say”
Yay mom! But, agreeing with other folks, I'm are more concerned with how your mama's workplace is actually using the info. Being inclusive isn't just adding more boxes, imo. I personally don't care too much about boxes, and a lot of times I check different ones for different things depending on my mood. That being said, an ""undecided"" box might be fun for me.
I agree with others that I don’t really love even being asked, but I appreciate that there are legitimate reasons for tracking these demographics. I’d suggest looking at some of the guidelines that have been published online by various statistical organizations and survey platforms. 

I reviewed several about a year back, and they were generally well-framed and trans inclusive, and a few even did a great job of walking through the relative merits of a few different options for framing gender/sex demographic questions, which is good because there’s really no one way to do it that is equally good at answering all demographic questions you might need to answer.

(And if you don’t have any demographic questions you need answered, I guess do have to circle back to asking why this question needs to be asked in the first place.)
***«LEAVE ME ALONE»***
I would like male/female/non-binary/without gender/other
Since gender doesn't actually matter, pronouns do, it should just ask for those and ideally don't have specific options cause that's always gonna be limiting (although might be better if you're dealing with some people that might not do very well when asked about their pronouns, lol)
I want there to be male, female, nonbinary, and then an other where you can type in a different one. Would make it a lot more inclusive
If gender is necessary for some specific reason then this is good but honestly if prefer not to say is an option then why do you need to know gender anyway? Why not just remove the question?
/exactly/ what I was going to say.
Unsure if this specific instance is for employee use, but workplaces sometimes ask for this data so they can track diversity and use that to inform decisions (for example ""the company is only 20% female, how can we encourage more women to apply?"" or ""this location has several non-binary employees, they should host our LGBTQ fundraiser"")
Yeah, and in that case it's not even your gender, it's what organs and levels of hormones you have.
If you're gonna have specific options I would make it he/him, she/her, they/them and ideally some popular nropronouns and then an other option you can fill in (with as many pronouns you want). Also I would make it so you can choose as many as you want want, not just one.
Some people do want to say. And apparently the federal government sometimes likes to track diversity.
I've only really encountered it in diversity questions (asked alongside race, sexuality and disability) which tend to be optional.
One clinic I have been to has a page in the file for exactly this! It asks about lots of things including gender identity and sexuality, but rather than just assigned sex at birth it has drop-downs to select which sexual organs you currently have, which have been removed, what your primary hormone is, etc. It feels -very detailed- but also way more useful than just knowing the state of my body as of thirty years ago. 🙄"	10a55ef	NonBinary	18	0.95	2023-01-12 17:23:41

Advice: changing the language/narrative of abortion being only a “women’s” issue	I’m planning on going out to protest the Texas abortion ban crap but as a nonbinary person I’m struggling with how this issue of abortion gets framed in only a binary gendered way. Plenty of people who do not identify as a woman have uteruses or would be oppressed by this ban. I think this community gets this. The ban is a blatant humans rights abuse, an attempt to control a large portion of the population and stripping vital healthcare away. It’s wrong on so many levels it’s too much to list. How can I help people see that’s it’s more than a woman’s issue? How can I make inclusive signs that are short and get the point across? How can the nonbinary community stand in solidarity and resist?	"""Reproductive rights!"" ""My body, my choice"" etc. 

Here's the deal tho, I don't think a protest is an appropriate place to have a conversation about de-gendering issues like this especially when they are explicitly tied with misogyny. This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't a majority ""women's issue"" and if you go into a space full of indignant, angry women and attempt to change the conversation away from why they are all there over semantics, I don't see it going well for you.  It may not be a ""women's issue"" in that *everyone* affected is a woman, but it is a ""woman's issue"" in that it is designed to control women because these people who make these laws are not doing so while considering the existence of trans people. They aren't doing this to oppress people with uteruses, they are doing this to oppress women, specifically. While I understand and empathize with you, I don't feel like a protest is the correct place for a conversation.

I wouldn't go farther than using ungendered language in your own sign.
I caught part of an interview with the head of a clinic in Texas last night, and she consistently referred to patients as ""pregnant folks."" It was a bit of goodness in the bad news.
I think the best thing we can do is just show up. Be there and be vocal, and also be openly enby. Use the flag colors and that kind of thing. I think that will help get the point across."	pghy60	NonBinary	16	0.9	2021-09-02 13:31:29
Trans vs Trans? G T F O	"When I was in college, the president of our LGBT club (trans person)  publicly announced via social media that anyone registered as a Republican was directly homophobic. My NB trans self was dating a FTM who had registered Republican (idek). This guy was our mutual friend and very familiar with who we were, and with the intention of opening the dialogue around this lightheartedly, my partner had commented ""guess that makes me transphobic"" to which he replied what can be summed up as ""guess you are.""
After spending so much time searching for an in-person trans safe space, this was one of the first things that tainted my view of the  trans community. Ultimately, our varying opinions on gatekeeping behaviors and social policing got us socially eighty-sixed ( I actually was lowkey blackmailed, but I'll go into that another time)from the university's LGBT club.

I feel like trans people are really divided these days when we should all be brothers and sisters on some level, right? Why are we gatekeeping what desperately needs to be an inclusive space? In my experience, the trans people I've met are either really anal and trying to run the entire community or they're part of the other 75% of queers leaning back out of the bullshit."	"I don't think your uni's lgbt club should have allowed that (ours has guidelines about being politically impartial, being a safe space for all). Is this something you can report to higher up in the uni?

While open political discussion is important it shouldn't be the cause to shun people out of a safe space
why did your interaction with the pres of your club shape your thoughts on the community as a whole?
I wouldn't say it shaped my thoughts, but It added to my overall schema. I said it had been the first thing that tainted my view of the trans community; not the last, and things continued like this for the duration of my time there. Because of my stance on these things I was made a social pariah by my local trans community and literally threatened with false rape accusations (and I'm not even a republican).

Singular 'they' is the inclusive 'they'	I'm a singular they and cannot get back to sleep without posting this.	"I think I know what you’re getting at. ‘Are they going to bring their drums?’ Is inclusive while ‘is he/she going to bring his/her drums?’  Is not. I wish we could transition 😜 our culture into automatically using them/they. Like when you have to refer to someone and you can’t be sure what their pronouns are, you just use them they until told otherwise. 🤷🏼‍♀️  maybe it’s just not something people think about.
I wholeheartedly agree. Use they/them as default, and if people want to tell us ""I use he/him"" or other pronouns, then it'd make it so much easier on nonbinary people. And assuming peoples gender (using he/she) is rude, but it's a binary world, so it's going to be like this for now.
There was an episode on this season of greys with an enby and they went through the whole thing of explaining it to dr. Webber. So maybe we’re getting some traction 😜"	by4856	NonBinary	16	1.0	2019-06-08 04:49:55
What is it like to be transgender or non-binary?	" My name is Sophie and I am a researcher at The University of Manchester. I am conducting research for my PhD about the experiences of transgender and non-binary students at secondary school and I need your help!

Do you identify as transgender or non-binary? Or maybe you used to but identify differently now? Have you spent at least some time in a secondary school in the UK?

If so, this is your chance to tell me: What is school like for YOU? Is it good, bad or just ok? Is there anything that could make it better?

I want to hear all about it!

We already know a bit about how lesbian, gay and bisexual people experience school, but we don’t really know what school is like for those who identify as transgender or non-binary. I need your help to understand what school is like for transgender and non-binary students and whether there is anything that could be done to make school a better place. This comes at a time when many transgender and non-binary young people are going through particularly tough times in school and other areas of life. In doing this research whereby I will contact both transgender individuals and teachers, I hope to come up with some ways which could make school more inclusive and representative.

If you are interested in taking part in an interview, or if you want more information or have any questions about this then please contact me by email.

To take part you must:

· Identify as transgender or non-binary or have experienced gender transition in some way – this can be during ***or after*** your time at secondary school (it isn’t a requirement that you were transgender or non-binary at secondary school to take part)

· Spent at least some time in secondary school in the UK

· Be aged 16-30

hey non-binary friends! book recommendation	"I'm a gay and I love my enby friends irl and online. I also love to read and came across a book I fell in love with that I thought yall might like.

Murderbot Diarys by Martha Wells

I know it sounds scary and violent, and it has violent moments, but it's very wholesome in a self discovery way.

It's a sci-fi book written as the internal monolouge of a construct (cloned human and machine) that was built as a security robot to guard humans on missions. It hacked its control and is trying to figure out what to do with itself since they are only built to kill.

The bot is NB and Ace and the writing is so inclusive in such a mundane way. Like no one cares about your labels by this point, they are just like a piece of jewelry.

Anyway, it's lovely, if reading is your thing, I recommend it. Feel free to fan person to me in my dms. I will 100% talk about books with anyone.

Stay loved 🫰"	"Thank you, looking forward to find time to read it! 🥰
I love this series as well. Murderbot is also not the only nonbinary character in the series; there’s a human who is tercera and uses te/ter pronouns. It’s dropped so casually with little exposition as if it is so normal and unremarkable.
Hey mods, if this was the wrong flair please lmk. Or if this isn't the content for here. I checked the rules, but I saw other nb subs so🤷
They aren't super long.  And they flow together really well.  I hope you enjoy :)

Themself, theirself, theirselves, themselves? Which would you use?	"Hello everyone!If you were to think about yourself in the third person type narrative, which would you be more apt to use? As in, ""they thought to themselves,"" ""they thought to theirself,"" themself, theirselves... or a completely different way altogether? Spellcheck (googlechrome) is trying to tell me that only *themselves* is correct, but I'm sure I've heard themself/theirself used as well... ?Full disclosure, I'm binary and very boring, but a proud ally. I'm trying to write a thing and want it to be inclusive, but wondering what someone who identifies as neither he/him nor she/her would want to feel included with a term they're more likely to use! (I hope that makes sense.)Thank you, anyone and everyone in advance for your input!"	"Themself
Singular they would use ""themself"" as the reflexive.
How would you write it in other formats?

""She thought about her"" expands to ""She thought about herself""

""He thought about him"" expands to ""He thought about himself""

So the logical continuation of that is ""They thought about them"" expands to ""They thought about themselves""

Though ""themself"" might also be appropriate. The term is coming more into use as ""they"" is being more often used as a singular
I've used both ""themself"" and ""themselves"" and personally don't have a preference
Themself
check out ""a psalm for the wild-built"" to see how well the writer incorporated gender-neutral pronouns into the book
Wow, thank you, everyone, for these awesome responses! I'll likely go with ""themself,"" based on the general consensus - even though now I know there are more than a few acceptable options! I really appreciate all of your input. Thank you so much. xo
I personally use they/them/their(s)/theirself but most would default to them :P

- 🤡
Themself :)
Theirselves and themselves are both plural so no. I follow the He/Him/His/His/Himself pattern (aka I use Themself). Pretty sure this is the most common one.
They/Them/Theirself/Theirself's


Reasoning: themself doesnt have a possessive conjugation implication the way theirself does to me. Also, ""selves"" seems to imply multiple people but ""self's"" doesn't.
Either ""Themself"" Or ""Themselves"", Honestly For The Singular I'd Just Say Use Whichever You Feel Like.
Yeah ""themself"" is the only time I know where the singular they acts singular in a grammar way. Like ""They are sitting at the table by themself"" is a sentence that makes me happy.
thyself
'Themself' is the proper grammatical use when referring to one's self, and 'themselves' is normally for emphasizing or speaking about a group, so it's usually a plural.

I love that you're being more inclusive for your writing, thanks for being the kind of ally we need today. :D
I like themself or theirself, I'm one person lol
I'd use themself.
I respect people’s choice to move to “themself” but I still find myself preferring themselves. I think for my brain it feels like an echo of your/yours, both of which can also be singular or plural. I understand the construction is totally different though
I hate how much this bothers me lmao its bad enough spell check doesn't get it, I've had people argue with me about this trying to correct me. Like really? You're gonna tell me to use ""selves"" to refer to one person? It almost seems bigoted at this point
Thank you!
Perfect! Thank you!
Those Aren't The Only Other Reflexive Pronouns Though, ""Myself"" And ""Ourselves"", For Example, Use The Possessive Rather Than The Object-Form, And Since ""Her"" Is Both Arguably ""Herself"" Does Too.
Thank you!
Thank you for inadvertently introducing me to what looks like a fun read!
If writing for an unknown individual I would use themself, but if *you* use theirself then that's what I'll use for you. You may not be using a typical conjugation, but your preference as an individual is more important than what might be more common. Your choice is valid and your comfort is important. <3
I knew I'd heard it used by some! haha Thank you!
>Theirselves and themselves are both plural so no. 

I Mean True, But It's Not At All Uncommon To Use Them In The Singular Too, I Personally Will Often Say ""Themselves"" When Referring To A Single Person, And I'm Far From The Only Person Who Does It. I Mean I Would Agree That ""Themself"" Makes More Sense, And Is Arguably Better, But ""Themselves"" Is By No Means Wrong To Use For A Singular Person.
I wasn't trying to list all the examples of this. I was using other pronouns to show how words are conjugated when adding -self, by using the other two gender pronouns.
you're welcome! it's a new genre btw: solarpunk. the book was a commission from a publishing house in an attempt to inspire interest in the said genre

enjoy!
Right, But You Seemed To Be Implying That Because ""Himself"" And ""Herself"" Add It Onto The Object Form, ""Themself"" Should Too, But There Are Many That Use The Possessive Form So ""Theirself"" Would Work Just As Well, Although I Would Agree That ""Themself"" Sounds Better."	11c0zkw	NonBinary	15	0.9	2023-02-26 00:51:02
Legal Non-binary Gender in the U.S.: Link Roundup! (add yours)	"Hi everyone!

A recent court case in Oregon was decided in favor of a plaintiff, resulting in the first legal recognition of non-binary gender in the U.S. This is a big deal just in itself, and will hopefully be the catalyst for many more cases. 

Since there's been multiple posts lately on this news, I'm cleaning up the front page by condensing them here. While this is still ""new"" news, this post will be stickied and new links can added in the comments.

I can’t stand when people say “his/her” or “she/he” or any other variation.	"Basically, the title. I’ve seen this multiple times just in the last week, and half the time, in the same sentence, they use “they/them” for the same hypothetical person. For example, I just say a tiktok with the text “When your battle buddy comes to you when his/her seargent yelled at them.” Like, not only is it so much more inclusive to just use they/them pronouns when referring to a person of unspecified gender, it’s also easier and less complicated! And you just fucking did it!

I just don’t get how some people don’t realize this. And I’m always so tempted to say something when I see this in comments on Reddit. But I also don’t want to be “that enby person that’s super overbearing and annoying about pronouns and gender neutral language” even though I hate that sort of stereotype.

Idk, I think it’s just especially annoying in the midst of so much debate surrounding “singular they” even though people use it ALL THE TIME without even thinking about it, just like in the tiktok I saw. Anyway, I hope this all makes sense. It’s the middle of the night and I’m just spewing my thoughts. Please tell me I’m  not the only one that’s bothered by this."	couldn't agree more, it's so exhausting to read. i also hate when people assemble those weird parentheses abominations like (s/t)he(y) or things like it as if it's not a massive waste of everyone's time. like, nb issues aside, language changes constantly. might as well whine about singular you when it should be thee/thou. it makes my brain hurt.	o4p349	NonBinary	16	0.81	2021-06-21 06:45:08
Vent: Local gay bar remodeled their bathrooms to be less inclusive.	"While I'd rather hang out in nb spaces, not many exist so I often end up in ""gay bars"". A local establishment I go to, not infrequently, removed the single stall from their ""men's room"" and replaced it with more urinals. As an afab, this completely prevents me from using a bathroom that I used to use frequently. I now have to stand in line with a bunch of cisfemales to use the ""unisex restroom"" (there is no ""women's room"") since it is physically impossible for me to use another restroom (due to disability).

I'm honestly heartbroken right now and feel like I've been punched in the gut. I just feel like there is no space that I am welcome in public, and it sucks."	"...wait, but, do they think men don’t poop!?
That really sucks. 

I’d poop in their new urinal if I could.
...I don't get why everyone doesn't just get stalls.
What I'm guessing is that if you only remove the gendered signs, people still act as if they are gendered and there's still a huge pressure to use the bathroom for your assigned or perceived gender. Right now what they have is a stall bathroom and a urinal bathroom, people of all genders who want a stall use one side and people of all genders who want a urinal use the other, which actually enforces gender mixing in the bathrooms. But unless they increased the volume of stalls all they did was make it harder to use the bathroom because bathrooms in buildings are built on a binary system and it's sometimes inconvenient to put a nongendered system over top of it.
‘Cause it’s so much more fun to have your pee splash back all over your hands and pants!!
They removed a toilet and replaced it with two urinals and the unisex restroom only has one toilet, so they've just made it super awkward to where if you are waiting for the single sit down toilet you either need to shit or don't have a penis, neither of which are things I'd like to have assumed about me. It's just really dumb and inconvenient for anyone who isn't an able-bodied cismale.
Yeah, they should have had a women's room in the first place. They're not even doing the bare minimum of inclusion which would be 2 gendered rooms and a unisex stall"	c6wm82	NonBinary	15	1.0	2019-06-29 08:47:34
People go out of their way to call me ma'm	"i have started embracing my masculinity in the last two years and i have found that people in public go out of their way to call me ma'm now? Have any of you experienced this? Like people wouldn't necessary use any gendered words before (i.e. it's that way vs it's that way ma'm). It's like they are trying to be politically correct by being inclusive of masculine women as still being women. Like ""hey you don't fit what i think of as a woman but i'll include you into it anyways, i'm so open"". But it's actually really infuriating? It feels like they are purposefully erasing my masculinity, like they are obtusely blind to it. I haven't ever felt less seen. Before, when i tried to fit the mold they couldn't see who i was because i was hiding it. But now i'm showing it and they are refusing to accept it/see it. 

Anyways ... rant over. anyone else dealing with that ? How do you make yourself feel better/react?"	"happens to me constantly. doesn’t matter what I wear, even if they catch me in wintertime when I’m bundled up, as soon as they get a closer look at how my clothes fall on my upper body they backpedal and call me “miss” like five times. got referred to as “the lady from [my job]” last week and full body recoiled, being misgendered while presenting extremely masc AND the implication that I at 23 am old? insult to injury

sometimes I kinda think they’re trying to compensate for what their eyes are telling them, convince themselves all over again that they’re looking at a woman because the person in front of them fit their mental profile of a man at first
I wonder what would happen if we actually said “no you were correct the first time” 🤔 would their mind just break from bidirectional back pedalling?"	z4tx74	NonBinary	14	0.95	2022-11-26 01:10:01
How can I make my speech non-binary inclusive whilst using commonly accepted language?	"I have noticed that when some of the most well-intentioned people who are truly in favour of the rights, protections and affirmation of non-binary people converse with one another that speech-based exclusion of non-binary people, which is generally unconscious, is still present. How can one remove this, perhaps completely?

One can alter one's language in certain ways to be non-binary inclusive -- for example, by saying ""people"", ""everyone"" etc., instead of ""ladies and gentlemen"" or ""women and men"" -- however it proves much more difficult when one is speaking of particular things (like pregnancy and sex, for example, with the former almost always being dubbed 'female'). One can, too, of course, use neo-pronouns which are inclusive towards all; these are not well-known, however, and thus may create ambiguity amongst some; any alternatives?"	"I don't change much in my speech besides using ""people"" and they/them more often. When talking about pregnancy, intercourse, etc, topics where gender and sex are commonly conflated, I just ask myself what I really mean. For example, if we're talking about pregnancy, someone might say ""women,"" but they really mean people who can get pregnant, women who can't get pregnant wouldn't be included--so I'll say ""people who can get pregnant.""
When I was writing my bachelor's I wasn't out to anyone at uni as non-binary. The study I was doing had all the forms already made before me, so I had no choice over it having a gender question with only binary options. Also I knew the study had at least one nonbinary participant because I had taken part in it in the early stages before I knew I'd be a part of making it later.

Thus when I reported the data I sneakily said ""people who reported themselves as women were more likely to..."" and so forth. Like, it's not the best we can do but at that situation it was pretty much all I could do. (Well, I guess I could have just not report that data on gender as it wasn't really central at all, but what kind of a science method would that be?)
Personally, I use ""folks"" and ""y'all"" pretty exclusively. As for things like pregnancy and sex... I worked at a sex shop for a while and so inclusive, yet precise/accurate language was a must. I achieved that by referring to relevant body parts if they came up (e.g. ""People with a prostate often enjoy this for xyz..."" ""People who menstruate really like this menstrual cup..."" etc.) There's no reason for gender to enter into the picture unless a person's gender identity is actually a major component of the conversation, imo. e.g. ""Pregnancy has been really challenging for hir because zie gets misgendered constantly, and the changes to hir body have made hir self-conscious."" stuff like that. 
Thanks for responding!

> For example, if we're talking about pregnancy, someone might say ""women,"" but they really mean people who can get pregnant, women who can't get pregnant wouldn't be included--so I'll say ""people who can get pregnant.""

I have personally used the ""people who can get pregnant"", ""pregnant people"", etc., and some have outrightly said, ""You mean pregnant women? Only women can get pregnant"". Is there anyway to get around this awkwardness to prevent things like this potentially happening in the future whilst still being completely clear about whom is being spoken of?

For example, what should one do if one is writing a scientific paper on human biology and sexual reproduction is asked about? How can one be non-binary inclusive in this instance?
Sorry for the late reply.

> Thus when I reported the data I sneakily said ""people who reported themselves as women were more likely to..."" and so forth.

I like that wording much.
> Personally, I use ""folks"" and ""y'all"" pretty exclusively.

I don't utilise 'y'all', but I do 'all' and 'folks'.

> I worked at a sex shop for a while and so inclusive, yet precise/accurate language was a must. I achieved that by referring to relevant body parts if they came up (e.g. ""People with a prostate often enjoy this for xyz..."" ""People who menstruate really like this menstrual cup..."" etc.)

The only thing about which I am afraid is the obviousness and repetitiveness of, for example, the ""people with..."" language. For someone who is not pro non-binary it could be very obvious that I was deliberately trying to use inclusive language, which I am, and I could be asked, as I have been, why I am not ""speaking normally"" or ""standardly"".

There's no reason for gender to enter into the picture unless a person's gender identity is actually a major component of the conversation, imo. e.g. ""Pregnancy has been really challenging for hir because zie gets misgendered constantly, and the changes to hir body have made hir self-conscious."" stuff like that.

I honestly could not agree with you more about only mentioning one's gender identity as long as it is pivotal to the conversation which one is having; the problem with using neo-pronouns, however, is that they are not commonly accepted and thus it would be even more obvious to most that one had what may seem like some kind of problem with using non-inclusive language, which I do -- however I don't want everyone to know that.
I'm not sure there is a way around that, because the whole point of nonbinary-inclusive language is to communicate something different to your listeners, and someone who responds in that way is just picking up that you're communicating something different. You can always remind them women are people, you can take it as a teaching opportunity, or you can deflect with ""you know what I mean"" if it's not a safe situation to openly support nbs.

The scientific paper situation might be a bit more difficult to navigate because there's often an accepted way of speaking in academia, but there's nothing about sexual reproduction that can't be explained in nb inclusive language, it's just not as popularized. Which words or phrases are you thinking would be hard to replace?
 ""You mean pregnant women? Only women can get pregnant""
""You're wrong.""
Singular “they” is now actually in the official Manuals of Style, so I feel like it’s an easy justification to go with that!
> You can always remind them women are people, you can take it as a teaching opportunity, or you can deflect with ""you know what I mean"" if it's not a safe situation to openly support nbs.

This is sound advice. I shall definitely utilise this.

Mainly biological sex-linked words such as 'female' with 'pregnancy' and 'menstruation' and 'male' with words like 'sperm', 'semen', etc.
> ""You mean pregnant women? Only women can get pregnant"" ""You're wrong.""

Exactly!
""Common misconception -- put intended!"" :D :D :D 
Seems to me that the vast majority of the time when we used gendered language, it's shorthand. In the context of talking about human reproduction, when people say ""men"", they mean ""people who have penises/produce sperm/etc"" so there's nothing wrong with just saying what you actually mean: ""Most men in the clinical trial reported increased duration of erections."" -> ""Most people with penises in the clinical trial...""

In some cases, it definitely feels clunkier, but that's largely due to what we're accustomed to. And while I'm all for making things readable and all that, it seems to me that clarity, precision, and accuracy are a higher priority than not being clunky in scientific and scholarly writing.
I concede defeat.
I agree with everything stated here, with the added caveat that if what you mean is specifically reproduction that ""people with penises"" isn't even what you mean! ""People with viable sperm"" or ""those with sperm-producing gametes"" might be even closer!
> Seems to me that the vast majority of the time when we used gendered language, it's shorthand.

I would have to agree with this.

> In the context of talking about human reproduction, when people say ""men"", they mean ""people who have penises/produce sperm/etc"" so there's nothing wrong with just saying what you actually mean: ""Most men in the clinical trial reported increased duration of erections."" -> ""Most people with penises in the clinical trial...""

Yes, this would work. I shall definitely speak, in someway or another, in scientific contexts and the like in this kind of fashion.

> In some cases, it definitely feels clunkier, but that's largely due to what we're accustomed to.

Yes, I'd agree with this. Most things with which we humans are unfamiliar, at least and especially at first, seem odd, even incorrect to us; after some use, though, we generally get used to the 'new' way of things.

> And while I'm all for making things readable and all that, it seems to me that clarity, precision, and accuracy are a higher priority than not being clunky in scientific and scholarly writing.

Whilst I definitely agree with you, I do think that there are ways in which one can speak inclusively and concisely, even if it takes a little bit of practice in order for one to do it successfully.
I've just seen this comment and I have to say that I agree with you, especially this:

> ""People with viable sperm"" or ""those with sperm-producing gametes"" might be even closer!
Absolutely agreed. In my example, I was not necessarily thinking about reproductive capacity, which was a bit confusing since I was just talking about that as context.
Sometimes it takes actual thought to find a way of communicating that is both inclusive and concise, and some folks resent that, i guess. People digging in their heels at the singular ""they"" confuse me. ""It sounds weird!"" Compared to what, ""he or she""?

The really beautiful thing about language is that if there's a need, there will eventually be a way to say it. Sometimes there's a period of clunkiness while we figure things out and that's okay.
Ya there are a lot of folks for various reasons who are not fertile who still have penises! Some intersex folks, some trans women on hrt, cis men with vasectomies, etc etc!
> Sometimes it takes actual thought to find a way of communicating that is both inclusive and concise, and some folks resent that, i guess.

I agree. I do think that it is worth it, though.

> People digging in their heels at the singular ""they"" confuse me. ""It sounds weird!"" Compared to what, ""he or she""?

The repetitive use of ""he or she"" is annoying and awkward. It is better for one just to speak neutrally, especially if one is speaking at length.
> Ya there are a lot of folks for various reasons who are not fertile who still have penises!

Agreed!

> Some intersex folks, some trans women on hrt, cis men with vasectomies, etc etc!

I have come across people who contest this on the grounds that, and this is nothing new, trans women are just 'mentally ill' men who are not, supposedly, scientifically speaking, women. Intersex people have, too, come up in conversation with the same people and what was said about them was just horrible: Yes, but they are freaks, it is often charged. They are biological freaks. Everyone ought to be biologically female or male.

This is what one is generally faced with if one is pro-trans."	9tjwsf	NonBinary	15	0.87	2018-11-02 13:06:41
Dropped she from my pronouns....thoughts...	"Maybe I am stupid and should just be more gentle with myself. But I have been Pansexual and Pangendered for years and years, have had an androgynous identification. With recent inclusion in both sports (I am a runner) and in my personal life I felt like I was holding onto she for other people when I myself felt they/them was more appropriate.
Now that I have come out I continually find myself feeling MORE feminine. Which. I suppose I present more feminine naturally, even when taking on harder presentation.... but how the hell do I help myself feel ok/less imposter syndrome about feeling very demigirl majority of the time???
To me this is the intricacies of nonbinary identity that I can't seem to answer for myself so would love to see what other in my actual community think. Thank you.
(•﹏•)"	"I'm actually feeling very similarly. I am in a big gender soup right now doubting everything. Sometimes I don't feel like a woman but other times I do, but then I end up dressing more femme naturally and makes me just upset with myself thinking that maybe I'm not actually nb (#impostersyndrome). Sorry, I know this isn't helpful at all to you :/
Gotta love the *down votes* on an ask, ok super helpful lol moving on
I just dress however I want, I'm still non binary. Actually I take it a step further & I say I am not femme, ""femininity"" is a cultural concept. Except  for femboi, I am okay with that label.
I mean. You can be *super* feminine and not use she pronouns. 

Hell you could be a binary woman and if you didnt like using she/her, theres no reason you gotta.
I think that is just that. The hair or clothes and all that is not a defining factor in the least, although appearance can OF COURSE BE A HUGE FACTOR in counteracting dysphoria and finding your identity- they do not write who we are. My struggle currently is really pronouns and identifiers, especially with loved ones who I feel comfortable with certain gendered terms of endearment and even using them in regards to myself. I have found I am ok with a lot of different terms like 'oooo gxrrrrrl' and 'boi' and etc etc like I dig all of them. Pangender seems to suit me other than my pronouns are they/them. But I can obviously only speak for my own experience.
I feel that for sure, but at the same rate there is a lot of identity within the femme (soft) and masc (hard) on a spiritual and emotional level...for me the connection, fluid presentation and attraction to both is part of my identity. I think moreover it's that maybe my fluidity made me reject the softer sides of myself until actually being wholly fluid and seeing myself as truly nb, and not some sort of subgenre, I suppose.
I think being queer at all is on a lot of levels is already a natural and biological rejection of the cultural/ societal roles of gender and sexuality, but you can do that and still be cisgendered. So therein lies the imposter syndrome I suppose is, why am I different? 
For fucks sakes because I just am I guess?
Well, no, obviously...it's much more than just anything.
For instance I am ok with a lot of femme type references I have found still appropriate, just not she or hers....but also comfortable with Masc labels as well. I think that is where gxrl and bxy and other agender terms maybe stem from, I don't know for certain.
For me I feel and dress to how I am presenting that day which I am both honing in on and also embracing more in general...on any given day which is most definitely why my gender and sexuality falls in the Pan category to be sure but it can be so difficult to feel reassured in myself sometimes.
Maybe I am on to something here for myself and anyone else having this conundrum. Either way thanks for giving me a backboard to bounce off of because it *really really really* helps.
Fair point to the fact that I probably need to just stop being so hard on myself and just let it flow already, heh (✦ ‿ ✦)"	z9gxvu	NonBinary	14	0.94	2022-12-01 06:45:13

Another subreddit is bullying me severely for a TikTok I made about gender inclusive language. I would really appreciate support.	"The hundreds and hundreds of hate comments on this post are unwarranted. I was only trying to be positive and affirming in my TikTok. The comments on the Reddit post are full of transphobic and enbyphobic hate. They are also making hate comments about my disability.... It's so bad, and the mods won't take the post down, despite breaking the subreddit's rules AND Reddit's rules. I would really appreciate some kind words of support.

UPDATE: The other subreddit took the post down, but the post and comments still live on Reddit. Just nobody can comment anymore. The OP also personally apologized to me, which I thought was very big of them and I appreciated it a lot."	"Sorry you're going through that, friend :( I would report the worst of them using the ""Hate"" and ""Harassment"" options, so they get sent to reddit's anti-evil team. There are always going to be ignorant and hateful people out there though, and that definitely sucks.
Really sorry that's happening to you.

That subreddit is a cesspool, my honest advice would be not to engage with it. It's too big, and it will be probably terrible for your mental health.

I think you are correct, and I agree with you. I feel the same way when I hear the language you referenced, but I just try to let it go. The world changes really slowly, and you stumbled into a snakepit of people who will aggressively and actively defend their right to offend you. I'm really sorry about that. You are valid, you are correct, you are entitled to your opinion, and I support you. I went through and reported a couple of the more blatantly horrible comments, but I don't think it will do much.

edit: additionally, I think your fashion-sense is rad.
Thank you for your kind words. 💖 I did report the original post as hate and harassment because it was posted with the intent to bully me, but no luck so far. 😞
Yeah, I don't even take the gendered language to heart myself! I was just trying to encourage some people to think critically. I'm proud I did change some peoples' minds on the topic, though. 😊 Thank you so much for the support, and comment about my fashion! 💖💖💖"	ox7g50	NonBinary	15	0.75	2021-08-03 16:46:34
Does being NB hurt my job prospects?	I live in a pretty mixed state in the US politically. I've just interviewed for a position where I would be interfacing with many members of the public for our organization. We are an inclusive organization, but I worry that they will pick someone else where it us easier to relate to everyone including people who don't believe being nonbinary is a legitimate identity. Does anyone else fear this in their work? Just curious	"Considering that I have heard of places just tossing out applications that list their gender as anyone other than M or F, and Google got caught letting companies exclude people who don't have male or female selected as their gender from seeing their job advertisements, unfortunately it's a real and valid concern :/
I'm in one of the two states where every single county voted for Trump 2020. **Yes this a VERY real fear of mine.** I'll share how I currently handle the situation. I think a lot of how much this may hurts your job prospects depends on your gender expression and how much you can cope with being misgendered/invalidated. 

I'm a library social worker so my entire job is interacting with the public. My resume and email signatures have she/they pronouns so I assume they knew I wasn't cis. I specifically use she/they in professional settings because I know most people read me as female and I don't have the emotional bandwidth to be correcting people who use she all day. 

I don't usually state my pronouns verbally when I introduce myself in person because more often than not I receive a **very** negative reaction. I do wear a pronoun pin on my required lanyard, have my pronouns in my library email, and Zoom display name. I haven't received any pushback to my nonverbal pronoun displays. 

. In an ideal world, I would use they/them pronouns exclusively. Currently sharing she/they pronouns nonverbally in professionally settings is enough for me to feel like I am being authentic in my nonbinary identity without risking my physical or emotional safety
if it does, then you don't want to work there in the first place. you should work somewhere you aren't exploited and if they're acting like that i wouldn't hold my breath for them to treat you right about anything else, either. in all seriousness, go look in r/antiwork and you'll get real life tips from actual workers about how to navigate the workplace while not being harmed by employers for any reason, even gender presentation.
I've been wondering that myself. I'm job hunting and have my pronouns on my resume and cover letter. I've been job hunting since the first week of January
Yeah. I have a couple of jobs where it's long been seen as relevant which binary gender someone is, and they currently assign me all ""female"" roles and only ""female"" ones (if I told you more about the work you'd see why; this isn't as bad as it sounds for binary cis people at least, and even a lot of binary trans ones would be fine, though obviously that's not actually good enough) and I'm slowly waiting for the day my ""transition"" and/or presentation crosses whatever mental line they have for what can be brushed off as me being ""butch... uh, *really* butch...""
You can just put down M or F (whatever you pass best as) and change your gender after you get a job maybe?
I live in Georgia so I worry about this too. But I would rather be out and proud in my place of work then have a job I can't be myself in ya know?
im in the south in the medical field, and while I’m visibly alt, i just keep my head down at work. i still go by they/she so it doesn’t mess with me too much, but i do get burnt out on some days from too many “ma’am’s”. work is not my life and being my authentic self there does not matter, so i just come in do my job go home. i have considered getting a pronoun label for my badge though.
[removed]
That is some scary news. I got this job without them knowing I was an enby, but they found out quickly. One of my bosses actually has a child that is an enby too, so I think I've got a better situation. Still, I worry about how they will think interfacing with the public would go. Thanks for your comment!
Jesus Christ! Google? Really? I'd think they of all companies wouldn't care
Very awesome response. Thanks so much! Really lends insight into how this can be handled. I do use they/them pronouns exclusively but only correct people who ask to be corrected. I usually feel safe to disclose, but don't know if it will affect how I get treated as far as new opportunities with more responsibility.
Thank you. Yes, I agree and will check out that sub
Yeah I wonder if it's something better revealed after the hiring process if possible. I'm not as androgynous presenting as some so that may be more difficult for others who appear to be outside the gender binary. But I know people who dress androgynous and identify as female and may still get passed over for jobs. It didn't become illegal until recently to discriminate based on LGBTQ+ status. I think we have a long way to go.
Well, asshole, that's employment discrimination now and I hope you get the pants sued off you. This isn't about being ""woke"". I have the right to be addressed in the way I choose just like anyone can pick a different name and go by that. My pronouns let people know who I am and I'm not scared of people like you. Have a fucked day.
Well, them not caring is how it happened.

According to [this article](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2021/02/11/google-has-been-allowing-advertisers-to-exclude-nonbinary-people-from-seeing-job-ads), they had a policy that restricted advertisers from targeting (some?) job/housing ads based on gender. But ""based on gender"" meant something too narrow, and in particular advertisers could (and some did) still restrict their ads to people whose gender was either ""male"" or ""female"" and exclude the ""unknown"" category. (Those three seem to be the only gender categories for advertisement targeting, judging by the UI screenshots in that article.)

So it's not that Google itself cares about gender in its hiring process. It's that they previously didn't care enough to restrict advertisers from running job ads that exclude the ""unknown"" category. From the sound of it they've probably fixed that now, but I couldn't find any updates.

Whether allowing advertisers to exclude ""unknown"" users was initially just an oversight or a move driven by advertiser demand is probably lost to history at this point.

Hey there. I am writing a fantasy novel for the first time and would like to be a little more inclusive.	I would love to include a trans or non-binary character into my series. I however, am a straight white male, and I have absolutely no idea how to be respectful about the experience or do justice to such a character. I would love feedback from everyone here on if that is even something they would like to see and how they would like to see it done. What do you consider the difference between pandering and inclusive? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks so much everyone!	"Please stay away from making us aliens, shapeshifters, or any other magical beings that otherwise would not exist. I think that making trans people aliens adds to the sentiment that we are a not normal. Like Loki. Please don’t make us Disney’s Loki
Thank you for taking the time to learn about us and include us! We've discussed this topic here many times in the past. A search for terms like story or [writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/search?q=writing&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) or character will help connect you with those previous discussions. Good luck with your project!
Biggest and most obvious tip: avoid shallow stereotypes. Gay best friend? Sure, but give them depth and purpose outside of being the gay best friend.

A good way to frame it would be: they’re the best friend that happens to be gay, not simply the gay best friend. So if you made them straight, you wouldn’t think they’re just an add-on. Same goes for any other character: don’t make their identity their personality.

Also, try to avoid writing a story of *being* LGBTQ+. As a classic example, a knight saving a princess from a castle, but they’re both women? Hell yea! But writing a book about the journey of a trans person figuring out their identity? Eh, not so much

Hope this helps a little!
Thanks for thinking of us! Do as much research as you can into how the character your writing expresses their gender. And if you can, talk to some people that identify similarly. Learn from their firsthand experiences and who they are and let that influence the character.
I'd think about why. Why do you want to include a nonbinary character? 

My writing group friend and I were recently talking about representation. She had attended a reading of a novel for young people with a deaf protagonist. But the reading didn't have an ASL translator. So she wondered how that book, written by a hearing person, was really benefitting deaf kids. She asked, ""Representation for who?""

Especially since it's fantasy -- would gender be the same in that world? LeGuin for example uses fantasy to interrogate gender norms. 

I don't know you or your intentions, but I would think about whether the inclusion of a nonbinary character by someone who doesn't have irl reference points is beneficial to readers? Nonbinary readers? Trans readers? Is it diversity for the sake of diversity? These are some things I ask myself when developing characters that don't share my lived experience.
Absolutely, only humans here.
I don’t know why I didn’t think of that! Absolutely will do.
Helps a lot thanks so much!
Great advice. That’s kind of what I was hoping to get out of this post."	p1zm2a	NonBinary	13	0.89	2021-08-10 22:13:40

Pronouns in the workplace	"Hey all, I've been struggling with pronouns lately. 

I came out recently and decided she/they might be a good starting place but I am regretting it now. My closest friends and partner use they/them but every other person who knows I've mentioned pronouns to just defaults to she/her pronouns. I am not mad at anyone.. but it's been bothering me... so I am starting to tell people its they/them when it comes up but I don't feel like its always socially appropriate?  Especially at work. 

 I work at a corporate office job and in general I think most everyone there is a cis normie although I've seen and heard a lot of promotions about how they are diversity inclusive- and even fundraisers and support groups for LBGTQA+. 

I have pronouns in my email signature. I don't really want to be obnoxious about it and its not something that I feel I need to announce or anything. I figure people are going to call me she anyways because its cultural norm at this point... I can tell a few people that I'd prefer they/them.

 But in general is there a good way of making pronouns known without it being cumbersom or awkward or obnoxious?  Flag? Pin? It would just be nice if I got she/her'd less and they/them'd more and the only obvious way I can see is email signature. Advice please?"	"Pronoun Pins have been amazing for my mental health. I’m not working but am in college. As soon as I got one, people started actually calling me my preferred pronouns.
My company gave out pronoun stickers for our laptops! That might be a great option, or a pin. Also, if you use Slack or similar chat options, you might consider adding pronouns to your nickname field there, something I've seen a lot of people do.

I think it depends on the kind of work you do. If you're customer service focused then you'd have to have that convo with every customer, which I could see getting really tiring. However if you're talking about a smaller or more tightly knit group, talk to your leader about discussing it at a staff meeting so you can properly explain pronouns and what it means for you (this is also a great litmus test if they want to just talk the talk or also walk the walk) and what their support would mean to you as well. If you have an HR department you could also see what steps could be taken (maybe not any because it hasn't been brought up yet, but that could be a catalyst for change for your company).

As always, double check your local laws and your company's policies as gender presentation is not always a protected status (it's not in my state but it is at my employer which is why I'm out at work)
[removed]
Just change it in your email and if it comes up mention it. Like yeah making a big deal of it at work probably wont actually accomplish anything. But if youre friends with anyone there, let them know and maybe others will catch on
We use Teams, do you know if that is an option on there? Thank you for your comment!
I am legally protected in my state. Im more afraid of the confrontation. At this point I don't consider it a micro aggression because I have not communicated what pronouns I prefer beyond she/they. 😅 i am just bad at the communication part of it but thank you for adding perspective that it helps others. I think others deserve things and am guilty of feeling like I don't.
It's protected status in my state. I don't really interact with customers. I am more of a background person writing letters and checking that everything follows compliance. I'm new so I am a bit more afraid of making waves than anything, the confrontation of it scares me but legally I am protected.
Based on your profile you only came here to spread hate and insult people. Does that make you feel like a big boy

On with feeding the pathetic troll... 

The workplace is the workplace, you're absolutely correct. Which means you should act professional, this means respecting coworkers and clients. This also means you don't discriminate against people either. 

You must not be great at interpersonal communication, when I'm talking directly to you, I'll refer to you as 'you.' However, if I'm talking about you to someone else in front of you, I'll refer to using pronouns, and refer to the person I'm addressing as 'you.'

What's an odd view to you could be normal to others, they/them is already a common pronoun, even if you lack the basics of English to figure out how and when to use them.

Sexuality doesn't belong at work, yet cis het men seem to think they can talk about it freely. Yet pronouns and gender have nothing to do with sex, but I doubt you have the critical thinking skills to figure this out.

Unlike you, most of us don't hate groups of people. There are white boomers who aren't soulless heartless zombies, that only march to the drum of the far right lunacy.

You probably won't respond to this, because you can't have an original thought beyond what you're spoon fed from your far right overlords.
My gender is not my sexuality... so your suggesting I stay in the closet for the sake of a career and others comfort?... 

Also, people use my pronouns infront of me all the time like in a meetings. This isn't exclusively something that happens when that person isn't around. Additionally I am in a state that protects against discrimination towards gender and sexuality. I'm not ""selling my odd views"" I am in an environment I spend the major part of my time. I deserve respect and that includes the ability to be myself.

This comment is incredibly ignorant.
Im pretty new, so I really don't have any close friends there
That's a good opportunity then - consider thinking of it instead of confrontation as education. It's very likely that they want you to be happy and comfortable at your work, they just need you to let them know how to do so. Giving them a basic understanding of why, examples of what works, and providing good resources or letting them know what questions to ask, and reminding them it's a protected status, that kind of thing. And being honest about 'hey, I know I'm new and this is kind of scary for me but I trust you with this because I like working with you"" is more likely to build trust on your team."	1155pul	NonBinary	14	1.0	2023-02-18 03:29:24
Manager uses my name instead of my pronouns	"Hey folks, just looking for some validation I guess or advice if you have it. I work at a pretty inclusive workplace, the company discrimination policies include gender identity and expression, and up until now all of my coworkers have used my pronouns without issue (except the occasional genuine accident or miscommunication with a non-native English speaker). My new manager as of a few months ago is a cishet man and in our first one on one meeting he brought up that he had heard people use ""they/them"" for me and confirmed that that was right. Since then I have not once hear him use ""they/them"" pronouns to refer to me. He doesn't use ""he"" or ""she"" he just never uses pronouns for me. At first I didn't think much of it, then I thought maybe he'd forgotten so I set my pronouns to show up as part of my name on Slack, but he kept doing it. It's really starting to feel like he's deliberately avoiding using my pronouns which feels shitty, but I don't want to bring it up. I don't feel like there's anyone at work I can talk to about this and I feel like I'm going to be called crazy because he's not technically misgendering me."	"I had a colleague do this to me while he was adjusting. It was super noticeable but I let him get on with it and it actually didn't take long for him to work a ""they"" into a sentence without a long pause or just using my name. Some people seem terrified of getting it wrong and I feel like my pronouns need to come with reassurance that I don't mind if people need to adjust and I'm not terribly offended by the occasional ""he"" anyway.

It's possible he's doing it because he's trying to not get it wrong, like out of politeness, or I guess it could be a weird and disrespectful refusal to use ""they""? One of my colleagues kept slipping for a while and I just explained all this to her and said it's fine if she slips and she can practise if she wants. Those conversations can be tricky though, but I would recommend bringing it up if you feel like you could. Maybe it could help to go over it and I hope they're not deliberately being disrespectful.
I agree with u/sereneboi255 that it could either be deliberate refusal to use your (OP’s) correct pronouns and thus invalidating your gender (for example, I’ve seen lots of people say “singular they is grammatically wrong, so I will not use pronouns at all”), or it could be out of a fear of getting it wrong. Do you have a sense of which it is from your interactions with him? If you think it’s due to a fear of getting it wrong, maybe talking with him about it, nonconfrontationally, would help. Something like “hey, I noticed you’ve done THING, if you’re worried about misgendering me, I know that mistakes happen so just correct yourself and move on, and you’ll get better at it.” If you think he’s doing it bc he’s anti-nonbinary people, check whether your state (or other locality) protects nonbinary and other trans people, then consider talking to HR.
I know this is an older post, but I have the same experience with my older Music Director. He always uses my name and never my pronouns. I've talked to him before about how I'd appreciate him using my preferred pronouns, as he was blatantly misgendering me before, and since then he's just used my name. Which is not terrible, better than she/her, but I still really wish he'd use he/they, which are my preferred prns. It's getting kinda annoying, but I feel like if I bring it up he'll dance around it again like he did when I confronted him about misgendering me(and the other trans students in the class, mind you). He's the same guy who calls my friend Atlas(chosen name, trans man) ""Alice"" sometimes bc it sounds similar— I don't think he does it out of malice, he's just so so oblivious. I think that's the more frustrating part too, is that he genuinely has no ill will, he's just slow to learn """"new"""" things like this."	q45esi	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-10-08 19:53:17

My Letter to My Coworkers on My Name Change/Pronouns	"I was recently came back from parental bonding leave and decided screw it! I'm going by my preferred name at work. I had already updated my pronouns and they were being used correctly (for the most part), but I've been going by my preferred name so long outside of work that it was actually causing some headaches because I wasn't responding to my legal name.

An excerpt from my email:

>I’m also excited to share that I have started the process for my legal name change, so you will start seeing my name update across the org to Caiden. My name change is an essential part of my identity and plays a large role in my wellbeing. I completely understand that this will take some getting used to, and slip-ups happen (I’ve been going by Caiden for a while now, and I still answer the phone “This is **\[redacted for Reddit\]**”). Side note: *The best way to handle mix-ups is like when your parent calls you all of your siblings’ names and the dog’s name before finally getting your name- “John! Robert—I mean, Tessa. No, Snoopy! I mean Caiden! Caiden, how was your day?” Don’t feel like you need to apologize or feel bad about it. It happens* 😊 I also have a very handy link in my signature for more information on my pronouns.

I'm very fortunate to work for a company that values diversity and inclusion and fights for employees to bring their true, authentic selves to work. Yes, my job is tough. Yes, it's stressful. But it's easier when I can wake up and go to work being my cranky, non-binary self. It alleviates the guilt of hiding a part of myself and kicks those intrusive thoughts out. Even when there are slip-ups, there is no more dysphoria when my coworkers use my retired name.

Love to you all <3

\~Caiden"	I love the advice to treat it like when your parents call you by all the wrong siblings names in a row. That's a perfect way of phrasing it.	nm76ot	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-05-27 13:14:31
The struggle of being nonbinary	"I’m starting work soon. (First shift is tomorrow.) While filling out the online paperwork, I of course had to put my legal name but then it asked what I wanted to go by so I put my chosen name, Siren. Also when it asked for my gender I chose nonbinary. I was excited that it was inclusive but also worried others were not going to be inclusive. 

On Monday, I attended orientation and picked up my uniform. My name tag said my deadname. Why even ask what I wanted to be called if you aren’t gonna use it? 

I just wanted a break of being misgendered and deadnamed at home but I guess that can’t happen. I guess I’ll just have to deal with it like always. I just can’t wait til I can legally change my name. I’m eighteen so I don’t need my parent’s permission but the process is long and I don’t have the money for it currently. 

At least I’m getting paid. 

I just needed to vent since I have no one to talk to so thanks for reading."	"If you feel safe to, you could probably ask about it. I don't know where you work of course, but it's possible that they made a mistake.
The expense to changing legal names can be such a barrier for trans people. Are there any organizations in your area that can help with costs? In Ontario, Canada, I’ve heard there are a few.
That's stupid,my partner told me about a preferred name and I thought of putting James at the time but eventually Jordan. If they aren't going to use your proffered name then why is there an option for it. I'm sorry that happened to you
Most places that you need a name tag for, generally don't mind what your name is on your name tag. Just ask your boss if you can get another one with your preferred name, it's a harmless request that costs little to no money. Like a few people said you should look into getting an official name change.
I might try that. It’s hard for me to ask for things. It makes me feel like a burden despite knowing that asking them to use my real name is not being a burden. I guess that’s what having severe social anxiety does to a person. Thank you for the advice :)
I live in a very conservative state so it is very limited but I can do some research. Thank you :)
Thank you. It’s tough right now
I might try that. Thank you :)
Ah yeah, I get that. Same reason my legal name is on my name tag. 😅 that name doesn't particularly bother me, and I don't even have to wear the tag, so I never said anything. Hell, if it feels less stressful for you, you could probably even frame it as a nickname you prefer to go by.

In any case, good luck!"	113gxzz	NonBinary	14	0.95	2023-02-16 03:35:11
Updated my Slack pronouns at work to he/they	"It’s the first public step I’ve taken in sharing my non-binary identity. 

My workplace is super inclusive and the People team had an initiative actively encouraging all employees to update their pronouns in their Slack profiles if they felt comfortable, especially cis folks to help normalize listing and asking for pronouns. That was super reassuring, and I feel quite grateful and lucky for that.

However, the pronouns list was missing he/they, even though it had she/they (odd), so I had to reach out to IT to ask them to add it. I was quite nervous about that, but they were great and added it straight away, and now it’s there for all he/they people to use. 🙌"		rfefgy	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-12-13 12:16:47
How i feel about pronouns	"I've been identifying as NB / genderqueer for a couple years now. I remember when the gender question came about in 2015/14 and i identified at genderfluid bc it was more inclusive but soon after coming out to people and my family they made fun of me. After that i identified again as a female. 

then i think about 2 years ago i realized that i shouldnt let others perspectives influence my feelings and identity. At first tho, i was okay with she/he/them (all pronouns). but after awhile i got tired of any bc peoples first go to pronoun was she. i understand im more fem but its in my bio & switch it up maybe? 

i just stuck with they/them more this past year and make it known since that aspect really bothered me and i was just wondering if anyone else felt the same way.

thanks ~ "	"Yeah, I'm NB (afab) but identify heavily on the masc side and present that way, too. I really don't mind she/her TOO much, but when I get referred to as ""sir"" or ""he"" in public I get amazing gender euphoria. I honestly could go with she/her or he/him and be happy, but I know that if I say that everyone's just gonna default to she/her, which I guess you can't really blame them for? Doesn't help that I also heavily identify as a lesbian. Language is weird, I guess. A lot of the time I want a different pronoun just so people don't assume I'm a girl all the time, not because she/her gives me a ton of dysphoria. "	b4mn1v	NonBinary	16	1.0	2019-03-23 18:44:33
Tired of the discourse	"Hey y'all idk about you but I feel very uncomfortable whenever the Bisexual and Pansexual community have discourse on the internet. I honestly love and appreciate both sexualities and fall somewhere outside or in between them. But as a non binary person is super uncomfortable and invalidating to see both sides fight over being more inclusive than the other? Like please stop using my existence to try and get ""woke points"" or bash another sexuality? Just acknowledge that both communities have ppl who spew transphobic rhetoric and bias against gnc ppl? like address that maybe? idk it's been making me feel very alienated from both communities. I'm not a talking point I'm a person."	"Ahhhh, the bi/pan discourse

Y'know, I've been seeing that same discourse for like 10+ years now with pretty much the same talking points?

I feel your frustration
Agreed.
I feel very “oh look, more people for me to block” whenever I see that endless nonsense.
I think what kills me even more is the way some of these people fetish us (and just trans folk in general) and act like they are woke for it. Like idk as a bi trans (and nonbinary) person its very weird to see us be the main talking point of this discourse when none of them refuse to acknowledge that yes, there are problematic bi and pan yes.

Recommendations for school shopping for an NB kiddo?	Hey there! I’m usually just a lurker as this sub helps me to understand and better connect with my 11-year-old child who came out to me as NB early this year. They’ll be starting middle school in a couple weeks so I want to take them shopping and make sure they have a wardrobe of things that make them happy and comfortable.  Are there any stores or online shops that are more NB inclusive these days? Thank you so much!	"If there are, I haven't found them. If you do end up going somewhere a bit more boys/girls segmented, just remind them that those signs are to help people find what they're looking for, and your kid should use them as such. It's not about who's allowed to buy them.
ahh we love a supportive parent !
my advice is to shop where you usually do, but dont limit them to the ‘boys’ or ‘girls’ section, instead pay attention to the clothes themselves (color, pattern, fabric, etc) and that will help narrow down their options! i do know of one gender neutral online store called ‘tomboyx’ i’ve never bought anything from them, but i’ve heard good things! also you can never go wrong with thrift stores!"	p6v9ao	NonBinary	12	0.94	2021-08-18 16:56:56
"Opinions on ""gender expansive"""	"Hey guys! I'm nonbinary and studying education. Today in one of my classes, we had a cis guest speaker come in to discuss trans inclusivity in the classroom, and he was discussing that the term ""gender expansive"" should be used, because nonbinary was outdated?? Being nonbinary, I was really surprised and confused to hear this, so I was wondering if yall could give me your insight. This is a term I've only ever heard cis allies use and never trans people, so I'm wondering if this is a ""latinx"" situation where people outside of the community created a term to ""fix a problem"" in our community that didn't exist? Please let me know if this is a thing and I'm just old now hahaha"	"I've heard gender expansive to include not just identities that aren't cis, but presentation choices that don't align with social stereotypes based on gender regardless of identity. So, if a cis guy wants to wear a dress, he's still cis, but his presentation choice would be gender expansive. But I tend to use TGNC when I want to include both identity and expression, and I see the push for ""gender expansive"" as a solution in search of a problem, much in the same way that autistic people have had ""person with autism/person-first language"" foisted upon us.
I don't like gender expansive as a replacement for non-binary because it excludes (imo) my identity of agender, whereas with non-binary agender obviously fits in just fine.
Sorry to go a bit off topic, but I have to take issue with your “Latinx” comparison. As a Latinx person with many Latinx friends, this is the first time I’ve heard about it being coined by people “outside the community”. Every woke (for lack of a better term) person of Hispanic origin I know uses that term. Also it isn’t a solution in search of a problem, it addresses an actual problem (Spanish being an extremely gendered language).
since everyone else already said all the constructive stuff, i wanna add that that cis guy can pry ""nonbinary"" outta my cold dead hands. i'm an enby til i die and i don't care what cis ppl think.
I think the idea is that “non-binary” references the thing which it is trying to get away from (the binary), so “gender expansive” is a bit more...open? Personally I don’t think a cis person gets to say what words we should or shouldn’t use to describe ourselves. I like both terms 🤷🏻
At least where I am gender expansive is a larger umbrella for presentation, as well as identity. So a tomboy or butch might fall under that even if they're cis. Or a cis male with more feminine expression like nail polish, long hair, accessories... They're expanding what the view on their gender is. With that said though usually those that fall into the above are cis and comfortable with being seen like every other man and women in the room, just don't expect their styles to conform to that.
I always think of gender expansive as the biggest possible umbrella for folx who may benefit from trans rights and inclusion (so including nonbinary people who don't identity as trans, as well as men who just wanna wear dresses/makeup, and butch women, etc etc etc). Like, anybody who is gender nonconforming fits into gender expansive, anybody who pushes the definition of gender fits into gender expansive, as well as trans folx of all types! I don't think of it as a specific identity or replacement for nonbinary though, that seems silly. Also saying any identity is outdated seems... Rude, at best 🙄
Thank you all so much for your responses!! This was very helpful and insightful <3
I've seen the term used on some websites. I don't mind it, but i also don't think there's anything wrong with just saying nonbinary. It's probably just one of those personal preference things where people should be allowed to use whichever term they like best without judgement. I totally agree with the first commenter that it's a lot like the person-first language argument about autism. I personally don't care if I'm called an autistic person or a person with autism, but if someone else cares how they're referred to, their preference should be respected. I think it's rather silly and unhelpful of that guest speaker to be trying to make it into some kind of moral issue.
I've honestly been struggling with accepting this term myself, so I am glad to see I am not alone! I've been working on my thesis and it continues to get sent back to me because I used the term ""gender non-conforming"" instead of gender expansive. As a non-binary person myself I was also taken back. I was told by my dissertation chair that any term that uses ""non"" in it, is automatically oppressive or suggestive of an other group. I've pushed back a lot on the issue but am struggling to find any literature that will be accepted by my institution to support my stance and I can't just cite it as a personal preference
""a solution in search of a problem"" is a fantastic way to describe this. I totally agree about the person-first language issue.
I think the comparison to autism is particularly apt given definitions like ""people who expand notions of gender expression and identity beyond perceived or expected societal gender norms"" (Pflag) which to my reading comes off as very ""You're all so inspirational! It's so wonderful how you expand our understandings of gender!"" Fuck. That. Expand your notions your own self; I am Other, not the cutting edge of norms.
Right! Thats what I thought gender non-conforming was for.. Thank you for your response!
agreed. i don't think gender expansive sounds inclusive of the full breadth of our community
From what I've read (I'm definitely not an expert), latinx vs latine seems rather regional on uptake. I've seen some strong opinions both ways.
Oh, thank you for telling me! It could definitely be a regional difference bc all my latinx/latine friends have expressed that they don't like latinx haha
Fr fr
I like this and agree with this and I like gender expansive
Lmao now I want to cross stitch ""Expand your own damn notions.""
Interesting, I might need to ask around more now. Sorry if I came off too critical. I could understand people not liking the term for whatever reason but I believe it was in fact coined by Latinx people

"A mod in a different group told me that advocating for trans inclusivity is ""entitlement to someone's sexuality"", lol"	"Someone in r/offmychest came out as bisexual and basically said ""I like boys and girls! Penis and vagina!"" Which is gross enough in itself, but I commented saying basically, ""hey, don't forget that bisexuality is trans inclusive, and while it would suck if you're not trans inclusive, the bi community still includes trans and nonbinary people, which includes more than just boys and girls."". 
I didn't even get into addressing the implication that genitals are gendered in their post, and I was pretty nice about it, but I still got hella down votes and even had a mod tell me that my comment was showing ""entitlement"" to this person's sexuality, LOL. 
They told me not to post again so I just noped out of the group altogether. I don't need to be in a group with transphobic mods. I know the majority of Reddit isn't trans inclusive but that was just so shitty."	"[deleted]
Uff, how annoying. 

Besides that, I like your username.
Oh yeah I don't think they were being malicious or intentionally exclusive, I just wanted to chime in and be like ""hey just FYI"", but I guess that's forbidden lol

Thoughts on using Binary Pronouns?	"Hi, I'm non-binary questioning (if that's a thing)!

Was just wondering what your thoughts are on still using binary pronouns (he/she) but identifying as non-binary?

Context: I still use he/him/his because it's convenient and I still ""look like a man"" for the most part to society, although I love dressing androgynously. I'm more pronoun indifferent than anything. Depending on the context, I am more comfortable being addressed with either a male or female honorific/identifier so I love the spirit behind Mx. and making titles more inclusive.

I'm still not sure whether I'm gay with a very fluid view on gender or I'm somewhere on the spectrum of non-binary. A friend suggested I might be transfeminine."	"no rules my friend! 
small amount of advice if you don't mind; remember don't ever let others dictate what pronouns you use just to make them comfortable or it's easier to do. I know you said it was convenient to use he/him but if you're only doing that to avoid using other pronouns for the others or maybe you're worried to explain your pronouns to strangers all the time, that might be something to think about!
sorry that was slightly rambling, good luck!
I don’t think it’s a bad thing. Use whatever pronouns u feel r right
I am kind of exploring my non-binary identity also. For the time being I am continuing to use she/her pronouns until I figure myself out and feel comfortable coming out to more people. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with using whatever pronouns are most comfortable for you! Even if you never decide to use they/them, it is totally okay!
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. :) It's entirely okay to be questioning, and to take your time as you search. And sure, use whatever pronouns are most convenient and satisfying for you at the moment.

All the best as you test, journey and explore!
There are cis women who prefer “he/him” and cis men who prefer “she/her”. Use whatever pronouns work best for you. Your gender and presentation are for you to figure out for yourself!
The pronouns other people use for me has more to do with what they see than who I am. I’ve been lucky to find spaces lately where I can be myself more, but I still get misgendered constantly, and if I don’t stand up for myself, that doesn’t make me any less non-binary. 

Also some non-binary people feel comfortable using pronouns like she and he, and that’s valid too. I don’t feel comfortable with he/she, so I wanted to give that perspective.
I prefer my binary pronoun at the moment but I identify with being nonbinary. You're valid no matter what. Also yes, nonbinary questioning is a thing because I dont think many of us can say we just decided instantly that we were nonbinary.
Ngl just love your life. Just be you the pronouns you use done decide if your valid. All that matters is that your happy however you express yourself. I use he/him and it's not a problem.
I accept ""he"". I present masc and identify between masc and agender. Nonbinary."	d0q659	NonBinary	13	1.0	2019-09-07 02:04:59
Theoretical vs. actual inclusiveness	"Maybe I'm overthinking this, but I was wondering if anyone had experienced something similar, or had advice.

It's taken me a long time to feel more comfortable being out as non-binary, and I'm still getting there. One of my major hangups has been feeling like I don't ""deserve"" to have people acknowledge my gender identity and that I can't expect them to understand or see me the way I want to be seen. However, I've been fortunate to be able to be able to volunteer in some theoretically trans-friendly environments, and that's made me start to feel more comfortable.

But I had an awkward experience recently. I do some LGBTQ-related volunteer work, and we often start events and meetings by going around the room and introducing ourselves with our names and pronouns. I actually have some mixed feelings about this. When I initially started this work, I felt awkward because I wasn't really out yet and felt pressured to either out myself or lie. Now I am more out, but it feels weird when I'm often the only person in the room who uses non-binary pronouns or who doesn't pass as the gender they identify with. It really puts me on display. And while I understand that a lot of the intent of this exercise is to challenge the idea that you can assume someone's pronouns just by looking at them, I don't feel like I can take for granted that the environment is really going to be inclusive toward non-binary/gender-nonconforming people if it seldom comes up. When all the male-passing people use ""he"" and all the female-passing people use ""she,"" it's hard to actually know if people are good at remembering and respecting people's pronouns when they're not ""obvious.""

The other day, I was doing a volunteer event with a cis person who's one of the leaders of our trans outreach projects. In the context of the event we were doing, we actually talked about trans issues and the value of not assigning a binary gender to someone based on how they look. I was vocally out as being non-binary and using they/them pronouns. And yet the person I was working with *consistently* used female pronouns for me. It was very awkward. Ironically, I'm not actually that concerned about what pronouns people use for me. But if I'm in a setting where sharing is actively encouraged, and I state that I use they/them, it's *really* noticeable if someone disregards or forgets that. And it was awkward that some of the others in our group, who were a lot less familiar with trans people, made a much bigger effort to not misgender me than the person who was supposed to be an expert. I didn't say anything, and I didn't really *want* to say anything. And I don't want to be unfair, because I know that realistically, it can be hard for some people to remember pronouns and get used to non-binary pronouns. But I also feel like if we're creating settings where there's a lot of emphasis on using the correct pronouns and not misgendering people, it looks bad if those principles aren't followed well in practice.

Sorry for the tl;dr. This was just a discouraging experience for me, because it made me feel like non-binary inclusion is a joke. Like sure, people will give lip service to it, but that's it."	"My opinion: if you have a general meeting where people are encouraged to say things they feel strongly about, that's the time to bring it into the open. Obviously it matters, but some people get so caught up in their own comfort zone they forget others have zones too. It's part of being in the world, dangnabit

I feel this. It's why I ask something like ""what pronouns do you want us to use today"" instead of ""what are your pronouns""

And yea I've definitely experienced that non-binary fake-allyship. No fun. "	6koqyy	NonBinary	13	0.85	2017-07-01 18:53:46
Interview with someone who identifies as Nonbinary for school	"Hi, I'm a belgian psychology student in my 3rd bachelor year and for an assignment I have to interview someone with a social identity that I don't have (to learn to be inclusive in our psychological practices). I immediately thought of interviewing someone with a nonbinary gender identity because I've been thinking for a while I should learn more about different gender identities, also to learn to be more inclusive. If you're interested in hearing more or helping out, please let me know!

I'd greatly appreciate it!"	"I'd love to help out! I'm a psych student myself and had to do a similar assignment a few years ago. 

Also idk if this matters, but I'm Dutch so if you're Flemish, we could communicate in our native languages instead of English.
Are you okay with a text-based interview via email or discord or similar?
I sent you a message :)
I'd be interested plus I speak French  (I'm French so I'd better lol), although is it possible via text? Video is fine too bit I'm more awkward when talking verbally
I’d be open to this!

Pronouns in Professional Settings	"My workplace is starting to encourage people to put their pronouns in their email signatures, Slack/zoom names, etc., as a way to normalize the practice and be more inclusive for trans/NB folks. I love this idea and love that I've seen it catch on in more and more places, however, I'm feeling a little torn how to participate myself. Adding she/her (my ""assigned""/assumed pronouns) feels disingenuous to myself, adding she/they (my pronouns) feels uncomfortable because I'm not out at work (or many places at all yet), and continuing to not include pronouns feels like I'm missing out on the chance to contribute to normalizing pronouns of all kinds in the world. 
Have others felt similarly? How do you deal?"	"Hello! I deal with this as well. My work hasn’t particularly progressed however other professional groups have and when I’m able to give feedback I always say it is VITAL to not require pronoun disclosure for this very reason. I am not out. I am not intending on bringing up my gender with my company. I am not looking for ways to out myself. I am where I am comfortable and I intend to remain in control of information about this part of myself as it has the potential to bring major impacts to my life.

We do not owe our gender or our performance of gender to anyone, the honest parts or the camouflage. The onus of work is on the environment to make a place actually inclusive and SAFE without requiring disclosure. We are not required to continually out ourselves when a place is not actually as inclusive as it imagines or when we just don’t feel like it’s time. Similarly, it’s not right to force closeted people to use incorrect pronouns. This leads to awkward moments like my mother includes her pronouns in her email signature but I don’t. People like me who choose not to participate may come off as not supporting the broader inclusivity but really I’m just protecting myself and others who can’t disclose for whatever reason. 

If I were to get direct pressure about participating, in an appropriate setting I would bring up that while I’m not against it and support peers who have decided to participate, it wouldn’t be right to force someone to come out therefore it’s not appropriate to force anyone to participate. Further, there’s much more risk placed on trans and or nonbinary people than any cis person, if everyone is pushed to participate trans/ 
nonbinary people end up cornered deciding if they’re going to come out or misgender themselves. Therefore while some may see this as part of expanding inclusivity, I do not feel comfortable putting unknown others in that position of being the only person who is visibly not participating. 

And I have said as much to people before because they thought they found an easy way to be woke but it actually just made me feel like shit.
Those are questions I often ask myself and I didn't find any personal answers yet.
Asking for pronouns in workplace is very complicated because it implies that you/people should come out but it doesn't mean that there will be specific rules to protect you/the employees against transphobia.
Perhaps listing your main co-workers/bosses and classifying them into groups (people who would probably be good allies or supportive / people you won't trust / people you're not sure) could help you seeing more clearly ? If you feel like talking about being non-binary with the first group, perhaps you'll feel more confident about using your pronouns in your signature ?
(And if nosy people/ people who gossip a lot ask you about it, you can reply that you're here to work, not to answer questions about your identity)
I feel the same. She/her works well for me, but they/them also feels true. Saying “she/her” only next to my name would feel incomplete. However I also don’t necessarily want to display it on my social media profiles as I’ve seen some friends do, because understanding this part of myself and affirming it is still something very new to me. Even after Im more comfortable, I’m not sure I’d want to put it online because I live in a conservative southern city and I don’t want to have people asking me to explain, my family wouldn’t understand either. That may be something ill work out in my head as i fully accept what I’m just now learning about myself.. anyway, I also would like to show solidarity with the lgbtq+ community through putting pronouns online, but I’m not quite solid on speaking to others about it yet, so I prefer to default to “she” for now and tbh deactivated social media during this time.
This definitely resonates with what I've been feeling, and helps put it into words, so thanks! It's definitely an odd feeling being made so uncomfortable by something intended to make me feel included... but I'm sure others find it helpful, so I don't want to speak out against it. I 100% agree that making it non-mandatory is crucial"	m0nhei	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-03-08 19:16:03
has a customer ever said anything to you at work? cw: misgendering, transphobia	i work at a retail store where our name tags have our pronouns on them. i also have a few pins that say “ask me about my pronouns” and one gives an example on how to use they/them pronouns. my managers allow this and even have their own pins. well tonight was the first time ive had a customer say something rude about it. others have noticed and just asked, others tell me they like my pins, some acknowledge it and then use it for me there. but tonight i had a lady come up to the register so i could check her out. everything was fine, i asked her how she was and if she found everything okay. she then looked down and say my pin that says “ask me my pronouns” and read it out loud. she proceeded to say “so what does that mean? you don’t use she/her?” and i with a smile said “no.” i thought she was just acknowledging my pin until she said “that’s really sad. and the fact that you’re advertising it.” i was stunned and just stood there. i gave her her items and my manager came over asking what happened because she could see my face and demeanor changed. the lady then turned around, came back in the store to return her items because “i just can’t support a store that uses pronouns.” my manager handled it and then emailed our general manager, district manager and corporate to tell them her name and what happened because the company i work for is incredibly inclusive and supports lgbtq+ rights. i am so thankful for my manager but went in the back and cried because it’s taken me so long to get to a point where i’m living as me and comfortable with myself. and for her to say that, she didn’t have to say anything at all. have any of you had a similar experience with customers at work?	"When I used to work fast food, I had a couple of different instances where people were outright hostile and aggressive. One time I got called a slur, another time a customer referred to me very harshly as ""it."" It was pretty upsetting. I don't know if the uncomfortable feeling ever goes away after something like that happens. I still think about it sometimes, but I recognize that my existence is important and valuable and that I shouldn't let someone else's hatred pull me down. I don't work food service anymore because I'm in grad school. Everyone here has been really great about my pronouns which I so appreciate. Having a crew who affirms and supports you makes it easier to deal with the negative experiences.
When I worked retail I did have a woman say ""so you don't have a name?"" when she saw my pronoun pin (I was wearing a name tag, it was just on a lanyard hanging below the register cause I'm short af). She was nasty to me in a lot of other ways, too, tbh. Most people just pointedly ignored it and used ""she"" anyway. Retail sucks, especially when you're queer or otherwise ""different.""
Don’t these dingbats know that she and he are pronouns, too?!
I’m sorry that happened, you didn’t deserve that at all. That person has demons they need to deal with, you’re an angel as far as I’m concerned."	w2gsj9	NonBinary	12	1.0	2022-07-19 02:04:36
Question about it/they use in my fantasy series	"(Long post ahead)

Hi there! I am a straight female writer and I consider myself an ally of LGBTQ+ community. I am no expert and I am in need of your feedback and advice about representation, as I do not want to be non-inclusive or unintenionally upsetting or insulting. If I have posted this under the wrong group, do let me know. I just thought its better to ask than be left wondering. 

I am writing a fantasy series where a race of intersex beings exist having both biological sexes and they have a neutral (neutrum) gender identity. Their language has the dominant gender class as ‘it’ to denote their gender. What i meanby that is that i and other characters (including these beings) refer to them by ‘it’. 
Now, I am aware that this term has a negative connotation in our culture, but from a linguistic, a bit of rational perspective, this use of the pronoun in a fantasy world seems harmless to me. Am I wrong and should i rather use ‘they’? 

A bit more about this race: 
Originally they come from another plane (or world)
when they procreate they can alter their pysical state (intersex) to slide towards the female or male biological sex but this doesn’t mean that they need to stay in that form. (Staying in a neutrum sex catagory is called the old way and they are also called walkers as they walk the path of the Old.)
Some of them, do and can choose to live and be  as either male or female. They consider this to be a natural effect of the world they are now in. This is the small difference of belief among them although general concensus is that it doesn’t really matter as they all respect an individual’s Path. 
 (Their whole belief is that they travel from world to world to transcend into the purest form of being that is liberated from the material world - everyone follows their own Path, which is an inner process based on intuiton that leads to transcendence within their own spiritual and alchemical practices that aim to understand the materialisation of the Divine) 

I know that this is an imaginary type of being and so slightly removed from our lived experience but I though i rather check with communities that live within similar states of being and self-expression. 

So my first question is: 
1st: is the use of ‘it’ OK or should i use ‘they’? 

2nd question: 
I do briefly mention that humans from other cultures that meet these beings that appear in a more fluid androgenous form experience a moment of “uneasines” as their own perception of culturally fixed biological and cultural sex/gender identity categories is disrupted. Is this OK? 

Please note that I am trying to normalise the fluditiy of gender identification through my fantasy series and be inclusive and perhaps reclaim and/or reframe the use of ‘it’ . If I am coming across as arrogant and uninformed, or if I am intelectually failing at it, please be gentle: this is my first fantasy book and my first dive into the gender and sex spectrum :) 

Thank you for taking the time for reading my post and for your feedback. 

Humbly yours ✨"	"I would say using ""it"" is ok, I would also agree with the other commenter saying it could dehumanize (using the term loosely and for lack of a better word) the characters.  Another solution may be to use neopronouns, whether creating your own set (fun fact, the neopronouns I prefer to use came from a sci-fi book originally, I haven't gotten around to reading it and chose the set because I like them but still an interesting note) or using an existing set, that avoids the occasional awkwardness of singular they/them, sets the characters apart in some way, and helps with normalizing neopronouns which may be something that would interest you (it isn't something that necessarily has to be involved, just with your desire to normalize the fluidity of gender, it may be of interest to you, or it may not be).  In the end, though, it is your book and you can write characters who use it/its pronouns and not end up with them seeming like they're treated as lesser by every character who respects said pronouns.
First off, thanks for asking. It is never wrong to be ignorant, but curious. You haven't said anything I find offensive, but even if you had I would rather you learn why by making the mistake now than end up publishing something offensive.

Anyway, what you are doing is fine, but it's kind of missing the mark when it comes to representation.

The fact that this is a non-human species gives you a lot of leeway with how you present them. It would be hard for you to make them offensive to enbys accidentally because any differences between us and them can be assumed to be just part of how they are. After all, they are not supposed to be exactly the same as human enbys. But it's a double edged sword; the fact that they are not supposed to be the same as us means that they are kind of not real representation. That is fine, not every story needs to have enby representation. But if it is important to you to do good enby representation, then it's worth working on it a bit.

There is an actual problem, but it's systemic, not personal. There is a massive trend of concepts like this (aliens, magical races, AIs etc) being thought of as enby representation. It is so hard to find representation where enbys are just normal humans, so we latch onto whatever scraps of representation we can get. But what that means is that the cultural concept of what an enby is is warped. We are seen as other, alien, nonhuman because we are never humanised in media. So while there is nothing specifically wrong with this, it feels like it is contributing to a harmful pattern.

So, some ideas on how this could be better;

* You mention that humans feel unease, this could be positive or negative depending on how it is actually presented. If unease is seen as a normal response, that would be problematic.
* Do humans have to experience unease? Could they instead feel some familiarity because they can compare the healers to enby humans. This could make the subtext ""Healers aren't that weird because they are similar to some humans who are normal.""
* If they humans do experience unease, could their unease be presented as silly? Making the subtext ""Humans have an unenlightened perspective of gender.""
* Could there be one or more gender diverse human characters? It could be interesting to explore the similarities and differences between gender diverse humans and the healers. This would give some natural opportunities to explain the healer culture, as well as an opportunity to present an enby as ""the normal one"".
I would absolutely not use 'it'. There are nonbinary folks who use it/its pronouns for themselves, which is fine, but it's also still very much a slur, weaponized by many to demean and dehumanize us. I don't think it's appropriate for a cis person to use 'it' except for specific people who use those pronouns.
From a non-binary point of view, I guess it's fine. Some people use and like ""it"". This is a group with a different biology and culture, pretty much anything goes. Maybe it just works with their cultural identity. 

I like seeing non-binary genders in fiction, whether it's regular human representation, or a different race used in a plot commenting on the social construct of gender. It really can provoke interesting questions about the constrains of culture regarding our identities. 

From a literary (and, to an extent, linguistic) point of view, I think it's not a good idea, but you didn't ask for this sort of advice.
Hermaphrodite is a term only used for animals. Humans are called intersex. Also, it’s wrong to say that there are only two biological sexes. Animals have more complexity than that, specially between insects (I’m a psychologist and not a biologist, so I know this just en passant, since I study gender). If you intend to approach sexuality and gender in your story, you’d have to do a more throughout research so you don’t fall on common sense misconceptions about the theme. Physiological sexuality involves the sexual chromosomes, intrauterine development, extern and intern genitalia, and hormones, to summarize. And gender is even more complex, because it involves some cerebral structures as well as historical and sociocultural aspects. 
I’m sorry I can’t suggest bibliography in English to you because I mainly study it in Portuguese.
it pronoun user here. If it isn't deliberately used in a dehumanizing way then i say go for it. That being said i understand the concern
I think it would be hard to tell the impact of the word before reading the whole manuscript. You can use anything you want while writing and change if it sounds off during edits
Stop saying hermaphrodite.
Thank you for referring me to neopronouns, really useful. It made me think that avoiding using gender categories in the (original language and then ‘translated’ into English as it appears on the page) would make more sense with beings as I imagined them. Very useful!
What you said makes a lot of sense. As i posted this I realised the same thing. I am not really being representative and I am gearing the ‘otherness’ even further… I have, however included point 3 and 4 in my story. In fact, some of the humans that posses a magical ability can also become more like healers... In a way I wanted to present a race that is somehow superior to humans. The unease really comes at healers’ ability to change their appearances - in fact they are constantly readjusting their pysical bodies, not really from gender perspective. It is almost some form of higher alchemical knolwedge of transmutation where one can will whatever one wishes. I do have human  gender diverse charatcers too so I hope That I will be able to make it interesting and diverse enough. Many thanks for your reply, well said.
A lot of the second half of this video discusses what I'm on about if you are interested.

Thank you, I have changed my mind of using ‘it’ after some discussion here. Many thanks.
Hi, thank you for your feedback - it helps a lot. Could you just explain what do you mean by, from a literary or linguistic point, it’s not a good idea?
Thank you. I’ll try to do more research. I didn’t know for example Use of term hermaphrodite refers to animals only as I have noticed it in other sci-fi novels with similar themes… Thank you
Could you perhaps refer me to some books for laymen in English or authors, perhaps I can find translated versions. Thank you
Thank you for your imput.
That is true, but just getting some feedback here has opened my eyes to the complexity and depth of this issue. For example, I became aware that I can use different neopronouns and also rethink how I will world-build healers. I’ve had this idea in my mind since I was a teenager and I think i still have quite limiting framing of the idea so hearing other people’s thoughts made me rethink and revaluate a lot.
I can change the original post if it is upsetting. I didn’t know it was. This is why I find it very useful to ask these question ang get informed, despite huge anxiety of doing so. Thank you.
No problem.  I hope things work out, your book sounds really interesting and I think I'd enjoy reading it.
Thanks again for taking this so seriously and seeking out our perspectives. It sounds like you are already approaching this from a good angle, and with a healthy amount of self awareness, so I'm pretty optimistic that you will get it right. Best of luck.
Thank you! Will check it out!
When used in a whole group (culture, race, species etc.), ""it"" highlights their otherness and I don't think it works very well if you want to use their situation to comment on the concept of gender real world culture. 

Apart from a group of people who make the conscious decision to have ""it"" apply to them, the pronoun is used for objects, animals and small children, as well as to dehumanise. The way I see the typical use, ""it"" is someone or something that you can't communicate and reason with.

When ""it"" refers to a fictional character, to me it's a sign that its situation just doesn't apply to humans.
Thank you! Could you share which neopronouns you found useful and which sci-fi book they come from? It would be good for me to read other sci-fi books, (I’ve read some, like LeGuin’s) many thanks :)
I see. I was afraid it might have that affect in English. In my native language all objects plants and animals have a gender ascribed to it: female, male, neuter, so ‘it’ doesn’t stand out as only being used for objects as other gender categories are used for objects too… this is why I am unsure what should I do. I might be overthinking this… Thank you for your input. Much valuable and appreciated.
The ones I use are ae/aer, from the novel A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay, but there are many more sets, I suggest [this website](https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/Neopronouns) for a non-exhaustive list.
Oh! My native language is the same. Non-binary people in my country usually use a mix of different grammatical genders or the neuter gender. If you're writing in a language like this, then neuter is pretty much necessary in this case. I was thinking about English and the use of ""it"" instead of ""they"" or neopronouns.
This is so cool! Thanks!
No, I am writing in English, hence the doubt. I think I will go with they, and mention somewhere the linguisitc aspects of the healer’s language. And Having written this post I started to become aware of some of the limiting thinking I still have and will now change a few things.

Be inclusive	Does anyone get annoyed when they here people say he or she, they just forget about us.  I hear it all the time in class and it upsets me. Why cant the world be more inclusive.	"ive never really understood when something written in english says like: Whatever he or she wants. it would be so much easier to just say whatever they want
I'm honestly still really bad about this too. :/ I've been working on trying to decondition myself and my language though. Defaulting to they/them until I'm told otherwise or in a position to ask, using folks instead of guys, etc. It would be nice to see more people at least make an effort.
Yeah that always annoys me. They could just say they or ""those people"" or whatever depending on what they're saying. Such an easy fix for them to do, but a lot of the time the ""Only girls and boys, girls are she and boys are he"" mentality has been taught by birth for a lot of people and some aren't educated about this. which does suck :{
Oh boy does the whole 'he or she' thing piss me off. Like we used to say he, but that wasn't inclusive of women, so now it's he or she. But that's still not really inclusive, and the kicker for me is that it take 3 TIMES the effort to say. They is clean and one syllable, 'he or she' feels like you have to stop your phrase and start again.
> using folks instead of guys

It’s a good excuse to say y’all 😂
Lol, I already said y'all a lot (pretty common in rural northeast) but I catch shade for that, on occasion, so I've tried to limit that too."	qzagd8	NonBinary	11	0.87	2021-11-22 02:09:54
Nonbinary nicknames for siblings?	"Hello! My younger sister is 13 (I’m 18) and has been questioning her gender lately (but still currently identifies as female). I was wondering if anybody has ideas for fond non-gender conforming nicknames for a younger sibling, because I want her to feel as comfortable as possible. 

I used fondly call her “girl” and would like something with similar vibes as this (kind of like “buddy” or “kid”) just more inclusive.

Any ideas are appreciated :) ty all"	"I’m Californian, so I use “dude” as a non-gendered affectionate, but that doesn’t always work for everyone.
I like using ""sib"", because people are used to say ""bro"" and ""sis"" for their brothers and sisters so I wanted to do the same with ""siblings"" :3
I frequently call my little sister ""tiny person"" because she is very young and thus very short, but I realize that that may not neatly fit into your situation. Sometimes I refer to people as ""human being person"", but that is a bit of a mouthful. Some words I can think of that may better suit your scenario(as of yet untested by me) are creature, friend, child or sapling.
Pal?
Kiddo, buckaroo, their name but w a B in the front, lass, yungin, bud, friend, bro, dude, my guy
lot of people saying bro, dude, guy, man,etc...and while I, too, use those to refer to all genders there are a few people I personally know who feel misgendered when those terms are used for them. so just be cognizant and maybe ask specifically if those are chill for her. as for truly non gendered nicknames, I call my sibling buddy & genius (sometimes sarcastically & sometimes genuinely lol)
My siblings and I (blood n’ non-related) always refer to one another as ‘the sibs’ — but I also refer to my friends / family members as silly things like: sprout, creature, bean (human-bean always gets a smile as well), nugget, punk or even just call everyone ‘love’ — whatever feels right for everyone involved!"	opvusa	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-07-23 05:36:35
Hello r/NonBinary, we are 'Lobster & Co' a gender inclusive trans support server, and we would like to invite you to join us.	"For the last 2 months our team has poured themselves into creating a discord server with a heavy support focus, and we are excited to finally be ready to open up.

The idea came to our founder when she just couldn't find a good place to seek peer to peer support. With drama between users and poor suggestions going unchecked she thought ""It's time to change this.""  
She brought on an admin to help her bring her idea to life, that admin found someone to build the discord server based on their needs. The journey started on September 9th, the size of the team doubled slowly as we carefully selected our starting moderation team. Now, 2 months later, we have created something intended to maintain a support focus, put rules in place that will help maintain a mentally healthy environment, and 
hold ourselves and future staff to rules that will lessen bias and favoritism significantly. 

We have a community section for ordinary chit-chat.  
A hobbies and interests section to talk to other users with similar interest  
And a support section with public support and a private support system that involves creating and deleting your own locked chats, both text and voice.

We also have an extensive moderation section with all sorts of rules and logs to help prevent mods from slipping into the position and abusing it on the discord server.

If you find yourself needing peer to peer support and the comfort of a gender inclusive trans community, look no further.  
https://discord.gg/PrVjvSZ  
We are very small at the moment, but hope to grow quickly in the coming weeks.

Mods: We hope a post like this is allowed on your subreddit. Please let us know if we overstepped our boundaries."	"Lobster & Co? Nice try, Jordan Peterson. I'm not falling for that one again.

I kid. This sounds cool.

"Does anyone have an actually good NB-inclusive replacement for greetings like ""Ladies and Gentlemen""?"	"Not much else to add, I'm just curious and I'm tired of finding ones where people just put ""them"" into every word."	"""Welcome, friends.""  
""Fellow \[shared identity\]...""  
""Esteemed guests...""  
""Hi, folks!""  
""Good evening!"" 

Tons of productions already use these without even any conscious intent to be inclusive. Like, Good Morning America has been going since 1975.
""dudes, dudettes, and dudon'ts"" is still my favorite lmao
“Guys, gals and non-binary pals” is nice and informal
“hello everyone” 
“greetings everyone”
""All individuals in attendance""

""sup everyone""

""ladies, gentlemen and non binary folk""

""Greetings humans""

""My fellow intelligent organisms""(not to be used near anti-vaxxers)

""Males, females and neithers""

Hope atleast one of these helps
I’ve heard “distinguished guests” being used at formal gatherings before. Not sure how I personally feel about that though.
Everyone.
Folks.
Y’all.
Fellow humans/Earthlings. 
Theydies and gentlethems. 
Comrades, Friends, Compadres, Crew, Homies. 
Ahoy, Mateys!
At the 1975 Grammy Awards David Bowie addressed the audience as Ladies and Gentlemen and Others.
Ladies, gentlemen and the gender fabulous!
Enbies, ladies, and gentlemen
""Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and friends beyond the binary"" is one of my favs.
I’d love to see Japanese “Minna-san” (kinda like “Respected persons gathered here…”) adopted into English. It’d seem strange at first, but we’ve gotten used to sushi, karaoke, and masks ^^

Which do you think should be the standard?	"I've seen a lot more push for GRSM (Gender, Romantic, Sexuality minorities) in recent years as its easier and is more inclusive. But which would you rather be the go to?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nox3ol)"	"I’d say GRSM is more inclusive, but basically everyone knows LGBTQ+ already so it’s easier
I don't think it will ever change but if I could choose GRSM makes more sense.
I’d say LGBTQ+ because it is (a) more well known and (b) equally as inclusive - that’s what the ‘+’ means
I think the idea of standardizing on something isn't necessarily the right approach? We're a community with a huge range of experiences and a big part of it is letting people figure out for themselves what labels that work for them?
I think LGBTQ+ is more common and doesn’t need and explanation. I haven’t heard of GRSM, but I like the Term SAGA (Sexuality And Gender Alliance) it is in my opinion more inclusive and sounds really nice.
GRSM on paper is better, however it would be a nightmare to rebrand.
Can we all just settle on queer?
I'd say LGBTQ+ is more positive as the term ""Minorities"" in GRSM feels more separative from the rest of the society. It has this ""there's a small, negligible number of people that differ from the rest in terms of gender, romance and sexuality"" vibe.
I'm operating under the assumption that the need for the labels in any capacity will be gone in a generation or two. So in that case it's not worth the effort to try to change it since the people who are already set with one or the other aren't going to want to change their label. And anyone who isn't set on one isn't going to need either.

Maybe I'm just being optimistic.
i say Queer & Trans personally
If enough of us feel that way it can definitely change
Personally I dont feel the + feels as inclusive because it puts more weight on the LGBTQ identities by having them stand alone
I see what you’re saying, but the + does seem kind of like an after thought. So I don’t think they’re quite equally inclusive, but I agree with your (a)
I feel represented by TQ too. This acronym has so much history behind it too, it'll be difficult to shake.
The main reason for GRSM over SAGA is that it includes and promotes people to separate romantic and sexual attraction creating more nuance
There's also been some use of just GRS but I think if it becomes the adopted term discourse will figure it out in due time
I would call it idyllic but in the same sense that moving to a trinary will help us move to a genderless society in a couple generations I see it as a decentralizing step to that elimination but I could just as easily agree that it wouldn't be necessary for that step 🤷🏼‍♀️"	nox3ol	NonBinary	13	1.0	2021-05-31 06:54:36
Using they/them pronouns in a professional setting?	"I recently got a job at a company that goes out of their way to be inclusive. They encourage people to put their pronouns in their zoom names, email signatures, and the anti-harassment training videos have people that use they/them pronouns. 

So naturally I introduce myself with mine, have them in my zoom name and on my email, and of course refer to myself with them. 

And I still get misgendered. I know I need to speak up more about it but I'm also kind of a pushover and not sure how to stand up for myself as the new person without getting either ostrisied or getting someone else in trouble or having it turned into A Thing. I don't want to become someone who's constantly talking about my gender but I do want people to... Use my pronouns. 

Any advice for how to firmly and professionally say ""hey I use they/them pronouns actually"" without it turning into a discussion about my gender or an argument or an HR issue?"	"You just said it in the last part. ""Hey, I use they/ them pronouns."" Don't even apolopgize with a, ""Hey,, sorry, but..."" 

It feels weird to tell people only bc it's not a norm in our society to share them since they're assumed in most cases. It's only a big deal if you or they make it a big deal. If they respond in a shitty way, *then* escalate. Just keep in mind, the more you do correct ppl, the easier it becomes. Correcting pronouns is a muscle we need to work out so it gets stronger. 

Also, don't rely on email or zoom. No one reads. I've had mine in my email signature for about a month and people I've emailed have still misgendered me. 🙄 progress is generally fairly slow. Doesn't mean it won't happen.
It has taken me a long time (like half a year) to get people to use them. I put them in my zoom background, I wear pins, I talk about lgbtq issues, and when I feel very empowered I correct people.
[deleted]
You mentioned zoom, maybe you could put it into the chat, that way nobody feels attacked
For email, can you make your signature totally un-gendered?

I had they/them in bold on mine for a while but my first name is gendered, so I'd often get people using the wrong pronouns as well as not using the gender neutral nickname I sign off with. To fix that, my email sig is just my first initial dot lastname and professional titles with they them still in bold underneath. There's literally no way to tell my AGAB and its improved my email experiences massively!

If that's an option for you I'd highly recommend it as an easier win than correcting people which can be a bit more intimidating.
Yeah people don't read it's tragic cuz I was hoping that would be enough and I wouldn't *have* to go to actually talking about it lol.
A) Good for you! I'm not yet brave enough to explore the pronoun thing.

B) You're like my Reddit avatar soul mate!
Giving them the benefit of the doubt is a good point that's hard for me because I'm in The South and it's kind of a defense mechanism for me to assume the worst in people but I need to remind myself like there's LGBT people everywhere and allies everywhere. 

We do have team meetings every week so next time I'll talk about it there 😁
My name is already gender neutral so it's more people who See me like my team and anyone I zoom with
Yup. Same. But then then misgendering happens in an EMAIL REPLY and I wanna punch the sender in the throat. 🙄🙄"	qymgoh	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-11-21 03:54:05
Healthcare question for non-binary patients	"Hey all, I have a question regarding healthcare and non-binary patients. To be clear, I'm a first year medical student, and I have started collecting patient histories in different clinics affiliated with my school.

Now, when a patient comes to a clinic for the first time, it's standard procedure to ask that patient a number of questions (e.g., what's your diet like? Do you feel safe in your neighborhood? Do you text and drive?). 

Eventually, we arrive at the sexual history of the patient. As medical students, we are taught to ask the following:

Have you been sexually active within the last year? If so, with men, women, or both?

My question is, might there be a better way to ask this question (men, women, or both?)? This is how we are taught to ask the question; however, I was wondering if there might be a more inclusive way to ask. 

I do apologize if this at all seems like a strange or intrusive question. I'd simply like to provide the best medical care I can for anyone who walks into my clinic doors someday. Moreover, I'd like to be the best person I can be! So if anyone has any comments regarding my question, I would appreciate it! I'd also love to know how healthcare in general might be better oriented for the treatment of non-binary folks, and how providers can better meet their needs! Thank you 😊"	"At planned parenthood, they ask 'do you have sex with partners with vaginas, penises, or both', which I think works pretty well and communicates all the actually relevant information. Like, I only sleep with men / male-aligned folks, so I'd answer your version with 'just men', but some of the guys I sleep with are trans, so I have engaged in activity with a partner with a vagina, which is medically relevant.
I think the key to rewording that question has to do with why it's being asked in the first place. I assume it's because certain demographics can have a higher overall risk for certain STIs and that kind of thing? 

I suppose you could reword it to ""what gender(s) have your sexual partners been?"" or something that's more open ended like that.
When I'm asked those questions, I re-frame my answers very pointedly.

""I have only had sex with folks with penises lately, but I have had sex with people with vaginas in the past. The people I currently have sex with are bisexual and polyamorous, and we are all tested regularly.""
I suggest asking if the patient is sexuality active, and if so, in what ways. Like, ask which parts they penetrate with or are penetrated in and whether it is by toys or parts of others, and which acts they use protection for. That should be sufficient to determine what tests etc should be considered. You can tell the patient it's to determine how often and which STI tests they should have.

Because someone's gender doesn't define the anatomy they have/use, it doesn't really make sense to ask about the gender of sexual partners.
From a pure data standpoint I see where you're coming from, but I know if I had a medical professional asking super explicit questions about exactly HOW I have sex during an otherwise routine appointment I would be super creeped out and might leave right then and there. Like even my gyno never asks questions like that when sexual history comes up.
If the question comes with an explanation of what the response is used for it's better than assuming activity based on gender.

It's the policy my Dr takes, but he's also queer so maybe that's what makes it more comfortable?"	ej2u4s	NonBinary	10	0.87	2020-01-02 19:26:08
I'm starting to make a community app. Care to help me?	"So I'm making an app for my grad class, and the LGBT+ community is what I wanted to focus on. I want this app to encourage self-discovery and promote safety and community. I'm pan and nonbinary, so I can be ""straight passing,"" if that's a thing. I guess sometimes I just feel really removed from things, and I know I'm not the only one, and I know a ton of people have much more dire situations than I do. There's a lot of nuance that's frequently overlooked, even within a community which aims to be progressive and inclusive.

I'm just beginning to gather demographic information, and if you could complete [this survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BKZBWWP), that would be a huge help!

Being inclusive to NB participants as a camp organiser	"Hi all! I tried looking for a similar question being asked before but couldn't find it so excuse me if this is something that's already been answered. 

For context, I'm currently organising an online youth camp (on discord) in my country which will happen next week around the theme of identity. We're mostly focusing on ethnic identity (basically how our understanding and society's understanding of ethnicity leads to racism), but of course, we're opening discourse on other parts of identity including gender identity. The kids (15-16 y/o) needed to send a short essay to apply for our camp, which we reviewed to let them in. The goal is to have kids from many backgrounds so we can expose them to new perspectives than what they, but that also means quite a few of them aren't as exposed to the LGBTQ+ related concepts, including gender and all its forms of expressions. Another important piece of information is my country is very heavily anti-LGBT, so for many of these kids, this is either one of their first safe spaces to express themselves or one of the first spaces for them to meet queer teens. 

On to the actual question, we have 2 kids who stated their pronoun as other, so I'm assuming they're non-binary (one goes by she/they pronouns, the other goes by every pronoun).

 I'm keen on ensuring this is a safe space where they feel their identity is respected, so I'd love tips on how to do that, as this is my first time working with genderqueer youth. I've already created pronoun roles in the server, and am planning to norm introducing ourselves with our pronouns. I'll also keep an eye out to ensure the other participants don't misgender/disrespect the two I'm talking about.

Something I'm especially struggling with are ""dorm"" sessions. We noticed that during in person camps, most students tend to feel comfortable in sharing some things with other members of their gender. We wanted to emulate this in an online setting, and I wanted to ask the two NB participants which group they wanted to join, if any, but I'm unsure on how I could go about this question in a sensitive manner.

Sorry this post is quite long, I tend to ramble when I write. Also, please correct me if I made any mistakes in how to handle/refer to these participants, as I'm still trying to educate myself!"	"Neopronouns are important to adress.
Maybe have a timeout thing ready? Just in case a kid goes ham with slurs and such. 
The basics of:
Gender is a spectrum,
Clothes don't have a gender,
Gender expression isn't gender identity,
Don't come out unless you're safe,
Take it slow,
Don't force labels onto yourself,
New names are cool, but you don't have to.

I hope that helps. Ask if anything is unclear.
The setting you describe might be Dangerous for the nonbinary youth. I think you will have to include Sessions on gender at the beginning. You must Help the Other Kids to understand IT and you must be ready to kick someone Out who acts harmfull. Speak with the nonbinary youth about what they want and offer them that you explain everything to the Others beginning with gender, gender Identity and gender Expression.
Be supportive of all the kids. You also need to make sure you have clear rules, definition and examples of appropriate and inappropriate behavior as well as clear punishments. The most important thing is to show that everyone there is a person no matter how impersonal it feels. Explain that everyone is different and affected by things differently and encourage empathetic and sympathetic behaviors. 

Your camp sounds like its gonna be a really good experience for kids to have. Good job and good luck.
The Transgender Training Institute has lots of educational material on creating trans-inclusive youth spaces, highly recommend you look on their website for info. They also do training sessions for specifically this kind of issue.
Timeout is a good idea! I'll also keep these basics in mind, thank you!
Yes, that sounds quite similar to what we're planning already. We've made it clear on our community agreements that we do not tolerate intolerance, and will have our entire first day on that. So that's very encouraging to hear we're on the right track!"	kov699	NonBinary	10	0.92	2021-01-02 10:12:03
Any/All Pronouns in the Workplace	"I've recently started work at a very inclusive company that asks for pronouns to be declared internally. **The form includes neopronouns AND allows custom pronouns, so I could write in ""any/all"".** There is a big focus on networking and building social connections within the company and subsidiaries (which is legitimate, given the nature of the business). I previously IDed as binary trans, but I have identified as genderfluid for the past year. Now, I prefer any/all pronouns, with people intuitively using what feels right (to them) based on how I'm presenting, or just...vibes, I guess? I don't mind ""they/them"" at all, but it's not something I actively ever choose to use, generally preferring ""she"" or ""he"".

Obviously, that's hard to convey, and I was curious to if anyone has any experience with using any/all pronouns in a work or academic setting, and if not, how did you choose what pronouns to use?

If you were in my situation, what might you put?"	"I don't have experience with this personally, but I work with someone who lists any/all as their pronouns. Speaking purely from observational experience, he tends to get ""she/her""ed more often than not based purely on name and presentation. 

People are creatures of habit and so even in an accepting and well-meaning workplace, many may pick one set of pronouns to use regardless of your presentation on a given day. Not saying don't go for it (live your truth!) but just food for thought if that's not something you're comfortable with.
For sure! I kind of describe it the same way; as long as it's with respect and not in a demeaning or mocking nature, I don't mind whatever pronoun comes to you in the moment. I never really vibed with they, he, or she 100% to be honest, so I just kind of let people fill in the blank however they like.

My co-workers usually use they/them for me, but every now and then they use my agab and immediately apologize, to which I tell them it's okay! They don't have to, I don't mind any pronouns, and that includes my agab!
Yeah that lines up with my experience as someone who uses any pronouns, I mostly just get the she/they use. Which isn't necessarily bad and I don't really care, but it probably wouldn't be ideal if you'd expect someone to switch pronouns that they use when you present differently."	11nuq52	NonBinary	10	0.92	2023-03-10 17:08:13
Does anyone else get annoyed when people try to be inclusive and fail miserably?	"I'm participating in a hackathon and it's for ""female and femme non-binary"" people. An like, I get they were trying to be inclusive, but it kinda feels like they're just considering non-binary as binary with a different name? and they've got it everywhere, too, and it just really annoys me every time I see it. It's honestly really invalidating and I almost wish they just hadn't tried and just said ""for women in tech"" like I know they're really trying to say."	"I've got so many thoughts, feelings and questions about the construction, meaning and intention of the phrasing ""female and femme non-binary"", that I honestly don't know where to start.
I try not to get annoyed because I don’t want to hold people who are trying to higher standards then the people who aren’t trying
Yeah, and also not all women are femme anyway. 
[deleted]
I’m seeing more of this framing. Reminds me of the aughts when all the “women’s spaces” at colleges were being turned into “info centers” or “resource centers.” Seems like we are going back the other way, women are always going to bear the brunt of patriarchal repression and when they self-organize they tend to reserve their resources for people that share that bullseye on their back. 

Does suck for the genuinely non-binary, goes to a coercive place where Nonbinary people have to wear a costume to fit in with the feminists because genuine, unremarkable androgyny gets read as intrusive maleness. The jester can roam the castle freely only so long as they wear a cap announcing them a fool. 

There’s enough prevalent male oppression that I think it’s the responsibility of male spaces to address coercive assumptions “more than” these kind of pop-up female spaces. 

I think though that it does a disservice to both non-binary and to the egalitarian post-MichFest consciousness to have non-binary people be forced to present femme before they have anywhere to hang. 
Wow, I just found this sub and was just talking to my partner about this a couple nights ago. 

I really don't like ""women AND non binary people"" as the label for things that are basically like... Not For Men? I guess it's a focus on inclusion, rather than exclusion by just saying ""non-men"". I'd prefer ""non-men"" because to me that's inclusive of all men all around, but is broader (better to me) to include overall ""gender minorities"". 

I am in the audio engineering industry and I am Non-Binary, and I work with a non-profit that consistently says ""women and Non-Binary people"" and I'm always like :// don't group me in with women please, because we are all ""gender minorities"", but nb folks aren't all AFAB. 
Those horny tech bros just want to seem progressive while hiding their obvious agenda
Not really, it’s privately organized by some company and they pride themselves on this being the largest event of its kind. I’ll just have to suck it up but it still sucks. 
This makes me so uncomfortable. One of the ways to majorly trigger my dysphoria is putting me in a group with women. I might have been AFAB, but I'm not a woman! Why is this so hard to understand?

Seeing erasure and not speaking up	"I’m working on a paid project with my lecturer and some seniors and classmates and all the text in the product referring to a third party says “he/ she”. Even the one that said “they” got changed into “he/ she” after the feedback. 

I personally like to be referred to with gender neutral pronouns (not that anyone ever uses them for me 🥲), so this made me a little upset but I don’t feel like speaking up because I’m just a student and I feel like it’s not my place to interfere especially since I’m only working on a tiny part of the project and getting paid for it. 

At the same time it hurts to see someone I respect and look up to put a big red slash across “they” and edit it to “he/ she”. But then again I live in a “conservative” country and not many people are aware of and support queer people and even less of nonbinary people, so it’s probably not intentional erasure. Which also means if I do speak up I also have to do the explaining and out myself in the process, and the mere thought of it is terrifying.

I just feel shitty and I feel like I’m letting down the community and my own identity by choosing to stay silent when there are others fighting for equality. I feel bad just thinking about a potential user using the product and having to see the lack of inclusivity. Maybe I’m overreacting, I don’t know."	"Perhaps you could point out that basically every ""authority"" on English says you should use they over he/she:

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.
You can maybe let them know in an email once you’re done with your part of the project, so it’s less pressure

Living for the inclusivity		"Definitely would change the 'Preferred pronouns' to pronouns. 


Unless they were using preferred in the accurate sense of someone who uses multiple pronouns or goes by no pronouns (with other options) having a pefered set(s) or a current pronoun preference.


There should be a pronoun section and a separate section after that, where one could put their preferred set(s) and their current pronoun preference.


And although it's great that there's 'They / Them' in the pronoun section– That's.. just still three pronouns out of the millions out there, and it is still restrictive in options, even if it is only slightly better.


There should be neopronouns / nounself pronouns there, no pronoun option, 'He / They' or 'They / He' options, 'She / They' or 'They / She' options, any pronouns, all pronouns, most pronouns, and a custom section to put one's pronouns down if they're  not already listed on the sheet.


Also, for the agab / sex section, there's no intersex option. Or even a CAFAB and CAMAB options.


Inclusive but definitely needs alot more work in its areas. /gen /nm"	12i1w4t	NonBinary	10	0.86	2023-04-11 00:17:13
Best ways to implement/improve gender-inclusive language?	I used to assume people's gender all the time, but for anyone who looked androgynous, I would use they/them pronouns. After a while of this I realized if I saw someone looking like myself (a pre-everything trans girl), I would assume they were male. Since then, I've been using they/them pronouns for anyone I don't know, with increasing success. I sometimes feel like that's not enough. Is there anything else I can do to improve my gender-inclusivity?	"So I just want to say I really appreciate you using they/them as a default.
Avoiding unnecessarily gendering stuff can go beyond pronouns. Things like ""ladies and gentlemen"" or ""girls and boys"" also aren't great and are generally avoidable.
Guys, dudes, and other bronouns also bother ablot of trans femme people, so it's not terrible to avoid those for people you don't know.

Providing pronouns when you introduce yourself (or doing stuff like putting then in email signatures) also helps normalize that and get people to not assume pronouns.
Right! I forgot about audience addresses. That was actually my first introduction to non-binary people being a thing (fuck the Canadian sex-ed curriculum). A stage manager for a show I was in once would address everyone as ""ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary folks""
>Providing pronouns when you introduce yourself (or doing stuff like putting then in email signatures) also helps normalize that and get people to not assume pronouns.

We actually do that in the trans group I'm in! Sometime in the future when trans and NB people are more commonly accepted it might even be expected to provide pronouns along with your name when meeting new people.
> A stage manager for a show I was in once would address everyone as ""ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary folks""

My favorite version of this is ""Guys, gals, and non-binary pals"".
When I busk I take on this carnival barker persona and found I was saying “ladies and gentlemen” to address the crowd. I started saying “ladies, gentlemen, and everyone beyond and between.”
Oh my gosh, this is wonderful. It even includes the ""boys and girls"" aspect that announcers would sometimes feel inclusive enough to include.

(I'm now inclusively including more forms of inclu* words with the ones already included with the hope that my inclusion would maximize inclu* inclusivity.)

(Edit: Just noticed that I failed to include ""include"".)"	8lxuld	NonBinary	11	0.93	2018-05-25 01:08:49
I can't remember the last time I was scared like this...	"I'm not scared of anything. I've been rocking a mohwak for about 20 years I've always worn whatever I want (before the egg cracked) and I've had no trouble with a little make-up every now and again. Right now I'm sitting in my brother's house all dressed up but unable to walk out the door. I'm probably looking the most obviously not cis I've ever looked and I feel great but too scared to go out in the most  inclusive city in my country. The brother is away so I'm by myself.

I have to do it right? Fear isn't punk rock! Yeah, fuck it. This is happening. Hoo golly. Wish me luck!"	"You’ll rock this! 🤘🏻
it's actually so cool to hear this I got into punk around the same time I came out and it's been so gender affirming to me. it's always hard coming out. up the trans punks!! you got this!!
I went for it and it was all good! I was only out for a little bit because something popped up and I had to rush back. I went to a bar and had a beer and listened to the band for a bit. No one said anything but I got a few friendly smiles!
I think being a punk has actually kept me fairly safe as well. I might be wearing a dress but it's probably pretty obvious that you don't mess with someone who is 6"", tattooed with a massive mohawk.

It was really nice actually. I got some new shoes and was wearing my favourite dress and I'd just had my nails done. I popped on the headphones and just went for it! I was only out for about half an hour but no one said anything bad and I got a few friendly smiles! I felt quite pretty and more confident than I have in years!
That’s good to hear, well done! :3
I love this. Great to hear you held you head even higher and rocked that hair.
Thanks 😁
Ah, geez. I'll feel like I've made a liar of myself if I don't admit it but the mohawk wasn't actually up yesterday. A couple of weeks ago I worked a late shift into an early shift which turned into a double so I worked 24 hours in 32 hours and was basically awake for 40 hours, at which point I decided to trim the sides. Resultantly my hair is too thin at the back and won't stand up under its own weight. I'm growing it back out but in the meantime I'm playing with some different looks. It's kinda fun actually and gives me the excuse to experiment with some more feminine looks.

My head was definitely held high though! I'm going to have to do it more often!"	yzw4s8	NonBinary	12	1.0	2022-11-20 05:29:34
Engaged Enbies, what would you like to see in a gender-neutral engagement box?	"I want to start an Enby-friendly engagement box similar to “Miss to Mrs.” They usually include things like bachelorette party sashes, sleep masks etc but it all says things like “Bride”, “Mrs.” “Bridesmaid” etc and even the non-Bride ones are just Groom versions that are just as gendered. I can’t seem to find any that don’t have extremely gendered language and designs. 

Are there any products/language/designs that would be more inclusive that people would like? I’d also like to make it inclusive to couples of many different orientations (Mx./Mr.)(Mrs./Mx.)(Mx./Mx.) with customizable options. Ideally, I’d like to offer more customized options in the future if this became popular."	"We do need a neutral term for Bride and Groom. Sorry that's all, good luck, this is a great idea!
The sash could just say ""getting married!"" That would be cute, I think.

It's definitely hard to do a gender neutral Mr/Mx whatever. I have two thoughts... First, you can obviously do like Mr/Mx on the pillow or whatever the person uses. Second, I don't think you can do Mx to Mx as an alternative to Miss to Mrs BECAUSE the whole entire point of Miss/Mrs is that women were traditionally losing their family/family name and taking their husband's family/name. And I really don't think there is a gender neutral version of that. The whole thing is you're not taking ownership, you're both equal people. So for me, personally, a ""Mx to Mx"" pillow would call to mind all that yucky stuff without being a good replacement, but I would probably love a ""Mr and Mx"" coffee mug.

Good luck!!!
What about customizable ones? Maybe that the buyer could assign their own honorifics and perhaps petnames to? Really I feel like having a set like that could lead to a much more romantic or at least cute situation, rather than the mass printed ones.

I was actually looking for something like this a few days ago, so it really caught my eye lol.
I definitely agree, and thank you! I’ve heard things like “broom” and “bridegroom” and even “nearly-weds”. None of them entirely feel right to me personally tho.
No me neither."	owgt1h	NonBinary	11	1.0	2021-08-02 15:26:01

LGBTQ+ Relationships and the Pandemic (Queer researcher)	"[Take the survey here.](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eRoDKVsXA15cgXI)

Hi, I'm a student at the University of Michigan, and I've noticed that LGBTQ+ voices often go unheard in sociological research. Unfortunately, what little research there is centers around cisgender lesbians and gay men, and isn't inclusive of other sexual or gender identities. I think it's important that non-binary voices are heard amongst this research. As a fellow queer person, I want to make sure that your voices are heard. I've designed a short survey (3 minutes max) to assess LGBTQ+ relationships in light of the pandemic. Thank you!"	"Would it be beneficial if someone who has never been in any kind of physical or romantic relationship before responded? I can send the survey around my friend groups, but I don't want to send it to everyone if that's the case.
Wait.. So is this survay only for people who are not in a relationship? It seems to be only about dating..?
Hi! Thank you so much for asking. Unfortunately, since I’m trying to assess casual sex/dating and serious dating, I’m not sure if people with those experiences would be applicable. Thank you so much for sharing this survey with your friends - it’s so important that our voices are heard in research and it’s much appreciated.
People who are in a relationship are welcome to and should take the survey! They would simply select “serious dating” to indicate that they are in a relationship currently. It is also for anyone who might be casually dating or having casual sex, both before and during the pandemic.
Done
Thank you for taking it! It’s very helpful."	mcv0lg	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-03-25 10:22:23
I'm opening a sex store!	"Hi there! I am a cis straight woman and am opening a ""femme-centric"" sex boutique. The goal is to make a store that makes all people feel included and safe and welcome because in general, womxn don't feel comfortable going into big sex stores since they are more centered around male pleasure and the male gaze. I also don't want the phrase ""femme-centric"" to be exclusive to NB folx so if you have a suggestion for a better term- I'm all ears! 

We want to ensure we are carrying the right products for all, and phrasing our site and marketing etc in the most inclusive way possible. Although I don't want to put the burden of educating me on those who are already marginalized- if you feel like sharing things you would want in a highly curated sex store (non-toxic, eco-friendly, not skeezy packaging), we would be greatly appreciative. I have gay moms so I feel like I have a decent handle on lesbian products and needs, but I want to make sure we don't unintentionally not serve or even do a disservice to the NB folks.

All related comments/ critiques/ suggestions/ resources welcome!"	"I think femme-centric can exclude transmasculine folks and people who's genders don't align with either masculine or feminine traits. Perhaps simply advertising as a sex store for people of all genders, and doing your part to educate the cis men who will inevitably show up will be enough? Or go with ""a sex shop NOT geared towards cis men.""

Otherwise, I'd really love to see a sex store NOT sell the cheapo made in China toys that are porous and made of dangerous materials. At all. 
I am not a ""femme"" or particularly feminine in appearance, and would generally feel unwelcome in a store that sees my masculinity as something negative (as would, I suspect, many other nonbinary people, butch lesbians, trans men, etc.) I sometimes pass as a cis dude now, and I avoid spaces that are explicitly ""femme-centric"" or ones that subtly exclude cis men, because I feel like I don't belong or that I'd need to out myself to not be seen as a predatory intruder.

In addition to having a safe space socially, I also want to see more emphasis on safe toys in sex stores. A shop I like and recommend looking into is [Smitten Kitten.](https://www.smittenkittenonline.com/) They've got a friendly, inclusive environment and a strong focus on body-safe toys and lubricants, so I don't have to spend half my time searching for ingredient lists or the material composition when I'm browsing.
Maybe you could also use language like ""femmes of all bodies"" or ""femmes of all genders"" (though ""all genders"" leaves out agender and gender-free people)?
[deleted]
Vixen Creations make some great toys, all silicone. (packaging is inoffensive ""dick in a clear tube"" style)

njoy make some really great metal toys, also really classy packaging
Recently a friend told me about ""WTF"" (women trans femme) events that were somewhat common in their home town, usually for bike maintenance, gyms, maker spaces... I love the term (even though it doesn't explicitly embrace NB) since it de-centers cis-men without mentioning them. If you wanted to use it, you could say ""women trans* femme"" and make it clear that * includes NB, transmasc, butch, genderqueer, agender...
Great feedback- thank you! I think you are right that the wording would feel exclusive to those folks and that's absolutely not what we want. And as for the cheapo toys- that's totally what we are trying to avoid! We will have a price variety for sure, but we are being super selective about body-safe, eco friendly toys and accessories! 
[deleted]
I hear you and that totally makes sense you would avoid those spaces. I'm definitely going to rework this so it reads more inclusively because we are definitely catering to all. I'll check out Smitten Kitten too. We will only be carrying things you don't have to worry about searching the ingredients of- so I will do research on what they are carrying. We won't be online to start, but if you are in the Denver area come check us out come August!
That's also a good point.... I've been seeing ""all genders"" used a lot lately so I'll be cognizant of that as well too. Thanks! 
Love Babeland! I used to live in Seattle and they are part of the inspiration for this store. If you are in Denver, come check us out once we're open in August!
Great! Another thought I just had was offering workshops or classes on various subjects. There's a TON of topics you could cover from safe space trainings to BDSM theory to gender theory to more hands on things like massage, bondage, impact play, cross dressing/makeup. If you can dream it, someone can teach it!
I really like that suggestion! I was just checking out She Bop's website (they are in Portland) and they phrase it: 

""She Bop is female-friendly, not female-only. She Bop was created for a diverse community with an emerging personal and social awareness of healthy sexuality as an important component to everyday life. This includes all varieties of personal identifiers such as gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, marital status – whoever you are, as long as you are over 18, you are welcome in our store!"" 

It's a little wordy but I think they get the point across well.  "	8seooq	NonBinary	10	1.0	2018-06-20 02:24:05
Pronoun question	"Would it be disrespectful to NB people if I myself decided to identify as He/They.

My current pronouns are He/Him and I am cis presenting.

I despise the current gender norms and proudly support all walks of life to live their authentic selves. 

I wouldn’t say that I myself am NB however I would be more than happy to be referred to as They / Them with the idea that we are moving forward into an age where the current gender norms really don’t need to exist.

I want to be as inclusive as possible in my day to day life. 

Any opinions or feedback would be much appreciated :)"	"anyone if any gender can use any pronouns
I myself don't find it disrespectful at all, if you don't completely identify as a male, but don't like to use non-binary as a label, that's fine
You can use whatever pronouns you like, don't worry! Halsey started using she/they and it's all ok
I think anyone can use whatever pronouns they feel the most comfortable with. You don't have to be NB(or not cis) to feel more comfortable with they/them (or any other pronouns)  
Just use what pronouns you feel like thy for the most :)
It is fairly common for men to use they/them to get away from toxic masculinity and gender norms.  And, of course, any person of any gender can use any pronouns.  I do not feel offended at all."	mh7iah	NonBinary	9	0.86	2021-03-31 14:38:26

Professional/business casual clothing?	So basically I'm getting my degree right now, and in a few years I'll be graduating and looking for work in my profession. Seeing as I'm AMAB and starting to lean more femme (see my recent post with my new leggings), I'm looking for ideas for what to wear for interviews and general work. One of the professional associations I'll have to be certified with [has a LGBTQ division](https://www.planning.org/divisions/lgbtq/) (who, like a genius, I'm just now realizing I haven't made an account with), so I'm not too concerned about inclusivity in the field. I'm just concerned about what works and what looks and feels good.	"Ok omg yes business casual is so fucking transphobic. I’ve had so much trouble with it at work bc I’m concealing my breasts :( 

Button ups! Chinos are great pants! I love to look at Depop for thrifted blouses or button ups. I think mules, loafers, and oxfords are all great styles of shoes too.
H&M has cute form-fitting blazers in the women's section that I think look great. That's my go-to.
My problem is I'm a small person so literally all button ups I've ever tried on hang off me, most shirts that aren't well fitted do.
Looking at them online, they look really nice. I'll have to check them out next time I go to H&M :)

advice on name/pronouns change at work?	hi all! im going to start letting people know about my name/pronoun change and i was curious if anyone could share their experiences with me. i'm really only worried about my work colleagues, and not even my immediate team but people i interact with regularly at other offices. my office is inclusive but i interact with corporate lawyers and finance professionals who have exhibited some pretty closed-minded and disrespectful behavior. when you changed your name/pronouns, what happened? how did it go?	"I told my boss and requested time to speak at the weekly meeting. At the meeting I announced that I am nonbinary and explained what that meant, and requested they/them pronouns and explained them too. There was a lot of confusion and some folks truly didn't understand how to use they/them pronouns but they tried. Most people were genuinely supportive and tried their best. Some folks were intolerant and that was difficult. If I had to do it over again, I think I'd send an email instead of doing an in-person announcement. That way I could include some resources and folks would have a chance to have their first reaction in private instead of losing face being confused in public. Whatever you decide to do, I hope it goes great and your colleagues are supportive and cool!
I also announced at a staff meeting and requested use of they/them pronouns with similar results. Some people were super supportive and others were not. Luckily I work for an institution that has LGBTQIA+ and other diversity training courses. I moved jobs recently (after coming out at the first one) and my boss here was kind enough to bring in the trainers for the whole office before I arrived. Even with that though it's still the same here . Some people are ok with it, some are not, no one is mean or bullying or anything though. Mostly the hardest thing is sticking up for myself and correcting people when it's necessary.
thank you! that's good advice. :-)"	elvo22	NonBinary	10	0.92	2020-01-08 17:18:54
Changed my name legally, now trying to change my username at work so I don’t have to sign in with deadname anymore. Kyle is just doing their job, but does anyone have any suggestions on where to go from here? I was thinking of reaching out to my the dept. of Diversity and Inclusion.		"If your name is legally changed, they have to use your legal name. Ask if they can create a new account for you.
I would go up the chain of hierarchy. I'm surprised the system doesn't allow for change in last name, or is that their rule? are you unionized? I'd talk to management, and if they don't do anything, then I'd go to HR, then if unionized, file a grievance with the union.
Is the offered change still your deadname? And have you contacted HR to inform them of the change in name so they can update all the paperwork, etc? Some companies won’t let the username be updated without updating the entire system.
We sort of have this at work? Like we have a username that is first letter of first name, middle initial, and some portion of last name and some people have a number if their name is a popular combo like Elizabeth Marie smith or whatever. But we have aliases in the system. So like I use my username to login but no one emails me at that username@xxx.edu. They email my.alias@xxx.edu. And that works for me. So my username is the same but the alias is all that people see and it’s what is listed at the top of my inbox. I only have to use the username to login to our online systems or like to setup access for someone else to my stuff or something like that. Anyone should be able to do that for you!
I think it’s a good idea to reach out to diversity and inclusion. I had an issue with my legal name (which is my dead name) being on my school account. IT people said they couldn’t help me, but I spoke to an advisor, DEI, and finally the dean of my college who cleared it to be changed to my chosen name. 

I also had trouble with a professional organization forcing me to choose a title when I set up an account. The only neutral option was “Dr.” which I am not. After being very assertive with customer service, they were able to get my account set up with no associated title. 

Keep going up the chain of command link by link and bug people until someone can give you a solution.
[Update](https://imgur.com/a/OIdbZvB) here after I reached out to the dept of D&I! It looks like I may be able to get this changed! 💛
I will say, even at major corporations systems like this are often partially to completely homebrew and extremely user unfriendly train wrecks, usually originateing with one person that no longer works there.
That’s an idea… my concern with that idea is that I work in healthcare, so idk what that would do to my history as far as being about see my previous emails and such.
I have reached out to my Diversity and Inclusion department to see if they can help. I sure can’t have been the only person to run into this issue.
So, I can change my name associated with the SSO username, but not the username itself. I knew that was a thing because I changed my last name in 2020 when I got married, but I figured they’d have at least some sort of rule exception for trans/enby people, but here we are.
Yes, the offered change would be reverting back to a student pawprint I had 10 years ago.

Everything is updated with HR.
We have a similar system. When people email me, they can use either deadnameSSO@system.edu or my vanity account that I set up, newname@health.state.edu.

But I have to use either “deadnameSSO” or deadnameSSO@system.edu to get onto a desktop, get info my email, get into my chat, etc. Depending on the computer I’m using, I may have to sign into every app, or only a couple of apps if it is using a VPN set up.
It's confusing that they don't have the ability to update last names... last names change all the time? So, no one who gets married can change their name? 

This sounds like a problem beyond you! Definitely reach out to someone higher.
oh I see. that's annoying. hopefully they have a person in the backend who can change this in the database.
You can change the name associated with the username. I got married in 2020, but I’ve still had to use my unmarried name’s username despite that because of this rule.

I just assumed it may be different for a trans/enby employee transitioning.

Inclusive Hair Spaces	"Hi pals! (El she/they) I’ve made an inclusive hair business in Meanjin, Brisbane Australia. @yokeinclusivehair on Insta. 

I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of questions/threads about hair.

Here’s a thread for us to ask questions and share spaces. 🏳️‍🌈🤌

 I’m Autistic, ADHD, bi and slowly coming out enby. I’ve been a hairdresser/barber for all up 17 years. (Flip!?!?) so I can fully appreciate the needs and concerns of both sides!!! (Basically I can also see where the industry needs to be burnt down and restarted) 

AMA- I’m intermittent on reddit, but ask me anything and I’ll try to get back to you. No promises. Spicy brain. I might forget I made this post for 6 months. 

I want us to have a running list of salons/spaces that support us! Post below any places that have been vetted by our community in your location! 

I know how hard it is for people to understand us, firstly, then try and understand our needs, when we don’t know our hair needs. I’m personally a barber and a hairdresser so for me that would be something that I would look for in a stylist. 

I’ll go first:

They’ve been so overwhelmed that they shut down business registrations until October this year, I missed by the 3rd and they’re opening up business registrations again in Jan. 

I seem be getting lots of people from reddit anyway so until everyone can get registered on #stransfortrans we gotta do what we gotta do!!"	zer80p	NonBinary	10	1.0	2022-12-07 03:49:59
I have a question about the concept of non-binarity	"Hello there!

I have a question for the enby community, in order to learn more about you.

For the record, I am bi (not important, but it is said). I find that the separation of genders in our society (for instance the taboo over gendered clothes, the fact that men must behave this way, women this way, the pink tax, etc) are, to be polite, a lump of turd.

I'd like the society to be more inclusive, so people would be able to behave as they like and dress as they want.

Myself, I decided (a few months ago) to dress and behave like I want. I'm AMAB and feel confortable in skirt and light tops, so I wear them whenever I feel like. I wear more men-gendered clothes when I need to be practical (at work for instance).

I don't feel the need to have a label (I decided to not care about labels and be me -- and I won't judge people who want labels), but just out of interest, do you feel like the ideal society I picture is a non-binary point of view? If not, how would you label it?

Thanks for your time."	"I am very new to all of it and thinking kinda the same like you do. I try to be myself and do what I feel in the moment, tho that is sometimes confusing in regards to questioning if I am still valid when i am comfortable with my AMAB body.

I think what you're talking about, most Nonbinary people also want. But you're talking about freedom of gender expression: in which people of any gender can look like anything without it being weird. No gender roles.

I wouldn't call this a non binary point of view because I don't think that's a thing. We're not an ideology. We're just a group of people who's actual genders (not necessarily related to our expression) don't fit the man/woman dichotomy. I'm not Nonbinary because I hate gender roles (although I do hate gender roles) I'm Nonbinary because I'm not a man or a woman
For me being non binary is about being myself, and I feel that the male/female dichotomy restricts me from that, trying to push me into a box I simply don't fit in. That sounds similar to what you describe. If you don't feel comfortable using that label though that is completely up to you, but it sounds like you are at the very least gender non-conforming.

Hope this is helpful.
If my speech is somewhat improper, please notify me and I will edit that
That's lines up with my personal idea of non-binary. Atleast for me, I dont like being restricted and especially dont like being lumped in with any gender as I dont fully feel like either. I feel like myself, and I dont concern myself with that people think I should be. I wish more people could feel like themselves and wear/do what they want. So in my ideal society everyone would care less about what they ""should be"" and just be themselves, wear what the want, and enjoy what they want to.
That's pretty much how I see it tbh
I am very new to all of it and thinking kinda the same like you do.

There is gender expression and gender identity. I think most of what you are talking about is gender expression (unless i misunderstood, correct me if I'm wrong). It would be wonderful if society excepted all forms of gender expression.

That being said gender expression is very different from gender identity (that deep internal feeling of what gender you are). Being non-binary is about your gender identity being different from your assigned gender some or all of the time. Non-binary people can have whatever gender expression they want. It would also be great if society excepted us as we are, maybe one day 🤞"	oeqqmr	NonBinary	10	0.92	2021-07-06 08:22:18
Just Need to Vent	"So I started a new job last week. Now I love this job it’s the best job I’ve had so far in my life. But it’s also the first job I’ve had since getting top surgery. So even tho I was generally pretty out at my last job there is no denying that I’m gender ambiguous now. Plus my boss has been amazing about making sure my right name and pronouns are displayed everywhere. 

But it seems in the under two weeks I’ve been here I’ve already become the person LGBTQ+ “allies” want validation from. 

Just yesterday a woman from another department came by to drop off a flyer advertising a Facebook group for trading items employees and students no longer use but could be used by another. 

When she dropped off the flyer she made a point of pointing out how she used the word “persons” instead of “men and women” and how she was trying to be more inclusive. And I just… congrats I guess??? Lol. It’s just annoying. And I know everyone here understands."	"I guess everyone is different but I think I wouldn't mind if I were in your situation. I'd say something like ""Hehe see ? It's not that hard, right ? Well done, keep up the good work !"" and I actually would be honest in my congratulations. I think this is not easy for them to think about those kind of things because they never experienced any issue with words like ""men and women"". I mean they are *really* doing some kind of actual *effort* to get this right. To me this shows empathy and care. That being said, I know a lot of people don't like to suddenly be the LGBTQI+ coach for all cis people when they come out so maybe that's just me actually liking to be a coach. I think I would love discussing genders with cis people as long as they are genuinely interested and open-minded. But maybe that's just me... \^\^' Also, I'm not out yet so maybe I'd feel different in a real day-to-day scenario.
When I switched my name at work I honestly thought it was cute watching everyone try to use the right pronouns. Hopefully they chill out and I think at least they are trying and this will hopefully make life better for others.
I feel you. My energy for that varies day by day. Sometimes I am validation thirsty like “yes omg thank you for using my pronouns you all are doing great, we stan an ally, I know I am so amazing for being able to exist in such a hostile work thank you for noticing 💁” and sometimes I’m like “please ignore me I am not here to constantly praise the bare minimum and I am not special just because I haven’t let this dumb world destroy me”

I’m sure people will chill out overtime (hopefully)
I definitely don’t mind educating, I just don’t wanna become /the/ office enby who validates ally-ship. Also I don’t want people to think I now represent all non-binary people haha.
Hoping so haha. Honestly I wouldn’t be against setting up a catch all presentation about gender and expression so people can learn. I just don’t wanna become the person who has to validate ally-ship and reassure everything they’re doing a good job. Plus I have an enby coworker who uses she/her pronouns and I’m pretty sure people don’t do this to her because they still use she pronouns as well and that’s gotta suck in an invalidating."	tm8cvu	NonBinary	10	0.86	2022-03-24 13:05:04
About dating enbies as a homo- or heterosexual person.	"I hope this question isn't too annoying, but I couldn't find a good source to get an answer to it.  


I have read and heard that homosexuality is inclusive of non-binary people. I myself agree with that. I don't see why a lesbian dating a non-binary person she is attracted to would make her not a lesbian.  


But on the other hand, I see time and time again that enbies tell straight people that are attracted to them, that that makes them not-straight.   
Of course, a lot of times this is played as a joke, because our cis-heteronormative society sees a deviation from being cis and straight as an insult. But I have also seen enbies be very serious about that.  


Is it a common view that heterosexuality is not inclusive of non-binary people and any straight person who is attracted to an enby is no longer straight, or is that a topic of discussion within non binary circles?"	"I think the reason why people have issues with that is, that if I knew a straight man found me (afab) attractive and still consider himself straight, I'd be worried he actually sees me as a woman. Same with a lesbian of course. It's just a bit iffy and people want their identity to be respected and cherished. On the other hand, the definitions of homo- and heterosexuality can for sure be bent and stretched to accommodate nb people. I think it really comes down to the invidual situation and person and how I think they view me.
Fuck who you wanna fuck and date who you wanna date and forget labelling because it's at best pointless and at worst actively damaging. Anyone who decides to prioritise technical dictionary definitions over being with someone they share an emotional and physical connection with is a gibbering idiot.

You are not your labels, you are you. ""Nonbinary"", ""lesbian"" etc are useful shorthand for communicating ideas slightly faster, but that's it. They don't dictate who you are and aren't allowed to be with or how you are and aren't allowed to act. They're not in any way important.

EDIT: I realise this post is a bit ranty so I wanted to take some time to explain how I think about this in a bit more detail:

Conservative society dictates acceptable behaviours for male and female and pretty much insists you stay entirely within your pigeonhole or you don't get to identify with it at all. For example, makeup and ballet and whatever aren't in the male accepted behaviour space so conservative thought says if you're into these things you're not a man, and if you're a man you're not into these things. Things like that.

Some parts of the queer community look at this and say OK, we'll create more pigeonholes so there's places for us to fit. Look, we'll create one called nonbinary and one called lesbian and etc etc! But they share the same basic underlying assumption as anti-LGBT conservatives; either you stay in your pigeonhole 100% or you don't get to identify with it at all. Either you are attracted to this one nonbinary person in which case you aren't allowed to identify as straight any more, or you can keep identifying as straight but have to surpress the part of yourself that likes this enby, but you're not allowed both. Either you can be male or you can like ballet but you're not allowed both. The basic message is the same - stay in your lane, surpress the the parts of yourself that don't quite fit with the pigeonhole or you don't get to identify with that at all. Whether it's coming from conservatives or from people within the queer community it's just as toxic either way.

Me I like being able to pick a bit of column A, a dash of column B, maybe a whole heaping helpful of column C. Anyone who tries to dictate to you that you have to fit a pigeonhole 100% or you can't use that identity at all is a bigot and they can fuck right off.
I would say you can be straight and date an Enby. However, they would be in a queer relationship, which is something they need to be okay with. If they want to date an Enby without being in a queer relationship then they don’t see the person they’re interested in as an enby. They see them as male/female.
...I will only say that anyone in a relationship with an enby is, by definition, in a queer relationship. Even if it is straight-presenting. Even if they didn't know.

So my homophobic ex was, by definition, in a gay relationship, because I am also male, even though I am in a female body.

And that is the best revenge I can think of for how he treated me.
There is no blanket statement that really works for nonbinary people. Homosexuality CAN be inclusive of nonbinary people. Heterosexuality CAN be inclusive of nonbinary people. It depends person to person. I personally have only dated bi/pan people and would not date someone who didn't label their sexuality that way.
It’s weird because as someone else noted neither of those words seems accurate. But here’s the thing, people who are LGBTQIA+ don’t typically use the word homosexual as a descriptor from what I can tell, because it only refers to one aspect. It’s also used a lot by people who are looking to disparage that community.

Funny thing tho, yeah, arguably the word heterosexual as a construction with that prefix would be semantically descriptive enough to handle this. But. This isn’t the way that word is used either. Heterosexual is used as a synonym for straight and applied only to male-female relationships. 

When you understand that the distinction you’re really looking for isn’t hetero vs homo but instead straight vs “gay” (in an inclusive LGBTQIA+ usage) it makes a lot more sense to me, though I understand there will be some nonbinary folk who don’t align themselves this way. 

I’ll use myself as a specific example since it hasn’t quite come up yet. I’m agender. Some agender people don’t even identify as nonbinary, because nonbinary is too gendered for their non-gendered outlook. But I learned about nonbinary first and I will always consider myself nonbinary and agender. Anyone want to guess which gender(s) would “straight” for me if my gender is “none”? All of them?? Ha, yeah, none of them makes way more sense. 

See here’s the thing, to argue that someone of whatever gender could see themselves as straight if they’re my partner is to suggest that my gender (or lack thereof) is reduced to something that can line up as straight with theirs. Gender is not sexuality, but, the determination of straight or heterosexual is very binary gendered and closed by default. It speaks to the status quo and is not inclusive or someone who is neither a man or a woman. 

All of which is to say, people are going to ultimately make their own individual choices with this. But anyone wanting to claim they are straight and be my partner is pretty suspect. FWIW, my attractions are fairly theoretical after finding this out, meaning, I’ve had no partners except when I still thought I was cisgender and straight. I learned I am also demisexual so it’s not outside the possibility that I’m bi/pan, although it’s really other nonbinary people who seem to be the most appealing. Regardless, yeah I’d say I’m gay, and that anyone who likes me in that way is also gay lol. But then the chances of me having a partner who was not already aligned as LGBTQIA+ have diminished quite a lot anyway.
This is a somewhat complicated subject and the consensus seems to be it depends on the enby's POV on it and on their own gender whether or not a specific pairing (ie that enby with a guy or a girl) would be heterosexual or homosexual or neither (which is important for understanding the whole issue overall).  For me, I categorically will not date a straight man because I would not see a relationship between a man and myself as straight and if he would, that is not something that can be worked around.  I would, however, date a straight woman because I see myself more aligned with masculinity and accept the idea that a straight woman can both accept my gender and be attracted to me because I identify in part with the idea of being a man therefore that relationship could be heterosexual.  I'm unlikely to date a woman but that's my sexuality and insecurities coming into play not their sexuality.  I would not date a lesbian because I wouldn't see a relationship between myself and a woman as homosexual, and I would date a gay man with the same logic as why I'd be ok with dating a straight woman in terms of being seen as sort of a guy-ish.  There are enbies who are the opposite of me, there are enbies who wouldn't date any straight person (sometimes in part for cultural reasons as LGBTQ+ culture can be the only place some of us feel safe, and I do think for me, if I were to date a straight woman, that would be something that could put some strain on the relationship) whether or not they'd date someone who identifies as homosexual.  And in general, what I've seen is basically the attitude that it's up to the individual to figure out what they are comfortable with.  I don't think it's necessarily a case of ""the person is no longer straight"", more ""the person should examine how they view the enby and if the enby is okay with being pursued by them specifically"", and I think in part that ""oh well guess you're not so straight after all haha"" is possibly a way to say ""I do not feel comfortable being pursued by a straight person"" or something along those lines, or simply a joke, or something else entirely.  I feel very uncomfortable when straight men pursue me so I tend to categorically make it clear I am not a woman and should not be seen as one in any way.
I've been wondering the same thing bc my crush is straight and I'm nb (amab) and idk if she would be able to feel similarly about me bc I'm nb and if I did ask her out and she said yes idk if it would make me feel like she doesn't see me as nb
I can see arguing the point that heterosexuality isn't inclusive of nonbinary people, but what I can't condone is the idea that we get to pick someone else's labels for them. As a queer person who has had my identity and sexuality invalidated by others for the majority of my life, I refuse to do that to another person, be they queer or cishet.

Now, you can be of the opinion that someone who identifies as straight but is attracted to a nonbinary person doesn't really fit that label. People can think whatever they want. It's true that if a straight person is in a relationship with a nonbinary person that relationship by definition is a queer relationship because they're *with* a queer person, and if the straight person insists it isn't then they're invalidating their partner's identity.

But here's the thing. The same can be said for the nonbinary person if they insist that their self-identified heterosexual partner is in fact not straight. It's also unfair to argue that homosexuality is inclusive of nonbinary people and that heterosexuality isn't when their definitions are equally rigid on paper. Ultimately what matters is not letting labels box us in so much that it prevents us from being who we want to be and being *with* who we want to be. I personally still find labels useful and validating and important, but I'm not about to tell someone what they can or can't identify as, regardless of their situation.

I think if we were to think about the semantics logically, homo and hetero are both innacurate prefixes to describe the sexual attraction to the non-binary person. It’s just “sexuality” in that case. Sexuality is more fluid than gender so
From how I see it either way people are going to categorize us in one of the binary boxes they have in their head (unconsciously) and then they will feel attracted to what best fit the one they are attracted to,  I'm aware of this and therefore I think heterosexuality and homosexuality includes nb people but not all of us, mostly the ones that fit in what a monosexual person is usually attracted too, I feel kinda conflicted because as others have mentioned, it kinda invalidates our identities but oh well, what can we do? I just wanna be loved.
Since coming to the conclusion and accepting myself as non-binary, I feel like the people most attracted to me are pan sexuals, and I find myself identifying more and more as pan sexual. Since non-binary is such a vague term, I consider people attracted to NBs as pan.
I think a straight person wanting to date a nonbinary person would still be straight, it'd just be a queer relationship. Nonbinary people all look and identify different ways so I think it is kind of silly to expect that someone's sexuality would change just because they wanted to date a nb person. Just like if a straight person had a partner who came out as trans during their relationship and still wanted to be with them because they loved their partner. 

A straight person can date a nb person and still be straight and a gay person can date a nb person and still be gay...what usually matters is if they are a respectful partner or not and genuinely view their nonbinary partner as being nonbinary. I personally would not wanna date a cis person at all so this is of no concern to me anyways lol. 

But overall....nonbinary is not a gender and it covers many things so someone who usually only likes women being attracted to a nonbinary person does not mean they are suddenly attracted to a new gender, it means they are attracted to a PERSON who happens to identify outside of the gender binary and it is more like an anomaly. It doesn't change their identity.
i see, thank you very much
i 100% get you lol  


the inital draft of this post touched on what you edited in, but i was scared the post got too unwieldy  


thank you for your answer tho
true true  
thank you for your insight  


i really wanted to get the opinions of enbies on this \^\^
I see, thank you very much
thank you very much for your elaborate answer
Thank you very much for your answer. The point about deciding other's labels was sonething I hadnt realised yet.
I mean I am trans myself and I can see where youre coming from xD
I can see that being very frustrating. Thank you for sharing
Thats what I thoght as well, but I wanted to make sure I am not talking over enbies.

creating a resource for pregnant people seeking abortions /abortion experienced using inclusive language	"Hi All,

&#x200B;

I'm creating a resource for pregnant people who do not want to be pregnant using inclusive language, covering being gender/sexuality inclusive and inclusive of pregnant people who want/need to have an abortion.  So much of what I came across during my experience referred to the pregnant person as a 'mother', and the embryo/foetus as a 'baby' and used lots of language about excitement etc. It wasn't helpful when I wanted to find out about how to soothe morning sickness, or when I was worried about whether cramps were normal etc. 

&#x200B;

It's called Oh Shit! Am I pregnant?  [https://osaip.home.blog/](https://osaip.home.blog/) 

&#x200B;

I (I identify as Queer and questioning (for gender) and would love to hear more about trans and gnc people's experiences accessing abortion and to invite anyone to share their story and be published on the website, and share ideas/critique what has already been written.

It would also be really helpful if anyone knows of any existing websites out there that could be compiled into a list? 

Thanks for reading <3

Scarleteen may still be up and running and something to check out.

Any Irish they/thems causing mayhems here?	"I’ve been learning Irish for a little while (like, a LITTLE while) and while I can read and pronounce fun things like “is biachlar é, ta biachlar agam” (good to know when you’re pulling a menu heist and you want to reassure your crime-friend) I can’t find audio for the pronunciation of dhénártha in neamh-dhénártha. 

I know neamh is like nav but is dhénártha pronounced Hhey-nawrt-ha? 

Also is there a term for transfemme? It’s really cool to see that the language is still growing and my interest in it has only doubled knowing its inclusion.

Go raibh maith agat!"	"Déithe dhuit! Yank by birth but I lived in Cork and Dublin for years and have intermediate modern Irish. Mine is Munster-flavored due to first learning in Cork but the time in Dublin made me most comfortable with lárcaint, so while I am not an Official Gaeilgeoir™️ I may be able to help. 

Neamh-dhénártha makes me cringe a little as it violates the grammatical rule of slender and broad vowels (the é beside the á) but the pronunciation is close to Nav-gYAY-nawr-huh. (Th is silent in modern Irish.) I’m agender so I typically just say Níl inscne agam which is especially pleasing for the literal translation of agam as “at/upon me”. 

While I haven’t seen/heard “transfemme” literally translated, I think trasbainnean would be the word that gets the point across (tras- = trans-, bainnean = female/feminine).
Mise mise mise! 😁

The best source for any modern words in irish is téarma.ie; the sexology section has tons of this stuff you're looking for! In this case, the word is trasbhaineann - [Trass-van-inn] or maybe [tras-wan-in] depending on dialect. 

For pronunciation, go to teanglann.ie - they have connacht, munster and ulster variations of most words (though mostly ones in the dictionary before 1980s or so). 

There can be a decent difference- the munster accent (south, eg Cork) tends to pronounce sounds for the dh, bh etc whereas connacht (West eg galway) tends to make them silent or into vowel type sounds. I'm from the south east (leinster) which doesn't have a proper dialect bc we've no original gaeltachts left so we tend to learn piecemeal of the other variations. Personally, I would pronounce neamh-dhénártha as [nyav yay-nOHR-ha]

Is duine neamh-dhénártha mé, tá mé neamh-dhénártha. 
Is duine trasbhaineann mé, tá mé trasbhaineann.

Má go bhfuil aon ceist eile agat, tá lánchead agat DM a chur chugam 😁

Oh how I wish I would know what any of those mean or how to pronounce it

NonBinary terms for pregnancy	"Hello!

I am wondering if there are NonBinary terms for pregnancy. Is the term pregnancy generally Non-Binary? I am making a tea blend to support pregnancy and lactation but I want to use language that is inclusive."	"i would just stay away from words like ""motherhood"" and ""mom"" and ""women"" etc and you should be fine. remember trans men can get pregnant as well :)
I mean there's nothing etymologically in those terms that's inherently gendered, so I would consider them gender-neutral. Male lactation is still called lactation, and male pregnancy is still called pregnancy. There aren't separate male and female versions of those terms and I'm not sure how you'd make them, so a new gender-neutral term isn't necessary. I think as long as the packaging and marketing aren't all girly, it should be fine as is.

Edit after seeing other comments: Seconding the advice to avoid gendered words like ""mom"" etc. and stick to gender-neutral versions of those.
Pregnancy and lactation are gender neutral. Chestfeeding is gender neutral (as opposed to breastfeeding). Birth parent, carrying a child, natural birth, and any other phrases like that are also gender neutral.
Isn't ""pregnancy"" already gender neutral?
“Childbearing” 
 “with child”
“Growing a human” 
Ect
Absolutely! Thank you :)
IMO, ""breastfeeding"" is gender neutral because people of any gender can have breasts. 

If I had a child I was breastfeeding and someone started calling it ""chestfeeding"" specifically because I'm nonbinary, I'd have to beg them to stop. It would make me 1000x more uncomfortable with the concept, because now I'm hyperaware that I'm not ""supposed"" to acknowledge my breasts.

Idk, maybe save that one for people who have explicitly stated they prefer it?"	nt0724	NonBinary	9	0.92	2021-06-05 17:00:12
AMAB Femme looking for more professional outfit ideas	"After being out as nb/genderfluid for like 3 or so weeks now, I've made some strides, gone out in public in femme clothes (without it being 'drag' like I used to do) and gone every day things like run my poetry workshop and gone grocery shopping in a skirt. Got new make-up that I can wear daily and got a bunch of 'going out/partying' clothes, but only issue is that I need more outfit ideas that look a bit more classy and professional. I got some skinny leg jeans that make me feel femme daily, that goes well with a short heel and some make-up, but need another option.

Am appearing at a poetry festival this weekend, on a panel and as an MC, and the organisers are supportive, it's very inclusive, there's NB poets there too but mostly AFAB, but still a bit nervous about appearing too immature in some of my femme clothes choices so kinda nervous about it. I tend to go for a-line skirts and stockings and print dresses and not sure they're that appropriate or I'm overthinking it.

I'm aware it's much more normalise for AFAB enby to get away with wearing pants and a shirt but it's another thing for an AMAB enby to wear skirts or dresses especially when I'm not going for a look where I fully want to pass as a woman. Society still has this taboo around that in particular."	"This is a tough one. It's made easier for me for 2 reasons: I'm a software engineer so ""professional"" = casual. The other is I'm pretty ""tomboy""-ish femme and not that interested in skirts/dresses. As far as actual professional wear that you are talking about... I'm still trying to figure this out, myself. Men's professional stuff gives me dysphoria and makes me feel like shit.

Honestly a skirt or something similar seems like it would be fine at that kind of event. If you're comfortable of course. Take my opinion with a grain of salt because I really don't have much experience with this."	csd7te	NonBinary	9	0.92	2019-08-19 06:27:16
Parent of newly out nonbinary teen	"Hi  everyone. I don't think this breaks any of the rules but if there's a more appropriate sub for this request please let me know, I will take this down or move it.

My BFF's (she/her) 13yo (they/them) came out this weekend as nonbinary. My friend loves and accepts her kid and made sure they know this. My friend is an exceptional parent and an inclusive feminist. She understands what non-binary means, the difference between gender and sexual orientation, knows the importance of pronouns and names, is vocally and actively supportive of all queer people, and most of all is her child's biggest fan, cheerleader and protector - in short, unconditional love and acceptance are not the problem here.

However, this is a big change and my friend is struggling with a few things. In particular she is having a hard time navigating the parenting aspect of things, and specifically right now, how to deal with her own issues and feelings without making her kid feel bad. For example, she is trying to figure out what she can and should tell her kid  about her own feelings, if anything - her kid is extremely mature for their age and will intuit that their mom is struggling a bit. Also things like how to sort through the fact  that her kid's preferred name is (age- and stage-appropriate but)...not great, over and above her own feelings of being kind of insulted since she deliberately selected non-gendered names for both of her children. She knows she has to work on these things and get over them, but is kind of at a loss for where to start.

Does anyone have some recommendations (besides PFLAG and therapy, she's acting on both of those) for support for parents that goes beyond the basics like ""this is what trans means""? We have excellent googling skills so we are really looking for insider things that are harder to find than that. We're in Canada if anyone has  anything specific or local.

Thanks a lot for your help."	"“Mature children” are usually actually just good at internalizing all the emotions of themselves and the people around them rather than expressing how that makes them feel. It’s more about not vocalizing their wants and needs and reactions than actually being mentally old enough not to be hurt by their mom saying things like how this hurts her. Really, who is old enough that doesn’t still sting?

So please, the biggest advice I could give is that right now the kid is the center of the crisis ring (although, being nonbinary isn’t a crisis, to our unaccepting culture it acts like one). Support goes in towards the center of the ring, processing and venting go out towards the less impacted rings. The kid is the center dot, the mom is the next ring, surrounding her kid with love and support. You as her friend would be a great next ring, giving your friend time to talk about this more than she’d normally take up in your socializing and giving her a grounding line to day things she should not say in front of her kid, no matter if the kid wouldn’t give visual or verbal cues to how that made them feel.

Kiddo is 13, that’s a perfect age for making mildly questionable decisions like names that are… interesting. Names are really not a lifelong commitment. It’s so much more important to spend parental influence on things that matter to this kid’s health and long term well being. The name is likely seen as a way to assert their marginalized gender in a real way while they have very few practical options for doing so. Having a fight about it, whether a big blustery one, or a quiet “oh you know I wish you would consider the name I gave you, it is so lovely and there are all kinds of people with it” judgmental one with the kid as a silent “mature” party, spends quite a lot of trust and influence that may be needed to get through the hell of puberty.

Had to go find it but check out this post to send to your friend:

While your friend may have chosen a name for their kid that was gender neutral in theory that kid has a lifetime of associations of it being used to gender them as their AGAB. Names are gifts and [gifts are not obligations](https://mobile.twitter.com/anamardoll/status/1155578422644609024)
I think your friend is a great parent, they will have a wonderful time together, adjusting to changes is never the most easy thing, but they will work that through in some weeks. The thing with the name is, although it might be gender neutral in theory, it still links to all the old memories of their former self, which might be not what they want.
Hey there!

I think it’s really great your friend is so supportive of their kid! I recognize it’s a hard thing to have someone’s kid come out an anything, so good on them for being accepting of it.  I’m not a parent, but I am non-binary and had pretty similar things happen with my mom. Very supportive, very cheerleader, but she always felt insulted and sad that I wasn’t what she thought I’d become. For one thing, I think it’s important that your friend make sure to keep a lot of that grief and insult and feelings away from their kid. Despite them being “mature for their age”, a lot of kids that are that have had to become that due to emotional circumstances throughout their life; i know I was. Your friends feelings should not be placed onto their kid. It’s okay to explain, if asked, that she have to work through her feelings on this but stressing that there’s no resentment or wishing her kid would be very different. 

I came out around 19 (I’m 22 now) and I still had a lot of guilt placed on me because my mother is a chronic oversharer of her emotions 😅 as for the name, it’s important to support them through their journey even if you don’t like it. I named myself Charlie, had it changed legally, and had thoughts about naming myself “Charles” for full but was guilted out of it. So really I think my biggest advice here for her is to work through it away from her kid. Sometimes people do things in life that we don’t like, but the important thing for your friend to remember here is that nothing her child is doing is against her as a parent, if that makes sense. Figuring out you’re non-binary is a very scary and personal thing to happy to anyone, and we harbor a lot of confusion and guilt around it because of the society we grow up in. The last thing we need is to feel any of that through our support system, especially when you’re so young. 

I hope this all made sense and helped a little bit! My biggest pieces to take away is nothing her child is doing is a personal attack against her as a mother, and that her emotions on the subject are valid but they are not her kid’s to hear or hold 🥰👍🏻 good luck to you guys! And thanks again for being so open about this, it’s really important for trans kids to have supportive families, so the fact that you’re here asking for advice is amazing 🥰
thank you for the link, much appreciated.
right - that's why she needs help dealing with her feelings about it, as the post indicates"	r659ir	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-12-01 03:30:01
Lingerie for post-top surgery	"Hey y’all, I tried doing a search in this group but didn’t see anything come up so I’m making a post. If someone has already ask this, I apologize. 

I basically took a hard turn into masculinity when I first came out as a trans man. Now I’m getting more comfortable with my non-binary expression. I’m looking for lingerie that is best for people who have had top surgery. I want to wear these cute long line bras that have almost a corset look to them, but I don’t have anything to fill out the top part. Also looking for bodysuits (which will probably be easier to find). 

Any suggestions on enby inclusive, queer lingerie brands?

Thanks for you help!"	"this isn't quite what you were asking, but [this](https://instagram.com/non.0f.your.business?utm_medium=copy_link) is an ftm lingerie model i follow! he doesn't link the brands but maybe you can get some inspiration or better keywords from it?

Y'all, I feel like the world is my oyster	"I was talking to one of my professors after class yesterday, and he asked me how I chose my name (my name's Lizzard) and I explained that people were already calling me Lizzard, but I leaned into it once I realized I was nonbinary. 

We ended up having a super interesting conversation about what gender means in today's world, and how architects should create gender inclusive spaces but there aren't any real precedents for it yet (I'm an architecture student). 

It made me realize that I could contribute to a better future and I'm so excited!!! Having nonbinary input in design spaces is super important and I'm really glad to be in architecture as a nonbinary person. I feel like I'm part of the forefront of a new kind of architecture. 

Are any of y'all architects/designers or just creative in general? I wanna hear people's thoughts"	One of my partners is an NB and college level writing instructor. She works hard to make her classes gender inclusive. I suppose in a way she’s building her own gender inclusive spaces. As creative and management types, we have the power to do this. Sometimes it’s only small scale but small changes beget larger changes.	eta6fq	NonBinary	10	1.0	2020-01-24 13:07:51
Sending emails to professors	I could use some general encouragement to stave off the looming anxiety this is causing. I’m sending emails to the professors in my major coming out as non-binary and explaining how the major could be more gender inclusive. I’ve already settled on this, I have drafts of the emails personalized to each of them saved. I literally just have to hit send and my anxiety is just killing me about it	"Speaking as a professor, you have every right to be respected and free of discrimination when learning, and that's what you should be thinking of when you hit that button. You *deserve* to be treated with respect, and there's not really any way to make that happen but asking for it.

I always love seeing the ""oh hey professor I'm trans"" e-mails, but I admit that may be a rare perspective in the academy.
Assuming you live in the U.S. like me, they cannot legally mistreat you or discriminate against you. I am nonbinary too and honestly have only told one professor, I think, and I only did so after a classmate who says a lot of incendiary things started saying stuff about trans people and I had a panic attack, but she was super cool about it.
Ya there’s only like three of them that are the big issue. I just hate confrontation and I know that’s what I’m going to get from this but it’s the right thing to do anyways
Ya I live in the South though so some of my professors are likely gonna actually discriminate after I put this out there. Which sucks but I think it’ll be ok
This is incorrect. As of right now, there are no federal laws requiring that colleges not discriminate against LGBT students. It's a common misconception, but federal law does not protect either sexual orientation or gender identity from discrimination in most cases. (The recent Supreme Court case regarding the application of the Civil Rights Act, *Bostock v. Clayton County*, only applies to employment.)

State law does bar discrimination in 18 states, but none of them are in the South. /u/Cind3r44, understand that you *are* legally vulnerable here, that the law is *not* on your side unless your city or county has a local nondiscrimination ordinance.

It's not a bad idea to identify who your allies are at the university in case you get pushback. Do you have an LGBT center? A diversity office or similar? An ombudsperson? Allies in the department?

Dropping the right name can make a lot of problems disappear.
Look up the contact info for your nearest UCLA headquarters/center/office/place and prepare to push back.
lovely.
I just meant general harassment and discrimination and hate speech.
Ya I mentioned in my emails I’ve already spoken to the gender ambassador at the Office of Inclusion and Diversity about this so I think that’ll help.
Ya I will. I desperately hope it doesn’t come to that but I could see it with one or two of them
It sucks, but better you go in knowing it sucks than get surprised.
Harassment is a crime, but it's one that often takes a pretty high bar before the police get involved, *especially* against marginalized people.

LGBT people are *NOT* protected from discrimination, and hate speech is *perfectly legal*. Indeed, the Supreme Court generally considers it protected under the First Amendment.

Something like 80% of Americans believe that hate speech is illegal and that LGBT people are protected from discrimination, but that belief is *wrong*.
Always be prepared. You a freshman?
Thanks. I doubt it will get too bad from the actual professors. From the students though... guess I’ll just have to be careful
Junior
Other students are trouble even in places with nondiscrimination laws. If your professor is doing their fucking job and ensuring an inclusive, low-stress learning environment, they will put an end to it. Not all professors care. I wish I could make every classroom safe, but alas I can only make my classroom safe.
Ah, okay. I wasn't sure if you were just starting college since you are just now notifying the college.
I appreciate the advice. I’m only worried about discrimination from a couple of professors but should be able to avoid them. Just gotta get through another year and I’m out
No I originally intended on transitioning after graduation but I don’t want my deadname on documents
That makes sense."	jpkhyg	NonBinary	9	1.0	2020-11-07 04:28:24

My dad is cool, Burger King is trying but failing miserably	"So today I was at Burger King with my dad and siblings.

 And I wanted to text someone so I went to sign up so I could use their WiFi (idk about anywhere else but where I live you gotta like sign up and put some infos to use their WiFi) and in the sign up page thing, you have to put your gender.

At first I assumed their would be Male and Female and since I use he/him pronounce as well, I thought I would put Male so when they refer to me in an email or something (advertising email) they don't use the wrong pronounces.

But then, I see that in the gender thing, there is ""non-binary"" and ""other"" As well as Male and Female.

And holy moly I was happy.

So obviously I put Non-binary and then submit, but guess what?

""Please enter a valid gender"" 😃😄😃

Dang how nice of you Burger King 🤴 

So anyway I ended up putting ""Male"" like I originally thought I would do.

Then after that whole thing, and me laughing like crazy, I decided to tell my dad about it (he's really open minded) but since I am in the closet, I said that I saw it in a video on TikTok.

So I explained what happened and he like chuckled and went ""That's stupid"" and I was like ""I know right? Like why put it if you're not gonna let them sign up with it"" then my dad said ""Well I guess they wanted to try and be inclusive but failed miserably"" 

Anyway that was fun lol at least the food was good 😋"	That would infuriate me. Similar to how subway doesn’t think email addresses ending in .email are valid, so I end up using an obscuring email instead.	rujhtm	NonBinary	10	0.92	2022-01-02 21:08:55
How to make emails gender inclusive	"Hello!  Lately I've been emailing lots of people I don't personally know lately.  I grew up being told the polite way to start an email in such a case is ""Dear Sir/Madam"".  I've started using ""To Whom It May Concern"" so as to not misgender the strangers I'm emailing.  However, are there alternatives?  I find ""To Whom It May Concern"" to be less personable and polite than ""Dear (title)"".  How would you like people to salute you in correspondence?"	"The way we do it in German when you wanna be inclusive, is saying ""Dear [first name] [surname]""
I write my professional business letters as “Dear [first name] [last name]” because no way in hell am I going to go around guessing whether to put Mr or Ms.

If the form must be generic, you can address them as whatever category they fill like job title/occupation/relation to you, ie Dear Customer, Dear Scientist, Dear Concerned Citizen, Dear Student, Dear Assistant Manager, so on and so forth.

To whom it may concern is acceptable though it does sound more serious and a bit stuffy.
I've worked in a corporate environment for nearly 5 years, and all of my emails to people I don't know start with ""Good Morning"" or "" Good Afternoon"".
I use: “Hello friends,” or “Good morning/afternoon”
I get what you mean... I use their name when I can but it's often the case that I don't know who I'm writing to (organisations, libraries etc.).
I’m not sure if this is right but I tend to just use the name of the organization if there’s no name listed. “Dear ___ Library” etc.
I know exactly what you mean. I actually just asked this question somewhere too, I think it was in the comments. 

I have no idea how you would, I mean I might say ‘dear person,’ but idk that also isn’t very personal. 

I’m gonna follow here for a while because I’ve been wanting to figure this one out too!"	oonrf2	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-07-21 11:13:16

Had a fantastic conversation with the gender ambassador and they’ll be speaking to the higher ups about the issue so I don’t have to and they’ll be sending my resources and following up with me during my process so I feel much better about it now. 

Now all I gotta do is talk to the professors which will be... mostly fine... I think"		jh542l	NonBinary	10	0.92	2020-10-24 07:53:50
Crowd sourcing: inclusive language for anatomy	I’m nonbinary and trying to help one of the professors at my medical school who is developing new materials for teaching the genital portions of anatomy. Unfortunately most mainstream materials are VERY cis and binary heavy, and the field of anatomy as a whole suffers from a history of slotting people into two neat boxes (and describing the rest as abnormal). It’s hard to find any official resources out there, so I was hoping to crowd source here. Beyond the standard phrasing “people with penises/vaginas” etc, any good ideas for teaching these areas that both recognize that there are distinct phenotypic differences that are important to recognize AND that both these differences and the gender of the people who embody them are naturally variable. Thanks for any emotional labor, sorry I can’t offer much more than upvotes rn.	"Replace he/she pronouns with singular they
They’ve already been doing that. I think  they are more hung up on ways to describe anatomy that has historically been characterized as “male” and “female” anatomy. That’s better than saying masculine/feminine or boy/girl but still sits weird because it enforces a binary that is tied to gender."	n11pkb	NonBinary	10	0.92	2021-04-29 10:47:25
Gender Inclusive Variation of Queen/King	I'm looking for a gender inclusive option for King/Queen but haven't been able to find much. One thing I found was Quing, but I was trying to figure out how to pronounce it. Is it just pronounced like it looks (kwing)? Is there anything else? Because it sounds a bit too much like King for me.	"I may be in the minority but I don't love when gender neutral words are just mashups of two gendered terms.

Monarch, Regent, etc work way better to me than Quing (/Keen?)
My leige, great ruler of the underworld, mighty usurper of thrones.
Majesty
I like ‘Royalty’ but it kind of only works as a variation of the phrase “absolute king/queen.”

Absolute Royalty.
Ruler
Monarch
I really like Monarch
Regent, Monarch, Sovereign?
Highness. Majesty. Tyler. Dictator. Tyrant.

Also, I pronounced Quinn as Xing. And as the actual X sound. Sounds like it’s a Chinese word
I generally don’t love the portmanteaus like these, but fair play to anyone who loves them. 

My preferred option would be Sovereign. (Yes, I do like Star Trek… Why do you ask? ;) )
monarch is what i use, it's clunky but i honestly just find that funny. for prince/princess i use pringle /hj
Ive always been partial to monarch
Majesty
Royalty, Sovereign, or Dictator
Im not sure if emperer perse would be gender neutral( sounds to me as a non natuve) although i know the word emperess exists
Would k
Kan be gender neutral?
Majesty :)
liege
I love your queerness
Royals
I like quing, and yeah, that's how I pronounce it. I suppose you could stretch out the I to be more of an E sound, like ""kweeng"" but it's probably a subtle difference.

What was your experience with pronouns at work?	I’m a femme NB. My team works remotely and we are making an About Me deck where everyone can share a little about themselves, fun facts, etc. My company says it’s very inclusive, and I believe them - but no one on my team is sharing pronouns. I think it’s just a ‘no one thought to include it’ thing, but still feel nervous about drawing attention to it. I don’t want to start a huge discussion about my relationship to gender and yet I feel not including it is a misrepresentation. Have any of you run into this before? How did you handle it?	"I totally feel this! Sometimes bringing up my pronouns makes me feel like im under a lot of scrutiny and I never want people to ask questions I don't know how to answer BUT if it makes you more comfortable for others to use your pronouns then I say tell them! Especially if you feel decently comfortable with the ""progressive"" or open minded atmosphere. It's intimidating for sure, but slap those pronouns in ur zoom name if it'll bring you joy and euphoria.
I didn't share pronouns in my latest ""get to know you"" session, mainly because I hadn't cracked yet.  But I would have and will whenever I get another opportunity.  For now I just have them in my email signature and zoom name.  Only 1 person has said something just simply because they weren't aware what it was about.  I just name dropped nonbinary and didn't linger on it.

Something to keep in mind is in a professional work setting, there's a general apprehension to talk about certain things (race, religion, politics, etc) either out of courtesy, fear of retaliation or other consequences.  So even if they know why you're giving pronouns, they're unlikely to address it directly.  And even if they do, you'll well within your right to indicate your discomfort and move on."	lhu47j	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-02-11 20:38:14
Participants need for trans and non-binary affirming, sexual engagement study!	"

My name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

**If you are interested, please visit** [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo (she/her or they/them), at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender and non-binary clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. 

**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements. There is no compensation for participating in the study. 

**Accessing Results:** The result of this study will be published in a peer reviewed journal. While we cannot guarantee that the article will be open access, we will post an accessible link to Louis Lindley’s research gate once it is accepted and published."

Apps/safe spaces for queer expecting parents?	"Hi everyone! 

My partner and I recently started trying to conceive, and while I'm excited for this new chapter I'm getting really bad imposter syndrome because of all the extremely gendered language that goes into this process. I'm nb and my partner is a cis man, this will be our first child. 

It's really been getting in my head lately and I'm starting to get imposter syndrome. This whole process is causing me a lot more stress than I wanted it to and I'm recognizing a lot of that is because of this highly gendered language. 

Does anyone know of an app or somewhere that is for expectant parents/TTC that is inclusive, or hell, even not as terrible? Im using a few for this process but they're all awful. Any help is appreciated! Thank you!"	"Have you tried any Facebook groups? I recall seeing a group for gender non-conforming parents a few years ago, I'm sure there's others too.
I haven't found anything. There are subreddits for samesex parents, but nothing specific to my situtation. I remember the occasional non-binary or lesbian posters on r/Tryingforababy, but never found a subreddit about just that. My partner and I have found it easier to ignore the language because I use she/her and was pregnant so it was fairly straight forward for me. The insufferable traditions people associate with the parent/daughter dynamic is harder. We can only smile at stupid jokes so much. We hope to find a support group when the world opens back up, but until then quarantine has been great for being able to ignore parent groups with biased, gendered events and attitudes.
Oh, I try not to use anything Facebook makes if I can. Just personal preference. 

That may be my only option tho, I'll look into it. Thank you!
I totally get that. Hmm maybe someone should start a subreddit for non-binary parents?

French/Spanish non-binary expression?	"One of the major mindfucks I'm currently experiencing is how to properly teach non-binary language expression in my French and Spanish classes. For those that aren't the best with other European languages, gender goes a lot deeper than just pronouns (which is most of the language issue in English along with other words that we can mostly get around-sibling instead of brother/sister, spouse instead of husband/wife etc.) and has an effect on nearly any sentence describing someone. For example, if I were to say ""[he is/she is/they are] a good student"" in either language 4 of those words require a gender marker. Literally everything but the verb (verbs are awesome and don't give a fuck about gender). 

So I'm looking for **native speakers** to point me in the right direction for resources or advice on how to approach these to teach them more inclusively (and to better express myself as well). I can Google, obviously, but I feel more comfortable with things agreed upon by native non-binary speakers.

Thanks in advance! ¡Gracias! Merci 1000 fois! 

Si es más fácil puedes responder en español / Si il est plus facile tu peux répondre en français"	"I know in Spanish, there are movements to replace that a/o suffixes with /e, so instead of saying

Mis amigos/amigas. Todos y todas. or Ellos/Ellas

they would say

Mis amiges. Todes. Elles.

As a native speaker I support this and prefer this rather than the overuse of ""x"" in everything. Like for example, Latinxs rather than Latines or the binary Latinos/Latinas. To me, Latines flows more naturally in Spanish than Latinxs (""lah-teen-es"" vs ""lah-teen-ek-kee-ses"") and is easier to pronounce

Since Spanish has had a long history of using binary forms of words, I would argue this would be the most natural evolution of gender neutral language in Spanish so far, but we'll see how things evolve.

Idk if you'll find a resource for this, since most laypeople I know have no idea that there even is such a thing as a Royal Spanish Academy in Spain or the ones in other countries. On top of that....Latin American has an intensive ideology on gender overall that would likely be resistant to changing both language/cultural attitudes on gender.

What I did find though, is a passionate young girl who presents this kind of gender-neutral language naturally and explains why there is a need for it. From a linguistics standpoint, she's partaking in the evolution of Spanish in her culture/community. I REALLY hope it sticks and grows:

http://remezcla.com/culture/les-gender-neutral-pronoun-in-spanish/
In French, it’s actually quite a work in progress and there’s no real consensus (I mean, even among people who actually care and try to make it more inclusive, not even counting the terribly vast majority who doesn’t give a carp and/or is actively against those changes…)

&#x200B;

Regarding pronouns, we obviously don’t have any « naturally » gender-neutral ones, so they’re all basically neo-pronouns, there are a bunch although the two who seem to be getting the more traction are « iel » (mix between « il » and « elle ») and « æl » (or « ael » for those of us who don’t have the privilege of being able to easily make ligatures…), the first one being used both for non-binary people and for general inclusivity (like your non-specific « they », when you don’t know the gender of the person you’re talking about), the second one mostly exclusively as a non-binary pronoun.

Other pronouns are built the same way (lui/elle → ellui/æl ; celui/celle → cellui/cæl, etc.)

&#x200B;

Now for accords (I don’t actually know how that’s called in English) well that’s… complicated. There are several techniques, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and basically break down to:

* Writing both forms of a word, separated with a · (it used to be commonly parenthesis, but there are some issues with it, so the interpunct tends to be preferred (by those who don’t flat out hate it) because it’s more « neutral »). For example « un·e danseur·euse » for « un danseur/une danseuse »
* Mixing both forms of the word: danseureuse (advantage being it’s possible to pronounce it)
* Using -æ instead of the usual ending of the word (more used for adjectives, imho more appropriate for -ée/e words specifically because the æ theoretically is pronounced like -é) : je suis blessæ 
   * side note on that: it’s also used in the gender-neutral version of le/la : læ (although you usually pronounce it as if the letters were separate)
* Using only non-gendered phrasing, although that can be a bit cumbersome

There are other alternatives, like using an apostrophe and whatnot, but they’re less common.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure how clear/understandable it was, specially since my English is getting pretty rusty, but feel free to ask any questions if needed!

Yeah this kind of linguistic shift would be amazing. No way I could get away with teaching it now, though... 
That's a really great reply, thanks. Since we pretty much don't make agreement (accord) in English I understand why you wouldn't know the word for it. There's a trend in general to remove as much gendered language as possible. For example many females nowadays will call themselves ""an actor"". Though I'd argue that's mostly due to feminism and not a rejection of a gender binary by most. 

One minor question - how would a non-binary dancer tend to refer to themself? 

And your English is still fantastic!  Je ne suis pas sûr si je pourrais écrire tant clair en français ! Merci !!
why not? You could mention it as an alternative that some spanish speaking communities use. Similar to how some english and linguistics teacher will discuss the syntax and grammar of non-standard dialects, like AAVE, Southern US, etc.

could that help in your situation or no?
>There's a trend in general to remove as much gendered language as possible. For example many females nowadays will call themselves ""an actor"". Though I'd argue that's mostly due to feminism and not a rejection of a gender binary by most.

See that’s kinda weird to me, because in my French-wired brain « actor » isn’t gender-neutral, it’s \*masculine\*, so leaving actress for actor would be basically going against everything feminism is trying to do grammar-wise here x) (which is: dropping the « masculine is the default » rule, so re-feminizing some job titles that had disappeared (like « autrice » as the feminine of « auteur ») and making gender-inclusive versions of words (that’s mostly where the interpunct came from, although it’s also used by some non-binary people as their regular agreement)

&#x200B;

>One minor question - how would a non-binary dancer tend to refer to themself?

Well that would really depend, tbh. A lot of non-binary people tend to use the interpunct form, because well, it’s here and more and more recognized, but a fair share of us don’t really like it, or not is this use (I’m one of use. I’m a big fan of the form as a non-sexist general form for non-gendered/unspecified gendered contexts, but wouldn’t use it for myself). Some of the forms I’ve seen, from what I think is the most common to the least:

* danseur·euse (or with other typography, such as danseur’euse, danseur-euse…)
* danseureuse
* danseurse (same logic as above, but shorter)
* dansær (those would mostly be using the æl pronom and -æ form I mentionned earlier)
* dansaire (whole new form so that it isn’t based on masculine/feminine and gets fully « out of » the gender binary, there can also be variations of this with the same idea)

I really mostly see the first one, and second/third used, the last ones are really anecdotal in my experience. But I kinda like all the creativity people put into it.

&#x200B;

> And your English is still fantastic! Je ne suis pas sûr si je pourrais écrire tant clair en français ! Merci !! 

Aww well shucks, thank you!! 
>See that’s kinda weird to me, because in my French-wired brain « actor » isn’t gender-neutral, it’s *masculine*, so leaving actress for actor would be basically going against everything feminism is trying to do grammar-wise here

Yeah I think that's a good example of a ""French brain"" vs an ""English brain"" - we have so little gender-marked language that the female forms are seen as being ""different"", and not that the masculine is the ""default"". I need to keep that in mind going forward (you can see I even plainly said it in the other thread) Honestly, outside he/she/they and his/hers/theirs (and other associated words) the English-speaking enby has it pretty easy, linguistically.

>I really mostly see the first one, and second/third used, the last ones are really anecdotal in my experience. But I kinda like all the creativity people put into it.

The interpunct forms are so bulky (volumineux?), though! Obviously I get 0 say as a non-native speaker but, still. I love the last one, personally. I think a (non-intentional) part of this non-binary movement should be to simplify language for everyone. I'll call up all my friends at the academie française and get them to put out nice non-gender-specific non-masculine forms for every gendered word tomorrow. :D

Ohohoh what can I use in place of monsieur/madame/mademoiselle for the students to refer to me? Other than ""prof"" (which I don't like because it doesn't work in Spanish) 
> the English-speaking enby has it pretty easy, linguistically. 

Yeah I know, us Frenchies tend to be quite jealous of you for that :p (But at the same time, we get to have fun creating fancy words and such, which can be a hassle, but also a real nice linguistic experience, if you’re into that sort of things)

&#x200B;

> The interpunct forms are so bulky (volumineux?), though! 

They are! You get used to it though, but I think it’s part of why I don’t like to use them for me.

&#x200B;

>I  think a (non-intentional) part of this non-binary movement should be to simplify language for everyone. 

Actually for some it’s very intentional! There are various… well I don’t know how to call that. Schools of thoughts, I guess? But anyway yeah, not everyone is on board with that specific goal, but it’s definitely something to work on for some.

&#x200B;

> I'll call up all my friends at the academie française and get them to put out nice non-gender-specific non-masculine forms for every gendered word tomorrow. 

Hahaha, oh dear. Seeing how the Academie Française was the one that banned the feminine version of some words (specifically autrice I mentionned, among a whole lot of other) and set up the rule of « masculine is the neutral because it’s more “““noble””” », and how the current Academie is vehemently against basically all attempts at making French more inclusive… Yeah, good luck with that :')

&#x200B;

> Ohohoh what can I use in place of monsieur/madame/mademoiselle for the students to refer to me? 

Aaaah good one! Lot of us just stole Mx from English. I’ve also seen « mamsieur » which I absolutely love (obviously a mix between « madame » and « monsieur »). I’ve also seen things like « misix », « monœstre » (based on old French for « mon être »), « mossim », and a bunch of others which I’ve forgotten because I’ve only seen them once or so
Mamsieur is way too close to ""ma'am"" in English for me :D. The more I think about it the more I'm coming around on just ""prof"". Monoestre is a beautiful word, though. 

Thanks again :) You're wonderful!

workplace transphobia wearing me down	"Trigger warning: workplace transphobia


So I work at a preschool where folks like to preach a lot about anti bias work - and notably they do really well in addressing BIPOC anti bias with kids so thats fantastic. But I continually experience microaggressions and rudeness around my nonbinary identity that escalated after i came out as Agender back in June. I've had teachers refuse to use my they them pronouns because ""its bullying"" and then referring to me as ""whatever you are"" and causing so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to move classrooms. Now I work with another teacher who is a cishet person who is constantly trying to micromanage my approach to care, always citing gender inclusion as the reason while she continues to dress children according to a binary of gender. But yesterday, she told me she heard me calling a child a ""they"" and that she wants us to eliminate that from the room because it would be offensive to families. 

I know this is minimal compared to what a lot of folks go through, but I'm just really upset about it and want a workplace where I don't get told my identity is offensive and where I have to watch folks deny children access to gender expansive practices and language."		zsvtb8	NonBinary	8	0.85	2022-12-22 20:21:45
Hi guys. My post asking about gender inclusive language on r/Spanish got removed despite not breaking any of the subreddit's rules. Just warning anyone who's learning Spanish and might be thinking of asking about this. Controversial, apparently		"I have a degree in Spanish and can confirm that in LGBTQ+ circles, they definitely get creative with new pronouns etc. 

Language is alive, it exists to describe reality. In some Amazonian languages, there is no word for icicle, they didn't need one because it wasn't a part of their reality. If one day it got cold in the Amazon, they would need a word for it. As such, with any type of change (social change in the case of a minority being recognised, more vocal, visible etc.), language evolves. 

This person obviously is not a linguist, but a grammatical prescriptivist (the enemy of true linguists lol).
As a Hispanic person, our community is overwhelmingly toxic to nonbinary people and it's a huge shame. So many people act like its about ""preserving the language"" but it's obvious that they just hate nb folks lmao
Ugh, as someone who spends most of their professional life in Spanish, this is a daily frustration for me. Spanish has so much potential to expand and allow for gender neutral language. Cultural hangups aside, from a purely linguistic/phonological perspective, Spanish absolutely CAN accommodate more neutral pronouns (like elle) and vowels (-e) pretty seamlessly. Young folks in Argentina have been doing this for a while! I'm in the US where you don't hear it much yet, but I've read every scrap of info I can find on the movement in Buenos Aires. It would be so amazing if the -e could spread and take root more broadly.

The good news is that prescriptivists' power erodes as soon as people start widely and continuously using new language features that fill a need! Sure, elle or amigue or alumnes haven't been part of the Spanish language since its inception, but people who actually know how languages work will get over themselves and appreciate that languages are forever evolving to fit the reality we live in, and you can't stop that evolution. We gender-expansive folks can keep the wheels turning by gradually blending -e into our speech where we have the opportunity! It would be a firm start to use it coloquially for mixed groups like amigues or chiques, then expand into more standard or professional settings. Use it! Make it visible! Normalize it! Celebrate it! We can make it happen (or at least gradually start happening)!
oof. that’s a pretty rigid view.
Gendered languages are so stupid. I could never learn french because they wanted me to memorize that a toaster is masculine.
That's really dumb. Btw I have the same problem with my native language and I use male pronons when speaking it. I guess male is just considered gender neutral for some reason (tho this probably isn't true for every language, but europian ones are pretty much a safe bet)

Sound like french. Don’t know in France, but in Québec (I’m from Québec), people seems to want to “preserve the french”. While I’m not found of the Iel neutral pronoun, I’m ok with using it if someone feel it suits them. But people are so against all form of gender inclusive form like, for exemple, “il/elle était beau/belle” it’s ridiculous.
Sounds fun lol. where are you from? I'm from Ireland so have only been in Spain (being in the EU and all) and know the most about Spanish culture. Spanish people usually seem super progressive in general? Then again I don't have any personal experience beyond surface level conversations (except for my Spanish teacher who does seem progressive?)
This is really reassuring, thank you! Part of what I said in the original post was that it seems like nearly no one (in my experience) even knows what gender neutral language is or what its purpose is in Spanish so I was wondering would it be weird to use -e if everyone I came across had no idea what I was saying. So it's nice to hear of someone else who uses it, and I look forward to reading about how people use it in Buenos Aires!
It's archaic and this person obviously thinks that being rigid with not accepting that languages change over time to accommodate new situations and circumstances is more important than creating an inclusive space for NB people.
Grammatical gender is not related to biological gender when not referring to people.. it's just a noun class system. What I was talking about was solely when referring to NB folk
In Spanish I know a few people use the suffix -e though (e.g. amigue) this person just doesn't want to let us progress I guess :)
I'm from the mainland US, but my family is Puerto Rican.
Sure, I think it'd be just like introducing any new language feature! I don't know in what contexts you usually speak Spanish or what occasions you might have to practice gender neutral language, but the easiest idea might be to use it colloquially and for mixed groups at fist- you could say things like ""vamos amigues!"" or ""hasta luego chiques"" (in conversation and in texts, etc.) and if anyone asks what the heck you just said, you could just explain it's a neat way that people in Argentina refer to a mixed-gender group. Before you know it, it might start catching on, then bleed into gender neutral singulars, adjectives, etc. It's just like any new term; I remember the first time my friend used the word ""yeet"", I had no idea what I was hearing, but when they explained it to me, I was like ""oh cool, yeah, there *should* be a word for that"". I can imagine a similar reaction from people who have flexible mindsets but aren't yet familiar with gender neutral Spanish. Hope that helps! Suerte!!

language zealots gonna zealot
I don't know what things are like over there I can really only say what little I know about Spain itself. I hope it gets better though 🥺
I'm kind of curious why people always refer to it in groups. The suffix -os is used for neutral in groups. It doesn't have to mean masculine. So ""amigos"" in my head is already neutral, and doesn't really need any adaption because I see it as inclusive since it is neutral. But I'm quite new to Spanish myself so I'm by far not the most educated about the Spanish language. 

I would only be thinking to use -e for myself as a NB person, and then also to refer to other people in singular so as to not just assume their gender.
That's awesome! Rock that -e for yourself! I always do too, when I'm around close Spanish-speaking friends who know I'm nonbinary. It feels amazing; better than they in English. I defaulted to suggesting neutral plurals as a start because of my own situation; I don't feel super safe to come out in my main Spanish speaking environment yet (i.e., work) so peppering in neutral plurals as the Argentines do is a way to ""plant the seed"" in a way that's easier for more conservative acquaintances and coworkers to swallow.

With regards to -os vs. -es, you're right that -o and -os are currently used as both markers of male-ness and of mixed-gender groups, as textbooks will corroborate (though so is -es sometimes, as in jugadores, estudiantes, proponentes). The new, gender-expansive Spanish coming out of Buenos Aires feminism just intentionally extends that -es ending to groups people with undefined/mixed/ambivalent genders (alumnes, niñes, esposes, tíes)... with the natural counterpart being -e for a single person of undefined/mixed/ambivalent gender (alumne, niñe, espose, tíe) like us! So while historically, the masculine endings -o and -os have doubled as the neutral endings for many words, the new gender-expansive language movement aims to reject the male-as-default rule and replace it with neutral-as-default. At least for nouns and adjectives that refer to people, haha. I don't think anyone envisions erasing grammatical gender and going around saying ""silles"" for ""chairs"" or ""basureres"" for trash cans 😅 All that being said, I just wanted to explain the thinking here, not to tell you what you *have* to use, because language doesn't work like that! An individual's language choices are entirely up to them! Only you can decide what words/endings you're comfortable using and when. Like how, while I love the ideas behind -e/-es, I use them very sparingly and strategically irl because of my delicate work situation. Thanks for engaging with this topic with me!!

I used the men's room tonight!	"I went to see a play at Emerson Paramount tonight. They are so forward about inclusivity - all the ushers wear a nametag+pronouns. The problem is that it is a Historical Register building, so there are only two multi-person single-gender bathrooms, and no feasible way to build any additional unisex one. 

I was strongly debating if I needed to use the bathroom enough to give in and use the women's one. I walked up to the door, and there was a sign on it encouraging people to use the restroom which affirmed their gender identity! (In pretty much those words). I had had a short discussion with a nonbinary usher just before the play, and they were still guiding people out, so I knew I had someone *official* for safety. So, I used the men's room.

Gender vs. Gender Identity	"I often find myself confused when gender and gender identity are listed as two separate things when people/companies talk about diversity and inclusion etc. It doesn’t feel that Inclusive to me to differentiate between the two. Why aren’t they the same thing? I.e. if I identify as female, male, non-binary, genderqueer, etc., then isn’t that just my gender plain and simple? It feels as though they’re talking about gender being men or women and gender identity to specify non-binary or trans people, like that’s just how we identify, but not really what we are 🤷

I’d love to hear others’ opinions on this, if I’m missing something, or misunderstanding the general concepts here, as I’m still learning about these things in general as I figure out my own identity. Thanks in advance!"	"Someone's gender """"""identity"""""" is their gender. Cis people are just invalidating af. That is exactly what they mean: we're all just men and women who *identify* as non-binary
For a long time people would use the terms Gender and Sex interchangeably to refer to biological sex. Unfortunately a lot of people still do. I believe this is why a lot of anti-LGBT+ folks can’t wrap their heads around transgenderism or pronoun use. For any allies who still do, they may have been using these words interchangeably and decided to include Gender Identity as a way to be more inclusive, when in fact they mean to ask about Sex and Gender.
According to the APA

Gender refers to the attitudes, feelings, and behaviors that a given culture associates with a person’s biological sex 

Gender identity is a component of gender that describes a person’s psychological sense of their gender.
>it feels as though they're talking about gender being men or women and gender identity to specify nonbinary or trans people, like that's just how we identify, but not really what we are

Totally agree with you on this. It's at best a failed attempt and at worst a pretense to be inclusive.
I think like another commenter said they are misusing “gender” when they mean “sex assigned at birth” (AFAB/AMAB). Source : worked in survey design and data science, this is a common mistake cis people make when designing surveys.
A better way to look at this is that gender and gender expression are two seperate things. 

Gender is what you feel, how you identify. Gender expression is more how you outwardly express that. The two aren't necessarily the same.

For example many nonbinary people feel they are agender, but have a masc, femme, or gender queer/f*ck expression.

The combinations are endless.
😔 yeah that’s how it feels to me. It’s a long old fight, eh 🙈
I think you unfortunately hit the nail on the head. I’ll give the companies partial credit for trying though 🙃
This makes a lot of sense to me, and I think you may be right. I’m considering questioning HR at my work to clarify what they mean when they say gender, and what they mean when they say gender identity. I’ll bet they have no clue and get totally flustered 😆 could be fun.
Using this definition it may be because they are trying to cover discrimination regardless of whether it’s about expressed or received gender. So for example a pre transition trans guy who isn’t out at work can receive misogynistic gender discrimination because of how others read his gender as being a woman. The discrimination is gender based even if it’s not based on his gender identity. Alternatively think about a cis guy who has a very femme/queer coded style of gender presentation—he might receive transphobic gender discrimination even though his gender identity is cis and male. Gender, especially when we are talking about discrimination, is about both who you are and about how people perceive you and the biases they bring to those perceptions and the law needs to cover all aspects of that.
100% agree. But I’m not referring to gender expression, only when people use the terms gender and gender identity to mean separate things. Completely understand that gender expression is a separate thing altogether.
It couldn’t hurt. I might even suggest sending a company memo to clarify their terminology so everyone can be on the same page!"	q77wae	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-10-13 10:02:18
Non-binary online clothes shopping.	"Dear friends. During ""Trans awareness week"" @madigan_lily said ""Instead of 'Men' and 'Women' try 'Everyone'. As in 'These cosy winter outfits can be worn by everyone'"".

As a digital designer, this got me thinking about how this would work in clothing e-commerce. How could a large, clothing brand better accommodate non-binary customers when the de facto solution is to separate their inventory into Men, Women & Children?

I'm appealing to the non-binary community here on Reddit to guide me to a solution. A solution which is inclusive of everyone, without overly complicating the filtering and sorting process. 

Can I please ask:

Is this a problem you feel passionate about? Does it even matter? 

Are there any online retailers which you feel have got this right?

Do you tend to buy your clothes from stores catering specifically to non-binary customers, or do you shop at general stores?

Is it problematic that 'men's clothes' and 'women's clothes' have (to my knowledge) different ways of describing the size?

How could it all be made easier?

Is there something you think I'm missing?

Thanks very much for your responses!"	"It’s not as simple as just eliminating the women’s and men’s designations on clothes. 

For “men’s” clothes to be wearable by everyone there need to be smaller sizes and some hip/waist variations. For “women’s” clothes to be accessible for all people there need to be larger sizes and sometimes increased shoulder proportions. 

Beyond size issues, it would be nice to see clothes with the colors/patterns/fabric variety of “women’s clothes” with men’s cuts. “Women’s” clothes often include masculine styles and colors, but “men’s clothes” have much less visual variety.
Yes this is something I’m pretty passionate about!! Ideally clothes wouldn’t be sized men’s and women’s but rather by unisex measures... sized for different body types, if you will. But I doubt business models will change anytime soon :/

I’d love to buy from nb-focused brands but usually clothes from big companies (and made using unfair labor practices) are cheaper and more affordable for my budget :/ so I usually just try to find whatever fits, often buying the smallest sizes in the men’s section, though it’s reeeeally hard to find men’s pants that accommodate my wide hips. 

If a brand wanted to be more trans/nb friendly while still keeping the “men’s” and “women’s” distinctions, maybe they could have their clothes ALSO modeled by the “opposite gender.”  Ex: a “men’s” shirt is shown on a cis male model, and it says “Brad is (xyz measurements) and is wearing a size M” or whatever? Well, ALSO show the same shirt being worn on a cis woman, AFAB NB person, or trans man... anyone with a more “traditionally feminine” body figure, so customers can gauge what size they would be! Hopefully that makes sense...
Not particularly? I buy clothes from general stores. If there's anything I'd want, it wouldn't be nonbinary-specific clothing, but men's clothes that were in smaller sizes and women's clothes in larger sizes as perhaps a way of catering to trans people? For example, men's shirts in xs or xxs could be more common and allow companies to retain their current clothes styles. 
it would be way better to just separate between adults and children and then further separate between how the clothes sit on your body instead of calling them male and female. it would also help for those not to be so different, both sections should have the same designs, just in different sizes.
I mix and match from general stores IRL and online.  I typically can find what I need to put outfits together.

It takes time to figure out the right sizes for some of it (having a hard time right now figuring out shoe sizes) but my bodyshape is somewhere inbetween, so maybe it's alittle easier than it would be for others.

Better size conversions online/instore would speed up finding the right fit for clothes as they are now.  Better build quality to some womens clothes, better colour and design variation on mens.
wildfang is my favorite as far as product presentation, tho they seem to target femme-types specifically, so it's not a perfect NB example. Their stock is largely NB, however (imo). they show models of many body types wearing the same garments, with options to look at the model's specific physical stats like height/weight. all online clothing retailers should do this, it's just smart business. 

additionally, wildfang has more casual options and a lower price point than others I checked out in this same space. 

i know little about Wildfang, never purchased from them, but was recently looking at NB online clothiers out of curiousity and they stood out to me as the one that's doing it right."	892kqv	NonBinary	9	1.0	2018-04-02 18:09:42
NB and self esteem	"I have struggled with poor self esteem and severe body dysmorphia for most of my life. I've always tried to be smaller, skinnier, prettier. I've tried to wear dresses that I hate and other clothes that make me look smaller but never have had the effect of erasing my fat that I wanted them to. I've struggled with eating disorders, CPTSD, and depression because of it. 

Now that I'm accepting myself as nonbinary I feel like I can finally embrace my body. Instead of seeing myself as a fat girl I can think of myself as having a dad bod and rocking a tank top and dad shorts. I can stop worrying about making my masculine features less obvious and start celebrating them. I'm not constantly thinking about food/my ED. I'm buying clothes that I'm comfortable in and not worrying about size. I'm finding joy in my feminine and masculine sides and all the stuff in between. I've hated my 'pretty' name all my life and now I can finally throw it away. I no longer have to be what a girl is ""supposed"" to be because I'm no longer a girl. It's an incredibly freeing feeling! 

My dysmorphia, mental junk, and ED will always be with me but for right now I feel almost comfortable in my skin for the first time ever. I'm just really happy and surprised about the direction this journey has taken me! 

Side note, I highly recommend the book The Body is Not an Apology by Sonya Renee Taylor. It is geared towards AFAB people but its super inclusive of all bodies, disabilities, and queerness. It's about loving your body as a form of anarchy and nothing has made me appreciate my body as much as this book has."	I'm so glad you're feeling happier!

Coming out at work. Advice for introverts?	"I'm AMAB non-binary and have been slowly but steadily presenting more androgynous at work. Laser and hormones are definitely doing their thing (5 months in, 6 mg E + 50mg Spiro). I have an amazing job, in a nominally supportive workplace, in a liberal city, in a liberal state. In my position as a technical writer, I even help our HR work on our gender inclusion policies!

So why the hell am I having trouble coming out? I haven't said anything at work, or expressed my they/them pronoun preference, or even told my closest colleagues. My boss is a bit of a question mark, and I think I'm weirding him out a bit, but everyone else seems fine. 

I'm relatively shy and I think I mostly fear making a big deal of myself to others, or appearing vain or self-important, or being typed as more femme than I am. I just want to come to work on whatever day wearing whatever classy office-appropriate clothes I feel like that day, without regard to gender. I want to use the full range of emotional expression without being typed as exclusively femme. I still value some things about my masculine past, but mostly am moving in a more feminine direction. 

Can I just continue being me without saying anything or making some sort of grand declaration? Or would it help everyone for me to have some sort of coming out? A couple colleagues have cleverly and subtly reached out to me to let me know they know and are supportive. For example, one of them texted me children's book recommendations about gender non-conforming families (I have a toddler at home). So it's clear that people have noticed stuff.

i've heard nibling and nephling for niece/nephew, but I'm not sure about aunt/uncle. i think i've seen auncle or something similar before but i'm not completely sure, it seems a bit clunky to me
I can’t find the video, but I saw someone on tiktok say Auncle and I kinda really liked it
I've seen ommer used in place of uncle/aunt,, sometimes abbreviated to omma
I've used nibling or niblets to refer to my nieces and nephews in the plural. I've heard the term auncle used for a gender neutral aunt/uncle, but I'm not out to my sister so I haven't used it myself. There aren't really many options.
I should have.. sorry.. thank you!"	lgeu9m	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-02-09 22:09:03
The big push against androgynous looks are borderline invalidating	I notice that there is a big push against the “stereotype” that non-binary equals androgynous. However, the reactionary movement against these claims seem to be indirectly invalidating androgyne non-binary folks. My gender is androgyne and I see a lot of comments and posts all over non-binary spaces that push against androgynous appearances and it feels invalidating. Does anyone else feel the same way? Is there a way to address stereotypes without making these spaces feel less inclusive?	"Thanks for addressing this, I never noticed it's AGAINST androgyny, so far all I've seen is you don't HAVE TO BE androgynous but it's perfectly fine if you are, can you send me an example of a post like this? That would be stupid as all expressions are valid and it's just very common to like being androgynous if you're non-binary, like that would go against a BIG PART of the community
enby spaces pushing messages such as “you don’t owe anybody androgyny!” is in direct opposition to cis people expecting that of all enby folk. your gender is for yourself; nobody owes anyone anything, but that’s what the nonbinary=androgynous stereotype pushes on all enby folk. you as an androgyne don’t “owe” that to anyone either! part of being nonbinary is to escape the oppressive nature of the gender binary, not to be generalized as a “third gender,” which is what the androgyny stereotype in part attempts to do. you think you misunderstand the message that stereotypes like this harm ALL of us. there is no erasure in this “big push”; promoting the inclusivity of all genders under the enby umbrella doesn’t actively do that. you can exist as an androgyne just as i can as a femm-presenting enby person! we’re all valid, despite any stereotypes that have to potential to say that any of us aren’t. we can fight for the whole without diminishing a part <3
For context, the post OP is implicitly referring to: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ennnnnnnnnnnnbbbbbby/comments/qe927p/to\_all\_the\_valid\_enbies/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ennnnnnnnnnnnbbbbbby/comments/qe927p/to_all_the_valid_enbies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  

OP, there seems to be a misunderstanding. **""Non-androgynous enbies are valid"" does not mean ""Androgynous enbies are not valid""**. It's really that simple. Please, take a step back and think about the kind of point you're trying to make.  

Concerning that ""big push"" by a ""reactionary movement"": can you please elaborate ? These accusations are a bit vague, and I if you have any evidence of this you should bring it up, because as far as I'm aware, this ""movement"" does not exist.

And last but not least : ""Is there a way to address stereotypes without making these spaces feel less inclusive?"" I mean, really ? Not the slightest bit of self awareness ?
I’ve seen a lot of articles and whatnot that do push androgyne as a stereotype rather than just one of many variations of being non-binary. I’m sure they mean well but it does feel invalidating."	qebjcz	NonBinary	8	0.62	2021-10-23 19:21:09

Possible Clothing Line - thoughts wanted!	"Hi folks - long time lurker on a lot of gender-related subreddits here, but first time reddit poster so bear with me haha...

Anyway, I'm a non binary MAAB art student who's thinking about creating a NB clothing line, and am looking for a bit of advice and input. I know that there's a few lines out there already, but what I've been seeing so far from places like Selfridges and Zara seems to be a samey and shapeless, tends to be pretty masculine in general and is seems quite expensive/inaccessible to your average person. The vision I've got in my head for this hypothetical line or label would be a bit more vibrant and interesting, form fitting and varied, with the aim of making it accessible to more people. I'd love for it be inclusive to all, and I know that there are also cisgender people out there that would like to have a ungendered option when it comes to shopping for clothes.

Personally in  the past I've found it pretty hard to find clothes that fit me well - I'm on the skinny side and only about 5'7-5'8 so I'm mainly left with the choice of getting something that fits really well from the women's department but might be too much on the feminine side cut or style-wise for me, or getting something with a more neutral cut or style from the men's department but having it hang off my body, so I'd like for it to be size inclusive and body positive for as many people as possible. Obviously there are practicalities to consider in terms of how many sizes of each item would be do-able as a newly started business/social enterprise, but inclusive is what I'd very much be aiming for as the core of the line.

The concept is that these are clothes for people, without boundaries, with the only separation being different kinds of cuts and styles - with the idea that one day anyone could walk into a high street store and shop in the clothes department and not feel left out or unwelcome. Anyway, that's my spiel haha, so I was wondering if anyone's got any thoughts on this idea? I'm aware that non-binary clothing isn't a new idea, and there are other things getting started up, but this isn't about rivaling them, just possibly adding my own ideas into the mix to give everybody more options to pick from. But yeah, if there's anything you'd really like to see or that you feel that isn't being catered to at the moment when you're looking for things to wear, I'd very much like to hear your thoughts! 
Again, first post on reddit so please go easy on me. Thanks :)"	"[Look to the future.](http://sttngfashion.tumblr.com/)
I think one of the most useful things you could do with any range you produced would be to focus more on having a broad shape/size range than a broad catalogue of choices.

To give an example on the curvy-bodies side of things, there is a shop called Bravissimo for people with very large breasts (like me) that also offers a clothing range.  The clothes are sized in two ways; traditional dress size, but also *curve ratio*.  So instead of the range being 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 etc, it's 8 Curvy, 8 Super Curvy, 8 Ultra Curvy, 10 Curvy and so on.  The company is limited - they do a very limited range of sizes and only cater to people who are both slender and large-chested, but the idea is great and the people I know who fit their clothes are *so freaking happy* to be able to buy things that fit them properly.

Personally, as an AFAB NB with a rather extreme size difference between bust, waist and hips and a plus-size body to deal with on top of that, I find it almost impossible to find clothes that physically fit on me that aren't dresses, or stretchy, feminine-cut items.  I would *love* to be able to wear a plain black masculine-style shirt that buttoned over my chest and waist and hips and didn't look like a tent on me.  Or proper below-knee board shorts that comfortably fit my hips and waist.  Or a waistcoat that fitted well and stopped on the mid-low hip instead of sitting above my gut in some weird failed attempt to ""flatter my curves"".

But like, take the template of a plain button-up shirt.  Size it by chest measurement and have a secondary size measurement for shape. 

There will be an additional challenge to this, of course.  People's body shapes are proportionately different in hips, waist and bust but also in shoulder width and arm size.  Which gives you a fair bit more size and shape variation to worry about.  But seriously, even if your clothing line totalled like 3 things, I'd buy them!
A bit late to the game here, but I've given this quite a bit of thought myself.

I'm no fashionista, so bear with me :)

I was thinking that 'bottoms' are pretty much already available; ladies/mens jeans, leggings/meggings, and I don't often wear skirts myself, but I don't think cutting them differently would make them suit my figure more or less than they already do or don't.

The issue starts at the shoulders. My shoulders don't fit properly into tops or self-described for women, often clothes I like are designed for more busty people than I. The sleeves are always too short. I'm sure everyone else reading this has the same or opposite problem, so no need to go on, I'm sure.

So, my thoughts.

Firstly, a range of t-shirts cut for men, but in more feminine fabrics. Floral fabrics have been in for a while, but generally in more subdued colours and as an accent rather than a theme. Also necklines in more neutral designs, low, but not so low as to show the décolletage I don't have! This range could easily be adapted to suit female-bodied people looking for a more masculine look.

Secondly, dresses with broader shoulders and longer sleeves, and a straighter cut over the hips. Again, necklines are often a problem.

Lastly, shoes. I wear a UK size 8 in most open shoes, but they always tend to be designed for Amazon's or drag queens. What about a nice pair of ankle boots with a good 2-3 inch wedge or chunky heel in a size 9 or 10? Maybe they're out there and I just don't know where to look.

Anyway, that's my 2 pence worth. Hope it helps!
I'm a huge fan of the somewhat genderless styles of Yohji Yamamoto and other deconstructionist japanese designers.  Lots of draping and layers, dark colors, etc.  It all seems very androgynous to me.
Yes! That would be awesome.
Fuck yes. I love Star Trek so much.

Yes please. A floral print tee shirt is something I've specifically been wanting for a long time."	4tn0i0	NonBinary	9	1.0	2016-07-19 19:30:44
Looking to talk to hr about educating team members and leaders about pronouns to create a more inclusive environment and open up discussions regarding pronouns and such.	"What are some good resources that I could use? There are a few books I have in mind so far and the hrc website, but any others I should include or avoid?

Also, what would make or break your work experience as far as pronouns and being properly referred to? I would like to use these points to help demonstrate why this is so important. Also anything that would have helped you understand the concept better in the first place.

I am mainly looking to help foster a more inclusive environment and open up a discussion on a store level so all of us working here, both those who fall into more gnc roles and those who don't, feel more comfortable and understood. 

Thank you all so much for your time and help on this. Any information you share will be used anecdotally, but I WILL NOT be sharing any specifics, names, or anything else.

Thank you!"	"I'm all for awareness and training, but please remember to make the disclosure of pronouns voluntary and optional. If including pronouns in email signatures or on nametags is a requirement, then you're basically forcing people to either out themselves or explicitly consent to being misgendered, neither of which is ok.
Is this about increasing the knowledge in the workplace around pronouns in general or is this about laying the groundwork for conversations about your pronouns? General education should be simple reminders that some people different pronouns than you might expect, talk about people how they ask to be addressed, make single occupancy bathrooms all gender. If it’s about your pronouns then it depends on how you want to come out at work
Honestly I feel like this would either be helpful or make everyone hate you like where I'm from I could feel the eye rolls just reading that, but other places could be more accepting I am from the Bible belt
Thank you, this is a really good point and not something that I thought about. I will make sure to bring this up.
Thank you for your response. I am already out at work, and am looking to help educate other coworkers about pronouns and gender identity and to open up communication in general on the matter.

Traveling While Trans	"I’m traveling for a relative’s wedding for the first time in a reeeaalllyyy long time and wondering if anyone has any safety tips/ reassurance to offer around traveling anxiety about transphobia.

I live in a really queer inclusive city and rarely leave. When I do take road trips I try not to stop unless I really have to (and only use restrooms that are unattended/ single stall whenever possible). But this trip involves plane travel, TSA, staying at a location that will probably be mostly older cishet couples, sharing a hotel room with a relative, having to wear a swimsuit in public, and no one except me is queer as far as I know. 
(For context: I dress pretty butch, have a low voice/visible body hair, and noticeable boobs so I get stares if people look long enough to notice and usually causes either homophobia or trans confusion depending on how I’m read). 
I guess I’m mostly nervous about bathrooms and any other trouble especially when I’m away from the group, but don’t really know what to expect. 

Anyone have any advice or experience here? Am I worried for no reason?"	"is your voice/body hair from testosterone? 
pre-T i was seen as a butch woman and had no issues with planes, TSA, swimming, or bathrooms. after being on T, i got some weird comments in womens bathrooms and started exclusively using the mens bathrooms and locker rooms.
Assuming you're in the US... PreChek makes TSA much easier. But in general, air travel isn't bad. Other travelers are busy and in their own heads. And the employees are trained to be respectful.
Just circling back to say thanks and it went well! A few weird situations but since I was traveling in a group no real trouble.
As a non binary person on e I have had identical experience and now use the women's restroom.  The body hair going away plus boobs means I get less flack in the woman's than men's,. Especially when wearing a mask."	xpv07r	NonBinary	8	1.0	2022-09-27 22:37:10
Creating A Fully Inclusive Underwear Brand... I Need Your Input!	"Hello everyone! Please kindly correct me and educate me if I use any incorrect language, I mean no offense if any is taken!

I'm working on creating my own underwear and clothing line, and I'm realizing the huge gap in the market for inclusive products for gender non-confirming and trans. I've been researching and developing menstruation underwear in boxer and brief styles for AFAB persons, and would love to know if any of you have suggestions for products you would like to see.

I want to create a space and store that lovingly welcomes every size, shape, color, and character, please help me make it a reality!"	"Sexy lingerie sets where the panties come with FRONT POUCHes. Like, OMG I want to look sexy but not have my cock and balls fall out the front of the panties. Sad
Maybe some cute regular boxers? I feel comfy in regular men's boxers (like shorts) but it seems impossible to find cute boxers. There is just mostly solids and plaids.
[deleted]
Packing underwear, especially packing underwear in larger sizes. Most brands of packing underwear max out at average or even below average sizes. Like, I don't even qualify as overweight in terms of BMI, and yet even I can only find one brand that fits my hips. People who actually are larger are SOL, and that's ridiculous.
Boxer briefs that are made to fit more feminine bodies. Wider or more moveable legs. Higher waist bands. No slit but still an area for a packer. Personally for menstruation built in simular to reusable pads would be nice, but more affordable since I mean you do have to change them... Personally I also would love male style underwear that it's easier to put a liner or pad in too.
I would absolutely LOVE some menstruation underwear in a boxer-brief style! I love your idea, It’s so difficult to find menstruation products that are gender-neutral or masculine. As a non-binary AFAB person who prefers to wear boxer-briefs I would really appreciate any menstrual products like that that would help affirm my gender and identity. Hope this is helpful, best of luck to you in this endeavor ♡
Omg if you could make boxer briefs that soaked up menstrual blood like BamBody (a line of fem period undies) I would be OVER THE MOON excited 😍
I'd take a look at tomboyx's line of menstruation boxers, etc
What a fantastic idea. There is certainly a market for this, and it will only grow. I would love to see a more masculine design made with a feminine material or pattern. Like lace boxer briefs, or ones with really gorgeous floral patterns. The opposite would be really fun as well. Like a feminine set of underwear in plaid or something. Some gender neutral sheer nightgown type options would also be something I'd love. I really like the way long, flowy fabrics balance my amab frame.
I’m looking for seamless, mostly cotton boxer briefs that fit a curvy body.
Definitely! :) Thank you very much for your input, this is exactly the kind of products I've been looking into making as well... We want to tease, not give it all away!
Of course! I would love to get creative with colors and prints for them :) There isn't nearly enough variety to begin with, even for male-presenting
I'm definitely going to try and see how much I can include in one pair! An opening for STP devices might be tricky with trying to keep them leak-proof, but I will definitely try to figure it out, and can certainly make sure we have a line of easy access flys. A pocket on either style shouldn't be an issue, and I will plan to include it as an add-on to most styles :)
I agree, that is ridiculous! I'm hoping to provide custom sizing options as well as a wide range of petite and larger sizes :) shop sizes are made for models! Let's create some pieces for beautiful beings of all sizes. Out of curiosity, what are the largest sizes you've seen from them? Let's crush it ;)
Thank you very much, I can't wait to make it available to you! Menstruating is uncomfortable enough as it is... Especially if you're forced to wear something that doesn't feel right to you. I'm excited at the thought of how comfortable I could help make people in their own bodies
I'm aiming for as much as possible! :) I'll definitely look into them, and see if I can find the best absorbent material
Thank you :) I really love that store, they're very inclusive. However their menstruation line is different from the one that I'm working on. Their pairs contain a floating gusset that still requires hygiene products to be used, which typically use heavily feminine-based marketing, and can be bulky and uncomfortable. I'm hoping to create a line that uses leak-proof gussets to remove the need for pads and liners, and feels more natural to those wearing it
Please put my u/n on a list and reach out when you go live. I mean I have scraped the web as best I could and found nothing like this. I resorted to buying a sewing kit and I think I'll have to just start making my own front pouches to stitch in but like ... that's no where near as nice 😕
Thank you! There really isn't, just briefs, boxer briefs and very few choices in regular boxers.
You are a real-life superhero ♡
Hell yeah! They did recently release a leak proof line, but diversity in options and styles would be a huge win. Keep us updated!
I've got your u/n saved :) Hopefully I'll be able to save you from some DIY-ing in the future! What sort of styles were you looking for? Lace, straps, velvet, satin, bows or bling? I'd love to go all out on them
I like lace a LOT. There's a lot of stuff on Amazon filtered to Prime delivery only that shows up under ""lingerie sets"" which looks great and comes with a bra, panties, and sometimes stockings and garters. I really really really love matching sets. Some of it has bows but it's mostly lace and designs that incorporate lace that I like. 

Here are some things I've bought or saved recently:

I'm not as big a fan of padded bras just because my breasts are still super tiny as I haven't been on HRT long, and it just makes them look small ... but there aren't many great examples of those. I guess not a lot of places stock 36A. 

But for sexier times, I love the half cup or no cup look:

I mean, I have thought about starting a brand like this where the styles are the same but ""front pouch"" is an option. I really think there's a niche that's entirely unfilled. But for me it's about availability,  not money. So, by all means go for it!
You've got amazing tastes! Thank you very much for sharing those with me, I'll add them into my research :) I would love to make matching sets like these available to everyone, no matter their sizes or identity. Everybody should be able to have some pretty lace pieces in their wardrobe!"	nl38r7	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-05-25 23:43:43
