Annoyed at folks who think my gender expression ‚Äúgives our community a bad name.‚Äù Why are you doing all the work for the phobic cishets?		"Which part of it is giving us a bad name? If being a hot, monstrous goth is wrong then I have no chance of ever being right.
Anyone who prioritizes licking the boots of our oppressors over celebrating our full and beautiful diversity is broken beyond measure.
lmao whoever said that is a dingus head. Any intolerance actively brings a community down. Honest self-expression does the very opposite, so I'd say you're giving the community a better name by just being openly you. Also you're super beautiful!!!
It‚Äôs not your job to be an ‚Äúambassador‚Äù for enbykind.  You keep rocking that look because hot damn the world is a richer place with that particular texture added to it.
You look like a haunting astral deity that I wish would visit me in my dreams!
Fuck those people! You look amazing!
I think the term is SLAY!!!
Can I follow you on social media somewhere to see more pictures? I'm feeling p gay
Being nonbinary has nothing to do with sertain types of presentation!  I personaly think you are mega hot in this outfit!
OMG bitchhhh, you look amazing!
You look fine to me?
They're just jealous of your fucking hot looks. You give us a bad name because bad is fucking hot
There are assholes in every community, even those communities that should know better than to gate keep or punch down. These assholes are insecure and become cruel in the face of confidence. You scare them. 

Keep scaring them. #gothNB4life
tbh if anything you're doing us a favor w that look
Gosh this look is gorge and you're so right!
I absolutely love your makeup, your whole style in general! Gender expression shouldn't affect how people think of our community, and even if they think it does and they look at your gender expression, they should instantly think ""Hey! This community is badass and don't take shit from no one!"" Keep living your life, you look great and your gender expression is soooooo valid!
 Oh wowwww your style is on point- the makeup's giving me comic book vibes tbh and I kinda love it?
Yes but at some point, some people don't want to be extravagant and just live their lives. Not being noticed... You have to see both sides of the story
It used to be that in order to be trans and be An assimilationist you had to be binary. I guess even non-binary trans folks can be assimilationists now.
Thank you for the validation üôÇ
Thank you üôÇ
I NEEDED THIS
Thank you for your kind words. I try not be an ambassador. I Really try to Express viewpoints from my individual perspective and not from the perspective of all non-binary people. Thank you.
Be careful what you wish for *spooky haunted house music plays*

In seriousness though, thank you, darling!
Yes! All the more ghostly apparitions to join me in the nether world once the bigots are slain.üòÇ

Thank you!!! I have so much fun expressing this way!
Lol sure. Instagram I‚Äôm @mx.hijinx
That‚Äôs what I thought! Goth exclusionists. Or maybe it‚Äôs the collar and leather community associations i dunno wtf it is tbh
What does that have to do with me? How does that make me harmful to the community?
Oh yeah, the nonbinary assimilationists are definitely around, these days. Disappointing bc I too remember when assimilationists wouldn't touch nb with a ten foot pole... Wish they'd go back to that. Fuck them tho, your style is phenomenal.
Say it with me people ""Magneto Was Right"".

"I hate the defence people give to older people who are phobic. Saying ""it's just their generation""."	"I hate the excuse/pass people give old phobic people saying,  ""it's just their generation"", that's bullshit to me. If they want to be a homophobe, racist or otherwise be against human rights that's on them. I refuse to give people the escape route of hiding in ""their generation"" to avoid their unhealthy mental attitude as an individual. 

All that it says to me is that people believe you should respect ""elders"" even if they don't respect you.  Respect should be something earned, not given out because you're ""old"". 

So before you jump to the defence of a discriminating older person because they're old. Look at them like an individual and recognise that their actions are their own and not their generation. And hold them accountable as individuals."	"exactly, older people get their panties in a bunch if people don't ""respect"" them, but I have a hard time respecting somebody who doesn't respect me back.
Also everybody bears the individual responsibility to educate themselves and become a better a person, so all that tells me is that you don't care enough about others to google a thing or two ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I also hate when they go ‚ÄòThat stuff didn‚Äôt exist in my day‚Äô as a point to dismiss it as something new or a phase.

Like, mother fucker yeah it did! What, did we just randomly pop into existence on Y2K?
Older people have had more time to realise how wrong they are so in a way it's worse.


You're right about respect it doesn't matter if that person is my elder or my boss they won't automatically get my respect. That doesn't mean I'm disrespectful, I'm only disrespectful when the person turns out to be a bigot or is disrespectful to me or others which I think is one of the many reasons I don't last very long in a job.
I think there's some nuance to how we should handle such things. The ""it's just their generation"" escape hatch is a giant crock of garbage and should be much reviled as an excuse. People in the majority and in power are always looking for ways to minimize the responsibility they have to take for their destructiveness and are basically gaslighting the people they hurt by pretending that hurtfulness is relative to the attacker's perceptions, not the victim's.

Still, no one is truly self-created, we all find context in our culture. It's not acceptable to say that, because an entire generation was mercilessly inhumane to trans people, that an individual from that generation should get a free pass, but it's still the case that people are influenced by what surrounds them and have been programmed in ways they may not even realize are harmful to others.

I think it's important to build bridges to older generations in trying to make a better society, but the first thing that needs to happen is that these older folks need to acknowledge that their generation was **wrong**. We can't get anywhere useful without that. Problem is, people often take umbrage to the idea that something they've spent their entire lives believing or associating with is bad.

It's no one's job to ""teach justice"". You don't have to teach an old person that it's wrong to hate you just because they don't already know. At the same time, let's acknowledge that sometimes teaching must be done, by someone at some point, in order to normalize relations with people who are abusive to us and think it's actually about themselves. Is that unfair? Oh, most definitely, yes. And it doesn't **need** to happen, some old folks will believe horrible things, then they will die, and that will have to do. For others who might be swayed or who genuinely don't understand how their perspectives are harmful, though, we do need to recognize that the world they see through their eyes is different than the one we see, and is colored by an upbringing in the past that, since we didn't experience it, we could never truly understand.

My favorite rebuttal to crap like ""These things didn't happen **back in my day!**"" is to have copious examples of precisely those things happening looooooong before their day :). Yeah, some (maybe most?) people will double down, and those people suck. Some folks, however, will pause and say ""...Oh."" Those are the folks who could be de-programmed from ""it's just my generation!"" nonsense.
I agree, it should never be an excuse not to try to change. I admit I'm pretty patient, maybe too patient, if the person isn't ""there yet"" but is trying to understand. I get that to some extent everybody's a product of their environment and one of the many moving parts of that is the times you grew up in. I also know that the older you get, the more work it is to change. I factor it into my expectations of someone. But at bare minimum I still expect them to at least make an effort. And if you actually care about other people, it's not *super* hard no matter how old you are.

I agree about respect too. It's scary to get old, old age makes you vulnerable as fuck, and it does change how you look at shit. But again, no matter how old, you can at least make the effort to treat other people like human beings. I have relatives who are in their seventies and in pain all the damn time who still manage to give at least as much respect as they ask for.
I had an amazing boss who would always call this out. She's a straight cis boomer, but has worked so hard to become a fantastic ally, and she always calls out that age and generation are no excuse for bigotry.
If it was ""just their generation"" then my aunt's father (who was born in the late 1930s) would have kicked her out for being lesbian instead of being super supportive of her up until his death (including helping with her wedding). It's not the generation they're just assholes
Agreed, and I‚Äôve met lots of older people who actually ARE accepting because that‚Äôs just how they are.  Age is no excuse for hate and rejection.
exactly! i‚Äôve seen old people be really accepting and i‚Äôve also seen young people be really transphobic. age plays no part in whether or not you‚Äôre a bigot.
Why do you deserve respect? All you did is not die for decades

E: the ‚Äúolder generation‚Äù
I will only say thy, older generations will not change their minds but die and give place to new generations which might accept new principles (like the true flat earth humans)
It truly just shows the character of the person defending them and of the ‚Äúelder.‚Äù A true elder would understand the importance of growing and learning everyday of your life. If you aren‚Äôt willing to accept and embrace change you will be unhappy because change is inevitable (ever heard of entropy?)
I was thinking about this the other day. So my grandparents' generation (WW2 era), I could sort of understand how they grew up in a time where like, segregation was legal, gender roles were strict and unbending, their religion was important, etc. and a lot of them just refused to accept that the world changed without their consent. Not to give them a pass, but to understand kind of why they were the way they were. But my parents' generation (baby boomers) came of age in the 60s/70s-- my mom turned 18 in ""the summer of love"" 1969-- they were the original hippie flower children, pushing for revolutionary change. And yet they keep looking down on Millennials and Gen Z advocating for the same types of changes. Makes absolutely zero sense to me. I just hope someone slaps me if I get that way when I'm older.
My current partner is 43 and is accepting of LGBT people and me being nonbinary/trans as well as bi (he's also bi). 

Age is not an excuse unless it's a small child who doesn't know the implications of what they're saying or they're being brainwashed by bigoted parents.
A little story time.  My father‚Äôs church was having a meeting to vote if they would allow gay marriages at the church.  The 80+ year old matriarch of the church stands up and a lot of people tense up for a heated argument.   She says ‚Äúwhat are we voting, I thought we voted on this a few years back!‚Äù   Pastor: ‚Äúno that was a vote on if we would be ‚Äòopen and affirming‚Äô to LGBT people‚Äù. matriarch ‚Äúwell this is stupid! of course they can get married here, let‚Äôs get this vote over with and go home.‚Äù  Then a congregation mostly boomers and older easily voted for gay marriage at their church. 

So moral here don‚Äôt assume people are bigoted by their age and yeah it‚Äôs not ‚Äú just their generation‚Äù
As someone from ‚Äòthat‚Äô generation I know and have experienced the culture of hatred and rejection, but what I find even sadder is the toxic relationships I have witnessed between the various trans factions towards each other.  This I don‚Äôt understand!
I don‚Äôt* need old people to like me or believe I exist, I just need them to not fire me or evict me or like murder me and shit.

There are battles I don‚Äôt need to fight like changing every single heart & mind. You can believe I‚Äôm a f** going to hell so long as you let me live my life in peace while you believe it.

They only ""didn't exist"" because they were terrified of their lives falling apart and getting shipped off to ~~conversion torture~~ therapy if anyone found out.
Even if trans people were summomed this millenia, candy crush or facebook didn't exist back in their day, yet they seem willing to use both.
> Older people have had more time to realise how wrong they are so in a way it's worse.

Unfortunately, human psychology doesn't really work that way mostly :(

Our minds are trying to find comfortable patterns to exist in so they can do less work and consume less energy. We seek patterns we can get used to so we can stop thinking about them.

This leads to the phenomenon of old people who are somehow flabbergasted about anything that's different from what they already know. I personally know entirely too many older folks who practically needed to be restrained by friends and loved ones in order to stop them from gallivanting about supermarkets, shopping malls, and museums when COVID began. ""What do you mean, we can't leave? But, but... **that's what we do**.""

It just kind of looks like a death wish to people who are wondering how their sharp, responsible parents could be so unfathomably stupid, but really, something major changed in their lives, and it's been so long since their way of life was disturbed in this way that their brains are slow in realizing they can't just lean on their comfortable patterns anymore.

From my anecdotal point of view, it does seem like older people have a tendency to be so ingrained in their patterns that they haven't had directed thought about contemporary social issues in decades. Sure, there are plenty of older folks who are still very engaged on that front, but I'm sure you know quite a few who seem basically clueless too.
I think this is really really well put. Very nuanced. I will say, in response to the idea that we shouldn't gave to teach people justice while surviving our own oppression, I think that's where allies come in. I honestly believe *they* should be the ones having a majority of these discussion with older folks. It isn't as taxing on them to actually have to take homophobic abuse or microaggressions or explain a basic concept (at least basic to us) for the millionth time (like we often have to do). It is incredbly exhausting. No minority should be obligated to teach their opppressor how to not oppress them. Many do, out of a need for survival, but this is where I think allyship becomes important. We all have straight cis relatives, and some of us have cishet relatives who are supportive. What would it be like if *they* took up that responsibility? Helping someone stuck in their ways to see differently, especially when a lot of this can be overwheming to them, would be great. Often times these people need someone to walk alongside them, and I think educated cishet allies are a good option. There are also elderly people who are also allies or okay with queer people for the most part. I just feel like if most cishet people who claimed to be supportive of the LGBTQIA+ community spoke up, this wouldn't be as much of a problem.
I think the main problem is that ""respect your elders"" doesn't just mean ""treat them gently and with respect"" it now means ""you are not allowed to disagree with or criticize old people, even if they're being horrible or screaming at you.""
This is the truth
> To prevent anymore lost limbs throughout Reddit, correctly escape the arms and shoulders

I call BS, /u/LimbRetrieval-Bot. If we correctly escape the arms, then they would be lost, wouldn't they?
A lot of trans people just HARD stealthed as well.
Yeah, and the horrible part is we're *still* not completely past it. Especially not with how things have been going around the world in regards to trans stuff. (Trump admin's 'religious freedom' protections, pervasiveness of TERF rhetoric in the UK, LGBT-free zones, etc.) 

(Put some sensitive stuff in the spoiler tags. TW/CW for detrans talk.)

Wait, what?	https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cisphobia	"eye‚Äî no words this isnt even what cis means üò≠üëçüèæ
That must be super fucking hard for them, I can't even imagine
I mean you took this from from urban dictionary where anyone can submit‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hardly surprising that people have submitted homophobic/transphobic stuff.

While the example given is rather stupid, at the most charitable I think there are some things that we as a community can keep in mind such as constantly making ‚Äúthe straights‚Äù jokes around people could make some uncomfortable. But all in all this is just a bigoted person submitting a word to an open site
Alex should search term transphobic, that's what this situation shows.
So first it was ""Superstraight"", and now they are victimizing their homophobia. Truly pathetic.
Isn't this site like a joke? Literally none is mad as someone for not dating trans women as long as they're not transphobic
This is hysterical
Sounds like some butthurt cis guy wrote this
Trying to dunk on homo- or transphobic like that is just silly. While the word was coined to linguistically resemble disorders like agoraphobia, this was just a stylistic choice, presumably because it was clever and sounded good. Clearly the way we use it means hatred and oppression towards and not clinical fear of.
Ah yes, you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt agree‚Äù on my lifestyle choices. Interesting way to say ‚ÄúI think you shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äù 
Crazy how they word it as if they don‚Äôt actively try to ruin our lives -_-
r/persecutionfetish
While hatred towards straight or cis people exists and is very wrong, this was clearly written by someone with less than appealing opinions towards lgbtq+ people. Someone who also happens to not understand the difference between gender identity and sexuality.
No such thing at all üòë
These people really just wanna be the victim of every narrative. They can't see beyond the blinds they put on themselves and then proceed to blame us.
I can‚Äôt really imagine a fear of straight white males being irrational
this is *hilarious*

obviously written by a cishet white dude in a rage, as this sounds more like a rant than a dictionary entry and he couldn't even take the time to get his spelling & grammar right üòÇ
Nah because isn‚Äôt Phobia a fear, distaste, or prejudice towards anything? Like you have arachnophobes who aren‚Äôt scared af by spiders, but hate them with all the being?
Cis people aren‚Äôt scary! They‚Äôre just a little more boring than us üòÇüò≠
Fellas, is it gay to like women?
Oh no, looks like I need to make an apology on Twitter
I can already tell the dude who made the definition is a cishet guy who goes onto LGBTQ+ safe spaces and attacks people.
Okay, but that would be *hetero*phobia, not *cis*phobia. What is this?
It was over once the word ""community"" got quotation marks
The oppressors will always do ""reverse"" anything
This is so damn wrong... Who the hell calls us phobic of cishets?! Our hatred for the ones who have hated us isn't irrational! Especially knowing that many of them have hurt us deeply!
He misspelled ""I'm pissing and crying and crying and pissing and pissing and crying and crying and pissing (etc. etc. etc.)""
Disliking cishets seems pretty rational tbh.
I love how the Urban Dictionary OP threw in a ""white"" in between ""straight male"" in his example. Way to be subtle about his self victimization complex, can't wait for him to rant without an ounce of irony about sigma Chad propaganda or some other deranged shit like that. 

(I get that it may just be there for the blue link to work, but that just solidifies the joke for me.)

ETA: ok I hadn't even noticed the word salad of trans women and homophobia before like this kid is a *mess*
Im absolutely cisphobic. I think it qualifies as a legit phobia. I feel vastly unsafe around straight white people.
I think it comes from the 100% of hatecrimes commited by cis ppl lmao
Some people really want to be oppressed dont they?
It wasn't right at first place but somehow it managed to become even more wrong
Guys this is no laughing matter!! Wont anyone think of the poor oppressed straight white males?? This cisphobia will not stand/ s
I think some straight people are scary.
See, but it would have to be -irrational- and that‚Äôs the key

Don't know what you expect from a website where anyone can write a definition for anything
Last I checked, queer people can technically be straight‚Ä¶.
Trans and homophobe don't go together. This is also not what cis means. Also trans women are not men and STRAIGHT men can still be sexually attracted to them and not to men. And where the hell does white come into this. The irrational fear of straight people would be HETEROPHOBIA. Cisphobia would be the irrational fear of people who feel like the gender of their sex. Sheesh learn English before making these idiotic posts. I'm talking about urban dictionary poster.
This is honestly the first shitty thing I've seen on Urban Dictionary... yikes.
I'd say fear of cis people is nearly always rational.
LMAO
 r/AreTheCisOk
There's so many things wrong with this one screenshot. Not knowing what cis actually means, implying that trans women are men, the obvious ""us straight white men are the victims"" nonsense... I can't even fathom the amount of wrong in this image.
There's no part about being afraid of cis-het white males that is irrational.
I have a rational fear of straight cisgendered white men. Does that still count?

I quote contra saying this on the daily
I think I had a submission to Urban Dictionary rejected one time, But that doesn't say much as I'm not sure I actually even used any words in it, So I wouldn't be surprised if all they do is check to see if it has actual words and if it does allow it. (I would say check if it's intelligible, But they accepted this definition which obviously isn't.)
I pose an alt to the straights since trans folks can be straight: 

CisHets. Get em in the specifically painted target
Odd, I could go tell my straight friend he's a dumbass straight and offends me and he'd laugh. Some of them have spines you just gotta accept nothing less
Technically it‚Äôs trans phobia ü•≤

I know this is ironic but not 100% close though, because people have the idea of ""Not being trans enough"" etc
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

Right? Next thing you know they'll be trying to protect kids from The Cis! Can't even imagine what these poor people must be going through üòî /s
And so I can with my friends and via versa. The whole point is that you can still make those jokes but just be mindful of other too.

Sometimes people say things without thinking if its going to mean something deeper whether that be about some personal matter or about their gender, race etc. Sometimes its just good to think first
Exactly got homophobia and transphobia mixed up
Nah, a phobia is an aversion, it covers a wide range of negative emotions from fear to hatred and disgust. The usage of it to strictly mean fear is popular, but wrong.
John Hopkins definition: phobia is an uncontrollable, irrational, and lasting fear of a certain object, situation, or activity. This fear can be so overwhelming that a person may go to great lengths to avoid the source of this fear. One response can be a panic attack. This is a sudden, intense fear that lasts for several minutes. It happens when there is no real danger.
I dont think trans people are murdering each other over ""not being trans enough,"" though.

I feel you. On a weight loss journey as well. Wish you the best with your weight loss goals!"	wl0iyi	NonBinary	78	0.97	2022-08-10 15:35:54
Had a really tough week, overheard some trans and Non-binary phobic comments (not about me) on Wednesday and it's affecting me a lot more than I expected üò© ü•∫. Trying to make myself feel better now it's over with a chilled afternoon watching movies in my comfy leggings and fluffy socks ‚ò∫Ô∏èüåà		"Hang in there and remember- no amount of unkind words can damage someone's validity. We know what we're about, and mebbe someday, so will they!
My dad's side of the family is pretty anti-LGBT+, so I can understand being hurt and just having to plow through it. Remember, there's also some pretty awesome other folks out there though who aren't so one sided though. I hope you have the opportunity to meet them. You just keep doing you.
Show us dem fluffs!!
It caught me by surprise a bit cos I'm used to hearing similar with working in a mostly middle aged cis environment where there's a lot of toxic masculinity. It really hurt me to overhear it this week though so it's lovely to have such a lovely and reassuring message. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫
Thank you so much, it really means a lot to have people there to support me ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.

I guess a positive way to spin it is to think that it looks like, after a lot of trying to figure out who I am, if I'm troubled this much by negative statements about Non Binary folk  then I've probably found somewhere I feel I fit in well. Thank you again for your lovely message ü•∫
Well, that's the first time anyone's asked me for feet pics. Better get to work on getting my Only Fans set up üòúüòÇ.

living with phobic family sucks but at least my mother has stopped asking me to shave.		"I'm glad you're getting a modicum of freedom. Looking great!!
we love to see it!! i cant wait for my parents to stop asking lol, so good for u!!! <3
so proud of u for staying strong !! :3 facial hair looks nice
thanks!! 
i am greatful for the small freedoms but i can't wait to be out on my own again since total freedom was bliss.
thanks!!! 
i hope your parents stop asking soon and if they don't that's their issue. 
going to pass on some advice i got from an older cousin of mine ""you're cool, fuck anyone who says you aren't cause they're not cool""
thank you!! 
ngl it's been a struggle but just focusing on getting out at the moment has been a great help.
Hopefully it happens soon for you. Nothing better than being free and being able to be yourself

The only argument I hear against non-binary people is ones that were used against transgender, gay and black people.	Most people don't realize that they are just phobic of non-binary people.	"There is definitely a class of person who experience distress when they encounter someone who isn't ""following the rules.""

That their version of ""the rules"" totally suck never seems to occur to them...
Definitely. And in certain circles, they never stopped using them against binary trans people, gay people, black people, ... any marginalised group, really.
well i'm pretty sure a black person was never told they don't exist.
That's quite an advance on anything I've heard if there are actual arguments. All I hear is disbelief and confusion. The closest approaches to a coherent argument come from TERFs, and they are trying to frame it as everyone being non-binary.
They were told that they weren't people. Anyway, the point was that people being discriminated against isn't new, yet somehow nobody ever learns."	78usyv	NonBinary	56	0.96	2017-10-26 11:02:15

My mom is being lowkey phobic about my Bonnaroo outfit‚Ä¶		"Does she think if ur anything other than cishet ur just going to have sex willy nilly??? Or am I jumping to conclusions and ur fine with her thinking about ur sex life lol. Anyway, my only suggestions is maybe wear some longer tight underwear if ur not used to walking around in warm weather and a skirt as the chaffing can get intense oof (the outfit is absolutly wonderful btw <3)
you look so cute!! love the fit!!
Idk what do y‚Äôall think? Am I handling this right or should I ‚Äúease up‚Äù on her? I know she‚Äôs gonna tell me I‚Äôm overreacting and assuming things about her and she‚Äôs ‚Äújust saying‚Äù certain things, but honestly bringing up stds in a convo about gender expression is fucked in my opinion. Is it right for me to try to read and challenge her assumptions or am I being too extreme?
Omg you look great
You look fantastic! You do you boo!!!
You look fabulous!
While I don't want to come to the defense of your mom since I don't know your history, I saw the outfit and first thought ""that's super cute"" and then thought ""I'd get so uncomfortable in that after awhile because I'd be having to suck in my stomach for way too long."" I'm approaching 40 and I'll toss something more fitted on, only to end up in a slouchy hoodie because it's just too much work to try to make it look good for that long!

I didn't read what she said as being real bad.  Sounds like she loves you and is just more of a worrier like my mom is.  Also, I don't know what Bonnaroo is exactly.  I'm assuming it's a festival.  Listen to momma and bring condoms if you might need them.  You might not be dressing for others, but you're going to feel cute and having fun.  Stay safe -- that's all she really cares about. :) That might be her way of showing her love and support.

As a parent myself, if my son were in your position, I'd give him every bit of love I could before and after I lecture him about staying safe.
Thank you!! Good advice to avoid the chafing hahaha, I‚Äôll do that for sure! And yes I think she‚Äôs trying to express her apprehension without outright saying anything. Feels like she assumes that I‚Äôm wearing that outfit because I‚Äôm horny or something. Idk! Either way I will take myself and my gender euphoria to Bonnaroo <3
Nah, she's just doing a poor job of being passive aggressive. She isn't acknowledging anything you're saying and ""moving the goalposts"" to attempt to express her disapproval without outright saying it cause it sounds like she's just a coward who's too afraid to say what she actually wants to ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so she hides behind false concern and offensive stereotypes so that you can't directly call her out on her shit.

Literally never ease up.
Just to add on to the chafing thing, because it's the worst, Monistat makes something called ""chafing relief powder gel"" that you can buy at most drug stores kinda by the pads and condoms and stuff and it is a freaking god send for hot sweaty days and bare thighs. Have so much fun!
Thank you violetsunshine <3 I think you very accurately described her behavior. I‚Äôve noticed these traits in her and she indeed hides behind passive aggressive behavior and never acknowledges shit outright. 

I will never ease up <3"	pat552	NonBinary	36	0.96	2021-08-24 18:26:57

ENBY-phobes in Sheeps clothing!? üòíüò≤	"
  Did you know that there are some people who actually think that ALL Non-binary people are actually just confused Trans-gender people who are either in denial about being Trans or are just in the middle of coming to terms with they fact they are Trans ( *cough* *cough* CONTRAPOINTS ). I shouldn't have to explain why this is obviously wrong, but alas... I do. If you were to actually sit down and have a conversation with a person who is Enby for five minutes, you would know that this obviously not the case. Non binary people aren't Whether this is your intention or not, you are participating in a little thing called ""Non-Binary erasure"".

   This Is the act of either not acknowledging the existence and actively erasing the Pressence of Non-binary people and Non-binary related things anywhere and anyway that said person can. By spreading this Enby-phobic rhetoric you're implying that the concept of being non binary doesn't exist don't exist and that they are ""confused"" and ""misguided"" people looking for attention. This way of thinking can be dangerous and reductive and it is your job and responsibility as an individual to educate yourself if you held any of these beliefs to heart before reading this post. I hope you learned something"	"I don't disagree, but a small correction that may clear up what is just a misunderstanding: a trans person is any person whose gender is different from the one they were assigned at birth. so that means nonbinary people fall under the trans umbrella. while it's still incorrect to say ""all nonbinary people are trans"" because there are some nonbinary people who choose not to use the label for themselves, but it's mostly incorrect rather than outright bigoted like you're describing.
Wait when did Contrapoints say anything like that? :0
(I am not commenting as disagreement with you, I agree that nonbinary is not some waiting room for binary people and that we exist as we are, nonbinary and fully aware of ourselves. These are just thoughts that bubbled to the surface and have been bouncing around for a long time.)

Early on I used to get very upset at people who said they were nonbinary until they could get top surgery or nonbinary while they were starting HRT and going to voice training before they‚Äôd move and go stealth. I‚Äôd feel frustrated when I saw post after post of people I‚Äôd followed saying ‚ÄúI no longer see myself as nonbinary, I am a trans man/woman.‚Äù I think that frustration and anger was coming from a place of fear, fear that at some point I would feel pressured to undergo a medical transition that I didn‚Äôt want in order to stay part of my community that was my lifeline of support and affirmation. But, those people weren‚Äôt doing anything to hurt me, and they weren‚Äôt taking away my community. They were using words as honestly as they could. Some of them yes had a different definition and viewpoint of what nonbinary is, but in actuality, if one is being seen as nonbinary although they don‚Äôt identify that way it is like the opposite of me, where many would see me as cisgender but I say I‚Äôm nonbinary and for them they‚Äôre being seen as nonbinary while actually being binary trans. They may not identify as nonbinary but they‚Äôre being seen as it and it may actually have been more comfortable for them to use the label temporarily as an acknowledgement of their physical and social movement through the liminal space between binaries.

And the group that had thought themselves nonbinary until their gender exploration brought them to a new place, well they were always on the same page as me, just needing a different set of resources that I did. I never want to feel negatively about people with this journey again. It is wonderful and beautiful for someone to not only begin questioning what they‚Äôve been told about gender and how it relates to them, but then further to not stop at the first accessible place. It goes the other way as well, people who believe themselves to be binary trans and then discover that‚Äôs not right either. Any personal discoveries to better understand and reconcile the self with the external are to be celebrated. I am not losing my community, there are so very many of us and we‚Äôre everywhere, we‚Äôre not going away. If a space I used to find nonbinary companionship in no longer has that, then I can find another space, and now I have two sets of community.

So, people outside of our sphere broadly misunderstanding and miscategorizing us is an issue, it‚Äôs hopefully something that WE can continue educating people on since outsiders can generally only regurgitate to a point and often don‚Äôt have the same kind of internal understanding that someone has once you‚Äôve made the leaps of personal awareness. I will just end with one more thought however, there is no solid line between binary and nonbinary. People can be both, exist connected to both. Many trans people I admire present a binary front and do identify strongly with that binary gender while also in less public or mainstream settings explain that gender is more complicated than that and they are actually nonbinary. There is no actual competition between binary and nonbinary trans people for numbers or prestige or attention. We‚Äôre largely a fluidly mixing population, and there is enough stage and resources for all of us if the heteropatriarchal structures weren‚Äôt pushing us down as a block.
I 100% agree, however, some binary trans people DO end up using a non-binary identity as a transition phase, and it‚Äôs also perfectly valid. In that time period, however, they are enbys, not ‚Äúconfused trans people‚Äù. Both are perfectly valid as nonbinary individuals and it‚Äôs sad that people can‚Äôt understand that
Went from being a confused genderfluid (male, female and non-binary), to a binary trans guy, to a transmasc NB person. 

I have literally never been happier in my identity. I‚Äôve known I‚Äôm not cis for five years.

People being forced into very clear cut boxes is stupid, gender is fluid and people are allowed to explore that without being punished or dismissed.
Uh oh you've expressed an opinion about C*ntrapoints that isn't blind adoration. The mob will be coming for you soon.
This has echoes of a lot of the bi-sexual erasure stuff people we‚Äôre going up against a decade or so ago.
Really? I've only heard one other person say enby was under the ""trans umbrella"" but never heard anyone refer to themselves as trans in /r/nonbinary , figured it wasn't a thing.

I guess I also kinda feel like I don't deserve the label or something because I pass as cis so much and I'm not dealing with HRT or a lot of the trans ""experience"" or whatever, but maybe that's bullshit. I do get misgendered all the fucking time, and I guess that's a part of it.
I don't think she herself said anything nbphobic but there was a bit of a controversy when she used Buck Angel in a video. Buck Angel is a trans icon in many other ways but is very dismissive of non-binary people in a way many consider outright insulting.

Contrapoints didn't apologise for including them when it was brought to her attention, but instead talked about how much buck meant to her

I think at times we can hold content creators to an unfair standard when they are on the left of the spectrum and contrapoints is almost certainly an ally to us all in a way buck isn't, by even so it's disappointing.

She did also talk about disliking using pronouns in therapy, by that's because she wants to be assumed female. I believe it was a symptom of her dysphoria she was expressing in exasperation, not saying the practice was bad in and of itself as many took it.
Oh wait they're already after me üôÑ
Came here to comment the same thing, though that thinking still crops up from time to time.

Nonbinary bisexual so I obviously don't exiiiiiiiiiiist. üëª Boo. lol
I call myself trans all the time. but in general nonbinary is just more specific. in the same way it'd be weird to tell you about my ""animal"" that I have in my house instead of just saying ""dog"". 

there's no one trans experience. anyone whose gender isn't the one they were assigned at birth can use the label for themselves. if only the people with the worst experiences could use it then that'd only leave like, poor disabled undocumented Black (etc) trans people. we won't all have exactly the same experiences and that's okay, but we can come together under the banner of the joy we share from finding ourselves.
I consider myself trans, and am doing HRT. Still non-binary though, and have been openly so for about a decade.‚úåÔ∏èThat said, I don't think we all have to agree to count ourselves individually as trans, especially as some members of the community don't might not feel connected to the label. I think that politically, however, even the people who are non-binary and don't consider themselves trans need to act in solidarity and support of trans rights. Not just for the people in our community who do see themselves as trans, but also for recognition of the fundamental nature of being non-binary, which is beyond the norms and structures of cisgender society. We certainly have that aspect in common with binary trans people.
I mean honestly I get where she‚Äôs coming from especially after her explanation, so I don‚Äôt see her point of view as problematic. She‚Äôs human too. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs actively supporting him or anything, idk...? She just used is voice once in a super long video
Out of curiosity do you have any links to articles breaking down the c points situation?
I have watched a couple of her videos before (she's pretty good I guess, but I'm not a super fan) and from what I can see on the topic she is coming across as hopelessly uninformed on nonbinary stuff (not that I can find anything recent). 
I see she also has some colabs with problematic/transmes people which isn't great ngl.
But I also found some bits where she seems to be trying to defend it? 

You seem like you might have had arguments about this before so I figured I'd ask :)
Oh yeah, it‚Äôs definitely still out there. Maybe not quite as common as it was though. As an AMAB enby who is also said to not exist you are in good company!
Yeah, the more I think about it, I really don't have the cis experience, even if I pass as cis on a daily basis. Trans works, just feels weird to use, but not because I don't identify with it as much as I just never felt I deserved it until I'd be completely out of the closet. But that's absolute bullshit, because I'd never tell some other enby here that they shouldn't identify a certain way until they're out of the closet...

It's just been a bit weird lately and heavier on my mind because my wife fucked up and outed me to her mom and all her friends last week, told them I go by they/them but with this wording: ""**he** doesn't see himself as a man and **he** goes by they/them"" and they all proceeded to use he/him riiiiight after. I wasn't even pissed, just disappointed. This shit definitely isn't a cis experience.
I don‚Äôt know about articles but the issue with Buck Angel was talked about in her video about Canceling/cancel culture
well, also generally the term ""passing"" is used to denote being gendered correctly consistently, by people who do not know you're trans. I think the word you're looking for is misgendered, my friend, and when you frame it that way it's kind of hard to argue it's a privilege. 

I'm sorry you're going through that. that's really shitty and you deserve better
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

Appreciate it. But yeah I spoke up about it with her later and she apologized and is really trying to be supportive, so it's getting better."	pb7lnl	NonBinary	28	0.89	2021-08-25 09:17:05
Can someone tell me if I‚Äôm talking this to far or if this person is being non-binary-phobic? I have no idea..		"Um, he/she are third person pronouns too. People trying to use grammar to justify nb-phobia is useless because these people wouldn't care about grammar otherwise and this is a prime example of their ignorance
Some people genuinely don't understand because they forget that this language doesn't have a nonbinary pronoun other than they/them. I've been trying to give more people the benefit of the doubt so I say they could mean well
Some people just don't understand and think it's a plural.
Linguistically, he, she, it, they, and them are all third person pronouns. This is where paying attention in English classes would have helped a lot of people. It, they, and them are the only gender neutral third person pronouns available in the English language.
Theres really no way of knowing based on only this interaction, but if they're making you uncomfortable just block them
I looked at some other comments in that thread and yeah that person sounds nb-phobic. Just ignore them (heh) and block if you don't want to risk interacting with them in the future.
The only other plausible explanation is that English is that person's second language? 

That said, when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras. It's most likely bigotry. No need to assume good will, especially in a coming out sub where folks should know better.
they def are
I was so confused when they said ‚Äúthird person instead of he/she‚Äù. It‚Äôs just so wrong.

I came out	"After weeks of confusion and constant over thinking I came out to my closest friends. It feels great, and I think I accept myself a lot more because of it. I still don't knew exactly how I will come out to the rest of my friends and acquaintances. Especially my family. My mother will probably be accepting, but my father and sister acted fairly phobic in the past, and I am afraid that they will look down on me because of this and who I am. 

If you have any suggestions on how (or aspects to keep in mind) while coming out pleas send them! I could really use some council... "	"Thought I do a quick update:

Yesterday I did come out to my parents, and they were surprisingly accepting and supportive. They did not really know what non-binary was, but they had herd of the pronouns ""they/them"". It is at least a start. 

Now I still have to figure out how to come out to my school. I do not want to make a big deal out of it, but I feel that I am obligated to tell at least my mentor group face to face.

Everyone I have come out to have been incredibly supportive, and I got some really nice texts last night. It makes me happy; I feel more confident in both my gender identity and steps further ahead. Hopeful all of you are lucky where you are at <3
As someone who isn't out to family yet, this is something I needed to hear. There's hope yet. Thanks for the update!! Hope all goes well in your enby journey!

My social media coming out	"I was misgendered a WHOLE lot at the NYE party I was at last week, and the next day I was overcome with a tidal wave of depression and dysphoria, felt really invalidated. Most of the folx at the party were well aware of my NB status, and were even misgendering me before anyone even really started drinking.

That made me real mad. So I tapped into Righteous Enby Fury‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, and came out on social media in spectacular dramatic flair.

In said post, I repeatedly said, ""repeated occurrences and I'm blocking people."" Esp re: transphobic or enby-phobic commentary or content. Or if people just plain don't respect my identity.

I capped it with, ""I'm Non-Binary, and I'm fucking Proud.""

It felt really good to just, blast it out like some sort of banger of a song with a massive subwoofer in my hypotheticalforthisanalogy car. Cause I was pissed that my friends had made me feel like that, and I will NOT be letting it happen again.

I get slipping up every now and then. I get that being drunk makes that easier. But, again, it started before alcohol had touched ANYONE'S lips.

But I did tell my followers and friends I'm not heartless, and I'll forgive genuine remorse, but I'm not playing about the phobic, toxic shit. If anyone, regardless of how close they are, simply refuses to accept my identity, I'm cutting them, blocking them, and never speaking to them, again.

Cause I won't be disrespected in this.

Sorry, I'm still feeling the Fury, and I'm full of Pride, and I wanted to share this with everyone here in case someone needs solidarity in their own struggles with their identity not being respected. You can live through me, vicariously. Be validated by my boldness."		elyvz1	NonBinary	24	0.94	2020-01-08 21:05:56

Some personal thoughts on what TDV means to me	"Hey friends and siblings! Today's the Trans Day of Visibility. I'll say up front that, while I do choose to include trans in my labels, not all non-binary people do and that's totally valid. You're still awesome and celebrated today!

For me, TDV is about firsts When I was growing up, I was in a very sheltered environment. I didn't have any trans or GNC people in my life, or representation in the media (at least that I had access to). I was in college before I first found out that some people are transgender, and explored whether that label fit me. Even more years after that, I first found the non-binary label, and then [genderfluid](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01). I wish that someone had been visible, so I could see that I wasn't alone.

Even after connecting with those labels, there was still minimal media representation that I could find outside of porn, and I had no one in my life who identified with a gender other than their presumed gender from birth. Becoming visible to my friends, colleagues and family by coming out would not have been safe for me. I would have lost access to education funding, employment, housing and healthcare. When someone would make transphobic or nb-phobic comments, I wanted to be the one who set the record straight, but being visible was too great a risk for me. So I looked around for someone who was already out that I could involve somehow.

I came out for the first time to a friend of mine when I was 35, and it was super scary. I showed her things like the comic above, and tried to explain my confused and evolving understanding of my gender. She was very supportive, and we got me some clothing options to express myself in a way that was comfortable to me, which... sat in the closet for me to stare at every day for months.

I remember the first time I presented in a way that wasn't in conformance to society's expectations based on my AGAB. My hands were shaking. I ended up having a panic attack. Even though no one was there to see me, it was a first. It was another 4 years before I first presented GNC in front of someone else, and I had to ask them to zip up my jacket for me because my hands were shaking so much.

I remember the first time I came out to my partner. The first time I came out to a family member. The first time I spoke with my doctor about hormones. The first time I was GNC in public. The first time I lost a friendship over being true to who I am.

Today is my first time on facebook explicitly stating I'm trans. I posted it in the context of a fundraiser for the Human Rights Campaign (they're amazing, go donate). I'm in a position in my life where I can finally be **visible**. I can be that visible trans person for my friends to bring their questions to. I can be that visible trans person in my job that gets asked what gender options should be included on forms. I can be the visible trans person for others who are growing up in a world with very little trans visibility, to let them know they're not alone.

I'm transgender, and non-binary, and genderfluid. My existence and identity are not a political statement, nor are they open for debate. I am visible, and I stand up for those who face discrimination and violence, who haven't found or can't use their own voices.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. Happy Visibility Day :)"	"That was wholesome and heartwarming‚ù§Ô∏è

I can relate to a lot of this, groing up without any perception of transexuality and first contacts through erotica and porn, so your perspective on Visibility is really resonating with me!"	mh4ui5	NonBinary	19	0.96	2021-03-31 12:17:18

Back to school as an an enby teen	"
Ah, back to school season. The time of year where the average kid has many things to worry about, like who is gonna be in there classes? Or if there teachers are going to be nice?

Well, I have to worry about that, plus much much more. This is the first year of school, where I identify as nonbinary, and this is my experience so far:

I show up for the first day of school, and a few people I know come up too me and start talking about my recently cut hair. They dead name me, even though I have already asked them not too. They tell me my hair cut makes me look like a lesbian and that I shouldn't have cut it short. I don't have the guts to correct them, so I just sit there awkwardly and except it.


I talk to my counselor, explaining to her that I'm Nonbinary, she says that's fine and offers to give me keys to the staff only bathroom that happens to be gender neutral, she says she will tell my teachers about my new name and pronouns. I feel like I'm finally getting accepted. I head home from school, scared to meet my teachers the following week. An hour after I get home , my counselor emails me to inform me that my classes had to me changed, as some of my teachers were not willing to teach a nonbinary child. So she tells me my new teachers and helps fix my schedule to fit my needs.
I was told if I didn't switch my classes, my teachers would most likely purposely deadname me and misgender me. 

I have a day off tomorrow , but I'm back to school on Tuesday. I'm afraid for my teachers reactions, I'm afraid that my teachers will tell my lgbtq-phobic family.
I'm afraid of getting bullied and losing most my friends becuase they dont support me.
I'm afraid to have to do activities in gym class, where the kids are separated by gender, male and female, but no inbetween. I'll have no where to stand and I bet you 60% they will make me stand with the girls, as I am afab.

I don't understand why it's so hard to just change what you call someone, I don't understand why my gender makes someone not want to teach me.  

I want to be confidant, and stand up for myself through any bullying, to prove that I'm not just trying to get attention. I hope that all these fears, are just my anxiety talking, and not things that will really happen over the next few months.

If you read this entire thing, and you have some times or suggestions for a new enby in school, I would love to have the help

Thank you - Alex"	"Hey ya, I am sorry to hear about those teachers that sucks but isnt too suprising. It is awesome that your counselor is supportive, that is so great.  I feel that you already know that this isnt going to be easy. There are going to be assholes. They are everywhere, but if you can get a support system close friends your counselor i dont know if you have told your parents or any more liberal extended family that you could talk to. 

As far as seperating the gym class why dont they just split it alphabetically. 

Some people might just be a little slow and will end up coming around with using your new name and pronouns.
stay strong and be ready if your lgbt phobic family reacts badly. Keep a list of local lgbt+ resources, shelters, places where you might be able to pick up a job pretty quickly, an emergency bag with some spare clothes, bit of money, and whatnot in case your parents straight up kick you out or threaten you with some sorta conversion therapy crap, etc.

If you have any friends with parents who you know are cool with lgbt+ stuff, you could try talking with them about your situation too. Maybe they would let you stay a little while until your parents have some time to cool off or you have time to figure out where you're going."	cyhpan	NonBinary	14	0.9	2019-09-02 00:15:25
"""calling urself trans without dysphoria makes it looks like a choice""??"	"Hi, questioning my gender here. Never felt really connected to ""being a girl"" (im afab). Kinda indifferent abd disconnected towards it. In my childhood I never questioned anything. Just took is as ""oh I have a female body, I dont want a male body so im a girl"". I only started to question myself when I learned abt the many enby identies. I started reading abt it certain labels. Now, that im starting to experiment w/ my gender, I think I'd actually be happier if I were to live as an enby. I mean, I cant as my environment is enby-phobic. But ideally, if I were to be the last person on earth (or if I were to have an accepting environment), I would. I get really euphoric when ppl cant tell my gender (not when ppl bully me bcoz of it ofc). Ive joined some trans servers on discord to experiment w/ the enby label and I think it really fits the way I see myself. I finally feel connected to a gender. 

Problem is, I dont have (alot) of dysphoria. I am uncomfortable looking at myself in the mirror. Seeing my girl-ish face, girls-ish hair, shoulders, chest, waist, hips. But it doesnt causes ""severe distress"". I have little-to-no uncomfortable feeling being refered to as my agab. It doesnt cause me to feel rlly uncomfortable, its more like ""oh this is wrong, but I can still function"". I mean, IRL, I am still female-presenting so I cant really be mad at ppl for seeing me as a girl. When I look at myself in the mirror, I see a girl as well so yeah. They dont know better. Even if I were to change my presentation, my family/friends would still see me as a girl as they just know me as such. Two IRL friends kinda know im questioning, so when they refer to me by feminine terms, it does kinda suck. In this case, they sorta *know* im not a girl. Around them, I cant just slide it away as ""oh they dont know better!"". So maybe the social uncomfortableness will increase if I start to come out. Must say, the idea of having to live as a woman for the rest of my life, makes me kinda sad. 

Ive been talking to some trans folks and some of them say you dont need dysphoria, others say you do. One person said the letter said ""if you dont have dysphoria, you are making being trans a choice"", ""are you transitioning for fun??"", ""you will regret transitioning without dysphoria"". I didnt really had an argument against their statement. 

These ppl even mess with my desires. What if *I will* regret it? What if im just trying to be different? I honestly dont even want to transition right now due to my environment. It honestly sounds so stupid to say ""I dont have dysphoria + I dont wanna transition, but im enby, really!"".

I asked my cis friend why he identified as his agab. He just told me ""oh I have a dick"". If thats all gender is for cis ppl, then maybe im just really reaching here."	">Problem is, I dont have (alot) of dysphoria. I am uncomfortable looking

This is literally dysphoria, even if you don't consider it ""severe"". The other stuff you described is also dysphoria. You may have a bit of imposter syndrome going on here. As others said, you don't need dysphoria to be trans, but you already have it? I think sometimes for nonbinary folks it's harder to recognize dysphoria or it's harder to pinpoint because we don't want to be the opposite gender and probably also like some parts of our presentation and/or are neutral about it. It's also more apparent when you change your appearance in some way like a binder, haircut, etc. and then you find that you are experiencing euphoria with this change of appearance.
Trans people claiming that to be trans you need to feel dysphoria are called transmedicalists, and are extremists.

Don't let them influence you. You and you alone have the right to decide what is wrong and what's right for you.

They are also completely wrong in their statement, by the way. The definition of transgender is, to not identify with your assigned gender at birth. Transition or not, you're still considered trans by the simple fact of being non binary.
Hi, it's mostly accepted that one can be trans without dysphoria, dysphoria is not a requirement to being trans or non-binary, and certainly, it does not make you any less valid if you don't have dysphoria. The last thing we as a community should do is to gatekeep people. The only thing you need to identify as trans, is feeling trans. Though I'll say, some non-binary people do not identify with the label of 'trans', but in general 'non-binary' belongs under the 'trans' umbrella so if you feel 'non-binary', you are probably also trans. 

Though, I feel like sometimes dysphoria gets reduced to only the body dysphoria too much. There is also mind and social dysphoria I think. I'm not very knowledgeable I think because I  have little dysphoria, plus I'm also in most situations, presenting as my agab for safety reasons. So, I do get the 'this is wrong but I guess I'll work with it' kinda feeling. The most I can offer you on this is my own experience, I have some dysphoria regarding my chest, but it's more like a slight discomfort around it. I do not like gendered terms surrounding my agab, like 'woman' or 'girl', and I feel more discomfort around that.

On the 'not having dysphoria making trans a choice' though, I'll say that none of us 'chose' to feel the way we do about our own gender, the only choice folks that have little to no dysphoria is making is, to either live as our true happiest self, or to 'make do with' our agab and continue to be seen as our agab. Some people are okay with making do with, but for some of us making do with is more like forcing ourselves. We are still trans, because I didn't choose to feel like my agab doesn't suit me. Plus with that the argument becomes, at what point is your dysphoria enough? At what point are you trans enough? And honestly, I think the happier choice for everyone, including you and me, is really just to say that 'people can identify as trans without having dysphoria, but some people do, and it affect their mental health severely', so that everyone having 0, or 0.1, 30, or 100 dysphoria can all still feel included, and part of the community.
A trans friend told me as I was trying to wrap my head around my gender identity that it isn't dysmorphia that is important. It's euphoria.

I think that's the better measure.

I likewise am AFAB NB, and don't really feel extreme dysphoria. I certainly don't like my boobs and wish to yeet them, but I don't feel horrid because of them, usually.

But getting my first binder and the feeling I got looking at myself in the mirror? I don't care what anyone says, I know how that made me feel.
I (AMAB, 37) lived until about 30 not questioning anything either. Did I experience disphoria, before? No, but that was never on the table as a thing that existed. I was a male, but I couldn't find any way of being a male that didn't feel off. I started looking up ways of presenting that didn't enhance my natural masculine looks, and after a year or so, I felt I identified the most with the idea of being agender, where I don't want to be a male, but neither a female, and in fact I despise being tied to one or the other in any way, and I just want to be alright and present with whatever I feel like doing. I just want to feel alright, to be able to feel alright with my appearance, and my AGAB didn't let me do that, but just made me feel like a fraud. It's hard to get to my age and never having experienced being alright with your self-image, and I've only managed that by incorporating to my life things that are stereotypically of women.

Then, the opposite of what you're worried about happened to me: I didn't consider myself trans because, to me, being trans was a way more complex and intense experience than mine. For me, trans people were just people who transitioned from one gender to the other, or, at most, people who were NB and their feelings and dysphoria were strong enough to go through HRT or alike. Or people who were activists. And then I was called transphobic by some for not identifying as trans, when in fact I didn't identify as trans because of respect for 'actual trans' people. Ironic. And tragic that there're people that will put up fights because of that.

After another while, I understood that anyone who rejects their AGAB is technically trans. That idea did make some sense, I was trans because I had zero attachment to my AGAB and I was trying something else out of the binary, but I wouldn't identify as such because it's not as if I'm really managing to get away from my AGAB for the moment (I'm not the most capable person in the world, exactly).

During this whole ordeal, which took a few years, feelings of dysphoria that weren't there before arose. That wasn't nice, but it is what it is, and it's normal that those feelings enhance as you start trying different things and your feelings towards your body change.

At the moment, I can explain that I'm technically trans, only that my whole feelings in general are lowkey and constantly changing. I identify as agender if anyone asks, because sometimes people ask, but I hate any attention, so it's not as if I go around telling people.

With this I'm saying that you've got to do yourself for a while, see where it goes. You do say you've got some dysphoria, so don't let anyone bully you with that idea that it isn't a choice. Feelings aren't a choice, but there's a choice in daring to try something different that feels alright for you and makes you feel alright, and it's from that choice, that your feelings will change.
*Any* amount of dysphoria is too much. Full stop. But people are putting so much emphasis on it because at some point some asshole decided that the best metric for allowing people to transition was ""how much does this person hate themselves/their life?"" In order for this to be 'okay' they be to be *miserable*. Think about that for a second. That's extremely fucked up. What would make you happier to live in your body? How long can you wear a pair of shoes that are only a little too small before you get a blister?
Truscum's gonna gatekeep. You don't fit their definition so you must be faking, and trying to steal their identity. They need to fuckin' *chill.*
it's not a choice to have a disconnect between our bodies and our gender experience. dysphoria is not required. cis people don't even think about this stuff from what i gather, so just the act of questioning and settling on an identity that doesn't reflect our agab IS being trans. you are valid, your experiences are valid, anyone making you feel otherwise is gatekeeping.
If you do not fully identify as a man or a woman, if those labels don't resonate with you and feel like home, please hear me: 

*You are nonbinary and you are nonbinary enough.*

(If you so choose to use the label!)
You don‚Äôt having dysphoria is a blessing. Don‚Äôt fall down the rabbit hole I had to with friends saying similar things about non-binary people ‚Äúcis people playing pretend‚Äù attitude.

It‚Äôs worthless and harmful gatekeeping. The euphoria is what‚Äôs important, it‚Äôs not some suffering Olympics where you have to suffer yay much to count as trans.

And you aren‚Äôt making being trans a choice. The only ‚Äúchoice‚Äù is identifying with that label. A closeted gay person who identifies to others as straight is still gay.

TLDR: euphoria is the key factor of being trans, chase that, be happy and keep killing it!
The claim that dysphoria is necessary to be trans automatically reinforces a binary system. 

Now, while many nonbinary people do experience dysphoria (and you seem too, a little), if everyone **had to** experience dysphoria, what would the ""goal"" for nonbinary people even be? A completely androgynous body? what does that even mean, especially when considering European patriarchic beauty standards (thin, white body with masculinized chest)? 

(I hope what I'm trying to get across is somehow understandable, I'm very much not a transmed)
Dysphoria does not mean you‚Äôre trans. You can be dysphoric and cis or not be dysphoric and be trans. Every single person‚Äôs experience is unique and don‚Äôt let some gatekeepers try and sway you from being your true self
It can take a lot of time to unravel dysphoria if you have it. You don‚Äôt need to have it. But you almost might not be able to identify what it is right away it might take months or years. 

I feel like some of the opinions you got from others are a little harsh and tilted. Everyone has issues so I wouldn‚Äôt put too much stock in those opinions trying to tell you what you are or aren‚Äôt. 

I would listen to your gut. People don‚Äôt choose to be trans or non binary just because it‚Äôs fun to make life harder. We do it because we need to to make our lives better. Cis people who are cis because they have a dick kinda shows how cut and dry it is for them. Plus everything is a spectrum you don‚Äôt have to be trans in the same way another person is trans to be trans. 

Hang in there it‚Äôs complicated and can take your whole life to figure out. Don‚Äôt let some of the harmful comments you got get blown out of proportion!

PS 

Am I trans enough to be trans?  Non binary enough?  Queer enough?  This is super common for everyone to question from what I can tell. I definitely go through this.
>Problem is, I dont have (alot) of dysphoria. I am uncomfortable looking at myself in the mirror. Seeing my girl-ish face, girls-ish hair, shoulders, chest, waist, hips. But it doesnt causes ""severe distress"".


that's just mild dysphoria. 


that said you don't need dysphoria to be trans. what matters is what makes you feel right, not what makes you feel wrong.
Who cares if you have dysphoria or not? You can be trans (or enby) and not transition at all. Whatever choice makes you happy is the right choice. Even if you don‚Äôt transition you are still valid.
Dysphoria doesn‚Äôt make you valid and no one can tell you otherwise
ughh transmelicalists annoy the shit outta me, and by the way OP, they are usually not accepting of non binary folks. I wouldn't recommend listening to them.
Not OP, but thank you for your comment. I didn't really consider the social and mental dysphoria, dysphoria but didn't have a proper word for it. It makes sense to think of it like that and I'm having a lightbulb moment.
How can you be dysphoric and cis?
Not liking your body is actually really common. You could be dysphoric about how your butt is flat or how you have a bigger build. It really just stems from the pressure put on people to look like the ideal man/woman
Oh but they wouldnt have *gender* dysphoria right? I understand how e.g a man can feel dysphoric over being misgendered as a woman or a woman feeling dysphoric over their chest after they had their chest removed. But would an afab feel dysphoric over their chest bcoz its feminine?
They could feel insecure in their femininity if their chest is smaller than what is societally considered attractive
Yeah okay but not because they think their chest *is* feminine?

Edit: I did some research and I heard some butch lesbian do. Well, I guess just like you said, everyones experience is different!"	10xpjcd	NonBinary	14	0.9	2023-02-09 08:24:05
