It's a shame that blue seems to suit me, since red is my favourite colour. I was kinda feeling myself yesterday, ngl.		"Wait is the killer queen
When are you getting your own anime??
Major ""33 years old living in the northeast part of Morioh where all the villas are wanting to live a quiet life"" vibes
Phoenix Wright meets GOT...love it
You look like you're ready to take on the Japanese legal system and yell objection at the top of your lungs. I love it!!
I could never in my life pull off a suit like you do.
That is a really beautiful blue tone
You have powerful supervillain energy, and I love it.
The coat gives me howls moving castle vibes, the fit is immaculate and really fits you well!
The aura I'm getting from your pictures is one of almost pure power
you look like an anime villain- not sure if it was intentional or not but 💙💙
Really liking your tie, it looks very... bizarre
Dude, I love that tie!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fire
Same, just because when blue darkens it stays a smooth color but when red darkens it goes to a brown ish color- maroon
You look so rad wow
This is a FIT, I can't tell if you're cosplaying or not
I'm pretty sure u could work a crimson red, too! 

Looking FIYA FIYA in anything!!
The Kira we need!!!
lemme know when the anime you're starring in comes to Netflix so I can simp over you. thank u 🥺💖
woaaaah hi there royalty
You look like you’re gonna be the first real fight the protagonist has had
That coat is perfect
holy hell blue DOES suit you, you look great
Blue seems to be your color, or at least that shade.
I love this! You're right, it really suits you. You look like a more fashionable Kira. :)
Awesome Outfit!
this fit is IT
your majesty 👑
I hadn’t been on this sub for a couple months – The other day you popped into my mind out of nowhere. So glad to see you’re still around!
Wow. What a great look!!
I'm here for alllllll of it! Looks great!
The vibes are just immaculate
WHERE IS THE TIE FROM 😩😩😩
You look awesome! I recognised you from your Guilty Gear inspired outfit a bit ago and I chatted with you briefly at the time. 

So what's the inspiration on this one? 

How are you btw?
BIG VIBES, THE BIGGEST OF VIBES. I'm speechless.
Jojo and ace attorny crossover game protagonist is that you?
I think you could pull off a nice dark red really well, like a burgundy, maroon, or wine red 🥰
Dear, first off, you look spectacular in blue. second off, YOU WOULD LOOK SO GOOD IN RED!
Sick outfit, especially the tie. You look awesome!
I'll bet you look amazing in pinks and mustard yellows
You look magnificent my friend!
You look fab! I'll bet you could find a shade of red that suits you too. If you like this bright, saturated shade of blue, if I were you I'd try a berry red, almost purply-red, that's really bright and saturated.
The only word I can think of to describe these photos is SUGOI 😱 You look incredible my friend
You look Awesome!!
I want a cape
I think you would look quite dapper in a red suit as well.
Wow, this suits you so well! You should definitely try red as well!
I-

LOVE. 

smsmsms
you’re looking great :) really nice photos
Hatchi Matchi friend you look amazing 😍
Really random but i thought you were a sim at first
you and lee xiaolan tekken buy clothes on the same store!
I though this was the jojo subreddit
I was so confused about the Kira comments until I saw the tie. Don’t know how I didn’t notice lol
That was a nice pun
Oh, dear. It seems you've seen it.
When Shinichiro Watanabe returns my calls
YES
Oh, I doubt that
It’s probably the tie
Me too

It's so funny when people try to shame me for being androgynous. Like duh, that's the point!		"Excuse me while I pick up my jaw from the floor...
“I can’t tell if you’re a boy or a girl.” THANK YOU, MARIE, YOU ARE VERY ASTUTE.
I'm in love with your style and whole aesthetic. Especially loving the eye pattern. 😍
This is awesome!
That is such a stunning look! What inspired you?
Divine!
How do you even shame somebody for looking like that
I hope you don't live somewhere arid because your mere presence could cause massive fires! 🔥🔥🔥
I don’t know much about two-spirits but the waist wrappings and eyeliner reminded me of them somehow.
You look like my FFXIV dancer!
I love this outfit wow
“but i cant tell and therefore you dont fit in one of the small boxes in small mind!”

s/ obv
I am so much in love and absolutely inspired by your look. Your style is amazing and you are so hot. I absolutely love everything about this photo and all your looks (I had to see more, which basically i loved all of them too). Your whole enby esthetic is just amazing. I love it all. You just inspire me to continue to be myself too. I may not have your amazing style RN but I can still be inspired. Keep being who you are. Doing that brings so much good into this world just by being you.
WOW

You look f**cking fantastic and all the haters should be green with envy
This post actually kinda took my breath away and I want you to know that you're um 👉👈

Pretty 💖
Omg you look stunning!
It is \*very not fair\* how pretty you are.
You look so cool!
I'm so confused... but I like it! Great sense of fashion style!
You look like you came straight out of Skyrim/other medieval-ish fantasies to come steal our hearts. You look fantastic. That confidence just... 🤯

You're absolutely amazing.
omg ur stunning
Wow you look so good :D especially the eye makeup
you look awesome especially that hair, i want that
[removed]
i feel like you're gonna stop me on the side of a dirt road in the cloud district and steal my money lol. nice aesthetic, 10/10 :)
You Look so beautiful!! I also want to Look so beautiful Like you!!!
Your the point of cool i aspire to be
😁 sorry for the inconvenience! (Thank you!!)
My literal, out-loud words before I got over the shock. 

“Holy Hotness”
😂 

One time some guy at the grocery store stopped and stared at me, and then asked me if I was ""a dude or a chick"". I told him I was looking for raisin bagels.
Thank you! I like to do designs with eyeliner
Thank you! You're awesome! ☺️
Thanks! I actually often dress in a bunch of draping scarves and wraps. I guess I missed the festivals this summer and wanted to wear something I might wear to one.
Thank you! You're celestial yourself!
I see you haven't met my aunt!
Snow on the ground right now! We're fine! ☺️ Thank you
Thank you!
I don't know what that means but I do love dancing! 😁😁 Thank you!
Thanks so much!!
Lmao exactly!
Thank you so much ❤️!!! I felt really good about this one, and it was the first time I had dressed up in a while, my everyday wear is a little more toned down version of this. I miss dances and festivals. Thank you for the confidence boost 😁🥰
Thank you!!! 💚
☺️☺️ you're so sweet wow thank you do much!
Thank you so much! ❤️☺️
Thank you!!!
Yay! Thank you!
Thanks!!!
I thought the exact same thing, I thought they looked like a video game character
Thank you so much! I like to feel like a random encounter when I'm out for a walk in the woods! 😁 Thank you again
🌟thank you! 🥰
Yay! Thanks for the compliment!
Thank you! You should cut your hair, do something funky!
Thanks so much!!
It is a beautiful day, and I am a horrible brigand ... here to steal your ~~heart~~ coinpurse 💓
Thank you! ☺️ Do it!
You'll get there! I reccomend thirft shops, especially for cheap scarves. And do something wild with your hair, you won't regret it!
Obviously the most feminine bagels. I think you answered his question loud and clear /s
When little kids ask me I tell them “idk, guess!” and whatever they guess I say “You’re close!”
Hey, take it from an objective party, a total stranger on the internet, you are a total knockout. Your aunt's attacks are extremely ineffective.
I bet your aunt isn't the most stylish of aunts
Somehow I feel like I’ve met your aunt even though I’ve never met your aunt. I too have an aunt
And where is that, if you don't mind my asking?
Its a playable class in the final fantasy MMO.
You’re welcome. My everyday wear lately has just been T-shirt and jeans without doing anything fancy because now I work doing manual labor in a warehouse. I get all hot and sweaty so it defeats the purpose of getting dressed up. I need to do it more on my days off though. I’ve just become so lazy since I never have anywhere to go or anyone that sees me. I can’t wait for the big covid stuff to end (there will forever be remnants but at some point the restrictions will lighten up some to where we can go out in the world more.
Honestly I was going to day Aela the Huntress. Seeing as she's decidedly female i didn't want to be offensive but that same warrior goddess vibe. Just (to quote another game) pwar (Sera, DA:I when viewing a Qunari female).
Oh my god too many innuendos and picks up lines can be made for that XD

But I'll resort to you're amazing to pull for such a look. You might have noticed by 99% of us are jealous and in awe!
No prob, you wonderful human 😊
Told a little kid I was a raccoon and they proudly ran to their mom and said they wanted to be a raccoon when they grew up too! 

Although I have gone with the more... I dunno... Movie scripty one where I go ""I'm a forest fairy. But you can't tell anyone. Shhhh!"" And they will nod excitedly because ""yeah that makes sense, no shit I was confused, they're a forest fairy!"" 😂
Northish westish Canada
Literally me too!!! I decided to dress up like that because I reconeccted with the woman who makes the infinity wrap I'm wearing on my torso. But I used to do this kind of look for river valley hikes, and for shows and dances. Now I usually look more like the work selfie on my profile, black t shirt and tight pants. I also want to start putting the effort in on days off, it just feels good
😜 I'd love to hear your best ones if you want to dm me. 

On another note, I never know how to respond to people who are jealous. Because like, I get it! I've been there. I may not have had it as hard as some people but I didn't always look like this, and did not always love my body. But after I got on hormones and learned to love movement, the beauty followed. I believe that most anyone here can also comfortably inhabit themselves as much as I have, if they have access to the right resources.
Ahahaha that is excellent. Forest fairy is one I’m going to slip into my back pocket to save for sometime.
Oh okay, yeah, I can imagine your area wouldn't be all firey. Guess you picked an appropriate place to live!

(anyway I don't know what to add so yeah, you're a 🔥 human and I'm sure you're a nice person too)
Oh I don't mena a kind of mean jealousy. More like ""drool wish I could look like you"". More like the way they look is ""is goals."" It's all meant in kindness and good fun. 

I'll have to get back to you on more of my stupid gaming puns cause my mind is shutting off, but there's so many fun geeky gamer pick up lines now in days!
Sometimes you get the hypercritical toddler/little kid who's like ""okay, but a boy fairy or girl fairy?"" But that is usually fixed by telling them that the fairy council/king/queen said you couldn't tell humans. And then give them a wink. 

So I'm not saying gaslight a toddler into thinking that they're wrong and you'll get in trouble for revealing your gender, but. Ya know. Fairy council and all ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Turning transphobic hate comments into affirming erasure poetry		"Erasure poems created from queerphobic/transphobic hate comments. This is heavily inspired by the work of Sarah Kate Smigiel (@justsaysk on Instagram). Amidst everything that is happening with anti-trans legislation in the US, I wanted to take back the narrative and transform something hateful into something empowering. I hope this brought you even the smallest amount of joy today ☀️
Thank you for turning that hate stuffed sandwich into a lovely scrumptious panini.
I love this. 

Erase hate, create art.
I love this and how you can turn it into a loving sentence
""It's actually not your job as an educator to impose your own bias about a person's identity and attempt to ""correct"" it. That's ABUSIVE and DAMAGING."" So uh, why exactly are you doing just that? Selfavarewolf moment
this is actually so beautiful. please don’t stop doing this.
Now this is erasure I can get behind!
All of these are so incredibly beautiful
Im in love with this
This is lovely!!!
this is one of the most powerful statements i've seen in years.  seriously, this should be an ad campaign on billboards or bus stops.  it's so fantastically self-evident what it is and what it means and why it's important.  dont even include the originals, the finished product speaks for itself.

this is one of the most perfect unions of art and politics i've seen since banksy started.
I love these! I’ve done this with the Bible
I needed this today.💜
I love this! But I also want to say to the teacher,  who said: 

""My classroom will continue to be a place where these 'trans kids' learn that they are just confused. It's actually not your job as an educator to impose your own bias about a person's identity and try to 'correct' it.""

BITCH YOU ARE CONTRODICTING YOURSELF 👏
Okay I love this so much and I want to see more you're an icon, just sending their words back at them but stopping the hate.
Thank you for affirming and uplifting trans beauty through these comments. ❤️
I ought to thank you for turning the hate-filled sandwiches into delicious cups of coffee jelly with whipped (oatmilk) cream!
I got a good feeling from this thank you
I love this
This fucking rocks
wow i love this so much!
Wow I really love this. Powerful.
These are beautiful 💕
wow this is beautiful asf. 🥺 you are a rockstar
I chose not to read the originals, but the third one caught my eye and I'm so pissed. This is not someone qualified to be a teacher. You can be educated but not qualified because you spew hate and ignorance.
The blog fixing-bad-posts on Tumblr is dedicated to this exact concept! They do blackout poetry like this, for every LGBTQ+ identity, as well as being against sexist/racist/etc. stuff

Just thought I'd mention for anyone looking for this kind of positive stuff :D

Edit: Forgot to mention, but the blog doesn't even post the original hate comments. It's just the blackout poetry, and they allow submissions too if you wanna help spread positivity
I love this so much. I struggle a lot with hate comments and I think trying to make some of these erasure poems will really help. Thank you so very much for sharing these :)
[i had a try at it myself](https://imgur.com/a/pscpAc3)
You’ve made erasure poetry cool again.

Nice.
""My classroom will continue to be a place where these 'trans kids' learn that they are just confused. It's actually not your job as an educator to impose your own bias about a person's identity and attempt to ""correct"" it"" 

Is a hilariously un-self aware combination of sentences
These are a beautiful.
This is beautiful.
Thank you thank you thank you this is so wonderful I love you
please please please unblock their users. they don’t deserve anonymity.
This metaphor is everything, thank you 😂😂
Damn now I want a panini 😡
Heck yeah! It is so healing to take away the power of hateful words and turn them into a message of love instead.
Very symbolic
My thoughts exactly! I was SO hoping to find this comment ❤️
fixing-bad-posts on Tumblr has tons more stuff like this for all LGBTQ+ identities :)
@justsaysk on Instagram does this all the time! Definitely recommend their account :)
tumblr blog fixing-bad-posts has tons more of this stuff, not just for trans positivity but for all minorities :D
Huh?
I see you and I'm sending you some love and light 💛
This made my day, thank you so much! 🥺🥰
@justsaysk on Instagram does this a lot!
💗💗💗
@justsaysk in Instagram does it lots too!
Paninis for everyone
Ahhh, thank you for sharing! New favorite blog
Yes!! I was inspired to do this by justsaysk! I love their work so much 💛
I have made erasure poetry using the Bible
🫂
I WANT A PANINI
Is it posted anywhere?
You get a panini
No it’s an old crusty Bible of mine lol
Here I am trying to *get rid of* my panini
You did it with a physical book? That's really cool

Yes my parents got us precious moments Bible for Easter one year mine was pink so it held both gender and religious trauma for me so I used it the make erasure poetry I’m not sure I still have it tho"	11nzyt5	NonBinary	958	0.99	2023-03-10 20:31:09
Body shaming doesn’t die. I don’t know why I bothered in that server, it’s always the same people who get complimented. Way to make me feel worse than before…		"Hey, you look great! I love your piercing and your top surgery results look amazing at just two weeks 💜
Fuck em, you're a beautiful person who deserves nothing but happiness. In fact, every single person reading this, i wish you nothing but the best in life ❤️
People mass downvoted a mother on the front page of Reddit for letting her little boy choose to wear a dress.

Yeah, safe to say popular subreddits are filled with close minded insecure normies who project onto other people.

Having said that...

You look amazing :D
Fuck them.
I thought shirtless pics aren't allowed at all on r/freecompliments . Regardless of agab.
Fuck everyone who has taken ur confidence. Ur gorgeous. And don't for one second think ur not. Ps, don't ever be ashamed of ur scars, they are what make you, you. They tell a story that you went through.
You *are* gender hun. Don't let em get you down
Whoa, what the hell? Are scars not PG or?
Mod here. Closing comments for a while to catch up.

I’m leaving the comments locked because there are too many people who are just here to argue with you, OP. And honestly, I don’t want to moderate arguments happening due to what happened on another subreddit. Maybe another mod will come along and unlock this.

People are having their comments removed for excessive rudeness and bans are possible. Remember folks, you always have the option of *not* commenting.
I'm sorry it made you feel like shit, but I honestly don't think it was about your body at all. As far as I can tell, they don't allow shirtless posts from anyone, regardless of what their chest looks like 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: I take it back, they obviously do allow shirtless guys so this is some bullshit.
Sending hugs if you like hugs❤️. We will always support and love you here:). Also, I see you have a tattoo on your arm, what is it of?
[removed]
You don't even have nipples, how are you not child friendly ? Also you are very good-looking !
Aww, you have the same kinda scars as I do! Did you ask them to remove the nips or was it just a result of the style of surgery? For mine it was just easier/cheaper to not try and save the nipples. 😅
You look very cool
Well, screw them, you're fucking gorgeous. 😍 You look so damn happy 😊
I think they just take the post down because they need to keep it pg? Please tell me if I’m wrong.
Congrats! You look happy ❤️
Was it posted on r/freecompliments or r/nonbinary? 

Either way wtf are the mods thinking? It’s not a sexual post, not a lewd in my opinion. You’re just sharing your transition experience. 

Also you look absolutely amazing!! Like a fun, kinda silly person with cool hair in the photo. I bet we’d be friends irl
how's that non pg??😭 I think you look great, btw.
[removed]
Well I think they did a really good job on your surgery, it looks great!
It’s not PG because it’s still provocative also some times scars make people uneasy. It sucks but we need to balance how much we love ourselves with how much exposing that love to others can affect them as well. 

Their in their rights to flag it they have a larger audience to deal with. 

But you are handsome as hell and I hope you rock out in your new you suit!
You look great  lol, weird mods
Hey I'm so sorry!! You look amazing! Please don't take it personally, I would consider a recent surgery scar nsfw.
I think they might just want you to have a shirt on, but I don't know the sub.
Two weeks?!? I skipped over that part. I’m shocked! They look fantastic. Seriously op, you’re beautiful and I really really hope my results look as good as yours
Thank you so much!! ☺️
You are a beautiful soul. Thank you ❤️‍🩹
Agreed. I may as well just stay away from those threads.
It doesn’t mention it in their rules, that’s why I’m confused. Thought I’d seen some before. But lots of breast showing is not considered NSFW? I’m confused
Replying to myself here: I enquired and they got real mad, saying that all chests are nsfw (lmao what!) and I'm basically an asshole for even suggesting they may be bigots. They also muted me for 28 days. Real bunch of sad sacks (fyi my message was friendly as fuck but they can go suck a toe now). Edit to add: I actually didn't even suggest they were transphobic, I said that no matter what their reasons were, they weren't gonna come out looking good, then named a couple of potential reasons I could think of, the very last one of which was transphobia. So it was totally transphobia imo or they wouldn't have overreacted the way they did. Scrolling the sub just now I saw a bra and bare male chest in the first 10ish posts.
That’s exactly where I’m coming from, I’m glad it’s not just me that read it that way.
They definitely allow [shirtless pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/s4m1bh/body_shaming_doesnt_die_i_dont_know_why_i/hsszzz2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
Aw, thank you! It’s of a carnation, for my mom.
OP is not in a shower. OP is against I white textured wall. Plenty of AMAB shirtless male pics that are clearly in bathrooms/bedrooms.
[removed]
Agree lmao
That was my thought. Thank you!! 🥰
What isn’t PG about this? There are afab people on that thread with their whole chest out. Just felt exclusive to me, and what a blow… I didn’t get any upvotes, but I got a couple comments that really helped me feel better. Then I wake up and my post is taken down… they said it’s supposed to be PG-13, I don’t see where this is a problem. I messaged the mod.
On r/freecompliments ! I agree with you. My boyfriend said maybe it was the medical tape, but it’s still a PG photo. Thank you for your kindness ❤️‍🩹
That’s the funny thing, the scars are covered! But as I said in a different comment, the scar thing is what upsets me, because I’ve got a major body scar just below that that cuts my whole torso. All bodies should be welcome, scarred ones too. Thank you for your kindness!! ✨
My boyfriend pointed out to me that even though it’s not Gorey, it makes people uncomfortable. I just don’t think that falls under NSFW. But the people that run that thread are allowed to have whoever they want in the group, I just won’t be a part of it and that’s okay with me. Thank you for your kindness!! ❤️‍🩹
I don’t see this as provocative, and it’s weird that it seems to be because I’m afab that it’s NSFW. Why is a shirtless pic of a cis dude sticking his tongue out harmless, but my shirtless pic is too much? Gatekeepy
Thank you!! 🥺💗
I’m learning this, I didn’t consider it. I’ve got medical tape over the scar, so I thought it was palatable enough. But that’s okay! Wrong server for me.
Agreed with this! Also it takes so much time to get used to a new body and it’s totally normal to feel moments of weirdness or insecurity or whatever for awhile after a big change like this. I had a reduction last year and I think it took about 6 weeks to really start to heal or settle into my new shape, even after wanting it for years. You’re doing amazing ❤️
The queer community should secretly start competing subs to groups like this and then just be real safe spaces for compliments instead of letting these asshole run shit.
You were totally in the right. Also, you look so fucking happy and your top surgery scars look dooooooppe. I hope you get to really enjoy tank top season when it comes around (if that’s your thing).
[removed]
even if they WERE boobies, boobs are shown in pg13?

 also - society has a real hard-on for not caring if a chest is shown publicly as long as it's flat or they're male appearing ~ so im upset that they either viewed you as a woman and found that inappropriate, or they viewed you as non-binary and not a safe topic for kids (ie saying your post isn't okay because they think it's hard for kids to understand nb instead of saying it isn't pg because of incorrect perceived woman-ness)
Well then it’s a problem about that subreddit. I’m sorry for that :(
The only thing I can think of that wouldn't be gender-related is being 2 weeks post-op...which is still stupid. Like, your scars look well healed (btw, looking great for only 2 weeks post-op!!)


Even then, they'd have to unequivocally remove any post with visible scars like this. I'm not on that sub, so idk, but press X to doubt.
True
[removed]
Agreed!!! We should start a thread!
Interesting. This picture was taken in my living room. I guess I have to get used to people sexualizing me, even in this body. This isn’t a nude and it’s odd that it’s treated like it is.
You said it better than I could.
You are deadass wrong about there not being shirtless cis men on that subreddit.

So if I’m uncomfortable with Black bodies or fat bodies they should be excluded too because I am uncomfortable?!?! Or is it just people who have scars? Or maybe it’s ok exclude those with other physical deformity  like a missing arm or microcephaly? Just gross. Crappy sub.
If other people’s bodies make them uncomfortable then that’s a THEM problem that they shouldn’t be projecting onto other people. Trans people shouldn’t have to hide their bodies for the comfort of others, their discomfort is their own to deal with
There also isn’t a rule regarding shirts on or off. Where I find offense is that I’ve got a major body scar that has nothing to do with my gender journey, and that has been flagged as NSFW before. All bodies should be welcome.
No, I’m not upset that people are uncomfortable, that’s what I expect. I’m upset that I’m unwelcome.
Put out a calling for help on r/lgdt and all other queer subs. If thier interest in undermining the phobs then dive in.
It’s being treated like a nude because it’s all visible skin and no visible clothes.
Look I’m glad you used the search feature because all of those posts are over +1 year old. I think one was maybe 120 days.. 

But that’s congruent with what’s happening here. Maybe those posts weren’t flagged back then during the times they were posted.  Who knows he’ll some only have 30ish upvotes on a forum that readily averages hundreds.. so that’s more data to gloss over.. 

Objectively the majority is selfies and smiles on the subreddit. But hey I’m not going to stand in the way of people who want to keep trying to just be a victim. It’s exhausting.
So even if OP is wearing pants, if people (probably AMAB hets) imagine OP is naked then it is OP’s fault? That is just effed. Misogynistic and transphobic. As pointed out elsewhere (with evidence) pics like this are permitted of AMAB, including AMAB’s with large breasts, AMAB’s in bed, AMAB’s whose pics suggest they are fully naked.
Those are literally just the ones I could find with 30 seconds of searching because they mentioned being shirtless, there are literally dozens more of these posts. 

They are not trying to be a victim, they have been victimized and you are being a bully. You need to stop it. You were already being disgusting by telling them it's acceptable for people to be uncomfortable seeing trans bodies the same way they cis ones.

i wore this very gender fit to the gym and when i walked past the cold pool a man stared up at me open mouthed from the water and after about 20 seconds he said “that outfit is an outfit” and then sank into the water up to his eyes in shame 💪🏼		"You look so fucking great and cool.

Your self-deprecation may be harming people.	"""I don't deserve to be called nonbinary?"", ""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", ""Am I X enough to be nonbinary?"", ""I'm AXAB so I can't be nonbinary without surgery"" and all of their fellow statements, I'm talking about you.

**Your gender identity is not a milestone.**

It's not an aesthetic, it's not a body type, it's not a race you need to win. It's your gender.

Posting self-deprecating (and I'm using that term with the conscious choice to give the benefit of the doubt that that's what these posts are about, without intending to be slights or have ulterior motives) posts about how you don't ""qualify"" as nonbinary does, even if you don't intend to, *harm* to everyone else browsing.

Just to list a few ill impacts, intended or not, that these statements end up doing off the top of my head:

* **Shoving people with low self-esteem about themselves under the bus.**

""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", asks a person and posts a selfie, genuinely having the misinterpretation or trauma related to gender issues that you need to be attractive to qualify as your gender.

Meanwhile, another user sees the selfie, believes the person to be more conventionally attractive than they are (*especially* if the person seeing it has qualifications that already make them ""ineligible"" to being seen as beautiful by their cultural beauty standards), and learns the lesson, ""well, if that person is questioning it, then the bar must exist, and I am *certainly* don't qualify.""

* **Othering nonbinaryness.**

""I don't deserve to be called a woman.""

""Am I too ugly to be a man?""

""Am I curvy enough to be a woman?""

Most cis binary people don't ever feel the need to ask these questions. At most, in the context of people who have experiences of being marginalised out of their gender (usually womanhood), but even then, it's usually in the context of ""to be seen as"", and often acknowledged to be the result of societal lenses rather than that 'woman' or 'man' are sacred categories you need to complete labours of Heracles to qualify for.

*So why do we do this to nonbinary people?*

* **Hurting people who have experiences with being marginalised out of their previous identities by subjecting them to similar standards again in their new-found self.**

Yeah, I wasn't done yet. People who have experiences of having seen their AGAB gender as 'conditional' due to ableism, racism, fatphobia, misogyny, et cetera, do not need having those same pressures applied to them now. We managed to accept a wider spectrum of womanhood, a wider spectrum of manhood, now we *need* to get better about not just grabbing those same boxes and applying them to nonbinary people.

* **Equating your transition goals as the right image for being nonbinary.**

Especially us with the goal of ""indiscernible gender"" tend to be faulty of this. I very specifically ask for AFAB nonbinary people to mind how they talk about ""looking nonbinary"" versus ""looking more masculine"". Feminine nonbinary people, and nonbinary people with different bodies deserve to be here also.

Androgyny doesn't equal being nonbinary, and while you're more than allowed to strive for an androgynous appearance, *please* don't equate it to ""looking non-binary"". Especially because...

* **Perpetuating sexism.**

...more often than not, the image of androgyny, as it's seen in the context of stereotypical nonbinaryness, is ""vaguely masculine."" The image of a non-binary body is an AFAB person who has altered their body, which ends up perpetuating not only stereotypes of what being non-binary means, but also equates AMAB bodies as ""neutral"" and AFAB bodies as ""other.""

(Tangentially related: that post about genitalia, while *hopefully* meant to criticise people's expectation of nonbinary people, ended up specifically equating bodies with vulvas as ""sexual and other"", which brought up a lot of righteous anger and shame in especially AFAB people who have already had to deal with a lifetime of being defined as sex toys for consumption.)

**I don't believe any of the people here asking these questions or out-putting these rants are being malicious**, not unless they prove themselves otherwise. **But you do need to be aware of the impact your words have.**

* If you are talking about societal expectations, *state that*, and point your dagger at the people putting those expectations instead of other nonbinary people.
* Separate your personal transition goals from nonbinary as a label.
* Don't equate your dysphoria with the implication that there are standards for being nonbinary.

**TL:DR; Watch for what you imply to be a fact in your speech, because someone more impressionable may take it as one.**"	"Thank you!! I know most of these sorts of posts probably come from a place of insecurity, and looking for confirmation of “yes, you TOO are nonbinary! And enough!” But you totally hit on the unnamed uneasiness I couldn’t explain
I think this also goes for people who are insecure about whether or not they can claim the word trans as a nonbinary person. It's okay to feel however you feel! But how you express that may tell other people that they can't claim that label either
I really like this post because it's goal isn't to shut down important discussions for us to have, but rather to emphasis the need for self awareness and specificity.

That said, I do think it's absolutely important that people who are new to talking about their identities may not understand a lot of the nuance. I lurked for a long time before I started commenting, and I did a lot of external research. But I don't know that it's fair to expect that of people who are in pain and don't have the vocabulary to express it safely.

Not that any of us owe it to be anyone else's therapist, but that it is important that we can speak what we think we feel and hope that someone will be kind enough to share their experience to help give context to our pain.

So yeah, absolutely. We should have this or something very much like it somewhere handy, but I wish there was a sub, a tag, something we could give people where they can spill out what they're feeling and not have people who can't handle that have to stumble across it. Maybe there already is and I just don't see it (I have observation issues sometimes).

Just thinking.
Yes! This needs to be pinned as guidance for all posts here.
I agree with this in principle, but likewise agree with other commenters who have pointed out the very real need to express these feelings, especially among those who understand. For this type of discussion, I would suggest r/NonbinaryTalk. They don’t allow photos (so you will not see any photos asking for affirmations, whether people “pass”, etc) but it is a good place to talk through these emotions and doubts.
Thank you so much. I have seen so many of these posts lately and it has really started to alienate me from this community so I’m so happy someone said something.

I feel like especially the posts that are about AGAB are really reinforcing my feeling that we are only seen as “menlite” or “woman lite” and it’s so distressing. I’m nonbinary. That’s it. I don’t want to be lumped in with people based on my agab, because it isn’t my gender.

Also people asking For woman and afab enby spaces are terfs.
While I see where you're coming from, I also don't think it's as dangerous as you're implying and can actually be helpful overall. It can even be educating and therapeutic in a lot of cases.

You more often than not, almost always really, see someone replying to the self-deprecating person and explaining why they are valid. First of all, you have one person who is going to feel better and feel more valid, and whoever else that feels like that and reads that will feel more valid. It can be extremely positive for people to get validated for more than just that one person.

This post also implies that someone should know better. Often they don't and that's why they made that comment in the first place. This doesn't apply to like ""do I look non-binary"", but more so ""I don't think I deserve to be called non-binary because so-and-so"". They literally don't know better and don't realize that this is not the right way to think about it, so they're not being self-deprecating for the sake of it, but more out of ignorance and probably wouldn't realize this post applies to it. I've said I didn't think I deserved the label trans because I didn't transition in any form. That was my own ignorance, and people told me, no, I don't identify as my AGAB so I can absolutely use that label. This post wouldn't have enlightened me that I shouldn't say that. It was ignorance, not even knowing that it hurts people, just thinking that's the way things are and that label is ""earned"" in a way I hadn't.

I think there's not much usefulness in telling people not to make self-deprecating comments, because often they pop out and feel just like reality to the person, not like self-deprecation. People are legitimately depressed, don't realize they are speaking out of low self-esteem, and have difficult issues with how they look at themselves. You can even end up targeting neurodivergent people who might be in depressed episodes, basically telling them to keep shit to themselves unless they have something positive to say about themselves. Maybe a bit more extreme but it's like, ""you're saying depressing things and making others depressed, you're hurting people by being in pain"". 

Half the ignorant shit I believed about myself, how I didn't deserve so and so, was cleared up by reading comments like these, and when I've seen others make self-deprecating comments I've taken my time to validate them and explain how I felt that way once but here's why it's wrong. Hopefully that person went on to do the same. Just my opinion, I believe it's a very positive thing overall.
👏👏👏
We need to make space for people to express the real emotions of doubt and confusion that come with gender discovery. Such a space did not exist for a very long time (my entire lifetime until maybe 5 years ago, for example), and that forced many generations of people into the closet and into isolation. Suggesting that it is harmful to others to express your true emotions if they are not positive recedes that space, and if this is the only space someone has it shrinks their ability to get the support they need.
I understand all this, and agree, but I think it's fair to say that not very many of us are brimming with self belief.
I want to apologize for the times I have made self-deprecating comments then. Honestly, being told constantly that I look like a man or I don't look feminine at all has just always gotten to me, and it's hurt to the point of making me feel like I'm not good enough to be nonbinary. But you're totally right in that I should be upset at the people who have set those standards for me. I wish society didn't set such harsh gender standards on individuals who don't identify as their AGAB.
Very well said 👏👏👏
*This.*

I’ve been thinking this for awhile, so thank you for putting words to it.
This this this this!!! I’ve felt like I should leave this sub so many times because of the posts you describe, like it can really make me feel uncomfortable and sometimes annoyed when people ask things like “am I too ugly to be this or that” yknow? Coz I know people are insecure, so am I, but implying you have to be conventionally attractive or androgynous in order to be non-binary is a rough thing to see. I’ve fought to be happy how I am coz I’m non-binary no matter what, how you look and present doesn’t change your gender.
I'm really sorry, and will delete my posts accordingly.
👏!!!!!
I think a lot of people making posts like these are confused/scared, or perhaps young.  It's hard to think about how your words affect others when they've merely been part of a train of thought that's been chasing you off the rails for months/years.

But yes, everything you said is true.
This.
Many of us don't have other safe places to express our insecurities, so it's important to be able to do that
I’ll probs get hate for this but I stand by it. This starts because of the obsession with labels. Just be you fuck what others think. I know it’s easier said then done and it took me till I was 23 to properly do so but if you take small steps I can guarantee that realising that only you define you and no one or any label can is hella liberating.
Good post!
Yes
I personally read trans as ""I identify more strongly with the things typically ASSOCIATED with the opposite binary gender of my agab then I do being neutral, bigender, or my agab enough to CONSIDER physically altering my body to match it"". That doesn't fit me but it does fit better with my new nonbinary thinking I've been working on and the trans woman I know that doesn't want to physically transition because she is just not okay with being chemical dependent on hrt and as result last I heard wasn't on hrt.
all of this. i feel so dysphoric when i see posts that focus on agab when agab is completely irrelevant. i wonder if the mods could include a flair for internalized transphobia or something like that? or if there could be a reminder to acknowledge that internalized transphobia/fatphobia/etc is at play???
You make such good points too! Is it possible to feel like I totally agree with you AND OP at the same time? because I do. That’s what makes this whole conversation so interesting, and how nuanced our collective experiences of discovering our nonbinary-ness are.
This
i agree with you, but i don't think you're really contradicting the op, either. i think the point isn't to shut down discussions of doubt and confusion, but to frame doubt and confusion as emotions rather than as facts (maybe not the right word?). for example, instead of saying, ""am i too ugly to be nonbinary?"" one could say, ""i feel too ugly to be nonbinary and i feel invalid because xyz"" and directly ask for reassurance and/or discussion of the societal forces that drive these kinds of insecurities in nonbinary spaces. if that makes sense??? like i definitely want folks to be able to talk about their fears/insecurities etc without actively perpetuating them within the community. i guess it's a fine line, tho, so it does have to be ok on some level for folks to walk it less than perfectly
i think it's also ok to just feel invalid or whatever and straight up ask for reassurance? like for reals, if i see you posting that you're struggling with some internalized enbyphobia or whatever, imma hop in and remind you that you're nonbinary af, you're fantastic, and you make this sub even more awesome than it already was. cuz it's true!
I just want to say I really appreciated your post about gender essentialism, it gave me a lot to think about. Please don't delete it!
I mean that’s ok with how you read it but trans is literally identifying as a gender other than the one you are assigned with birth. It’s fine if it is a label that you don’t want to claim but that’s what it is 🤷
As a transfeminine nonbinary person (trying to find a label -- agender woman?  rofl, who knows or cares!), the ""trans"" label is somewhat difficult for me.  Yeah, I'm on HRT.  But as someone who isn't very feminine at all, I do feel more attached to the ""nonbinary"" label.  I describe myself as ""trans"" to cis people, because it seems to communicate a lot and they can't understand simple gender concepts without their brains overheating.  In the end, to me, labels are about creating a set of expectations for whoever I'm talking to.

I'm not a transmedicalist at all (dysphoria is *certainly* not required to be trans), but the primary motivating factor in me describing myself as ""trans"" and ""woman"" rather than just ""nonbinary"" is the treatment I've received for dysphoria and society's expectations that all lesbians are binary women (and I'm definitely a lesbian).

It's all a big frustrating word game anyway and I commend everyone who hasn't been tricked into playing!
Haha yeah it's just a discussion. I see where OP is coming from. They are coming from a real place and I think it's valid to agree with both of us at some level. It's not like I totally disagree with OP, just feel differently about some aspects.
Thank you so much. This is so sweet. I get afraid of being annoying asking for reassurance, and sometimes I feel ignored when I do ask for reassurance. But I'm glad you're so supportive. Thank you again. :')
I guess it's shifted to that because that fits me being trans neutral, I honestly don't care about sticking with my ""dead gender"" at all anymore, so yours fits better now. 😂
Yah I just had the I guess I'm trans neutral realization so mood. I have what would be called gynecomastia so I guess I already got what I would have taken hrt for so guess that's a thing.
Dang I started developing breast tissue at around 13 before testosterone did me dirty (never got diagnosed with anything though).  I wonder how common that is?
Idk, maybe ask a doctor, I figure mine was related to high Adderall doses I was on but all I really know for sure about it is I still have my tits at 25, about 10% of the majority of case that start in puberty don't go away last I looked at statistics."	qo1leo	NonBinary	615	0.97	2021-11-06 14:39:15

Is that an old popcorn bucket? It looks similar to ones ive seen when i worked at the movies 👀 i love the plant too btw, good job :)
sounds like a great day!!

Even as society tries to tell males to cover up more (because their body is deemed shameful) and to tell females to cover up less (because their body is deemed sexual), I refuse to play along with such binary gender mandates.		"Lmao where do you live that people are telling men to cover up more and women to dress more revealing? Like I get that women's bodies are sexualized but 90% of the time people (including women!) are telling women to not dress so slutty, be more modest, leave something to the imagination, don't dress like you're asking for it, etc.
I wish I had the legs for shorts like that... like damn! You're definitely pulling that off 

I just have short fat legs best suited to jeans/skinny jeans 😅
Literally too sexy for a shirt.
[deleted]
as a nonbinary person who is afab i have spent my entire life being criticized, shamed, ridiculed, by peers, family, teachers, people in power, for wearing outfits they deemed inappropriate. i knew spaghetti straps were “sexy” at the age of 5, because of dress code rules at school. if I go out in something that shows my long legs, or my shapely chest and waist, no doubt I will get dirty looks and stares. you look cute, but you could have left the whole “girls can dress sexy” out of it. AMABS can walk around with their tops off and nipples out for Christ sake I have been wearing a bra since grade 3.
I'm straight but i just wanted to tell ya that even i think you amazing in that outfit like my god you really are rocking it.
[removed]
Notice I didn't say ""people"", I said ""society"". In other words, it has nothing to do with where I live but rather the predominant social conventions and attitudes promulgated by both mainstream media and fashion.

We'll start out with the most obvious example: magazines. Seventeen magazine is highly influential amongst tween girls. Here are some outfits they suggest for back to school:

[https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/g2527/back-to-school-outfit-ideas/](https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/g2527/back-to-school-outfit-ideas/)

Now let's see what they think guys should wear to look ""hotter"":

Isn't that remarkable. It's almost as if Seventeen magazine confirmed exactly what I said: Males are told to cover up more and females are told to cover up less.

I feel bad picking on Seventeen magazine. So let's find out what random vloggers suggest that tween girls wear back to school. After all, they are the ones actually wearing the clothes, so it only makes sense we take their advice, right?

[https://imgur.com/a/ORJPXzc](https://imgur.com/a/ORJPXzc)

Bloggers also have a lot to say about back-to-school looks for girls:

We shouldn't forget the guys, since they are going back to school too:

* [https://www.brandedgirls.com/outfits-for-high-school-guys/](https://www.brandedgirls.com/outfits-for-high-school-guys/)

It seems that even in the blogosphere, males are being told to cover up more than the females, by wearing bigger or baggier clothes by comparison.

And it's not just mainstream fashion that promotes these double standards either. Music videos from major recording artists routinely showcase males being fully clothed while females are scantily clad.

[https://imgur.com/a/6EoYpKX](https://imgur.com/a/6EoYpKX)

In sports there is also a notable disparity between the uniforms that athletes wear. Regardless of age, the females are nearly always wearing comparatively skimpier and tighter outfits than the males.

[https://imgur.com/a/VSYeMlp](https://imgur.com/a/VSYeMlp)

It should come as no surprise that action and adventure movies, video games, and TV series play on this double standard too. There are endless examples of female characters intentionally wearing tighter or skimper outfits than the male characters for no practical reason even when they are going into battle.

[https://www.nicksmovieinsights.com/2020/12/borrowed-robes-female-video.html](https://www.nicksmovieinsights.com/2020/12/borrowed-robes-female-video.html)

*""The problem is, female players have to exist in the same gameworld. Their own desires are either ignored, or inaccurately portrayed. Either through her own avatar or the NPCs she encounters, a female player is forced to see how men want her to appear. This goes beyond escaping the traditional, passive roles like the damsel-in-distress. Female heroes are invariably sexualized no matter the type.""*

[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/harmful-female-gender-stereotypes-film-industry/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/harmful-female-gender-stereotypes-film-industry/)

*""But even when \[women\] do appear in powerful roles, they are often objectified, according to the new study, which used machine learning to examine 56 top films in countries from United States to India, Sweden, Uganda and South Sudan. It found that nearly a third of powerful female characters were shown wearing revealing clothing compared to less than 10% of similar male characters.""*

Then there is swimwear. So often it's said that men can go topless, while women can't. But that's only half the picture. Males in America are still expected to wear oversized baggy shorts that obscure their thighs, hips, buttocks, and pubic region. Females by comparison wear skintight bottoms that expose their thighs and hips and that countour their buttocks and pubic region.

This YouTube video of teens cliff-jumping makes these differences readily apparent:

[https://i.imgur.com/JBkUXvc.png](https://i.imgur.com/JBkUXvc.png)

As you can see, there is plenty of evidence that on a systemic level in America, males are encouraged to cover up more and females are encouraged to cover up less.
That doesn't mean that both don't happen simultaneously. Women can be shamed in individual instances for how they dress, but yet still actively encouraged by society at large (institutional sexism) to expose or reveal their bodies. Nowhere is this more evident than just by looking at the disparity in men's vs. women's fashion, and how the clothing is designed. Women have few options other than to wear skintight or revealing clothes. While men have few options other than to wear oversized and baggy clothes.

I could cite so many examples of where a random male can be placed alongside a random female, and the female will be wearing comparatively tighter or skimpier clothing. This can be tested quite easily regardless of the social setting, with perhaps the two notable exceptions being swimming and fitness, where men can get away with wearing relatively less overall clothing than women -- but even in those situations the men's crotch and buttock region is still significantly more covered by fabric compared to that of women where they are often wearing skimpier and/or tighter bottoms.

Of course, music videos are my favourite, only because they so readily showcase this duality. Typically the female dancers/singers will be wearing bodysuits, miniskirts, booty shorts, daisy dukes, crop tops, bikinis, thongs, or any other variety of skimpy and skintight outfits while the male dancers/singers in stark contrast will be wearing suitcoat and tie, jeans, tee-shirt, tracksuit, or other very loose and oversized garments. And the funny thing is, it doesn't matter if the music videos are foreign, because the same sexist depictions still occur anyway -- whether it's a French music video or a Japanese music video or a Russian music video. The women are virtually always scantily clad to look as visually appealing as possible while the men are dressed nice and formal or simple and casual with nothing suggestive or provocative about their appearance whatsoever.

These double standards fit in perfectly in with the sexist idea that men are not supposed to be seen, but rather to remain in the background and to fit in with their peers and to never challenge the norms of masculinity while women are supposed to stand out from the crowd and be in the foreground and constantly challenging the norms of femininity. This is why boys/men's mainstream fashion, particularly formalwear and athleticwear, is always so bland and boring and mundane and utilitarian and conservative and basically never has any real revolutionary changes compared to that of girls/women's mainstream fashion.

I did an experiment one time, where I sat out near the sidewalk and simply watched people walk by -- observing the clothing choices of any male/female pairs whether it was a son and daughter, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, etc. In nearly every single case, the males had more skin coverage relative to the females whether that was their arms or legs or torso. Even in situations where the male and female were wearing similar outfits (like say, a simple tee shirt and shorts) the individual garments of the male would still cover their skin more than that of the female. And it wasn't just skin coverage either. Tightness was also a factor. In the vast majority of cases where pants were being worn, they were more form-fitting on the female than the male. I was surprised to see that even socks came into play too, as the males would often have taller socks that covered more of their legs than the females that would have basically be wearing no-show socks or foregoing socks entirely, thus completely revealing their calves and ankles.

In the United States, women and girls are by in large almost always wearing comparatively tighter or skimpier outfits than that of men and boys when in the same social situations. That's an easily verifiable fact.
According to somebody else, the shorts are apparently too short.
short fat legs look good in whatever their human wants to garb them in. don't let the fat-hating cis hets get you down!
So sexy, it hurts?
Aww, I'm blushing and giggling at the same time :D
I don't approve of it at all. And I look horrible.
Notice that I never said ""girls can dress sexy"" anywhere.

I also find it interesting that you claim AMABs can walk around with their tops off and nipples out even though that's a patently falsehood. In the vast majority of social situations I certainly can't do that. Here's just a partial list of places off the top of my head where I couldn't walk around with my top off and nipples out.

School classrooms

Lecture halls

Movie theatres

Playgrounds

Banks

Courtrooms

City Council Chambers

Police Stations

Fast Food Restaurants

Museums

Passenger Jets

Airport Terminals

Bus Terminals

Subway Terminals

Amtrak Trains

Subway Trains

City Buses

Cafes

Dentist's Offices

Hair Salons

Antique Shops

Pet Stores

Bakeries

Diners

Bookstores

Florists

Pawn Shops

Pharmacies

Grocery Stores

Convenience Stores

Shopping Malls

Bowling Alleys

Roller-skating Rinks

Hardware Stores

Hospital Cafeterias

Public Libraries

TV News Stations

Office Meeting Rooms

Mental Health Clinics

Convention Centers

Food Courts

Nurseries

Then there is the matter that even in the situations where an AMAB person can take off their shirt and have their nipples out, that doesn't mean they want to. That's because there's a difference between ""can"" and ""want"" and ""do"". Just because someone can do something doesn't mean they want to. And just because someone wants to do something, doesn't mean they will do it.
I'm not sure what your point is. I see women dressing like this or similar all the time. In fact I bought these clothes in the women's department.
Definitely turned mine.
Are people only allowed to blend into the background now?
I seem to have made some people mad....
I also forgot to share examples of concert performances, which make the double standard even more glaring. And then there are also the ""camgirls"" on Twitch who are cashing in on exposing their bodies in the most revealing clothing possible. Yet male Twitch streamers are not walking around half-naked in order to get viewers.
Well you definitely have the natural flair for them, I think they really suit you! 

Maybe that person is just jealous
Thank you! 

It's also partially a case of ""hungry bum"" sometimes too lol

But yes you are absolutely right!
Consult a physician if painful sexiness lasts longer than four hours.
I like how I'm downvoted for acknowledging all of the places that I, as an AMAB person with a male experience, am not supposed to expose my nipples and remove my shirt even after the person above claimed I can freely walk around with my nipples exposed and shirt removed, which is obviously not the case.

Youre not a very smart person are you? This ain't the place for pearl clutching. The only people who would get ""offended"" by this aren't worth worrying about. Its their choice what they want to wear and they dont need to worry about what makes people comfortable. I can't figure out the point of your comment cause unless you're brain dead its pretty damn obvious that conflict could start because of how they dress. People are ignorant assholes. Im not sure why you felt the need to point that out when OP would be most aware of that out of anyone how the way they dress affects them. Think before you type next time
I should dress for what other people want not for myself.
💚
Yes 😆
Have you seen men's running shorts? They're *very* short. Nothing wrong with people wearing short shorts in public as long as whatever genitals they have are covered.
There aren't any genitals hanging out, or boldly outlined, so that'd be entirely on them for choosing to be offended.
don't body shame ppl in this sub, pls. that's not the vibe here. op looks great and so does everyone else who posts selfies here.
Who gives a shit??
Uh, sorry? I feel like I haven't said this correctly... I deleted the comment to save everybody else from having to get more mad than they already are with me. SORRY!
Nah those people are dumb. If they make you feel good, that's all that matters!
why tho? you do you. other ppl's opinions are not your problem! edit: if you're referring to the commenter below, they're not being cool.
I assume you're correct.
Again, not what I was trying to say... I wasn't saying they don't look good. Or trying to body shame anybody. I'm just trying to say some conflict may happen if you were to wear that in public.
I am the one that dumb for not dressing more appropriately.
Still their decision to wear that or not. I seriously doubt your comments are going to impact that decision at all, nor should they. Maybe just worry about yourself in the future?

I like your shoelaces
Where'd you get the laces from?
I love those laces.
OBSESSED with the laces! I would def wear those
I like um & love the laces.
So do I :)
the laces were from a uk based seller on etsy by the name TZLaces(sorry i didn't respond earlier), they're handmade to order and you can request a specific size if they don't have the size you want listed
They actually made me want to wear my converse again, my old laces are so dirty and are now in their own jars, idk why
 Edit: corrected spelling
They add just the right amount of color to my converse that I definitely didn't want because of Del Spooner from I, Robot
I stan saving things for later.
I'll never use those laces again, I'm not throwing them out though
Old laces can make good cat toys 😀

Being Genderfluid Vent (read text/caption)	"Vent (kinda)


Hii my name is Leslie/Quinn/Ben (I use all three names you can alternate between them) Idk what it say. I just hate being genderfluid sometimes. It’s really annoying that my gender always flip flops and I have multiple genders. (I feel any combination of feminine, masculine, neutral, and sometimes some other unexplained genders here and there) And since I’m closeted it’s even harder to fully understand what gender I’m feeling cause if it’s anything other than my agab I can’t express it. And then when I tell anyone who isn’t lgbtq+ about being genderfluid they don’t get it and think I’m being extra or something. I wish I could use they/she/he pronouns but if I do, people just resort to only using him cause my agab is male. A lot of times I want to feel pretty and girly and the shame kind of gets to me sometimes. I LOVE the color purple and black as well and I would love to wear a goth/punk style with those colors. I identify as a nonbinary lesbian as well and a big dream of mine is dressing like a butch lesbian. I have so many things I want to do, hopefully someday soon I can. Idk I needed to vent/rant about this thanks for listening you beautiful/handsome/gorgeous/cute/pretty people (whichever adjective you prefer 🥰✨)

P.S. these pictures I added here represent how I want to look.

P.S also (I had to delete it and post it again cause I forgot to add a flair lol)"	"genderfluid people are a minority among enbies, who are in turn a minority among trans folk, who are themslves a minority among queer people, who are a minority among all humans. 

it sucks not being understood or respected by the majority, but you're definitely not alone and YOU ARE VALID regardless of how you present or identify.
Valid, and you're not alone!
You're definitely not alone, and I think Quinn is THE coolest name
you’re totally valid!! however, posting someone else’s art without credit is totally not.
It’s like being a chameleon that changes colors, regardless of the background or the chameleon’s intentions to remain the color they were before.
if that first picture isn’t almost EXACTLY what I wish I looked like too idk what is. Nice work, love thy style

I felt this vent in my core. And while idk if I consider myself fluid (I think so, but I’m figuring it out still) what i experience is VERY close to you. 

AMAB. Wanting to be pretty. Though personally i think in another world I’d be a genderqueer bi girl. 

Thanks for sharing. Nice to know there’s similar stories out there. Much love friend.
Someone understands my pain, finally. Glad to see another genderfluid person here <3
I also feel a bit annoyed about my changes of gender, I don't really like changes in general 😭😭
I'm in a really similar situation where I can't express my gender, I understand how you're feeling so well. I think that you're really cool and I love your style :)
Absolutely spot-on. You’re not alone feeling that way.
Seen, heard, and felt. I’m genderfluid too and just trying to figure out my presentation. I wish my feelings would settle but they just don’t seem to ever
My dear Leslie, my heart goes out to you. You’re a wonderful person and I just know that someday wether it be soon or far in the future you will find yourself in a place where everyone understands you. I just hope you know, I understand.
i see you, genderfluidity can be a real pain. i usually don't mind presenting and passing as my agab but i'm mostly neutral, and it's frustrating to realize that i pass a little *too* well. the only time i experience body dysmorphia is when i occasionally swing over to the definitely masculine part of my gender identity. the rest of the time i'm grateful not to be stuck in a gendered box, instead free to be whoever i am in a given moment. it gets easier when you are surrounded with people who are understanding and compassionate, so you just gotta get through until then. i'm rooting for you!!
Mood
I feel you Quinn, i’m still exploring my gender but i have thought that i’m genderfluid, although currently i say genderflux, and i also can’t express myself openly. 

although not exactly the same, a lot of genderfluid people have similar feelings, especially early in self discovery. but we are all valid regardless.

i don’t want to give too much advice bc i’m definitely not the greatest at it. but i also use they/she/he pronouns and something i do is i tell (cis) people something different each time they see me. although it doesn’t always lead to them using all pronouns it usually leads to some variance. 

if you ever need someone to talk to (especially someone who knows and understands genderfluidity) you can dm me. i live in the us west coast so if i don’t respond at times i hope you understand, but i’ll respond asap!
Purple and black are the best colors - mixed with goth style... perfection. I would dress like that myself if I wasn't so shy about my looks.
Hey, I see you. I'm a questioning genderfluid person myself and I'm so frustrated by it too. Though I never feel masc I do kind of bounce around the femme-to-nonbinary-to-agender zone. It's so hard to explain to people who don't get it.

Hell, it's hard for me to even accept it about *myself*. Let alone others.

Wanting to be cute and femme and pretty is absolutely allowed. I know you know that logically, but the emotional side of you needs to hear it. There's nothing wrong with being who you are, even if that person is a little different every day.

I think wanting to dress butch is a great idea. Maybe try looking into stuff that says goth butch to you? That could be a good compromise between the aesthetics that live in your heart.

(For example, my different sides want different vibes. One wants to wear skirts or dresses with short hair, the other wants to be in preppy gender neutral-ish outfits with long hair. I realized last night I can compromise by wearing preppy shirts with dickie collars to simulate layering, and skirts or cute floral pants! Can't wait to get paid next week so I can buy some of those shirts. The jury's still out on what to do with my hair though...it's currently short and growing out so it feels like three different kinds of Weird)
I'm genderfluid too :DD 
I always get rlly happy to see other genderfluid ppllll
This is exactly how I feel!!
You are valid. Don't listen to people who say that you are not. :)

Wow actually I guess you’re right. that makes a lot of sense. Huh. Thanks, that made me realize why it’s hard being genderfluid it’s basically unheard of in society
Literally though. I stumbled upon an anti-genderfluid rant (https://www.reddit.com/r/truscum/comments/1071yat/how_does_), and everyone was like “Oh yeah, genderfluidity isn’t a thing, you’re either cis, trans opposite gender, or trans enby”

Also, thank you. It means a lot to feel valid, and I appreciate that.
Thank you : )
Thank you! I like the name a lot cause in the Harley Quinn show, Batman would call Harley just “Quinn” for short and I love it so much. And I like that it sounds gender neutral
You’re right. I’m sorry I was at the heat of the moment and posted this with a few photos I had in my camera roll cause I was venting

YES THIS! accurate af
Right?? It’s so gender. Sorry I should have clarified this isn’t my artwork (just wanted to show what is my preferred look/clothing style) . Credits are in one of the comments above I left. Maybe being amab it’s very hard for us in the sense of being surrounded by toxic masculinity and amab people doing even the slightest femme thing isn’t seen as “normal”. (Although of course all struggles are valid as well with other genders). I always wonder what life would be like if I was AFAB and treated as a cis woman. I think the result would be similar, I would be struggling to feel like a guy and it would suck I’m guessing. I’m glad you (and a few others) could relate to this I genuinely was starting to think I was the only one. It’s nice to hear that we’re in this together and I’m glad this was relatable to you as well.
Yes! It’s so damn annoying, especially cause society is transphobic so it’s hard to accept changes in our gender. I do this thing sometimes where I tell myself to just “pick a side” where I have this internalized transphobia telling me to not be genderfluid. But I know it’s not true, sometimes it gets to me lol. But yes it’s so annoying cause I swear some days I’m like “ooh I’m a guy, I’m feelin pretty manly, and then I pass by and see a purple dress and I’m like “omg that would look so pretty on me I want feel girly now” and then back to masc later 😭😭
Thanks you! The artwork itself isn’t mine though (I put the credits in a comment above). But if you mean style as in dressing style thank you. I really discovered this about myself and I never knew I like dressing like this until recently discovering that I’m not cisgender lol
Thank you as I’m not alone I’m this. Also I LOVE the name gender Oobleck, accurate representation of how it feels to be genderfluid.
Yeah idk why it’s so confusing and it really sucks. It’s a daily struggle tbh. Thanks for listening/commenting ✨
*sobs* thank you that means so much to me . You’re also a wonder person for saying this 😭😭✨💕💕
Hmm never thought of it that way. I always see it like a curse that I can’t stay in a defined gender but it really is something beautiful. I know this deep down but I guess my internalized transphobia gets the best of me sometimes. Thanks ✨
OMG gender flux makes more sense to me! From what I understand in the definition it’s being genderfluid, but even more inconsistent as far as the timing and genders we switch to right? (Correct me if I’m wrong). Also thank you, very kind of you
Yasss I ADORE those colors. It took me a long time to admit to myself that I liked the color purple (cause it’s not a “manly” color. Yeah I know, it’s dumb lol). But yes I want some goth platform boots and a black twirly skirt with black lipstick and Smokey-eye black shadow. Also you would definitely own the goth look fr fr. One day you’ll wear it and be like “damn I feel confident with this look” ✨
Thank you ✨. Well I mean I can’t really dress femme/androgynous cause I’m closeted currently. Only like 2 irl friends know I’m genderfluid at the moment. But I think as time goes on and I live on my own, I’ll definitely start practicing dressing femme/androgynous and butch femme as well. And yeah it really is hard to explain to people cause for a lot of people, even being nonbinary itself is a hard concept so now add genderfluid to the mix and it’s extra complicated lol. I’m glad you’re questioning your gender, because wether or not it turns o you’re genderfluid, it never hurts to look into it (contrary to what my mom taught me which was to NEVER question my gender, unfortunately)
Yay :D me too I love it cause I never actually see any genderfluid people irl lol
I’m a lot better thank you : ) I talk to more nonbinary people and lesbians online now and they help me understand that I shouldn’t keep excusing transphobia. (You’re also valid btw ✨😁)
You are obviously valid
Yea
Yep I thought you got it from Harley too, it's really cool
LOVE that show! Come to think of it, Harley *and* Quinn are badass gender neutral names. 

These days, I feel most like Clayface 🙃
SAME, the ""pick a side"" thing is very true.
But we'll carry on 🙏 fuck society
Just trying to leave each place a little better than before. *You* are a wonder my friend.
anytime, friend! 👍
Nice
Thanks hehe *blushes* *squeeze*
Glad to chat with a few fellow genderfluid people in this comment section. Makes me feel less weird about being myself. Good talk

"im tired of cis men trying to shame me into being comfortable with them being ""straight"""	"i constantly get pursued by men who openly claim they're straight but then privately are actually bisexual, they just refuse to use the label. they come up with a billion excuses for why they're not bi, i've heard anything from ""i only top so it's not gay"" to ""i only like feminine people (of different genders) so im straight"". and when i express how that makes me uncomfortable and feels invalidating and i only want to be with queer people, they tell me i'm ""too obsessed with labels"" and should be willing to overlook it. i don't think it's unreasonable to want to be with queer people when im nonbinary & transitioning. it just sucks because i am very attracted to men but bi men are rarely out or even willing to admit it to themselves and they think i should be okay with that so they don't have to be open about themselves"	"The irony of saying labels aren’t important when they’re clinging so hard to a label that’s clearly inaccurate. IMAX level projection.
Yeah i wouldn’t want to date anyone who identified as straight, it feels invalidating to my gender and they most likely will see me as just a woman. Stick to your boundaries and don’t let anything slide, you deserve to be respected and validated <3
I made a decision to stop dating cishet men after I left my ex. He was mad controlling and didn't let me cut my hair and only complimented me when I was dressed more femme. I'm a transmasc demiboy. I think I must have made him feel emasculated or something cuz none of my cishet male friends act like that even when we're joking about dick size
This is a real world example of bi/pan erasure, as well as phobia of it.  It's frustrating for a lot of reasons.  I'm sorry you've been having to deal with this.  You're valid, your feelings are valid, and your preferences are valid.  If someone won't respect you, especially when you say it makes you uncomfortable, they aren't worth further effort.
 Cishet men feel entitled to people they view as women or have 'parts they like'. Many cis people believe that their preferences, attractions and perceptions of our gender matters more than our own comfort. Our own dysphoria matters less than their needs to maintain their cisheteronormativity. You don't owe a cishet man your body or time
As A Bi Person, That Internalised Biphobia They Got Hurts Me To Hear About. I'd Say Just Send Them To A Therapist, All Of Them. They Could Definitely Use It.
That sucks, but if they're not ready to acknowledge their Queen attraction, that's their problem not yours. Honestly, just date other people.
I'll defend their right to not come out and just call themselves straight, but they 100% should be leaving you alone when you say you expect the people you date to be openly attracted to men. Sorry you are experiencing this :(
Ah, the classic ""man being insecure about his sexuality because of societal homophobia"". I totally understand your frustration and those people aren't worth your time. They clearly have their own demons to deal with, don't let their personal problems become yours. If you don't wanna date man who calls himself straight (regardless of what he actually is), be clear and firm about that and the fact that there is no convincing or persuading you. You be with who's right for you, those guys aren't ready to date and aren't right for you and you gotta make that clear so that they leave it at that.

Really, just tell them ""bro, figure you gotta figure your shit out before dating anyone"" because that's genuinely good advice. 

People who already know themselves and are confident in who they are don't wanna waste time with someone who is still incredibly insecure about such a thing, it doesn't result in a healthy relationship.
Yeah i mean. Personally idc if they say theyre straight. All that means is i wont be dating them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Man or woman honestly. If theyre straight i wouldnt be comfortable. Not bc of an obsession with labels but bc of what that implies abt their perception of me. It aint complicated. Id as you wish but you cant get pissy when that makes certain ppl off limits to you.
People get to define their sexuality on their own terms. That includes straight men (even straight men whose heterosexuality looks a lot like bisexuality).


You don't have to date straight men, it's perfectly fine to draw that line in the sand - that you're only comfortable dating men who are openly bisexual. And then walk away.
This!!! I’ve had this happen so much too, I identify as non-binary (afab) and visually I’m androgynous/masculine seeming enough that I attract closeted bi men. It’s a very weird power dynamic, it got unsafe w one cis man and his homophobia sigh
Seems more like they are the ones “obsessed” with labels…

Labels are just words. Words have definitions, they mean something — labels are words to define something. Saying I’m pansexual doesn’t change who I am, it’s just a succinct way of saying that I am capable of attraction to any gender and/or sex. 

It’s understandable that there maybe reasons why someone isn’t comfortable actively declaring the words that accurately describe who they are but at some point your phobia (fear of the consequences of sharing that information about yourself) can become phobic.

Reality is that cishet men have privilege that other groups don’t have. They are afraid of loosing that privilege. Don’t waste your time with people who are uncomfortable with themselves and doing mental gymnastics.
When did defining other people's sexuality for them become okay?

It's one thing to be uncomfortable about being with someone who identifies as straight. It's another to try and define their sexuality for them. 

You don't have to ""overlook"" their sexuality as they suggest, but you don't have to come here and define it for them either. Just tell them you don't date straight guys and move on.
If you allow a cishet man to top you and he has toxic masculinity he will 100% consider you to be ""below"" him.
I'm so sorry you have to deal with this bullshit. This is not on you, this is not you doing anything wrong, this is cis het men being self-centered dipshits.

I have some advice on where to find people to date based on what you said, if you want it. I try not to give unsolicited advice.
Wow, I really disagree with a lot of the responses on here. 

Sexual behavior and sexual orientation are very different things. If a man tells you he is straight, that's what he is, even if he is also attracted to men, trans, or non binary people. You don't get to decide for someone else that they are ""queer."" It just doesn't work like that. 

That said, you also are under no obligation to date straight men. Cut these fish loose homie! It's not worth it to date someone who identifies in a way that makes you feel like your gender isn't valid. Bisexual and queer men exist, and even though the dating pool is smaller, I get the sense you will be happier swimming there than in the sea of cishet men.
I mean I personally wouldn’t mind dating someone who was straight who also acknowledged my gender (same for gay or lesbian honestly), but I can completely understand how it would be invalidating for some people.
I’m speaking as a non-binary bi person; it sounds kind of like you’re upset about someone claiming their sexual identity if it’s not what you expect it to be? I’ve spent my whole life being told by other people that I was wrong about my sexual identity and I kind of can’t imagine doing the same
thing to anyone else. If someone says they’re straight, in my book they’re straight. Totally not my place to make them fit in my box.
Such fragile masculinity. Yeah most people don't realize that sexuality is a spectrum and a lot of people deviate from the extremes. It's not fair of them to put you in whatever category they see fit just because they're not big enough of a man to admit that they like different genders. And yeah that sounds incredibly invalidating. It's unfortunate because there are a lot of NB's who only like men and men aren't willing to admit that they're bi which can leave a lot of people hanging. Like why make yourself unhappy for some stupid made up reason? This is why it's really hard for NB people to find people to date. It can take a long time and even if we find people who are bi there's still a chance they won't be into us. Just be patient. It can take  time but I'm sure eventually you'll find someone who ***appreciates and values you for who*** ***you are!***
if you plan to transition medically a positive is most of the “straight” guys will stop pursuing you and you won’t have to worry about it anymore. at least that was the case for me, but straight guys never pursued me too much pre t because i was perceived as butch anyways
exactly!!
my thoughts exactly. i've only ever once talked to a cishet woman sorta romantically, and it was a constant ""yeah but you're still amab"" or ""yeah but you sill look like a man"" so i immediately left.
thank you 💗
God he sounds awful. Your body your choice and he can fuck right off. I know now looking back at my previous relationship with a cishet man, (he knew I was NB I made this painstakingly clear) he was full of BS. He would rarely text me or make time for me and made a lot of back handed comments on minorities. He said he was a moderate but I got a feeling he leans conservative. I usually make a point to always date liberals but I though moderates couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. Don't date conservatives/moderates they hate minorities. But whenever he said something I didn't agree with I was always dismissive of it and tried to look past it to keep the relationship going. He even mentioned that he supports the ""all lives matter"" concept which fucking sucked. In retrospect I really shouldn't have excused these comments and should have just broke things off right then and there. I will never make up dumb excuses like that again and I will never date moderates again.
thank you! yeah it's incredibly frustrating
very true, im also very open about getting bottom surgery in a few weeks and i keep getting cishet men saying ""let me fuck you before you transition"" it's awful
i agree! just wish they wouldn't try to make it my problem too :(
I know that’s a typo but I absolutely love “queen attraction” because all non binary people are monarchs.
totally agree, just wish they'd stop harassing me when i say no
yeah that's their choice, i just want them to respect mine
Exactly. If you don't see me for who I am then you're not worth my time. You should always be comfortable being your true authentic self in relationships without fear of judgment/reservations from your significant other!
This right here is the right response!
Yep, this right here
I think that rhetoric is really misused in this context. These men aren't defining themselves with a healthy and genuine understanding of their sexuality, they are struggling with internalized homophobia and biphobia. And it severely negatively affects their relationships with others, including the way they try to disrespect trans and nonbinary people in their desperate attempts to be near queerness but deny any connection to queerness. It's a very specific experience and dismissing it like that isn't helpful for anyone.
thank you! a lot of folks seem to be unfamiliar with the rampant issue of closeted bi men who seek out trans men and nonbinary people and are really disrespectful about it. glad some people don't experience it but it's very much an issue!
yes thank you for pointing that out! it really is about trying to maintain privilege
i do tell them that and try to move on. i am harassed and guilt tripped by them because they literally tell me that i should be comfortable with them because they secretly fuck men
I'm pretty sure that if someone dates an NB that makes them bi. Men who date NB's are not straight by default because being straight implies men dating *Females* and not NBs'. If they are as straight as they claim to be then they shouldn't be attracted to you.
sure, im happy to hear some advice
denying the very real issue that internalized biphobia is super common among men and prevents them from being open about their sexual attractions and the relationships they want to pursue is just naive and harmful. and telling people they can be attracted to multiple genders, sexually and romantically pursue multiple genders and still be straight is incredibly biphobic and contributes to bi-erasure
I think you're interpreting it wrong. OP said they're frustrated with men pursuing them who are straight, or say they're straight except in private (so closeted). They want to be in a relationship with other openly queer identified people, not straight people or queer people in the closet. From what the post says, it sounds like these men are pressuring OP into dating them regardless of OP's preferences. That's why they're frustrated. Because these men are trying to guilt them into a relationship. If you read the other comments, this is a common problem because many of us have this preference. It really isn't about trying to label other people.
eh maybe, but im on T and have had top surgery and a lot of them know i'm getting bottom surgery in a few weeks and they STILL bother me. im pretty androgynous
Mine knew I was enby but I'd not had chance to explore what that meant for me before he got his claws in. He said he was bi and then decided he wasn't while we were together. I lived with him and he was emotionally and financially abusive, he would compare trauma and make me feel guilty when my depression was bad. I have severe anxiety and depression due to similar treatment by my mother (I've posted on RBN lots) on top of being autistic. He said my sister and I were codependent because, instead of staying in an argument going in circles, I'd go to my sister's to calm down.

I'm not playing those games again.
Yup they don't care. I had vagina preserving phallo and cishet men still try to sleep with me and ignore my dick or go after my chest(no top surgery yet). They just don't see us as people but just as body parts to fetishize.

I don't think these men are queer. They are just cishet fetishists who don't respect other people's gender
It’s not your problem and you’re fully in the right if you only want to date queer people, I’m bi NB AMAB and if some guy wanted to date me without acknowledging the queer nature of our relationship I wouldn’t want anything to do with them.
Ahahaha I didn't even notice my autocorrect did that. I'm definitely leaving it.
Or like the band Queen we all know isn't straight lol. And ""drag queen"" for gay men.
Who are you to say that someone's sexuality is anything other than how they describe it, themselves? 

A man is attracted to a trans woman: does that make him bi?

A man's partner identifies as nonbinary: is he now magically bisexual because he's still attracted to them? 

The nexus of homophobia, transphobia, and toxic masculinity makes it particularly challenging to date cis men, and that's a valid criticism. Criticize that.  

But that doesn't give us *any* leeway to make assumptions on their sexuality, nor in the way they see gender. 

To anyone seeing this: don't date people who don't respect you.
I mean… if a lesbian can date non-binary people and be a lesbian, and a gay man can date non-binary people and be a gay man, then logically speaking a straight person can date non-binary people and be straight. 

That’s not to say you have to date them, by all means don’t date those who don’t view you as your gender. Just that they’re definition of their sexuality is valid as well. And it’s really not your place to say they’re wrong when non-binary genders are already outside the binary labels people often use.
As a NB bi person, the only thing that makes me bi is that I identify as bi. No one else gets to label my sexuality.
There are lesbians who date lesbian non-binary people though. As well as gay men who date gay non-binary people. They’re not bi.
You might really like the drag scene, if where you are has one?   


There's a lot of genderfuckery, a fair number of bi guys, and a shit load of different enbies.
This is actually far more homophobic to say than anything said here. You are spreading toxic hate, you don't get to decide other's sexualities. Reported for harassment and blocked.
yes exactly! this is what i'm saying.
I disagree with your assessment, but I appreciate your kind response
Holly shit. I'm sorry you had to deal with all of that. I'm glad you left him. He sounds like a total asshole.
Some of them definitely seem queer when they tell me they regularly fuck fem men lol. but yeah some of them are just fetishizing us for sure
Perfect!
Your examples literally have nothing to do with the situation im talking about. I have had extensive conversations with these types of men who are literally secretly having queer sex with men! or want to and are too scared to do it so they try to use me as a ""safer"" alternative. im not making any damn assumptions beyond what they say themselves. you're really naive for acting like this doesn't happen
that's not the situation im talking about but y'all keep ignoring what im saying. this isn't about straight men who are just interested in some nonbinary people. as i have said several times, these men im talking about are also having sex with other men, plus i am ftm transsexual as well as nonbinary and am very open about both aspects. im being really specific here and people keep acting like im talking about completely different scenarios
im actually already part of a drag house! just recently was invited to join and have been getting more involved in my local drag scene
they're right, that's exactly what i said.
That's an insult to assholes. They have a use and can be fun 😂
No no, I'm aware that it happens. 

I'm also aware that sometimes, some straight men have sex with men (and that they're not gay or bi for doing so).
I don’t think we’re acting like you’re talking about something else, it seems more like a misunderstanding of what exactly you meant.
OMG that's so awesome! two of my enby partners do drag, and I've been thinking about getting into it myself because I definitely love makeup.
straight men may experiment a little but if they reguarly pursue sexual and romantic relationships with men, that is not straight and you're biphobic and homophobic as hell for trying to convince anyone of that
it's neither biphobic nor homophobic to take someone's description of their own sexuality at face-value. 

Where's the line between ""hetero exploration"" and ""confirmed bisexual""? Who are you to decide it?

What you're suggesting is abuse (ironically, an abuse that has mostly been waged against queer people). 

Sexual behaviour is *not* equivalent to sexual identity. If it was, we wouldn't recognize the bisexuality of people in (monogamous) hetero relationships.

Queer identities aren't some kind of evidence-based label assignment, they're opt-in *self*-identification. I'm a firm believer that no-one gets to be the ID police, and heteros are included in that.
lol whatever, if you really think it's abuse to talk about how internalized biphobia and homophobia affects people and prevents them from accepting themselves, then you're lost and that's not my problem"	yqc1nc	NonBinary	189	0.97	2022-11-09 07:45:11
I’m really sick of binary people telling me to stop talking about my gender.	"You literally grew up seeing others of your gender everywhere. If you’re cis, you literally grew up feeling comfortable in your own body. You don’t know what it’s like to feel uncomfortable for so long, especially since finding other non-binary people can be really really difficult. 

Please shut the fuck up and when I find other people who I can relate to, don’t fucking shame me for getting excited. 

Fucking Christ."	"It's the same way as a mostly binary trans guy. I'm not going to stop talking about being trans because it greatly effects my life and the positive stuff is so vital for my wellbeing and that of those around me who might be closeted.
Me too. My family always says I need to stop discussing trans and non-binary issues because it ""alienates allies"" and ""pushes people away."" I no longer speak to family who think like this.
God I feel this so much because  being a binary trans person is a rather similar experience to this.   People literally want you to shut up about your gender because they don't feel comfortable,  think you're deluded,  or worse.   Finding people who actually understand is fucking difficult especially in more conservative areas such as the Southern US.  Even people who accept you don't get what it means to be trans or NB,  and they sure as fuck don't get gender dysphoria.  So it's also incredibly lonely.
One of the most hurtful things my brother ever did was thank me for “not making a big deal out of this stuff” at a particular function where every single person misgendered me, but I was too sad to say anything.
I feel dat like y'all are the only other nbs I currently know n I've only met two in the past
High five I feel you so hard
I respect the idea that you want to express who you are but like... If someone doesn't wanna hear you talk about it, fuck em. You shouldn't shame them for feeling comfortable with who they are cos in the end theres no rule that says that they have to be interested in what you are saying, and if they don't... Fuck em! Just talk to someone who feels comfortable about u talking about it. Im sure it's not that hard...


^he ^says ^to ^a ^Reddit ^user


Edit: This is my opinion, I've explained why and respect others who don't share this view, have to fucking say that cos apparently Reddit isn't a place where those with radically contrasting views can converse without consequence coming in the form of hundreds of downvotes who don't understand that.
Stfu about your gender, nobody asked.
THANK YOU! You worded it so well.
You’re strong. I respect that.
That is so true. It being so hard to find other people who can relate, when people tell me to stop talking about it I get very mad. I want to say “You have no idea what it’s like to live in the shoes of a trans person. You have no right to tell me to stop making myself feel better in a healthy way.”
Oh my gosh, that must have been horrible. I’m really sorry that happened :(
That surprises me, I’ve already met 2 other nbs just at my middle school
🙌
Decent point. I respect your opinion, my guy
People just get uncomfortable with things they can't relate to, unfortunately. Part of the human brain says that if someone challenges the status quo they challenge the ""pack"" survival but this isn't the ice ages anymore and growth and acceptance is possible.
Thank you. I've also been told that I'm too ""obsessed"" with trans issues. Trans people are dying literally every day, whether it be from murder or suicide. Damn right I'm obsessed.
Im 30, we didn't have those labels we just were confused
Absolutely.

I originally came out as nonbinary, and then as a binary trans guy. But honestly I felt a lot of pressure and shame to be called binary because I wanted so much of the physical transition and I’m okay with being referred to as a guy. Now, I’m more comfortable with exploring my gender again!		"I feel like I shouldn’t stress as much on labels, but I’m thinking I’m definitely genderfluid, fluctuating between nonbinary and transmasc? God, just thinking of myself as not a binary guy makes me feel so much better.
Oh hey I know you! We're Twitter mutuals! Nonbinary transmascs unite. 🙌
Tbh like even though I try not to label myself, even identifying as FTM felt so boxing to me. I felt I could never be femme. As an enby, I present as both/neither. I kind of just do right day by day.
We change and grow and there are dif words to describe who we are. Gender is fluid and you can identify as how ever you please! I have to remind myself of this always
Honestly I’m going through this too. Up until just recently I called myself “transmasculine nb” but after some soul searching decided that “agender” was the right word for me. And before that I was genderfluid, and before that I was bigender. Our truths are always changing with time.
That is emotional stability goals. Wish me luck with the ""I must be mostly boy before I can be NB"" phase!!!
You look great! Glad to hear you’re finding what works for you 😄

I think we're very similar, mate :D. At first I thought I was a binary transguy (tbf I hadn't even heard of nonbinary at this point), and now I know I'm nonbinary! I'm bigender and go between nonbinary/agender and male. I also want to physically transition, but I'm still nonbinary. Transitioning doesn't make anyone more or less trans.

I just wanted to tell the internet that I’m coming out to my straight friends now (which is huge for me). Last time I posted I got yelled at for posting a selfie wrong. Hopefully I don’t get shamed this time.		"How tf is it possible to “post a selfie wrong”? Wtf? You’re killing it though! Hope everything goes well.
Congratulations! I hope that everything goes smoothly, you got this 💪🏼
Good luck, you've got this! I hope it goes well.

 Also, what the heck is up with people, that they have nothing better to do than complain about How someone posts a picture? You are awesome for sharing and for coming out. That's the important part.  👍
I don't think being told you are posting in the wrong subreddit qualifies as being shamed. Nevertheless, good luck with coming out.
Congratulations!! That’s a huge and awesome step!! I also just wanted to commiserate, I posted a picture once in another lgbt sub of my fiancé and I when we got engaged, it was the first time I had posted anything and I get really anxious about being visible in queer spaces just have always felt like I wasn’t really accepted in the club for whatever made up in my mind social anxiety reason. So it took a lot for me to finally post something and I was so excited, only to be met with the mods coming at me because I apparently did it on the wrong day or without a tag or some bullshit, they said they’d “allow it” and congratulated me,  but I went into a shame spiral and deleted it crying and have never posted there again. I felt humiliated, which is obviously an overreaction in reality but it’s just such a tender subject.
Thanks so much for the comment. That’s exactly it! The other post was like the first one I’d ever posted to Reddit at all, and the first post I’d ever made about being trans. Even though the comment that I got back wasn’t that rude the whole experience was really disheartening. I get that I did it wrong but maybe there’s a nicer way to police people on here? It took a lot for me to post that and I was pretty crushed by the harsh reaction. Not exactly the safe space welcome I anticipated. 

I still feel hesitant to post things on Reddit in general now cause I’m worried about getting shit for doing it wrong, so that’s cool."	k90zf9	NonBinary	148	0.97	2020-12-08 09:03:52

Last summer, my now ex-wife tried to shame me out of being who I am, despite claiming to be an ally. 2 nights ago, my current partner asked to do my makeup for me for my first time ever, and they were able to make me see someone in the mirror that made sense to me. Good morning 🖤	I can’t wait to let them do this again when we have more supplies. They completely understand me when I say that I’ve never felt like myself until the moment I looked in the mirror when we were done. I’m still trying to understand truly what my identity is, though presently I identify as gender fluid/non-binary. Sorry to gush, but it’s just been a very…positive feeling week for me, and it really all traces back to this. 🖤	"Yay
So happy you have this support now. You deserve it 💜
I’m so happy you got away from her. You look amazing 💛💛💛
Fly free butterfly. Free.
aWW! I'm glad you're happier than ever, you deserve it :)

I'm cis f and I have a nb partner and I did the same for them it was so sweet to see their face light up when i showed them their finished makeup look! we sometimes paint our nails to match too x)

I hope u both have more sweet experiences like this in ur future <3
Wow! There's so much emotion going on in your eyes 😭 it looks like you feel so RIGHT, it's like you're seeing yourself for the first time. But at the same time you seem to be grieving a little bit that past you wasn't able to feel like that 🥺 

Not only have you gotten yourself out of an abusive situation (very difficult to do, congrats) but you've also found support as you learn to experience existence as the person you now understand yourself to be. 🥰 I think it will be a fun journey to discover more of who you really are and what you like :)

Also just my two cents but you seriously resemble Jennifer Aniston in that first pic for some reason
Thank you, star stranger 🥺 admittedly, I always look a lil emo 🥺 but I did feel like I saw myself for the first time. I stared in the mirror for so long, and I just felt whole, which has been a very rare feeling for me in life. My marriage ended in a nightmare, and it’s one I still have sometimes at night. My ex wife claimed to love me exactly as I am, then used my identity to get her family members to attack and shame me after she decided to have an affair and ask for a divorce. I still feel their words like knives, even though I couldn’t care less about them. My current partner is the most loving and supportive person I could have asked the universe to let me meet, and has always reassured me that they love me for me, not my identity. They assure me daily that no matter who I may turn out to be, it will not change the love they feel for the person they continue to choose 🥺. I hope you have a beautiful weekend 🖤
That's one of the loveliest things I've been called, thank you ☺️🥰
Having people turn on you like that really rocks your whole world. I'm so happy that you've found some stability 💕💕"	12dnvhc	NonBinary	132	0.99	2023-04-06 15:32:06
"I'm tired of being judged by binary trans people for not wanting to look how I'm ""supposed to."""	"Whenever I post about my identity and transition goals, I always get shamed for wanting to look like a ""hairless anime boy"" or some similar description.

I feel like nonbinary people are always expected to have the same ideals as binary people and are treated as crazy and immature when they dare dislike an effect of HRT (like facial hair and acne with testosterone for example).

It's like I'm stuck between two decisions, either I stay like this forever and hate my body forever or I transition, take a little testosterone until I get a little too masculine for my liking.

I'm tired of being treated like I'm crazy for wanting something in between, for not being in love with every single effect of HRT.

Is it possible to achieve this ideal?"	"[deleted]
You can achieve any medically feasible transition you want.  Top surgery without T?  That's fine.  People will hate, but that's their problem.  If you have questions about what's medically feasible, I can try to answer.
i know this is an old post but oh my god thank you for posting it. i have a lot of binary trans friends and i always felt like no one understood this feeling. i want to be a pretty boy, i take no joy in the nastiness of life. i hate being stinky, dirty, or grimey. i want to be beautiful, and masculinity can have beauty.
Transphobia from trans people really sucks :/ Sorry you went through that. I’m  a binary trans woman and support however any person desires to transition. Personally, I’m going for fat redistribution, no breasts, and maintaining bottom function. You do you!!
Look into DHT blockers, like finasteride
i think some ppl have made good points about trying to have transition goals realistic for all human bodies and being aware of how unrealistic (fatphobic, eurocentric, misogynistic, or even transphobic etc) beauty standards might make trans ppl even harder on themselves. that those things can just end up making us feel unfulfilled forever bc we can’t attain them, or worse, make us police each other’s gender presentation in harmful ways. like saying transmasc ppl have to look dorito shaped and chiseled or transfem ppl have to be thin and hairless for each of them to be attractive, which is totally false.

BUT that’s totally different from having gender aspirations or transition goals that DEFY binary beauty standards and expectations. that should be completely up to each individual trans person to decide for themselves, and is frankly a radical and liberating freedom of expression to desire for ourselves and anyone else who wants it. 

i personally think some binary trans ppl with a lot of internalized transphobia baggage project those feelings onto nonbinary or gender fluid trans ppl’s transition goals. like they think someone saying that they don’t want facial hair on themselves is the same as them saying “facial hair on a trans person is gross”. which it’s not. like i personally love all the effects of T except facial hair, so i remove it/ lowered my dose/ am considering dht blockers. i have nothing against any other trans ppl who want facial hair or are ambivalent abt it. i’m not digusted by it, it feels wrong on me and i just don’t want it. end of story, no problem lol!

as long as you aren’t going around making other trans ppl feel shitty for their bodies then you should get to do what you like with yours. isn’t that the whole point of all this?
You could try lazer hair removal? Only risk is that if the hair is too blonde it wont get fried
I’m choosing not to do T and trying to love my bod as it is, while being true to myself with regards to my expression and my relationships.  I DON’T WANT HAIR.  It’s a deal-breaker for me.  I like the prettiness that estrogen tends to give, even if I identify as male.  I have a seriously womanly body, which is frustrating for me, but, for myself, I’m just kind of leaning into it.  I have a partner who sees me as I am, knows me for who I am, so that helps.  I am presently trying to find a look that is pretty, while carrying a masculine energy.  I haven’t gotten far lol

Good luck to you.  The frustration is real
The people who I spoke to in the past acted like I was crazy for not loving acne and oily skin. So I'd say there definitely seems to be.
I'm interested in top surgery definitely and maybe bottom surgery too. I'm cool with deeper voice and all that, just not facial hair.

Everyone says that I'll just look like my dad if I go on t, but I hate that so much.
Loool, I mean..... whenever you can take to take a step back and see the stupidity these people are talking about. I think some people with a bunch of issues try sooooooo hard, to the point of saying they love the awful things that come with X practice because *gender*.

When they go low, we go high :)

I send you a gigantic hug and recommend you to stop wasting your time listening to toxic people. Something I love about this community (I hope you haven't found toxic ones here, if so, I'm very sorry and you should report them) is that it has helped me accept that I do not need to look like any predefined image or stereotype of my identity. I have felt very accepted.

So I will close by telling you that I definitely think you should go for an appearance that makes *you* feel the most at ease and that you do not need the approval of those idiots.

Best wishes!
I think you only need to be on T a year to be eligible for bottom surgery (and obviously you can get top without being on T at all).  You can always get laser hair removal or try finasteride to reduce changes to hair follicles while on T.  I do know people who've grown a stache in under a year on T, so it depends on genetics, but there's stuff you can do to prevent that.
Couldn't facial hair just be dealt with via laser hair removal?
Thank you so much!! I'll look into that.
That's what I was saying but they came up with a bunch of excuses for why I'm wrong. Plus no one I know on t has ever grown facial hair despite being on it for years anyway? Like I get genetics and stuff but they act like I'm gonna grow a beard overnight.

Are ""they"" medical professionals in that field or just people with anecdotal evidence? 😅
Yes but that can be predetermined. It's mainly a function of skin colour, hair colour, and going to a place that knows what they're doing.

Edit: but again, one should ask a medical or cosmetical professional about this
Definitely not. Just your average redditor who thinks they know everything, I guess.
Then I'm rather confident that it'd be safe to ignore their opinions on it. If in doubt, talk to a medical professional. 
I'm not a medical professional, but I'll just say I believe they're wrong. I believe t might(!) be able to ""activate"" existing hair follicles in the face but if you then go have them destroyed with a laser, they're gone. That's how permanent hair removal works AFAIK 😂😂😂 and that's not even to say that more facial hair absolutely has to be a consequence either. There's lots of amab who grow very little facial hair even when they're otherwise healthy cis men, for example. 
I wouldn't stress too much about it."	z166ko	NonBinary	98	0.95	2022-11-21 18:28:40
Tired of body shaming in queer spaces.	"Sorry, quick rant incoming. Fat enby here. I was recently in an online group where folks often share transphobic bs they encounter for the purposes of shaming/dragging the transphobes in good fun. All good so far. Problem is that lately it's devolved into body shaming, especially when people decide the transphobe shithead in question fits the fat incel stereotype. Anyone who's pointed out the harm caused by shaming the person's appearance is not taken seriously.

To be clear, I'm not defending the transphobes. Just tired of how those kinds of comments degrade, devalue, and dehumanize all fat people, including fat queer people (we exist!).

Sadly, not my only bad experience as a fat person in queer or ""woke"" spaces, and won't be my last. Just needed to vent, thanks for reading.

Just as I won't apologize if my gender confuses, upsets, or inconveniences someone, same goes for the size of my body."	"Wow I so feel you right now, if you ever wanna talk about fatphobia in queer spaces hit me uuup!
I feel this so hard. Like why sink to their level?!
The fact that you can own your body image as it is is amazing, frankly. My weight is one of my biggest causes of dysphoria, which is probably why finally starting to lose weight has dragged me out of my egg. It's hard out there for all of us, and that's why I mainly seek positive spaces myself, built around ideas of building each other up instead of tearing others down.
It always angers me that such an abused group of people can sometimes be just as abusive as the outside world. Gatekeeping and body-shaming do NOT belong in the community!

Even though I'm thin, I've always had so much appreciation for people with bodies not like mine (or perhaps that's why I like them so much, as I've got my own body issues). So it makes me so angry that people can't just appreciate the beauty in others. Maybe I'm just different than ""most"" people, but I genuinely see people for their inner beauty (not to mention, you can still be fat and attractive, like come on people). You never know what someone is dealing with, and I generally think it's never ok to comment on someone's weight unless you know it makes them happy (like if you KNOW they've been working out for the purpose of weight loss/muscle gain).

I know fat people who are outright gorgeous, I know chubby people who wear crop tops and are looked at as fashion goddesses, and I think the best thing any person can wear is a genuine smile.
I rlly agree, the queer communauty shouldn't recreate society's oppressive dynamics within our own spaces. It's just sad to see :/"	d10c8x	NonBinary	95	0.97	2019-09-07 19:20:39
I have no gender, so why the fuck do I care about gendered beauty standards?	"I’m sharing this hoping to get some perspective and possibly reassurance that I’m not alone in this. 

I’m agender, and solely experience social dysphoria. I have no physical dysphoria and present for all intents and purposes as my AGAB. 

For me, I feel like there’s a disconnect between my gender and my body. I don’t see my body as having a gender, and so I don’t get dysphoric by my boobs or other feminine attributes. If I had no boobs and a masculine body, I would be equally okay with that, but my whole attitude is kind of like “I’ll work with what I’ve got”, if that makes sense.

Whenever I see gender non-conforming people, I think they look really good, but for some reason my brain insists on being gender conforming myself in that I follow female beauty standards despite not being a woman.

I just feel like I’m betraying myself in a way? Like it genuinely infuriates me that I insist on removing my body hair and I know if I was AMAB I would be fine with it, and I see other AFAB enbies rocking it and looking great but I can’t stop myself from caving and giving in? I don’t know if it’s just that I was shamed for it so much growing up and just internalized that, but it really frustrates me that despite not being a woman I still feel beholden to this shit, as if it’s supposed to mean anything to me."	"Correct me if im wrong but i would assume these gendered beauty standards have been marketed to you your whole life from family/friends as well as companies. 

That has an impact regardless of your internal sense of gender.
I'm kinda going through the same thing. I don't know if I look down on myself for wanting to look more feminine or girly or whatever, but I don't really like the way that I'm treated when I dress or present more masculine. I'd rather be called pretty or beautiful, but sometimes I feel like it undermines my genderfluidity. Idk, gender is a slippery thing (mostly because it's made up and extremely subjective) and try to be a little kinder to yourself. You've been socialized as a woman, and it takes a long time to deconstruct all that. So whether the reason is because you like how you're treated when you present a certain way, or because you feel like you can't help but want to present a certain way, doesn't make you any more or less agender! Maybe deep down you actually like presenting more feminine but the guilt comes from maybe some rigidity regarding your gender identity. Try to find some fun in it for now and stay open to other ways of presenting!
I can definitely relate to this. I’m an amab enby and I like my hair short. Idk if it’s because of gendered beauty standards or just because I’m impatient in letting my hair grow out or a little bit of both. I’ve realized after I tried to grow out my hair a bit during quarantine then cut it all off to go for a new look, it literally doesn’t matter how I look, I’m still a valid enby and people will just have to learn that not all enbys look androgynous. Of course I’m planning on looking a little more androgynous once I move out of my parents’ place, but we all have our own preferences on how we want to look. And no, just because you might present a certain way does not mean your “asking to get misgendered”. You do you and people will hopefully adjust their views on your gender identity
Yo - my leg hair is like black - three hairs in each follicle. My mom said I was born with a coat of black fur. I was SO self conscious about this. I got my legs tattooed, even my knees, and gained a lot of confidence from them. Still, the first time I went to the pool with my leg hair fully rockin I was mortified, and people stared. I went home. But that was almost six years ago now. And I couldn’t give a fuck and would actually say something goofy to somebody who was staring - or assumed it was my tattoos. 
It takes time to get used to for sure - but I believe that if you let your body hair roll you might get used to it and it might be really affirming. It was for me!!
Could be societal pressure or expectations. We have it embedded in our DNA to not really go against society due to survival purposes.
I felt really similar at one point… it can take a long time and some practicing feeling comfy/safe presenting in a way that other people are uncomfortable with especially in public or in front of judgmental family. Misogyny is a thing and affects lots of ppl, and nearly all trans people including ppl who aren’t women. Oftentimes following gendered expectations especially around femininity is a coping mechanism to avoid potentially unsafe or uncomfortable reactions from others (or even ourselves if we haven’t unpacked them). Other times it might just be the case that what feels right to you also aligns with society’s expectations.

It might help to figure out what actions, environments, or situations compel you to follow other people’s gendered expectations. 
Some guiding questions might help, ie would not shaving body hair make you uncomfortable if you’re the only one who sees it, or if ppl in public/specific people perceive you having body hair? would dressing a certain way be uncomfortable bc of how you see yourself or bc of how others treat you? would you possibly be unsafe or face threats/ harassment for presenting a certain way in some places vs in others? does it cause anxiety to think about how others might see you if you tried to present the way you see other trans people do?

For example, I had family who made comments about my body growing up that led me to feel rly embarrassed when my body didn’t look the way they clearly wanted it to. They’d even get mean about it sometimes and it made me rly anxious. It took me a while to unpack where those feelings came from and how they were projecting their own issues into me, and to recognize how fucked up those expectations were. Even though I’ve always been pretty ambivalent abt my body when I’m alone, I had to figure out what expectations I actually genuinely believed in as opposed to theirs. It sounds like you’ve kind of done that already. 

Even after that though, it took me years of trying new styles of dress or not shaving etc. in specific setting where I felt more comfortable (like around my queer friends). I’d test out being in public while making little changes to how I presented to see if ppl would really react unkindly or harass me for things or if it was more my own anxiety. During all that I’d also check in with myself to see if the way I was presenting or being read felt more right or joy inducing than before. 
This can help you figure out what things might be worth the discomfort/reaction of others and what things might not be. 

In the end that’s totally up to you, and your feelings and identity are 100% valid no matter how you present. You don’t have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable to prove your gender, but it can really really help to figure out what’s truly you and what’s other people making decisions about your gender for you. As long as you’re not enforcing gendered expectations on anyone else, you can do whatever you like!

I gradually figured out how and where I could dress/present/act certain ways while still feeling safe and eventually just became much more comfortable not shaving/not wearing a bra/wearing certain clothes in almost every setting including around family who would give me shit for it. By that time though, I knew who I was and what felt right for me so I was better able to stand up for myself and ask for the respect I needed from ppl who supposedly loved me. It actually worked out well and now I can be myself around family without worrying too much, which I never expected! And I make a point of only keeping friends that I feel comfortable being my whole self around. 

All this isn’t to say that I don’t ever get shit for presenting the way I do, or that those creeping anxieties don’t sneak up especially in situations that trigger dysphoria and insecurity the most. But I definitely feel way better about just presenting however I want without feeling ashamed of myself, and like I have the freedom to play and experiment and discover truths about myself while connecting to my trans siblings over it all. It’s a breath of fresh air like no other when you feel free like that. And that’s worth it to me.
Bby we’ve been brainwashed since we were itty bitty and it’s gonna take years to unlearn being swayed by gendered beauty standards. Take it easy, be nice to yourself and enjoy the journey because you’re trying to find who you truly are without all the bullshit we’ve been fed since childhood and that’s exciting!
Well I’m a feminine presenting amab and I also hold myself to female beauty standards. I shave most of my body hair, wear makeup, have long hair etc. It’s even more infuriating for me because I know I’ll never fit those standards since I don’t naturally have a feminine body.
Lol. I hold myself to the beauty standards of men and women ):
I experience something very similar as a transfem, with my facial hair. I know that body hair doesn’t define gender, but it’s so hard to not internalize the societal messaging, and I can’t imagine how that feels for someone who has been conditioned as feminine. 

I believe the truth and the reality of being non-binary is so powerful in that, it encourages and inherently means accepting yourself in a radical and powerful way. You are not alone, and you have your whole life to grow into who you are, and I wish you peace and comfort in that exploration. 

Carry your lantern, and light your way.

Yeah, they’re definitely something that was pushed on me my whole life so it makes sense it’s had an effect. I just sometimes feel like I shouldn’t feel this way because I see other AFAB enbies who seem to have no problem with letting go of them. But comparing is probably useless anyway, since everyone is different.
Thank you, I really appreciate it 💛 It’s funny because I see other enbies in the same situation and I’m like “no shit you’re valid!” but then when it comes to myself I’m like, nope, I deserve nothing.
I feel you, I’m Middle Eastern so I’ve got all the genetics for the thick, dark body hair, which definitely plays a role in the whole self-consciousness thing. I’m really glad you’ve gotten to a place where you no longer feel like you have to hide it, and I hope I can too :)
Yeah, that’s definitely a huge element of it (if not it in its entirety). I’m a huge people pleaser and that’s something I’ve managed to unlearn in other areas of my life, but I think when it comes to my non-cishetness I still feel fear and the need to conform.
Thank you so much for your response, it really gives me a lot to think about! I think I definitely do need to think more about how I would present myself if I were in a vacuum, and what *I* actually want, because I definitely have internalized a lot of discomfort based on how I think other people perceive me. 

I’m lucky to have a really supportive partner and a safe space to experiment in, I just feel like I have to overcome a mental block to open myself more to those possibilities, maybe because I’ve been locked in a certain way of thinking/seeing myself for so long.
Thanks for the input. I feel like part of my frustration comes from the fact that I feel less valid for being this way. Like I’m giving people an excuse to misgender me.
Oof that’s tough :( I hope in time you can do what makes you happy, whatever that is 💛
Yeah its really a thing of those messages just landing differently. 

That and people working to un-learn that. You might see someone who has successfully (to whatever degree) unlearned that messaging and feel bad bc you havent. But you dont see the work they did to get there,, nor their struggle with it. 

Youre not less valid bc you care abt these beauty standards. 

If ita something you want to do, you can work on that. But even if you dont/dont want to. Thays totally fine. It doesnt change or invalidate who you are just bc you look / want to look a certain way.
Just takes time. It's definitely harder when feeling judged and fear of being ostracized. Alot of it is also negative thoughts. Reminding yourself why can help shift the brain
This stuff is hard! It can take time, but you’ve got your whole life. I’m glad your partner is so supportive ☺️ good luck! I believe in you!
Oh that makes a lot of sense :/ Its not true but it’s hard not to think that way. Nothing wrong with presenting in a way that makes you happy, you’re always valid to me ❤️
Thank you, I really appreciate your kindness :) I just need to grow some more confidence in who I am and care less about people’s expectations, I think.
Thank you so much 💛 I just wish we could live in a world where everyone could present the way they wanted and not have a specific gender tied to that.
That would be wonderful wouldn’t it :/"	yy1e4v	NonBinary	85	0.99	2022-11-17 20:57:54
[TW] I told my parents I want top surgery	"I \[they/them/18\] told my parents today that I wanted top surgery, they already know I'm non-binary and have been using the right name and pronouns for a while but I didn't mention anything before about wanting to transition. I was dreading telling my parents cause, while they aren't transphobic, my dad isn't very in the culture and grew up in a fairly traditional household (women in his immediate family didn't even get pierced ears). 

Overall my mum was fairly supportive, she definitely is the more understanding of the two of my parents when it comes to identity stuff, but my dad greatly dislikes any kind of body modification, I got a tattoo recently and he only seemed 'somewhat' okay with it when I said it would be covering SH scars. But today was horrible, he didn't say anything for a very long time and then just seemed to want to understand why but was being very closed minded about it all. He said that he was ""appalled"" that this was something I wanted and that has just been going on a loop in my head since... 

I have always been close with my parents and my dad's reaction was heartbreaking... He left the house to continue a chore he was doing, without eating (this conversation happened right before dinner) and still hasn't returned... It's past midnight. 

I feel utterly horrible about all of this, obviously top surgery is something to be excited about but now I can't even do that, I just feel all this shame and guilt that I 'hurt' my dad in this way. Despite it being incredibly illogical for me to feel guilty. 

My close friend knew I was telling them and has been pressing me for answers. I have no idea what to say. I really hate ranting about my parents to anyone I know cause they are overall good people and I don't like people being upset with them (again illogical I know)

This post is kinda all over the place, I just needed to get this off my chest (much like something else ha! dysphoriaaaaaa)"	"I’m so sorry you had this stressful experience. If it makes you feel any better, I wasn’t excited for too surgery in waves after I decided I was going to get it. It’s in may and currently I’m so excited just bc my ribs hurt lol. And I’m still not going to tell people I don’t think will support me in my decision. (I’m 28 tho so it’s a bit different)

I remember I told my best friend about wanting top surgery and she just said “why?!?” And just talked about how she can’t imagine doing that ect. It was obvious her reaction was a bit about her own feelings about her body and also how she wanted to keep seeing me. That was like a year ago now and she is super fucking chill, even writing in my Christmas card how excited she is that the next time I see her I won’t have boobs 😂
I'm so sorry :( it's great that your dad is supportive of your identity and pronouns, but sucks he can't understand your desire for some physical transition. My mom and I haven't talked since I told her I'm non-binary and want to have top surgery over a year ago.

It sounds like your dad might come around though as he is supportive in some aspects of your feelings and identity. I do hope he thinks about it real good and realizes your happiness is what's most important.
I’m really sorry your dad wasn’t supportive like he should be.  I can understand as a parent it might be hard for him, but he didn’t do it in the right way. I hope he comes around and is supportive. I’m glad your mom is there for you. You’ll need help post-op so I’m glad you have her. Good luck on your surgery journey.
Keep this in mind: with every relationship in your life, there will be conditions. If you have a friend who is repeatedly making poor and self destructive decisions you might decide to stop being friends with them. If your partner cheats on you, you may choose to break up. But those conditions don’t reasonably extend to someone else’s feelings about your body. It might be startling to someone unfamiliar to the culture that someone would want top surgery, but equally body modifications whether it’s piercings, surgeries, or tattoos hurt literally no one. It’s not like picking up a drug habit and refusing to get help (a condition someone may choose to reject you). Be patient as it may take time for them to accept new truths, but persevere in your pursuit of happiness and be weary of conditional relationships that aren’t reasonably imposed. You might not get financial support but you’re not doing anything wrong or unnatural, body mods have existed for thousands years in hundreds of cultures. 

Finally, in my opinion it sounds like you love your parents and they love you. It might be a hard pill to swallow but if they value a relationship with you, they will accept an otherwise harmless procedure that could improve your quality of life!

Made a first for non-binary folks at my company	"Background: I work for an international transportation company. My division is in North America and I specifically work in their autonomous division. 




I needed to fill out a travel request form to travel for work to Ohio. The form says to use the information as it is on your legal ID. When I get to the gender part, there are only options for male and female. My ID says X. I inform my manager, he apologizes and contacts the person in charge of the form. She came back with the airlines didn't have other options. I found that hard to believe so I checked the airlines we fly with and they both had options outside of male and female, X and U for unspecified and undisclosed respectfully. I send her a message letting her know my issue and that airlines recognize my gender marker. She was really responsive and fixed the issue immediately. It's a shame I had to do the research on this simple matter myself, but hey I'm paving the way for this large corporation to being more inclusive and I think that's pretty fucking cool."	"**You** got to be the groundbreaker for your whole fucking company!

How awesome is that!?
i was informally consulted by a relative who's a funeral director about the way in which her company's registration software only allows deceased individuals to be categorized as male or female. i suggested looking into creating a third marker for 'x,' and it surprisingly went through! feels really good to be a part of this kind of change : )
You are paying the way for sure.  Just that bit of work, which will seem like a blip in time years from now, made the process easier for the thousands to come. Thank you."	pki3rq	NonBinary	65	0.99	2021-09-08 20:02:58
Don’t know if anyone else can relate but this is super specific enby mood	That enby mood when you’re afab but were shamed for being femme your entire childhood and femininity was looked down upon and essentially ignored and not respected by all the men in ur household so you became more masc to adapt as a defense mechanism and then were shamed for being masculine and now yer just  a genderless trauma void	"This is a very relateable mood
sometimes i wonder if i was so put off being feminine as a child and young teen that ive fabricated a nonbinary identity to distance myself from it
(x) I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
same mood but im amab and definitely femme now (lowkey a genderless void tho)

AFAB going braless and wearing t-shirt. I got yelled at in public for this.	"I'm AFAB and I'm new to this community.

I stopped wearing bras altogether a year ago due to discomfort and dysphoria. I love it and I never intend to wear one again. I don't agree with society's ridiculous taboos around feminine breasts/nipples at all, but I'm still having trouble dealing with it in my everyday life. When I go outside of my house, I feel compelled to wear mid-to-heavyweight fabrics (hoodies, sweaters) simply to provide ""cover"" to my nipples, which are distinctly femme: if I wear lightweight fabrics, you can see the contours of my nipples very well, and if the fabric is light in color, you can make out the darker skin pigment too. I wish I didn't have worries about this but I do.

Once I decided to wear a light colored t-shirt out, only to have someone yell at me to put a bra on. She actually yelled. In my face. Angrily. Because I was wearing a t-shirt? ""Put a fucking bra on!"" (actual quote). I felt a wave of shame and embarrassment wash over me and put on my hoodie.

I want to be strong about this. I know that there's NOTHING wrong with what I'm doing but I still feel like I have to alter my behavior for the sake of the people who think I'm doing something wrong. When I go out or go to work (an arguably hip company with the most lax of dress codes), I feel like I'm doing a bad thing if I wear a t-shirt. I feel like there's a very good chance I get called into Human Resources if I wear a t-shirt. In public, I feel vulnerable to interactions like the one I mentioned. 

Where do you find the strength to deal with this shit? 

I'm venting but also looking for thoughts. I know one answer is ""don't wear light colors/light fabrics"" but fuck that. Everyone should be able to go shirtless as far as I'm concerned. I want to be stronger. 

Thanks for reading.
"	"Fuck her for yelling in your face, that's completely rude and unreasonable.

That being said, I have a lot of breast dysphoria but I wear soft sports bras that are in constant rotation so they get kinda blown out and floppy. They don't restrict anything and they're barely noticeable most of the time. The nice thing about most sports bras is that they come in regular sized instead of bra sizes so it's easier to find one that fits correctly and is comfortable. Plus the straps get mistaken for tank-top straps and nobody yells at me if they're visible 😊😊

I completely understand where you're coming from and just want you to know that you're not alone.
The Grand Vizier of Bad Advice wholeheartedly encourages you to immediately start yelling back at them like the world was about to end, then keep yelling, then yell at them a little bit more as they retreat.

This is a proven and true method against nosy windbags, also applicable to door-to-door salesmen, small dogs with no sense of their place, and showstealers.

* 1) Go apeshit as fast as possible.
* 2) Keep the verbal deluge flowing against all comers.
* 3) BONUS: Don't use swearwords or insults and everybody will take you much more seriously.

As an additional consideration for your particular problem, you could consider buying the frilliest and fullest of metal bits bra you can find, *not to wear it*, but just to carry it around in your backpack/bag/purse, and use it to threaten that kind of idiot with a brassiere-flavored flogging.
I've been braless for probably like 6 years now. I honestly can't say that strangers have ever ""called me out"" on it, but I did lose a job over it once (the dive bar I worked at tried to tell me bras were part of the uniform and that 'customers had complained"" after I had worked there braless for several months. I stood my ground, told them it was bullshit, and lost the job). I'd like to think that if what you described happened to me I'd laugh in their face and tell em to stop looking at my chest, but I'd probably just be stunned into silence instead. I'm sorry you experienced that harassment, I support you in wearing whatever you want and not taking any shit for it! Best of luck!
That totally sucks. It’s really  inappropriate for anyone to yell at you for your body and clothes. 

If it would help, you could get some trans tape or medical tape in a light color and cover your nipples, if that would help  you feel more comfortable. Not that you need to live up to other people’s weird expectations. 
What part of the word ""UNDERgarnment"" did she forget to understand? Next time, maybe accuse her of sexual harrassment!
AFAB as well. VERY large chested. Haven’t worn a bra since October. I wear scrubs at work which are thin and T-shirt’s in public. Never once had a problem. I broke my collarbone badly in October and the scar and nerve damage from it being screwed and plated makes bras a no-no
I don't wear a bra on a daily basis, and haven't since high school. Before high school? Have I ever worn one daily? Probably not. Fuck that shouty person! You can imagine me cheering for you when someone gets their pants in a twist.


I stopped wearing a bra this year. Feels so much better, right? I'm also a little concerned about this to be honest -- I'm not sure how feasible it will be in the hot weather. Oh well...

But this lady is some judgemental bitch. There's nothing wrong with going bra-less. I'd invent some bullshit sob story about how all my bras were tragically cut into millions of pieces and burnt, and how I couldn't afford new ones because of my breast cancer. Just to watch her squirm. 
You are listening to your Truth. Keep doing that. The alternative is always a pain.
Undershirt?
She jealous boo. You be you and let other go fok themselves
😂 maybe i'll just bring you along next time I go out.
I'm not sure if this is terrible advice or really solid but picturing essentially an attack bra being whipped out to deal with shouty people made me giggle
Fuck. Sorry you lost your gig, though they clearly never deserved you. Thanks for reaching out and sharing your story. We're in it together. 
>The dive bar I worked at tried to tell me bras were part of the uniform and that 'customers had complained'

I can't believe there's anybody naïve enough to think this argument can hold any water. Unless you can attribute that misjudgement to the inflence of alcohol.

Seriously, it's hilariously unbelievable X//D


😂 oh god
Oh, that'd be dandy! Not only do I spend much too time indoors, I wouldn't mind going ballistic on this kind of idiot for you.

Unfortunately, most likely I'm an hemisphere away.
I wouldn't be something they'd forget, and being flogged in public with lacy underwear sounds thoroughly humiliating and unpleasant (unless you're... uh... into that kind of stuff...)

If they bring the authorities down on the bra-wielder for assault or something, not only will they find themselves the target of some scorn out of sheer absurdity, the bra-wielder can at least put forth in their own defense that the instrument used isn't a capable weapon in any regard, and therefore wasn't wielded with an intent to injure.

I thought I was one of the lucky ones.	"I was wrong. [30ish, AMAB, NB, they/them, just dont call me sir.]

This is about to get very very very long, but i just need to write it out.


[BACKGROUND]


I grew up in a very small town. Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. 

I was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father's repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn't. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.

By high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don't think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.

When I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn't wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.

During the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don't ask don't tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. 

After around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I'm not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]

Thus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.


[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]


Which brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we'll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn't seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. 

It was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.

Sue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn't want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).

We were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren't awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. 


[SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT]


Three years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can't really describe the feeling, it wasn't that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.

A couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn't for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn't want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.

She freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I'm fairly certain she cried.

The next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn't something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn't home. I never said I wouldn't, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.

After a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn't make me gay, I'm not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I'm not trans, but I am queer. I just don't know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn't think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn't have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.

But I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.

I look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. 

And maybe we were?

One night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn't WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.

I wouldn't try to change my voice and I hadn't been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn't like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn't want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn't sure how to fully communicate that.


[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]


I feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.

Sue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.

But it did get normalized. 

I broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.

But I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn't know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.

We bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can't do that, you're about to be a father."" And I started crying.

We had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" 

After the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn't feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.

Late last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.

I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

That month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. 

And the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.

The floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. 

I started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn't go to the gym, and carrying a purse.


[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]


Christmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I'm out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I'm the same person I've always been. And I blew it.

I don't know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter's christmas presents. 

It wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn't drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.

But the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970's NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.

Her father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what 'non-binary' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: 

He said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, 'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don't like that we shouldnt get together.' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" 

I understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I've skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.

Sue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.

A month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: 

1) I am hurting people by doing what I'm doing

2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again

3) I don't think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.

I tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I've thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.

Not satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don't stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""

That hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.

The woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sue knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here's johnny."" 

I deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.

It was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn't try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.

I was alone. 

And I've been alone ever since.

I have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I'll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I've been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.

I've had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I've still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.

I was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won't be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.

I'm so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.

I have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she's been such a huge support. I've reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.

I didn't get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.

I had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. 

I am up for a big promotion so I've had to go in on weekends and stay late.

I havent left my couch all day today. I don't even think I've turned on a light for more than a second.

I thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I've had my blinders on to all those times she wasn't supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.

I doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.


TL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.


EDIT: formatting and spelling


EDIT 2: As if you need more to read, here is the contents of my ""coming out post"" I made the day after she left.


Dear World,
My name is [birth name]. I am not a freak. I am not a monster. I am a person. With hopes and dreams and fears and ambitions. I am also non-binary. What does that mean? It means I don’t let the shape of genitalia determine how I interact with the world. It means I don’t shove myself into a man shaped box or a woman shaped box. The shape of my body does not define my role in the world and does not preclude me from finding joy where I see it. In practice, I’ve been experimenting with makeup and a more feminine expression in my clothing choices. I choose the middle path. It shouldn’t hurt you to hear this, and if it does you should ask yourself why. This has been a journey I found myself on over 5 years ago and it has not been an easy road. At times it has been very lonely and painful, but I find that most of that pain and anguish came from holding a part of myself back from the world. I come to praise [birthname], not to bury him. The label only serves to describe my feelings, but it does not define me. Only I define me. And I am [birthname]. The passionate, sympathetic, caring, and loving person I hope you’ve always known me to be. I will not be held hostage by society. I will not be made to think I am “less than.” I am the new normal: a world existing in and on a vast spectrum that “black” and “white” couldn’t begin to describe. Join me or not, but I hope you will. ✌️one love

"	"Wow.  That's quite a story.  I can relate to some of the core parts.  My wife is currently trying to take all of my kids away bc I am transitioning and bc of how embarrassing it will be for the kids.  At this point, I'm pretty sure I still have myself and my job.....everything else is a crapshoot except the certainty of losing my marriage.   I think at one point in life, I thought I was one of the lucky ones too.  The only comfort or solace I can offer you is the reassurance that you are not alone.
I read it through. I'm so sorry Sue can't understand you and can't see how not letting your daughter see you doesn't help her at all. Do you have any lawyer friends that you're discussing with about the situation?

You sound pretty amazing. 💕 Thanks for sharing your story
Have you gotten your own lawyer? My understanding it that the longer you allow your daughter to lived away from you the harder it will be to get custody as a judge will not want to change her lifestyle/what she knows. Start the fight for custody rights *now.*
This was a sad post. Friend, I truly hope things get better for you and that you get to see your child more. I know it's not the same, but I've not seen my little sister in almost two years and I've yet to meet my youngest sister due to coming out to my mom.
>I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

This resonates a lot with me. I’m agender, but I’m very fem, and this is a really good way of putting it into words the way I haven’t been able to.

Thank you, and you always have us as support.
:( im sorry about what happened with sue, it hurts so much to be in search for support in people you care about and not finding it, but from this post i get the impression that you can handle anything life throws at you. you are beautiful!!💜💜
I'm sorry to hear all that.

It sounds to me like you got to a point where you sort of had to force the issue that you are non-binary and she would have to be okay with that, but she isn't.

If you can't be together, I hope for everyone's sake that you and Sue can be adults about this.  I know that we hear many horror stories about how the family courts handle situations with divorcing couples with children, but you don't hear a lot about couples who divorce and then successfully co-parent afterwards.  I hope that you and Sue can come to an agreement to be able to parent together.

Some USA jurisdictions now have ""presumption of joint custody"" policies in place.  If you live in such a place, you are fortunate that you have the law on your side that Sue must make an affirmative case against you in order to take your daughter away.  In any case, /u/UVSky is right that you need to get in touch with a lawyer and learn about what the policies are in your jurisdiction and what you need to do to secure your right to parent your child moving forward.
That's a big story, and it deserves a big post. I'm so sorry.

But you know what? F*ck Sue and f*ck her family. You don't deserve that kind of hatred and toxicity in your life. I firmly believe everyone has the right to be happy and open about who they are. You are part of everyone.

Remember, this community is always here for you.
I'm honestly really sorry you had to go through this. Much love to you and thanks for sharing! 
Hey friend, I'm really sorry all of this  happened. You're incredibly resilient and you'll get through this mess too somehow.
you already fully went through puberty at only 14 and call yourself a late bloomer? ok.
Friend, that's neither here nor there.
Maybe I didn’t word that right. Like I didn’t ejaculate for the first time until I was 14 and I don’t think the mechanics had turned on until then. The things I’ve heard about 9 yos humping everything or the 12 yo taking 1000 showers a week was never anything I experienced. 

Maybe it wasn’t “puberty” but I just didn’t “discover myself.” I didn’t know it was supposed to do anything other than pee.
that's what the post said."	8an4qz	NonBinary	53	1.0	2018-04-08 02:32:31
(Triggering) amab not NB enough	"My second rant of the night. I’m amab. I use they/them. I feel so invalidated by social media, and certain people around me. I feel like the common perception of non-binary is afab and white. I feel like there is very little representation for amab’s of any type. Like, I search “non-binary” on Instagram or tik tok and the vast majority of people I see are afab. First off, it’s not THEIR fault. If you’re afab and NB you should feel no shame for that. My issue is that the common perception for NB is afab, and I am starting to feel excluded in LGBTQ circles. For instance, I was out with an NB friend of mine one night (we went to a concert) afterwards we were hanging out with someone who came up to us (I was in a crop top and some high waisted jeans, trying to look femme, my friend was just wearing a t-shirt and jeans) this person comes up and asks my friend and I our names and then just my friend their pronouns, not mine though. Okay. Odd but whatever. Anyways we talk and then my friend goes off for something. This person asks me some questions about voting for some reason and I say I didn’t vote (I explained my reasons) to make a long story short they called me a “straight white male” while trying to guilt me or something. I am one of those things. My friend comes back and this person refers to me as a “he” and then the whole situation devolves even faster.
What I’m trying to say here is that I’m feeling excluded. I don’t feel like I’m valid because I don’t have tits. It’s deeply upsetting to me because no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to find good representation for amab’s. I want people to see that I am also non-binary, and that stereotyping this gender is an actual problem. There is nothing wrong with afab. I’m just upset that from my point of view non-binary is expected to be afab. Idk I’m just upset, it’s late and I’ve been invalidated a few times today by my family on my gender and I’m upset."	"Please read Sissy by Jacob Tobia if you can! They're also a YouTuber and talk frequently about how hard it is to be amab non-binary, even in queer spaces. You are so valid and I'm sorry this is happening to you
I think part of the problem is cis people still seeing enby folks as their assigned sex at birth. They're still gendering the experience of being nonbinary, and gendering it as something feminine people do. They think being nonbinary is being a vaguely masculine ""girl"". 

I'm sorry that people are treating you that way. You don't have to prove your gender to anyone, and fuck that person for asking one person their pronouns and not yours. They basically clocked your friend and completely disrespected you. Don't let assholes get you down.
Look into Jeffrey Marsh who is nonbinary and AMAB, they are Indya Moore, from the series Pose, is also transfem nonbinary although they portray a trans6+q woman.  And if you are into doctor who or other nerdy stuff, like media anysis, Council of Geeks on YouTube is genderfluid and AMAB. They so have another channel, Vera Wylde where they talk about their transition, although earlier videos focus on cross dressing because that's how they started exploring gender and stuff. This is a very short list composed of people off the top of my head. It won't fix everything but it is a way to see some more AMAB nonbinary people qland maybe feel less alone
I understand where your coming from. Before the pandemic I often found myself avoiding queer spaces because I felt that I would not ""fit"" , that my appearance would make others uncomfortable. When you foogle Nonbinary , I see so many thin stylish people; not alot of people like me
I'm so sorry about how the community make you feel and that this person was an asshole.
It can be hard to feel seen when you don't see anyone who looks like yourself, who you can relate to in a place where you're belonging.
If I can add to the amab NB list, there is also Sam Smith and Alok Vaid-Menon that you can look up.

I hope you'll be able to find the people and spaces that will make it right for you and you are definitly valid ❤️
I very likely don't agree with ur reasoning on voting but fuck that person srsly, it is one thing to criticize in my opinion bad decisions but I would not invalidate someone's identity cause of that. Sad to hear about that, not asking for ur pronouns but ur friends was such a giveaway, i hope next time u iust give anyone who does that shit for that, just shit on them"	qbq7qn	NonBinary	53	0.96	2021-10-20 01:47:24
Came out to a friend	"I met with a good friend of mine tonight, he is the pastor's son from the church I used to attend. 

I've always known him to be loving and accepting, but coming out as NB, and more specifically talking about my desire to appear more fem(I'm AMAB) and feeling zero judgment was amazing.

I have a lot of shame internalized about my identity from my religious childhood, but having him accept me for who I am, AND be happy for me to find my true self brings an overwhelming feeling of freedom and joy 💜"	Awh! I’m so happy to hear this!! The validation is such a nice feeling.	y673ml	NonBinary	48	0.96	2022-10-17 10:08:49
I'm never going to a hairdresser again. Never ever. I'm so done.	"I'm AFAB (nb and they/them pronouns). Around half a year ago I decided that I would finally stop listening to people telling me that I can't chop my waist length hair off because it's oh so pretty, because it would be a shame and because they would miss it.

I went to the hairdresser for the first time, told them I wanted all my hair cut off and an undercut. She was all like ""Oh but what if you don't like it? Why don't we start slow?"". She ended up convincing me to get a bob. The longest parts of it were at the bottom of my ears.

It wasn't quite what I wanted, but it already felt so much better than the super long hair, I was much more comfortable with myself. I really enjoyed it, but of course it grew out after a few months.

I went to a different hairdresser and told him I wanted short hair. It basically looked like someone had put half of a very blonde coconut on my head, kind of like Angela Merkel in her early days. Couldn't convince him to cut my hair shorter, so I just decided to let it grow out again.

But I didn't feel very comfortable with it, so I tried yet another hairdresser today. It's gotten even worse. I showed her pictures and everything. She did shave the lower third of my head, which is way less than what I wanted, but at least she's been shaving some parts I guess. But the rest of it... Ugh. She barely cut any hair off there, so you can't even see the shaved parts. Instead she chose to insult my natural hair color and said I'd look retarded if I cut any more off. It was extremely awkward and frustrating. I'm pretty good at hating myself, I don't have to pay anybody else to do that for me lol. 

I'm now even more dysphoric than I was with the waist long hair, and as a bonus I also feel ugly as fuck. I look like a girl that was shaved while asleep as a prank. But the worst part is it's so feminine. It's just too girly. And I'm not a girl ffs. 

I've tried putting the rest of my longish hair in something like a bun, and it's probably the best I can do right now. It's okay as long as nobody else is around, but I dread having to leave my room tomorrow. 

I've given up on hairdressers.  So yeah, I'm going to buy a razor on Monday and try doing it myself. It's probably going to look awful, but at least it will finally be short. And if it looks all to bad I'm just gonna do a buzzcut. And if I ever decided to go to a hairdresser again I'd already chop of most of my hair beforehand so they don't have a choice.

I just don't get their problem. Why the fuck can't they just chop my hair off?"	"I would maybe try one more time, see if you can find a man who primarily does men's haircuts and bring him a picture of what you want.  I was never able to get women to cut it the way I wanted them to, I guess they were projecting their feelings about short hair onto me or something.  I got mine cut the shortest it's ever been this morning and LOVE IT.  Bonus: my current guy charges me for a men's haircut.
If you want an undercut or short hair go to a barber. Hands down. 

Unless you find a hairdresser that is also a barber and a colorist (bless my stylist I love her, she is magic 💖)
I had a bad version of my current haircut for three years before I found someone who did what I wanted. 

When I needed a new hair dresses I had three criteria they needed to fill, they needed to 
1.) Be young (I looked for anyone under 35)
2.) Be queer or have had a queer experience 
3.) Be covered in tattoos

It took me awhile but I found The One. And honestly I have the best haircut of anyone I know, including people who have my exact hair style, and I love my hair dresses because she gets me. 
The solution here isn’t give up on hair dressers, it’s don’t settle on someone who cant give you what you want.
clippers are like 20 bucks. best decision I've ever made was doing it myself
Bruh get yourself a set of clippers with guards and shave your head your own way. I've been doing it for years (also afab nb) and only need help for the back of my head sometimes. I've been able to rock whatever shaved style I want, and if I want the longer part trimmed/shaped I just go do that with a barber (""men's"" haircuts are my preference, hence barbers instead of stylists). It may seem intimidating at first but honestly, it's hard to injure yourself and as long as you stay even and keep an eye on details (like sideburns or around the ears) you will look fly no matter what. Every time I've gone in to see a stylist it's always an ultra-femme look they give me. Nothing wrong with that look, I just can't stand it on myself. Being able to take literal control over your hair by shaving it yourself is so nice. And if you want any styling/details in the shaved bit def see a barber.
I'm sorry if this isn't helpful, but this is why feminism is important. Though you may be identifying differently, if you are perceived as female, people are less likely to listen to what you actually want/have to say in many places. 

Idk where you are, or what your situation is, but maybe try to find a place that is trans or LGBTQ friendly, or even run by someone non-binary themselves. Hell even a punk style hairdressing place might be more likely to cut your hair short.
Try a barber shop
I second everyone saying to try a barber shop. Not only are they willing to do whatever you ask of them (in my experience) but they’re specifically trained to do more masculine haircuts/clipper work, and are typically cheaper than hairdressers
damn..  bummer experiences..  really sorry to hear that.   getting your own clippers and DIY haircutting if you can get half way decent will save you a ton of money in the long run too..  so +1 for that.

If you ever decide to go to a professional again.. I also vote barber.   or find someone lgbt so they will be more open minded and know whats up.

I personally have one oddball experience related to this.  For background, I am a masc presenting AMAB MtF Trans.    When I was 25 ish..  and welll into transition, but again,.. masc presenting.  I often performed as a drag king.   I went to an old school barber.  old dude like nearing retirement.   this was 2000-2001.   He stated he didn't cut women's hair.....   I told him ""that's neat, but you seem like the perfect guy to cut my hair to look like Ronald Reagan from 1985""   he agreed and cut my hair for the next 4 years.
that is the most unreasonable thing. how can they refuse to cut your hair the way you want it? IT'S YOUR HAIR!! i just use a wig since my school does not allow hair shorter than the chin.
For awhile I was doing the faux hawk w/ fade and it took me soooo long to find someone who'd do it. They never tried to convince me not to, but they'd give a reason they couldn't do it, and it always boiled down to ""i can do scissor work but not clipper work"" or vice versa.

That was trying at salons and barbers. Finally I realized my best bet was a chain shop that I knew did men's and women's cuts. The first time I went there I got sat with a guy (who I'm pretty sure is queer) and he didn't bat an eye - gave me exactly what I wanted. The second time I went in, the same guy was there but they sat me with a lady who, even though I already had a month-outgrown version of the style, said ""Really?!"" when I showed her the picture.

The guy who'd done it the first time said ""yeah she means it"" and he ended up doing it again🙂 because the lady ""didn't know how to do a faux hawk"" 🙃
definitely go to a barber shop
I have a clipper set with different length guards and I've been cutting my own hair for years. I can make the top long and the sides short, full buzzcut, grow it out a little shaggy etc
I second this. Hairdressers can be divas, but barbers tend to be “whatever, your hair, your money, your decision”.
Seconded. I got to a great local barbershop who doesn’t separate between men and women’s styles or cuts. They just charge a short cut or a long cut. None of the stylists there have ever given me grief about me wanting my hair short with an undercut and sideshave
Oh absolutely same! Pre chop hair was about armpit lenghth. When quarantine went into effect and it kept getting longer I kept feeling less Me.

Taking scissors to it and then a 1 inch guard all over was just. Amazing. And it's also like. If you screw it up? It'll grow back. And you can just laugh at any remarks and call it the covid cut. Downside is work ID still has the very femme hair which is Oof don't like that now. But yeah yay clippers! 💗"	ivyhdg	NonBinary	50	0.99	2020-09-19 18:56:08
I just wanna say a big thank you to all you beautiful enbies showing off your facial hair!	"I'm AFAB but I'm not an androgynous enby. Personally, I don't want top surgery or to go on hormones (though I will defend to my dying breath anyone who does!) As a result, the ""YoU'rE nOt nOn-BiNaRy"" is real and since I'm barely out yet, I find it so agonizing. It really makes me doubt myself even though I've never truly identified as a girl or woman. I'm in my late 30s & never heard of non-binary until a few years ago. But growing up, I was always the tomboy. It wasn't ""JuSt a PhAsE"", it was who I was, who I've always been. I was also told I had to grow out of it but all that did was make me feel ashamed of myself while I tried to be what was expected of me. 

But seeing you beautiful people with a feature incorrectly* attributed as male only, be so bold & non-binary really helps me feel that I do belong. I hope it's ok but I'm saving some of these posts to whip out the next time someone tries to tell me what non-binary is & isn't. So thank you so much & please keep sharing your gorgeous photos.


* Facial hair on women is much more common than people realise, it's just women are shamed into compulsive facial hair removal.

Are anyone else's ideal existences as a nonbinary person to be nonbinary to the point of being nonhuman/not even applying human ideals of gender?	"I'm not agender, I'm nonbinary, as in I have a gender it just isn't one there's a name for. My transition goals are basically ""I don't know what you are but you're hot"" and I've found that the more I lose interest in pleasing the masses the more I'd like to just go ham with my appearance. I'm autistic and have always found myself to be very nontraditional in terms of almost everything, especially self expression. My relationships with my friends are hardly ever strictly platonic, every day I care less for sexuality labels and the limitations of a binary world, my habits are less influenced by typical standards and expectations, and I generally do whatever's best for me and what feels right.

If I could afford it, every outfit would just be akin to an ethereal being. Every outing I'd look like *that* guy you see at hot topic. The weirdo in the plague mask or the person who looks like a clown or a woodland creature or something. The sort where kids think I'm a fantasy creature, teens think I'm cosplaying, and adults probably think I'm a jobless lowlife, keeping it appropriate of course. The sort where I'd get posted to cringe subs for looking as weird as I want.

Of course I don't want to be shamed for self expression, but honestly when I see other people like that I want to be them. I think it takes a lot of confidence to be able to do that and I think it would be incredibly freeing to dress up all you'd like and feel happy about it, to not have to apply the standards of male and female beauty to yourself and just be what you want to be. I don't even want my sex or anatomy to be guessable, I want it to be the last thought in someone's head to try and figure out what my body is like behind it.

Not even in an ""I want attention"" sort of way either, I just think it'd be really fun and freeing to live that way. Even if it's an unattainable reality (which I personally don't feel like it is,) it's still a fantasy I like to daydream of sometime. I guess I just don't want to spend my life trying to conform to something I don't feel at home in, and if I'm already an outcast in life I'm going to live as happily with myself as I possibly can.

Does anyone else have any similar desires to express beauty or personal aesthetics in very nonstandard ways? If so, how do you express it or how would you like to express it?"	"You might wanna check out r/voidpunk
Yes, me :3  


I just want to look like an eldritch dragon creature at \*all times\*  


If I could present however I'd like I'd wear mostly a collection of goth and historical clothing and wearable art, always have blue and silver hair, get my ears pointed, have all-over tattooing, get a bunch more piercings, get my canines pointed, and wear dragon horns or half-masks everywhere. Oh, and claw jewelry. Lots of things. But mostly I just want to be clocked as 'not really human' and 'reminds me of dragons' and 'scary but hot'  


I'm slowly collecting stuff so I can be more openly 'me' all the time. Luckily my partner is the same, and I don't work, so I can get away with a lot of fun stuff  


Thanks for this post, it makes me braver to know we're out there
me. i do. literally exactly this.
Oh gosh yes; gimme functional tentacles and glow-in-the-dark contact lenses!

I want to wear the archetypal Link outfit from Legend of Zelda unironically. Tunic, hose snd cuffed boots? Yes please. I'm also drawn to being the most goth anyone could be. I had a minor goth phase in my late teens, and maybe being 30+ has driven me a little bonkers, but I want to do it again now I have the money to buy all the fanciest stuff.
This reminds me of Ye Olde Days (2009ish?) on AVEN when there was a forum thread on the topic ""what is your ideal body"", and the suggestions started out as physically possible human phenotypes but ended up as things like ""shape-shifting dragon"" and ""swarm of nanobot bees"".

So tired to conform to societal non-binary stereotypes and expectations	"Pressure to conform to societal “non-binary stereotypes” give me distress and sometimes makes my life completely unlivable. I used to be fine with my body, I used to even be proud of it, but now I feel constant shame about my body, because I’ve changed nothing about it to prove that I’m truly non-binary. I don’t want to do anything with my body, my style, my interests, I want society to stop gendering everything in me, my body, my life. I want the world to hear me and adjust their understanding of me but instead I have this constant unbearable pressure to proof with every second of my existence that I’m who I’m. I just wanna cry, I’m so tired of this. Do they create these new ""boxes"" for us because they don't understand us at all?"	"I know it is tough but if it helps, by me not changing anything and just saying this is the way I’ve always been…just didn’t have the words I’ve actually opened a lot of peoples eyes and changed their negative perceptions of what it all means. So, you may be doing this too, even without knowing 🖤
That's what people do. They categorize. There's nothing we can do about it. Nonbinary as a label is difficult, not only because it falls outside the usual understanding, but because overall, every NB has a different experience. 

OP, I hope you can forgive the idiots that make your life difficult. But either way, it's your life and you are your own best advocate. As long as you can stand by yourself, it makes it easier to let other people's ignorance slide off.
You don’t have to change anything about yourself to be non-binary. I’m sorry the world is making you feel this way. 

I have no surgery or hormone treatment plans, I haven’t died or cut my hair, haven’t changed my clothes. Haven’t even changed my name. But I’m still me, and I’m still non-binary. 

You are valid, keep being you and encourage others to do the same :)
Then don't. Stop caring about what other people expect of you and just live your life. Tell em to go cry about it if you aren't up to their expectations. They can piss and shit their pants if they're really serious about throwing a tantrum about it.
I feel this so much. I think part of the issue is, nothing we do is enough for society's opinion

I was able to get a surgery I wanted for other medical reasons, so the stars aligned for me there. Afterwards, I liked the change and all, but I still felt like an imposter anyway. I feel like it actually feels better the more I explore and figure out myself vs the medical steps I've taken.
I think people who have a binary understanding of gender more readily create a ”third gender” cathegory, that may suit some non-binary people, but far from all. So they try to also create a signal system, so that this ”third gender” will be complete and follow the male-man-masculine, and female-woman-feminine pattern. 

That expectation/need for nonbinary to follow the same pattern as the binary genders is I think what creates this strong push for it to go nonbinary-enby/enbin-androgynous, and to apply the same kind of control (or even stronger) to nonbinary people who aren’t interested in androgyny that is applied to women who aren’t feminine or men who aren’t masculine. Some nonbinary people also fall into this pattern/striving, maybe for the sake of validation, seeking the validation of gender identity in androgyny the way women can find it in femininity and men in masculinity.

But nonbinary isn’t a gender, it’s more a family of ways to relate to and experience gender as disconnected from the binary, so the pattern doesn’t fit. Potentially some particular nonbinary positions could have that pattern, potentially demigirls will be somewhat like other demigirls, and demiboys somewhat like demiboys, just like women are somewhat ”like” eachother to some extent over a huge spectrum. Maybe neutrois will be generally neutral over a huge spectrum and genderqueers queer to their hearts desire, and agenders land wherever life takes them when they are finally allowed to drop the whole gender thing and just be. But nonbinary will never follow a single pattern, and neither should it.

We’re trying to figure out what gender is beyond the far too binary understanding of it, trying to make space and welcome for the real extent of gender, and to free those who find gender irrelevant, unrelatable or missing from having to relate anyway. It is very unfortunate, though fairly predictable, that the next struggle after erasure is stereotyping.

It’s hard to keep your footing against the onslaught of social pressure, whether that pressure is for self-erasure, self-stereotyping or ”correct” performance of group membership. I’ve experienced many times, with many different things in my life, that it was easier for me to be something in my own way before I started to be grouped with others ”like” me and had to start relating both to this group’s diverse, own norms about the ”right” way to be whatever it was, and to the stereotypes that people outside this group had about us, stereotypes that fit some of us but usally at most maybe a quarter. Usually it’s even less people within a group who has strong ideas of how you have to be to belong to a group, but they sure can be loud. I’m very happy to see so little of it here, that the general tone here is: if you want to be nonbinary you are, and if you are nonbinary, you can express that (or not) however you feel like.

I’m myself struggling to return to my own peace and ways with the things I am and do. I was seriously fed up with being thought my agab even before I had heard of nonbinary being a thing, and my expression has been bold and all over the place for over twenty years. From childhood I always wanted some things that my body won’t do on it’s own, but I don’t really mind what it did do, and as you, I used to be proud of it. This is my nonbinary body, whether or not I choose to pursue more, and whether or not I can get other people to (un)gender me correctly.

Hope you find your way to keep your footing, your way of being you, resonating with yourself beyond the binary.
You can’t prove you’re nonbinary. You can’t look nonbinary. It’s a blessing and a curse. (This is the second person ‘you’) 

It’s very difficult to prove that you’re not a binary person because many people are androgynous by nature and are cool being gendered by their sex. It’s not your fault this happens.

However, you (me too) have to stop caring and advocate ourselves.

Take care of yourself.💕
You don't need to change your body or anything else to be nonbinary <3
I’m realizing more and more this feeling we have, as I often feel exactly the same way. Has little to do with others accepting me, and everything to do with me accepting myself and loving myself.

The world will not change and has not changed because I realized I’m non-binary. There’s other aspects of myself that are challenged and I’m not disempowered. So why am I so disempowered when someone calls me sir?

I don’t have to change my gender expression so others accept or respect my gender. If I chose to change my gender expression it will be so that I accept my gender and want to fully express it.

Hope this helps."	rhtfsa	NonBinary	40	0.96	2021-12-16 15:47:05
I ♥️ that I can finally sit comfortably with my legs crossed without the shame that was beaten into me (not literally) for year for doing it wrong. I think the ankle on the knee manner was devised to give the impression that your package was sooo big that you needed all of this space		"I mean I do the ankle on the knee cuz it's comfy and doesn't squish my balls when I do it. Also it gives me a nice little shelf to put my book on when I read on the subway.
OH MY GOD I was told through years of grade school that I sat “like a girl” IE as you are here and I was always just perplexed at the notion. It was comfy as far as I was concerned, and it was ideal for holding a book or a laptop with modest ease. Hell, I can even remember some adult telling me that “boys don’t sit like that” and guess what? Jokes on them. I’m not a boy, I can sit however I please, and so can you 🙌
Yes! Sometimes it's the little things that make you feel free to be yourself.

&#x200B;

I'm can't even sit comfortably like that for more than a few minutes, but sometimes it just kinda happens and not having to self-""correct"" is a great feeling.
as a AFAB that was always taught to sit like this but couldn't because my leg would simply slide off or go numb: what about this is comfortable 😭 I'm glad you feel comfortable sitting this way but for me nothing beats a good old lean back and spread 🤪
I have always felt more comfortable Sat like that anyway, the ankle on the knee thing always made my hips ache. I used to be teased that I must be small downstairs for it not to be uncomfortable, they didn’t know how used to squashing you get when you routinely tuck in private."	rfg34l	NonBinary	37	0.97	2021-12-13 13:46:48
I don't know why I'm shy about feeling included in both mens and womens spaces when I'm genderfluid and androgyne	"I guess I've never really felt the need to be divided into either group, and on top of being genderfluid and androgyne I'm also autistic and so struggle to understand binary gender and it's division to begin with. 

I'm AFAB since it's relevant. But I feel embarrassed about wanting to be included in womens spaces or womens discussions because sometimes I don't feel worthy enough for those spaces or like I'm an invader. And in mens spaces I just don't feel welcomed at all, that I'm ""too woman"" for them and just trying to shoehorn my way in. 

I love being considered for both spaces, but then I feel so shameful when I try to consider myself as ""one of the girls"" and as ""one of the boys"". Not because of my own relationship with my gender, but because of societal expectations. I know that there's subs like ""ask women"" and ""ask men"" but I'm embarrassed to include myself in either because of how people might see me. I feel like I'll only feel even more isolated from womens spaces when I start hrt, but still too uncomfortable and not ""man enough"" to be in mens spaces. 

Nonbinary spaces just don't exist. There's no ""ask enbies"" and even if there was it'd be by enbies for enbies and inherently queer and not really casually comparable to the other two even if queer folx can participate in the other two. 

I guess I just feel so isolated and alone. I don't really see groups. I just see humans and I want to be included in their discussions. I don't like that they're basically clubs. I feel like I have some of the perspective of women, esp growing up AFAB and currently am not out so I'm still treated as a woman, and I feel like I have some of the perspective of men since I'm transmasc and want to be in masc spaces. 

I just don't feel good enough for either. Like either I need to be cis or binary trans and if I'm not then I'm not welcomed in the mens club or the womens club, even if my gender dictates that I should be. I wish I could be welcomed, I just am in so much despair from this binary world."	"I was just thinking about this kind of thing too... the problem I've run into is that I'm enough Other that honestly my experiences and opinions aren't as relevant as I feel like they might be, even from before I understood about being non-binary. They're often askew in subtle ways from the norm, and I feel like it's not fair to be casting my vote, as it were, for an outlying position in a way that makes it look like another woman/man supports it. But then that does leave me feeling isolated too.
I feel somewhat similar. Places labeled “mens space” or “womens spaces” tend be pretty exclusive and (esp. women’s spaces) actively hostile to anyone other than that binary gender entering.

I don’t ID as a woman, but I still have lived as one, was raised as one, spent my whole life as one, and feel very connected to them socially and also the broader issues/situations they discuss. And yet they’re very sensitive to the idea of people who don’t belong there butting in and taking up space - so if I actually transitioned, I’m sure I’d be hella unwelcome. 

I like being “one of the girls” and “one of the boys” as you put it. And I also really fear sometimes “what if i’m just identifying as nonbinary so i can claim access to womens spaces where i don’t really belong???” Which is ridiculous for the reasons above and also because W H A T. But damned if I don’t feel it.

I started typing this intending to clarify how my feelings about this diverge from yours significantly but the more I type the more I’m relating to you. I’m sorry you’re feeling like this, I hope someone relating helps you know you’re not alone at least. That you’re not trying to shoehorn, this is just one of many experiences that come with being nb.
I relate a lot to this post. I recently discovered myself as genderfluid but I'm AMAB so I'm kinda coming at it from the other side as you. I've never really felt at home in any kind of gendered group, and the closest I've ever felt to being ""one of the boys"" is with a very specific group of nerdy guys from high school that are some of my only friends. It's definitely worse with women's groups since I still feel a connection with being a man and I lack the shared experiences and traumas that bind those groups together so I'd definitely be unwelcome (understandably so but still). I wish I had a solution for you but I'm struggling   with the issue myself so I just wanted to say I totally get you haha 😅
Yes, totally. This is why I prefer spending time with animals and nature coz I fit in fine and feel right, like it’s not even relevant. Groups have always made me feel like an outsider. People can be fine one on one though so that’s how I prefer to roll. Maybe focus on where you feel ok rather than where you don’t? Life is short and wonderful, we belong here too❤️
I have a hard time with this too. As someone who’s AFAB I often want to share my experiences with women because I lived a lot of my life as a woman and my experiences are real and valid and maybe helpful to others but it’s also hard cuz I’m not a woman and I don’t want to be put into that box because I’m acknowledging how I lived a very significant portion of my life. It’s confusing and hard to be outside the binary a lot of the time.
I completely understand and wish a space was dictated to us that wasn’t inherently queer. I just want to be a human and relate to other humans. I want to talk about things like our favorite cereal or what good anime/tv shows we are enjoying at the moment and not always have to have it relate back to being enbies. I love that those spaces are a place for people to talk and relate but I wish something more causal was around to feel apart of as well.
god it hurts so much man. i wish i had some meaningful advice for you, all i can say is i relate
I mean…this is a non-binary space. Someone had to start it. Why not start one in the manner you wish one existed? Like to hike? Genderqueer/NBi/fluid hiking meetups! Like movies? Gender expansive horror movie club! Make the thing that if you saw it you’d say ‘yes, I’m def going to join that’ and they will come.
Absolutely feel this! Especially about being gendered as “one of the..”.’ Feel connected to being a woman still (afab) but def right now there’s a new sensation of affirmation to be one of the boys or theys! Glad you can relate.

I'm exploding with joy and just need to share it	"Hey you wonderful people. After 10 years of unhappiness with my body I've finally managed to accept that I'm not going to ""grow out"" of it. After months of anxiously feeling like I'm not trans enough to be actually trans, I've realized I'm non binary and that that's okay too.

I'm still confused about a lot of stuff, but I'm just so filled with contentment. I'm a person happy with my vagina and unhappy with my breasts. I want a deeper voice but I don't want facial hair. I want to wear dresses and suits and have a more gender neutral name. I don't care what pronouns I'm called, I don't care what people think I am. And for the first time none of these feelings come with shame or confusion. 

I've scheduled a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon and plan to get top surgery next spring. I've been buzzing with happy energy all week. Every time I look down at my chest the usual dysphoria sets in, but it's being drowned it by impatience and excitement. I can't wait to feel and look how I want to. I can't wait to shop in the boys section. I can't wait to be actually happy with how I look.

After surgery I don't know what will come next. Maybe I'll be happy then. Maybe I'll actually change my name. Maybe I'll publicly stay a flat chested girl forever. I don't know. But I know that I'm really happy to start becoming who I want to be, whoever that is <3 

Thank you all for your part in helping me realize who I am <3 <3 <3"	"That's awesome! I'm in a similar place and have been struggling with that for years. I'm okay with my small breasts but I kind of wish I was male downstairs and often wear a prosthetic in private. I'm neutral to facial hair and I love dresses on occasion and gender neutral t-shirts and button-down dude shirts. I've had a child and I don't regret it. It was nice being a womb haver and being able to use it. And I love my hairy hairy legs. So I've always been a bit conflicted. But once I accepted myself and felt so much better. Congratulations on feeling more like yourself! That's so important.

Anyone else feel like an imposter?	I've been very slowly realizing that I don't fit into the binary my whole life. Only in the past couple weeks have I publicly asked people to call me just by my last name and use they/them pronouns. To one part of me, this feels so right and feels exactly like I'm being true to myself. But another part of me feels like it's all a lie and that I should just accept my birth name and assigned gender. I have so much shame surrounding what I feel is being true to myself. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope?	"I think the imposter syndrome is very common, actually. I’m not sure what causes it, but feeling like you’re making too big a deal out of your gender identity, or feeling like you’re just being a “special snowflake”, or things like that- I think a lot of us get those feelings and second guess ourselves. 

It may be a symptom of depression/anxiety, or at least for some people it is? The gender thing isn’t the first time I’ve felt it, anyway. The best way I’ve found to deal with it is to treat things like facts, even if you doubt them. They/them pronouns feel good? Then it doesn’t matter if you feel like a fake, you should have those pronouns. Does your chest bouncing around bother you, but you feel like it’s not enough that you should have a binder? Get a binder anyway, your chest bothers you and that matters. 

It takes time and practice, and the self-doubt still hangs around, but at it stops paralyzing you when you start giving your symptoms credit and acting on them instead.
I always feel a sinking ""I'm lying"" type of feeling to the point were I feel kinda sick. Idk how to stop it but what works for me is playing a nastoligic (idk how to spell it) game, like for me it is Minecraft, or I do things that always bring a joy to me. Sometimes it is hanging with friends, sometimes it is doing something alsone and other times I just let myself be with those thoughts and think through it. It sometimes takes a while, bit eventually, I feel a lot better.  

Hope this helps, and hang in there!
Thank you for this, truly. I am in therapy and taking meds for my depression/anxiety, and I never realized they could be behind me feeling like this. That opens up a lot of possibilities. Treating them as facts is so right - thank you."	cmkv0w	NonBinary	32	0.97	2019-08-06 02:41:14
RANT: My mom keeps forcing femininity on me	"I'm not out to my mom (bc she will obv disown me if I do) and she's just always forcing me to be feminine. Everything that makes me happy and euphoric makes her mad. When I cut my hair she mocked me and when I shaved my head she didn't talk to me for for two whole months. She's always been after me to lose weight cuz ""girls shouldn't be fat"". She keeps implying that there's something wrong with me for being bigger in size. Even when I've constantly insisted that my health and my vitals are all good. She shames me for eating at all. Like always making comments about how much I eat. And I've honestly been working out in secret since the beginning of this year when my therapist recommended it for anxiety. She doesn't like my makeup and says I do too much and look like a ghost and I'm just so sick of her not accepting me even when I haven't told her I'm non binary. It just sucks so much I hate it and I hate her.

PS: not looking for advice just wanted to rant and get some validation maybe?"	"Gosh she sounds like such an abusive person. I hope you can get out of there soon ♥️
Yeah she sounds terrible. Sorry you have to deal with that. There is nothing wrong with you. 
You don't have to be anymore or less feminine then you want to be.
I’m so sorry. That’s horrible. I’ve seen a lot of people fall into eating disorders due to their parents focus on their weight."	owefrb	NonBinary	30	0.96	2021-08-02 13:23:56
Has anyone else gone from confident queer to doubtful/ashamed NB?	"I posted this on my Instagram but I'm just wondering if anyone here can relate.

Real talk - the past year and a half has been the hardest of my life when it comes to being queer. Confidence in who I was and that I was doing the right thing came naturally to me as a 13 year old in 2007, and I really loved being part of the gay community. When I was 18 I had no inner conflict about adding the term nonbinary - it just felt like a natural extension of who I already knew I was. I knew I was lucky to be one of the first of an era to grow up surrounded by support. This is why it floored me that I have felt so much shame and doubt when it became necessary to actually DO something about the dysphoria I was feeling. 

Being nonbinary right now is not easy and I have felt guilt over every possible thing. Asking people to use they/them pronouns when I know it's difficult. The idea that my weirdness makes things harder for binary trans people. Worrying I was making myself less attractive and therefore less valuable as a partner.  Feeling broken/defective/different.  People fighting over my right to stay part of the lesbian community. Feeling guilty for wanting the things I did and wondering if I was somehow faking it. Feeling like I shouldn't be making a big deal out of things, that gender wasn't important enough for all this. These hurtful ideas come from both inside and outside the LGBT community, and it adds up. And all of this has come with a lot of doubt that I'm doing the right thing. 

It is hard to feel proud when you're the butt of so many jokes. It's hard to exist with an identity that is difficult to explain. It's also hard to be proud when you aren't sure who you are or where you fit. And when your identity doesn't fit easily into the world. Everything has been a lot harder emotionally than I expected, and then I felt ashamed about that because being confident in being queer was important to me. 

Right now I am slowly building up confidence in who I am and what feels comfortable for me now. I have come along way and I have a long way to go still.

Bonus - [me at pride](http://imgur.com/f7RwShX) yesterday"	"[deleted]
yeah, but now I'm back to confidence. from doubtful queer to confident queer to doubtful /unhappy /confused ??trans to happy nonbinary.

it took several years to settle into place including more than one identity change
I have felt like I'm intruding on trans spaces too, or other times I've felt (or been told) I'm intruding on women's spaces? It's so confusing but at least people in my real life have been really supportive

I think more nonbinary spaces would be a good thing. I was at Philly pride yesterday and I noticed even a really large pride had relatively few nonbinary specific things. I saw a couple flags in a two hour long parade, no specific nonbinary groups or tables at the festival later. I'm sure there were many nonbinary people, but maybe we need to make our presence more seen at stuff like pride
I am slowly becoming confident again too. It's hard to be confident when you aren't sure who you are I think, and this year has definitely been confusing both about who i am and what I want
and that's okay. it takes time to figure out, for sure.

there's no time limit though, and the exploration is interesting in its own way"	bz25x4	NonBinary	30	0.96	2019-06-10 19:29:57
Changed My Gender Identity For the First Time	"Yesterday I changed my gender identity with my university to non-binary and it felt so good! I’m working up to changing it on social media after I tell some people who I think deserve a heads up (like my mom) before seeing it on Facebook. 

I always felt broken and lost because I didn’t know who I was. I felt ashamed because I didn’t make sense even to myself and then I discovered what it meant to be non-binary and a whole new world opened up for me. I’m mostly the same person, just without the shame and confusion.

I’m so happy to be me today!"	"That's so exciting! I'm happy for you :))
That's awesome! I went through the same thing up until last year when I came out as NB, and I've been feeling amazing since. It's like I'm finally comfortable in my own skin! I'm glad you're finally feeling good! Welcome!
Happy for you!! Yay!!"	p2zome	NonBinary	27	0.97	2021-08-12 13:19:59
A really conflicted enby sharing some very gender pictures	"I hope this isn't too annoying, I just wanted to share some pictures I felt really good and affirmed in. I came out only a few months ago and ever since I've started dressing more masculine and taking steps to let go of the shame that I felt growing up as a ""woman"". 

I've always been surrounded by queer/LGBTQ+ friends but I've only ever had two trans friends and neither of them are NB. Ever since I came out to a few of my friends, I've kind of felt a little isolated through this whole process because although my friends are very supportive and my trans friends are obviously very understanding, I still feel alone and like I don't have a community.

It's really nice going through this sub and seeing everyone's lovely faces and their amazing fashion. I'd like to talk to more NB people. Perhaps I'd feel more understood that way...

Anyways! This is just one big blob of nonsense, sorry about the rant, hope you enjoy the pics!"	"You look absolutely fabulous!
Thank you so much!"	z5vtbw	NonBinary	30	1.0	2022-11-27 08:27:51
Does anyone else wish they could just accept being in their AGAB?	"I often find myself feeling a heavy amount of guilt and shame in being in the nonbinary spectrum, aside from it being the ONE thing i have fully accepted and felt some sense of comfort? since a very young age it just made so much sense and connected so much with what i experienced growing up. 

But it has also brought me a lot of insecurity, lots of confusion, and more confusion within my already lack of self identity. Therefore the one thing i felt some identity in was in being Nonbinary. but i oftentimes wish i could just accept my agab and actually perfect it. I hate how damaging of a thought it has become for me, because no matter how “girly” or “feminine” i can look i have never felt connected to any “womanhood” of any sort. I have cried looking at myself and wondering why i look the way i do. Why i don’t look like other girls, or why i couldn’t just simply transition into being a trans man. but that never felt me... and although being in the binary could make things a lot more simple it still doesn’t diminish the experiences that those as trans binary have to go through. so i don’t want to make it seem like being in the binary is life made easier because it is simply just not... But i just mean that for myself personally... being in the gender binary would make it easier to manage the heavy gendered society we are in.

I know that makes me weak. to follow such a het-patriarchy society. It’s so damaging and i don’t know where this is going but i’m so frustrated with gender. with identity. and the lack of acceptance that there is for us still in this society.

I love Nonbinary folks, and in fact wish i was more open in being androgynous and in my identity... but i also know that being Nonbinary is such a diverse spectrum with so many amazing people in it and i hope i can just accept it one day. sorry for the messy rant thank you if you do read this"	"I’m non-binary, and sometimes I wish I was my AGAB. I’m AFAB. It’s so strange because it almost feels like being transfeminine, but in reverse, somehow? 

Like I WANT to be a woman really badly, but at the same time I’m not one. Honestly it’s confusing and makes me a little bit mad at myself.
This doesn't make you weak at all. If you take nothing else away from this, know that you are never weak for your struggles.

It's normal for trans people to feel this way. Before I came out and for the few years after, I would have done anything to be happy as my assigned gender. I prayed and prayed and prayed to any deity that was listening to fix me. I didn't want to be trans, I didn't want to be dysphoric. I wanted to be ""normal"". I hated every second of being trans, despite the support I received. It was hard, it made me feel like a black sheep, and I was torn between suffering alone with an assigned gender I hated or blowing my whole life up to pursue happiness.

I know this won't fix anything and I don't want to come off as too much like a Hallmark card, but i promise that this too shall pass. It does get better with time and I think your saving grace will be sticking in a supportive community. I think you're smart for reaching out and brave for asking for help. I hope time will help you come into your own.
I was crying pretty heavily this week about this: why can’t I just let my life be “easy”? Why do I feel this way?
That is such a perfect way of putting words to it - thank you
I wished that pretty hard from 14-19 and eventually didn't anymore, but it was a lot of work and care and letting go.
Saving to comment for later
I spent most of my life feeling this way, trying to wish myself away. It might be easier in each moment, but there is a deep heaviness carrier within you. It’s a weight that doesn’t dissolve. It doesn’t go away. It eats you away.
omg this is exactly the most accurate way to explain it with how it all feels? super confusing and i feel mad at myself as well... thank you for sharing as it’s somewhat comforting knowing that we aren’t alone in this.
Whoa, this is how I feel.
Thank you so so much, you have no idea how much reading your message brightened up my day, i appreciate you taking the time to write this and share your experiences as well as being so comforting at the same time. 
I too hope it shall pass! and thank you for your radiating energy. Take care <3
i’m so sorry you feel this too. I wish i had those same answers, and if we could make things easy and understand why we feel this way it would eliminate a lot of that burden, it’s always easier said than done when there is so much acceptance and healing that we may need at first.
aw i really appreciate it and i’m glad you think so... you’re not alone <3
i’m glad to hear you were able to overcome it. i can imagine the hard work, time and dedication of letting go. so happy for you!
You're welcome! I read your post and really felt your pain. I remember those dark days and I'll never forget how much having loving people in my life helped me when I felt like other people's opinion was tearing me up. I want nothing more than to pass that love and tenderness on to other people who still carry that weight.

You take care as well, friend! Hit up my DMs if you need anything!

Gender in your 30's, 40's, 50's, and beyond. Some questions.	I discovered my gender at 32, last year. I've gotten a lot of crap from the people in my life, and more than one of them called me immature. Do you ever feel old in certain communities, online or in real life? Was it harder to 'come out' knowing you will be judged for being at a different phase of your life? I don't feel any regret for not discovering it sooner, but i do feel like it's a shame that the language i wanted didn't seem to exist for many years. Was your 'coming out' delayed by age-related feelings?	"I'm 39, just started coming out to family and some friends in the past couple months. I only really reconciled my gender identity about a year ago. Although I was actively questioning for a very long time, internally, I only heard nonbinary being discussed last year and it instantly clicked. Since I'm pansexual and in a ""straight passing"" relationship for 15+ years, I really had no direct interaction with the lgbtq+ community at large, just always ingested a lot of articles, podcasts, blogs and presented as an ally.

Since coming out, I've started actively participating in groups online and irl and I'm usually the oldest person around. I don't think many people would call me immature, since I've been kind reserved and mature (read: child of an abusive addict) since I was little. Being closeted definitely caused me to be less outgoing, confident and noticeably happy, which has changed.

I find a lot of people my age who are coming out (not all, of course) more visibly tend to already have an identity in the lgbt spectrum, so it's often a second coming out. I'm kind of starting from a dead stop, since I've never been out with my sexuality and have never presented anywhere close to androgynous (I'm tall, heavy, round face, hairy). Most of the people in my support group are late 20's and younger, but it's also good to have a variety of experiences in those environments. I did recently come out on my instagram account and almost everyone posting on nb accounts seem to be under 21...and a lot of TERF trolls are way younger too, so their attempts to ""reality check"" me about how life (or say raising children, I have 2) always come off hilariously (or infuriatingly) ignorant and condescending. Those people tend to assume I'm a teen tumblr poster who's never been outside.
I'm 33 and also came out at 32 (hi again!) and yeah honestly this has been one of the most complicated aspects of re-realizing myself as agender. It's complicated in an interesting way, though, because it often doesn't feel all that urgent or relevant in my daily life. Like, I'm pretty insecure about being immature or being read as immature, but no one ever actually has said it to me. So I'm lucky to have this only be a fear in my head, which I acknowledge is different than your situation.

But yes, it's definitely a fear. It's made worse for me because I do typically like weird fashion. I like dressing weird and outlandish. Certain people are always going to judge that, no matter what your gender and age are. Ultimately I see it as part of my larger mission to be my most authentic self. I like being weird and if people are going to read me as weird why am I worrying about it!! haha

For me, being non-binary has been a deepening of my relationship to myself. That's something that has absolutely become easier with age, experience, and healing. I like to say that I discovered emotional maturity at age 28, which sounds funny maybe especially to younger folks, but it's true! That's when I really started feeling like I had a decent grasp on what I was feeling + why + how to communicate it. Through that growth I found a deepening sense of integration within myself, and in retrospect at that point it was only a matter of time and healing till I realized I was agender. So, in that sense, my experience with aging and growth are very much wrapped up with being non-binary.

One thing I've been feeling a lot that I don't think I've expressed to anyone before (!): mourning my queer youth. It feels really sad to me that I didn't realize I was queer until I was 32. Better late than never, but damn. What could have been?
I came out in my early twenties and spent a good decade-plus being told it was an immaturity thing and there were no older genderqueer people (the umbrella word in use at the time) and blah blah blah. There's no getting away from the, ""Oh, grow up already"" reaction, is what I'm saying. You get it at the start, whenever the start is, and then you keep on getting it. It's been ongoing work to see myself as an adult for my contributions and not for having ""settled"" into or for a binary gender.

It IS a shame the language exploration is only really starting to take off. It would have been amazing to have been exposed as a kid to more concepts than ""girly-girl or tomboy?""
I'm 35 (came out at 32/33), and I often feel ""too old"" for NB/GQ spaces. Like several people commenting, I didn't have the words for what I felt until I was older. But I also appreciate the fact that coming out later in life was probably much easier than it would have been when I was in my teens or twenties. I know myself now. I know what I like and don't like. And I'm much less likely to be swayed by trendiness and fads. 
My coming out is delayed due to ""why is it any of your business"" feelings, I guess I would say. But yeah, late 30s, totally feel ""too old"" and had gender revelations a few years back like it sounds like everyone did once an adequate vocabulary emerged for us. It can sometimes lead to imposter syndrome when I'm out at bars around all the beautiful young queer people. 
i am also in my 30s and i think reddit is more populated by teens and twens in general than 30s and beyond. twitter has some older ones( if you look in the right places) 
I live in a really rural area, so the only lgbt+ (or gender variant) support groups are at the local college. I also feel like discovering this part of me now, as opposed to when i was young and confused, has given me a better perspective on it, and much more confidence. Coming out is really tough at any age, but when people see that you have children, they always seem to pile on a special kind of judgement. I see you post all over this sub, and i think you're awesome; i'm really glad to have your input.
Growing up, i knew that i wasn't comfortable being a girl, but i always just assumed that was part of being one. I used the label 'failed girl' for many years. When i first decided to embrace that 'woman' was not in my cards, i still felt pressured to accentuate my feminine side, which i have never really done successfully or comfortably, because my first impression of Enby life was that you are a bit of both. I realize now that i was a bit confused, but it seems to get clearer all the time. I do feel like it plays a big part in my life right now, because the idea is so new, and finding the perfect label is a bit like finding the most comfy sweater and never wanting to take it off. Do you ever feel like people judge your wardrobe because of the stereotype about people over 30 having calmed down? Do you have to shop in the kids/teens section to find things that are suitably colorful? Thank you for being such an awesome part of this group. I always love reading what you have to say.
Tomboy rubs me the wrong way now, but it was all i had back then. 
Exactly. Trends, and the fact that teenagers are total meanies sometimes. 
Oh definitely. Just googling androgynous makes me feel like an outsider. 
Thanks, I'm glad my input is useful to someone. I agree with you about age being an advantage in some ways. I've done a lot of work on myself as a person since I got married, more since I had kids and I don't think I would have had the strength to come out if I had realized this when I was a teenager. There's also much more acceptance and resources now, in general. Don't be too nervous to seek out a group, even if it's more youth focused. I've found it incredibly helpful, even if you just hang out and chat with people who let you be yourself.
Yeah I definitely go for youthful fashion. And it's hard because I'm legit trying to figure out whether I'm having a mid-life crisis, and having a gender crisis is already hard enough! But really I think I'm just excited by clothing in a way that a lot of people in their 30s either don't relate to or don't indulge in. Generally I think it's younger people who are at the forefront of both gender and fashion, and I definitely take inspiration from them on both. 

Ultimately I think this is just another way that I struggle to be my self. I've been learning to own my weirdness in a lot of ways this past year, and this is one aspect I'm still nurturing.
Hahaha... To quote Shakira, ""these hips don't lie"". I can't rock that look in any way but what the world reads as genderfuck or some flavor of dyke. C'est la vie. 

I guess that's another thing that separates me from the younger generation of NB trans identities... I just don't have the energy for very much angst these days. Even the age issue we're discussing is like a ""meh oh well *yawn*"" on a scale of zero to OMG EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE! And not to label anyone a angsty either, that sounds dismissive and insulting. I just know these issues very much used to fill me with what I can look way back on and call angst  now. 
I have, quite simply, all the feelings about this. With an eating disorder in maximum overdrive (counting every single calorie, every day for 18 months), I was 230 lbs at 6ft tall and was probably eating something like 800-1200 calories and walking an 1-2 hours a day. Being petite and the typical version of ""androgynous"" is never going to be in the cards for me, so I settle for just taking care of myself and trying as hard as possible to feel good about the things I can't easily change.
I want to thank you both for sharing all this :)
This entire post was just so i could find people to feel 'meh' with. ""Back in my day, we had dysphoria, and we lived with it!""
I'll be meh with you!

Feminine Enby	"Hi fellow enbys and people who are following this subcategory,

My gender expression is feminine, yet my gender identity is androgynous. I really love the way I look for the first time, but I’m sick of people assigning gender to me and in general, everything. Non-binary allows me to be boundless without restrictions as I see almost everything as gender fluid, unless told otherwise. I only feel safe and understood outside of the cishet world.

Every time I express I’m non-binary, I get tons of hate everyday by cishets saying I’m a girl. They are super rude telling me I can’t be non-binary because it doesn’t exist, how I can’t be enby and feminine, how there’s only two genders, and overall limiting my identity. It makes me cringe as I would never say these things to someone and wondering how humans and strangers can treat each other so awful.

I just know no one has to look gender neutral to be non-binary. In general, trans people don’t have to look passing to be trans. I have learned gender is how you feel, not how you look, and I feel amazing. I don’t feel entirely woman or man, I’m both, but people have a huge problem whenever I show off my body. They project and limit me into one binary. It’s exhausting me cause for the first time, I love my body!! I don’t need to be shamed for it and I don’t want to hide it any longer. I also am only into femmes, so I love the way I present. I really need support and if anyone relates, that will be so appreciated. I’m done being invalidated and shamed. Thank you if you read this."	"Thanks for your post. It’s a binary world, to be sure. I feel my way through my enby/fem nature everyday with delight, excited for what will happen next. I don’t think other people are doing this....

People want to play rules of the scripts they’ve been given but biologically at least 10% and up to 35% of us don’t fit those traditional scripts. So eggs change the script, and there is a whole new world of diversity to explore. Keep being your beautiful genuine self.
if femboys are still boys and butch women are still butch women, then non-androgynous non-binary people are still non-binary

gender =/= gender expression shouldn’t be so hard for people to understand
Thanks for posting, this made me smile :)
same :(
Thank you soo much, I needed this!!"	gcc795	NonBinary	25	1.0	2020-05-02 19:23:29
I can’t shake the fear that I’m just a “trender” who’s doing it for attention at times.	"I’m 16 AFAB and I’m questioning my gender, mostly leaning NB/transmasc? I’ve been questioning for maybe like just over half a year, but recently it’s been really eating me up. Every time I reach a conclusion, thinking “yep, I’m not cis”, I always end up doubting myself, wondering if I’ve just made everything up and that I’m not *really* non binary, and that I’m “just a cis girl who’s making it up for attention”. Sometimes my irrational mind seems convinced that I’ve made it all up, and that the discomfort I feel with my chest and pronouns is not real, simply because it doesn’t upset me really badly and I hadn’t noticed it before. Even though I relate to a lot of descriptions I’ve seen of chest dysphoria, I repeatedly convince myself that it’s not real.

The idea of questioning then realising that I was cis all along feels almost shameful to me, even though I know that it really shouldn’t, and that questioning is fine. I hold a bit of internalised transphobia (which leads to my belief that I’m just a “trender”). I want to know how to overcome this fear, and be more sure with my identity, as it’s the only thing holding me back from trying other things (like binding mainly)."	"okay, so a few things!

1. cis people don't typically wonder ""am i trans?""
2. your gender is allowed to change. many people don't have a constant, underlying gender, it's just whatever it happens to be that day/month/year.
3. what's the point of questioning if only one answer is acceptable? you're absolutely allowed to ask ""am i trans?"" and figure out that you're not
4. gender is make-believe, do what you want
[deleted]
I kinda thought the same, mainly as in the sport I play, generally, non-male players (fmale, trans, nb) get more field time, and my mum always joked about me just saying I was nb to play more.

So at first I thought maybe this is what I was doing. But i havent played since I 'discovered' my gender a month or so ago, and I still feel the same.

And, if you are willingly wanting to go through all the BS that comes with being non-cis, then, imo, you are whatever you think you are. 
You are nb for the right reasons, if you know what I mean.
So i reallyyyyyyy don’t think “trenders” are a thing. Or it’s like 3 people in the entire earth. That’s not to say that identities can’t shift. It’s possible that 5 years from now you’ll identify as a cis woman (I would guess unlikely, but possible). It’s slightly more likely that in 5 years you’ll just care less about your identity, whatever it is. But either way, that doesn’t make you not trans now. So unless you’re doing it purely for attention, knowingly faking it, you are not a trender

Also I’m 8 months on T and pass as a dude daily and my mental health is 1000 times better than pre T but sometimes I have a moment of panic like WHAT IF THIS ISNT WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING. And then I read my old journals and remember how much better I feel now than pre T :) 
I've been out for three years and I still ask myself that sometimes. Chances are though that if you have to ask yourself and don't know the answer, you're probably not. Even if you're questioning and it turns out you're cis, that doesn't mean you were ""trending"". It means you were exploring your identity which is fine and good and probably everybody should do it. 
This is the most relatable thing, jfc. I’ve been questioning for years now, probably ever since I hit puberty and got a bunch of curves I wasn’t sure I wanted. Some days I feel cute and wear tight clothing and love them, some days all I wear is oversized flannel so I don’t have to see them.

It tough when you both love and hate your body. It’s real tough when you HAVEN’T known since the day you came out of the womb, which is what a lot of trans stories are (which are completely valid btw, but it’s not every body!!!).

I struggled with thinking maybe I was fluid, maybe I’m FTM, maybe I’m an enby, and maybe I’m making this all up because I want to be part of something I’m not. Only after years of that (and I still have my moments) did I realize that cis people don’t go through that to that level. They don’t have dysphoria, they don’t freak out about their internalized transphobia, and they don’t come looking for subs like this just to find a place to belong.

Sure, cis people can question and explore gender, but more often than not, it’s just part of trans culture to question yourself 24/7 (very very sadly).

r/egg_irl helped me a lot in convincing me that I’m not cis and that my experiences are valid, even if they aren’t the norm. You got this, love. I’m here if you ever want to talk :)
I wish that this bigoted concept of ""transtrenders"" didn't exist, because I think it causes way more self hatred, dysphoria and confusion in people than would even typically exist. There are liars, people who are intentionally deceiving others or manipulating people for various reasons, mostly online and not in person...and that's it. There are people like this for almost every group and they spin really disingenuous and manipulative narratives to excuse their behavior when caught (people pretending to be ill, disabled, different races, various types of predators, etc.). People who are seriously questioning and all but sure they're transgender, emotional and mentally in turmoil over it...aren't riding a trend. There's nothing fun about it, there's nothing to be gained...the biggest ""trends"" surround trans teens are abuse, harassment, homelessness and suicide. You should be able to question on your own terms and come to your own conclusions, without having to worry about being a fraud (which most people feel when they're young, regardless of gender and orientation), because a bunch of people told you that there are fake people out there who just want attention. If those people are real...they are not delusional, they're predatory...so if you're not intentionally faking, you're not a faker. It's ok to question, to explore and to be unsure. Just don't beat yourself up, be kind to yourself and give yourself a judgement free zone to figure it out and be ok with whatever answer you come up with. 

&#x200B;

There's nothing wrong with questioning and determining that you're not transgender, I don't think we should keep telling people ""cis people don't question their gender!"", because that might have been mostly true in the past, but in a perfect world EVERYONE should be able to do that and come to whatever conclusion is accurate, without assuming the natural default state is cisgender (and straight and so on) and everything else is an exception or deviation that people need to figure out. Cis people didn't used to question if they were trans, because they had zero awareness of it, then it was considered taboo and degenerate, then it was considered a rare aberration that they would somehow know about themselves from birth and be binary and have a clear and overwhelming urge to be a perfect stereotype of that gender. Now at the point where 4 year olds know what transgender and nonbinary means (mine does and knows about pronouns and presentation not equating to gender) and we understand that not everyone experiences figuring out they're transgender in the same way (because presentation and expression isn't uniform across every gender, so childhood preferences don't always betray ""true gender""), shouldn't everyone be asking themselves what their gender is and how they know it at the ages they can fully grasp the concepts and examine their own feelings about it?

&#x200B;

Just one last thing. It's ok if you don't know exactly what you're feeling. When you're questioning or repressed or any of that...it can be hard to even recognize what your feelings are. It takes time to figure that stuff out, even after you have answers and are sure of yourself. I'm middle aged and I still find myself unpacking things I did and felt when I was a teenager, in my 20's, even my 30's, that I only now realize were gender dysphoria or some coping mechanism or thing I totally didn't recognize even after coming out. If you asked me when I was 25 if I had gender dysphoria, I could have emphatically said no...but I didn't understand what that really meant then and I didn't even realize how many walls I had built up to make sure I wouldn't feel those things as much as possible. It took a long time to identify that and start undoing it.
Thank you! I’ll keep this in mind ❤️
You’re right about both things. The issue is that my parents see it mostly as a trend and that there are only a few “valid” trans people, so a lot of those beliefs have caused me to have some internalised transphobia. It sucks that being nb especially is seen as “trendy” by some people when really we all just wanna live our lives u_u
Thank you. The second point is especially something that I need to keep in mind. If I was doing it for “attention”, I definitely would be conscious of it.
Thank you. I know that “transtrenders” are pretty much nonexistent, but the coverage the concept gets has seeped into my insecurities.
i wanna add: you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans, and you definitely don't need to feel dysphoria ~before~ you start questioning. I didn't experience any until after I came out at 25.
Ah yes because it's trendy and cool to be in a demographic with the highest suicide rate in the US and a high murder rate as well. It's so hip to be bullied and discriminated against everywhere you go. 

Let's be real, the only people who think someone is cool for being trans is other trans people. And then it's like ""lit you're one of us"" not ""omg you're so cool and awesome"". 

Those people are either misinformed or lying to themselves. Don't listen to them. To be out and proud in a world that doesn't want us to exist isn't ""trendy"". It's brave. "	afygt3	NonBinary	25	0.88	2019-01-14 18:05:28
Feeling shame of letting people gender me wrongly	"I have been identifying as (AFAB) nonbinary for couple of years now, first as demigirl, but after some thinking I realized I'm actually more nonbinary/neutrois. Well, lately I have been feeling extremely dysphoric when people gender me as female. When I came out to my friends, I told them that I was okay with any gendering (I'm from finland and we only have one pronouns, but there are some terms that are more masc/fem/neutral) and at the time I actually was okay with any gendered word. But lately I have been more dysphoric when gendered/referred as girl and it bothers me since I'm scared to tell them about my dysphoric feelings. I'm scared that they will call me a special snowflake or I would ask them too much for not gendering me as female or male. 

Has anybody had same kind of feelings? And if you have had, what did you? I take amy advice gladly. "	"I can really recognize the feeling of shame when you have to constantly correct. Especially when maybe being non-binary can be so much more suttle than binary genders.
But the only answer I have which is maybe a little boring is that if your friends ridicule your identity then they wouldn't be great friends would they? See it as weeding out. If they respond with being douchebags then fuck them. They wouldn't have been good to you in the end anyway.
I have also felt a lot of shame regarding not correcting people when they don't use the correct pronouns for me. In some cases, it can't really be helped. For example, my workplace is not at all progressive in terms of gender and sexuality, so as much as it disappoints me, coming out is not really an option.

If I tell someone who is considered a friend or personal relationship, I correct them to begin with (it can be difficult if you've known someone for a while, so I do have sympathy), but if it keeps happening, I basically step out of the relationship. Sometimes I regret that I don't confront people about this stuff directly.

But at the end of the day, you're not the one who should feel ashamed for not calling people out. Anyone who has a sense of respect for fellow humans is not going to judge you. Seeing a situation where someone is constantly misgendering someone else, it should be (and often is) obvious who is at fault there.

Don't feel bad about yourself. Yes, it's great to stick up for yourself in this context and I have a lot of respect for people who do, but at the end of the day, you're not the one who is being a jerk.
That's not a boring answer it's very good actually, thank you! I have abandonment issues, so sometimes I try to keep close to me even if they are not that good friends for me. I will try to remember your advice.
Thank you so much for your kind words! And you are right, it's not always my fault if people misgender me. And I will try to remember not to feel bad for myself. "	8653f4	NonBinary	26	1.0	2018-03-21 19:38:46
Nonbinary Shame	"Idk if anyone's posted about this before as I'm new to reddit and have yet to work out what I'm doing. Recently, I've finally been able to (somewhat) accept myself as nonbinary. For years, I have identified as a trans man as I was filled with shame and self-doubt about being nonbinary. Like, I felt like I would be an inconvenience to those around me if I were to identify in that way as it's ""confusing"" and ""they/them pronouns are hard"" kinda stuff. So from the ages of 15-19 I have identified as a binary trans man. I knew when I was 15 that I was nonbinary but thought it would be impossible to be accepted that way. Even now, I feel a deep sense of shame about my identity, and almost feel like I have to apologise for it and it's the main thing that's stopping me from coming out. Does/has anyone else feel this way?"	"I always feel the need to apologize to people about my pronouns, though I know that's silly. But yes, I feel that shame of having a non binary identity. But I'm working on that.
I'm going through these same feelings right now. I've thought i was genderfluid for a while now and have just recently accepted that i'm nonbinary. Now that I'm seriously considering HRT, i can't stop feeling like an inconvenience to others. The biggest thing holding me back from taking T is how it will be taken by my coworkers. I don't have the backbone to call someone out for misgendering me, but at the same time not calling it out feels makes me feel like i'm just a fake. I've always been invisible / forgettable / ignorable but once i start to look more masculine there are going to be people who notice and talk about me and probably get uncomfortable around me. And it isn't just work that I'm worried about. Although i don't see my extended family very often, I'll still basically have to come out to them due to holiday gatherings and such. I don't want to have to explain myself to all these people and i don't want to have to be the one that answers all their questions and basically ""educates"" them on what being nonbinary means. I jist wanna be happy with myself and not be treated differently because of that.
I feel like what I want skews nonbinary transmasculine, but I'm AFAB, and part of my brain keeps trying to convince me that as long as ""woman"" doesn't feel completely and definitively *wrong*, shouldn't I just put up with it, *all the time,* from *everyone*, so as to not be inconvenient or demanding?  It's like my brain keeps trying to bargain me down to the smallest and least disruptive gender options so as to not inconvenience anyone else.
Yes. Just like me, you have internalised transphobia. It is hard, but for me the only way forward was to let go of my self-criticism and shame, and learn to never, ever apologise for being myself. Just keep cool and be matter-of-fact: ""I am nonbinary and use [x]/[y] pronouns.""

I go out of my way to learn how to correctly pronounce unusual or non-English names. Everyone should. Learning pronouns is no harder and just common courtesy. By sharing your pronouns with someone, you are not imposing on them: you are including them in your life.
Yes! I thought I was a binary trans woman for a long time, but recently I’ve realized I’m more comfortable as trans femme non-binary. I still have a lot of dysphoria surrounding certain aspects of my identity and person, but thus far HRT has been wonderful at helping me cope with a lot those things.
Anyone who makes you feel ashamed about your identity is not worth much, let alone pretending to be someone you're not. Be proud of yourself, it's beautiful.
I was questioning whether I was even non-binary almost a week ago. It can be hard to feel comfortable with yourself when you’re grappling with these feelings.

So glad you’re starting to feel better. Good luck!

This is... too relatable :( I just want to live my life comfortably without my existence bothering/angering anyone, is that so much to ask?
oh look it’s in words

That... makes so much sense the way you explained that. Thank you!

Feeling of shame, thinking maybe I’m not really non-binary? AMAB	I recently came out of my friends and family that I’m non-binary, it made me really happy and I got approved from Estradiol hrt. But, I’m feeling really intense shame all the time. I think maybe because I don’t have gender dysphoria, I feel guilty. I don’t know what to do, has this happened to anyone else?	"I think these feelings are publicly engrained or common to culture, like viscerally we feel ashamed of transgressing assigned gender roles. What seems trivial can bring up sooo much background stuff. Stick with it! When I first came out to anyone I felt a huge rush of guilt and self hatred and went back into the closet, and I really regret it now, it feels way better to take a step, and another little step, and try to bare with things and be kind to yourself. There's so much else it could be and don't be afraid to ask questions! Hope this helps you
My heart goes out to you, friend. That feeling sucks and we've all been there. You are valid and loved.
The most important marker for someone being something other than cis (trans, enby...) isn't actually gender dysphoria, but rather gender euphoria. The happiness that comes from presenting the way you want or the idea of being able to have the body you want to have someday.
Tbh, when I was just coming out I spent a long time debating this but eventually I came to the conclusion that I want to be Non Binary. So I decided to be. And who can say that isn't valid?
Being non binary is being free. I wish you well on your journey
You don’t have to hate the bits you were born with in order to be a gender that is not the one you were given. Your way counts just as much as anyone else’s. 

Plenty of good stuff about the shame and all that already here. Just wanted to affirm ^^^.
Offer a CIS person HRT and watch them recoil in terror, the fact that you have taken this awesome step is pretty strong evidence you're not faking it. Truth be told I deal with this a lot myself, but getting positive affirmations from others really seems to help
Hang in there. Have you heard of ""impostor syndrome?"" Basically you don't feel like you're *good enough* in a situation. Could be work, could be not being ""non-binary enough"" (that's not actually a thing LOL).

Most of us here likely feel.or have felt exactly the same way. Happy to chat if you like.
Murky Asparagus summed it up nicely for me. Be kind to yourself. Your experience and expression counts just as much as everyone else’s.
I don’t know if this will help but I felt a reduction in gender dysphoria when I acknowledged to myself that I am genderfluid. I don’t experience much in the way of gender dysphoria, and that doesn’t make me any less enby. It doesn’t make you any less enby either.
This really does help, thank you so much. I guess it really does feel like failed to live up to gender expectations. I know I shouldn’t feel guilt around that, but I’ll try to be strong and push through.
Thank you so much for your kind words.
Thank you!
Yeah, this community has been really supportive. I’m glad to have the love :)
I'm an amab person too, it takes AWHILE, male socialization toxicity is real and deep set. It's ok to feel whatever your feeling! Just remember to feel through.

summer is coming up and i don't wanna shave!	"this past summer i experimented with not shaving my armpits and that turned out fine. i wanna continue the trend this upcoming summer with my legs BUT! as an afab, racially ambiguous person, i'm so so insecure about my dark leg hair. i've gotten negative comments from kids in school growing up, my family, and my friends that have all led me to believe it's shameful or gross to leave them unshaved... and left me terrified of facing the same or worse comments, even though i wholeheartedly support afab people who don't/don't think it's gross on them.

i so badly want to be able to let go of this insecurity and say ""fuck it, i'm gonna wear cute shorts with unshaved, dark hair legs!"" but i'm so terrified! but i don't wanna wear jeans or long skirts all summer! ugh!! the cognitive dissonance is killing me!!!

anyway thanks for reading"	"Haven't shaved my legs or armpits in years...at first my friends and family were judgy, making comments, etc, you have to remember it's new to them. My mom especially was hung up on it, told me it was gross for almost two years, which is hard to hear but whatever I'm an adult.
Now, she doesn't say anything, no one says anything, I don't even think about it. I wear whatever I want: shorts, skirts, tank tops, and I forget to worry about it, forget that people might expect different, and for the most part it's no big deal at all.
You do you! Whatever fleeting thought someone else has about you is inconsequential 
I used to go out with a friend who didn't shave. I found that refreshing. She made a point of telling me as if that could be a dealbreaker for some guys. I couldn't believe it mattered to people. For me, the more comfortable she was with herself the better.

Conversely, now that I know I'm NB, I feel I should wax my legs to feel comfortable in shirts, skirt or dress. I thought my friend would be critical of it and that made me think it twice. Now I'm decided: once I'm back from vacations, I'll wax.

In both cases, the moral of the story is: Do what works for you. Those who care about it, probably don't care about you.
I am so glad you brought this up because I've been having the EXACT same problem. I'm an AFAB Indian person with dark thick black leg and body hair. I also got a lot of disparaging comments growing up about the body hair and I've been shaving ever since. I never shave in the winter, and over the past few years, I've gotten more and more lax about stubble in the summer. Earlier this winter, I looked at my fully grown out leg hair and realized that I freaking loved it. I've always followed this pattern of wearing pants in the spring until I absolutely can't anymore and then I shave so I can put on shorts. Then when fall comes around, I immediately put on pants again as soon as I can. Enough of this bullshit. I want to wear whatever clothes I want to wear while still keeping my body how I like it. I am honestly pretty scared about how other people will react. I hope I'll stand my ground on this one.

i think i'm gonna try to get some support from the people i know i can rely on and try to find the courage. start small, like being with those trusted people and like, wear a skirt or shorts with my hairy legs! then maybe i'll feel okay to go out I public, you know?

Told my partner I think I’m nonbinary	"So a little background. I (30AMAB) have been dating my partner (30F) for 11 years and we’ve been married for 5 years. She’s my best friends, and I love her so freaking much. About 2 years ago we both (independently) came to the conclusion that we are both queer. We are both attracted to all people, gender doesn’t play a role in that attraction. I love that we can share that. For me personally, as Ive come to that realization about my sexuality, I’ve also been exploring how I express my gender (I was raised Mormon and very conservatively so it’s taken a while to really “find myself”). My partner has been more than completely supportive of me exploring how I express myself. 
As a part of that I’ve been contemplating my own gender identity, lurking this subreddit for months alongside separate research and self reflection. I eventually told my partner that I think I’m nonbinary. (I haven’t told anyone else) That at the very least I think I want to explore using He/They pronouns. I honestly (probably naively) anticipated full support, much like the support I’ve gotten through the rest of this “journey,” but that’s not really what I got so it really took me off guard. She expressed questions as to why I feel that way, confusion as to why I would think that’s necessary, and reservation’s with how this would change our dynamic. For me I don’t feel like it changes anything as far as our dynamic goes except for a change in vocabulary. I think she feels like it will be hard to think of me different when she’s been with a “man” for 11 years which I completely understand. I think she’s scared/nervous to have to voice that shift to friends and family and scared of feeling judged by me if she slips up. I tried to reassure her that I understand and I don’t want to shame or judge people and that I won’t be upset if anyone still addresses me as a man. That that’s still okay, I just would prefer they/them. 
She’s since said she’s willing to try and see how she feels about it. She appreciates me telling her and she supports me being true to myself but has to be honest in the fact that she doesn’t know how she will feel later on. I get it. It’s been almost a week since we had the conversation and neither of us have brought it up at all. We’ve just continued our normal routine. I’m feeling really lost, constantly worried at any day she’s going to decide she’s not into me anymore. The whole thing honestly left a bad taste in my mouth and I kinda feel resolved in just not bringing it up again and pretending it never happened. Like it’s not worth possibly losing my partner over because I love her. Sorry to ramble, I guess I’m just looking for advice on where to go from here?"	"I came out to my partner a month ago and it left me with similar feelings. All the quoted parts are exactly what I went through.

> ""I eventually told my partner that I think I'm nonbinary. (I haven't told anyone else) That at the very least I think I want to explore using He/They pronouns. I honestly (probably naively) anticipated full support, much like the support I've gotten through the rest of this ""journey,"" but that's not really what I got so it really took me off guard.""

At first I was really offended that my partner would react with scrutiny at all. But I think both of ours are just afraid of change. They might be insecure in their ability to adapt to it. I don't know that for sure, it's just a possibility.

Maybe they want life to stay the same as it always has. But that's impossible. People are always changing over time, and you will eventually both be very different than when you first dated. 

> ""I think she feels like it will be hard to think of me different when she's been with a 'man' for 11 years which I completely understand.""

Yup, mine said this sentence almost verbatim. 

> ""She expressed... reservations with how this would change our dynamic. For me I don't feel like it changes anything as far as our dynamic goes except for a change in vocabulary.""

Same here. I think my partner was afraid that change would be instant, that everything would be different all at once and I would simply be ""nonbinary"" because I felt like it. I had to reiterate countless times that no, I'm not starting hormones and getting surgery next week (and even if I was, that'd be a whole other conversation). It took a week of hellish dismissive one-sentence answers before they finally properly talked to me again. 

It's okay if they don't know how they will see you in the future—NOBODY truly knows that. But what's important is if they can be here for you right now, and you can both talk it out and understand each other, even if it takes some time.

> ""We've just continued our normal routine. I'm feeling really lost, constantly worried at any day that she's going to decide she's not into me anymore. The whole thing honestly left a bad taste in my mouth and I kinda feel resolved in just not bringing it up again and pretending it never happened. Like it's not worth possibly losing my partner over because I love her.""

Here's an exercise for you.

Imagine you died today, seen by the eyes of the world only as you are right now. 

Write your eulogy.

Do you feel like it reflects who you truly are?

I realized it didn't for me. I had a lot of things I wanted to try and I had barely dared to start on any of them. I was not living authentically, I was living how people wanted me to live. So I started experimenting in small ways, and I have never felt happier and more myself in all my life.

You deserve love. You deserve acceptance. It is stupid to contribute to a relationship where you both pretend nothing has changed—things have. And you can navigate that change together. But don't force yourself to stay the same just because being non-binary may make your partner uncomfortable. YOU are the only person in the entire world that you are 100% going to be with until the end. Be the person that makes you happy to live. And if your partner can't accept that, decides she has lost feelings, so be it. It's not worth the pain and disrespect to pretend to be someone you are not.

I really do hope you both can be happy together. Good luck, and be safe.
This isn’t going to be very helpful but my NB ex encouraged me to explore and when I came out to them as agender they lost interest sexually and we broke up 2 months later. I do think change is just a lot more for people to handle in reality than when it’s hypothetical. That was about a year and a half ago, I was really upset about it for a while and even leaned back into being masc for a while. Ultimately I came back around and came out publicly about a month ago. Still figuring it all out but I do feel very liberated. I hope you don’t have to lose a relationship to be your true self like I did, but just know that you coming to love and accept yourself will ultimately be better for you than someone else’s approval. I really hope she comes around though. Take care
Ugh, you’re so right. I’m going to agree that I think her biggest reservation is coming from a place of not wanting to change. I’ve literally always felt like I’m not being my authentic self, I’m finally trying to change that and I shouldn’t put a stop to that now. It honestly feels so good to hear someone else going through a very similar situation (though I’m sorry you’re going through it too lol). I hope things ended up working out for you?

Thank you for taking the time, much love!
I hear you; it honestly feels good to hear that someone else is dealing with the same thing.

It took my partner time to process that I will not always remain the same. He avoided talking regularly to me for an entire week in a LDR, so I reached out to friends for advice, and I eventually broke down sobbing in front of his family. Their support (mostly my friends) really helped me get my shit together. I felt like I could live without him, and at the same time, I realized that I didn't want to.

Once we actually talked, he recognized that I wasn't changing overnight. We talked about concerns on each of our sides, focusing on feelings and the near future. We asked each other questions and had several tense but insightful conversations.

He's into astronomy, so I used a lot of space metaphors to get through to him specifically (example: ""The sun's gonna explode in a few billion years, so why do we even study and enjoy it now?""). I wanted him to trust me enough to live with me in the present, rather than live with me always.

Last month was a mess, but things are WAY better now than before. He's back for the holidays and we're chillin' as usual (of course, with me sending him more non-binary memes). I definitely feel more secure knowing there are people I can turn to for help. I think you will be okay too. :)"	zquv12	NonBinary	22	0.91	2022-12-20 17:54:14
“nonbinary skepticism” is destroying my well-being. [long]	"sorry there’s so much to unpack here. I’m a bit of a mess at the moment and need somewhere to get it all out. tldr @ end

so, semi-positivity first. I just bought my first actual GC2B binder, with my own money, and I can expect to have it in a minimum of about two days. yay, me! but just like when I got my shitty Amazon binder off a friend of a friend of a friend, I’m suddenly hit with this overwhelming feeling of “oh my god, transitioning is a thing I can do outside of my imagination???” and it’s just so much that it’s making me nervous. but, hopefully it’ll arrive in good condition, and it’ll fit. so I have that to look forward to beyond everything else that’s dragging me down. 😌

now onto the big bad. I’m beginning to have a much harder time embracing my nonbinary identity, and presently it’s not regular flavored transphobes I have to blame for once. if you’d like me to go into specifics I like the terms transmasc and androgyne but according to the LGBT spaces I’ve encountered more and more of online,  androgyne is ACTUALLY (/s) a “”special snowflake term”” and it’s acceptable to shame me for using it 🤨 doesn’t matter that the word’s been around for ages. apparently I make the community look like a joke by using the word. sure I might not actually be out as androgyne specifically, bUt iM sTiLL a JoKe bcus logic 😌

also, apparently it’s acceptable to be “enby skeptics” which basically just amounts to someone not believing being nonbinary is possible (because...something about brain structure and how it relates to gender?? who in blue hell actually goes as far as checking brain structure of all things when it comes to gender stuff...anyway.) but still pretending to respect nonbinary people for those sweet, sweet woke points. there are so so many of those people floating around (some of them even go to my school! it’s so fun! /s) and it’s honestly got me worried. especially because a lot of them seem to be eighteen or younger and are super quick to dismiss the words and experiences shared by older nonbinary people. maybe they’ll grow out of it, maybe not...but more and more people are speaking out about their “nonbinary skepticism” and it’s. bad.

does anyone else have experiences in dealing with these sorts of people?? they’re like regular transphobes but Big Brained and Woke(TM) /s and it’s getting on my nerves because I don’t know how to deal. I have a small circle of people who look up to me on Instagram specifically where that crap seems to be the most heavily concentrated and it’s getting stressful having to stay strong through the onslaught of people bitching to me about how I’m oh so clearly faking my identity for oppression points. advice on coping is appreciated, or even just sharing experiences w these sorts of people. I’d like some reassurance that I’m not alone in dealing with this fuckery in the one place I’m supposed to feel supported when real life falls through.  I want to be a good role model and an inspiration to fellow LGBTQ people but now I’m questioning whether or not I should even let myself be visible at all...

tl;dr: enby skeptics r annoying as hell and even with small things to help affirm my gender it’s getting hard to stay positive at the moment ://"	"There's LGBT people out there who seem to think that if they kiss up to cishet people by disowning anyone who they deem to be more out there than themselves, cishets will think they're reasonable and acceptable. They're wrong. They're buying into the kind of thinking that is used to harm all LGBT people, including themselves.

You deserve to be around people who support and respect you instead of throwing you under the bus.
I haven’t found a reliable correlation between gender philosophy and overall placement on the spectrum from idiot to genius. Sounds like the skepticism you describe is a fairly standard stripe of modern idiocy—“only what I understand is real.” Sounds really boring, leaving those people behind is smart
Theyre going to be on the wrong side of history.

Also, that sounds like straight up online bullying! Can you block them?
Whenever any ""skeptical"" person mutters something about ""brain structure"", you'll notice that they never get into any details explaining how it has been ""proved"" that there are precise neural signatures that are known (in advance) to be the ""true"" underlying hallmarks of ""maleness"" and ""femaleness"", and that every brain is strictly and irreversibly configured to operate according to one of these models for the rest of eternity (this configuration is apparently so strong that it can never be broken, but simultaneously so weak that one's faith in it can be undermined by reading tumblr). They just allude vaguely to some research that has been simplistically relayed to them at third-hand, and that has been interpreted in the light of underlying dogmas (and then treated as though it proves the fundamental correctness of those dogmas).
Like, you got cis people that say they don't think you can be anything but the binary and can't cross it, and then there's people that think you can be trans but not nonbinary, and then you've got nonbinary people that reckon that some types of nonbinary aren't acceptable? 

Like, if you've found a word that you like for your gender and your experience then use it, people are a bit of a nob if they're policing the language you use to define yourself. I've seen people online who despise the word dyke or hate the word queer but those are slurs that are being reclaimed. If the criticism is that it sounds snowflakey, or like some made up thing from tumblr (legit got that response from someone when I told them I was agender) then that's sorta when you know you're not gonna get much out of em.
Trueee. It’s especially bad with cis gays. I recently found out a former friend of mine has literally made her career “fighting for lesbian rights” by doing everything she can to prevent trans and NB people from gaining any.
It’s not a matter of intellect as it relates to gender identity they’re pushing. What I’m getting is they believe the physical structure of the brain (like,, grey patter deposits and shit?) determines your gender and use this to justify ideas like gender fluidity being impossible because brain structure doesn’t just spontaneously change...there’s so much more and it’s all so bad but that’s the best and quickest way I can describe it.
Yeah, I’m gonna start doing that. Thanks.
Very true 🤨 
really makes you go hmmmm don’t it
One indicator of intellect is the ability to discern when models represent reality and when they don’t. I’m saying these people are dumb and have found superstition that agrees with them. The exact details change person to person.
Big agree. This makes literally no sense. You can't just make up a fact about the physical structure of the brain without any evidence lol. Where is the evidence for the beliefs these people are stating? Can they cite research that shows every person's brain looks one way or the other by gender? Because afiak there's no existing model for the gender of the brain, just some nascent models on *correlations* between gender and brain structure. 

I like to think about it in this simple way: Physical, biological sex is supposed to be simpler than gender, correct? Yet sex is not binary! There are 4+ dimensions: chromosomes; hormones; primary and secondary sex characteristics; reproductive sex... and while most people fall neatly on one side of the bimodal distribution, something like 2% of people fall outside of it some way (That's the same as the percentage of red-haired people in the world). Now how can you say that gender, which is so much more complicated as it's psychological and sociological, is more binary than sex? Again maybe it's a small percentage, but if that percentage is anything smaller than 2%, that seems totally reasonable."	ej99cz	NonBinary	22	0.92	2020-01-03 03:12:16

Worried I'm too old to be questioning	"I'm AFAB, in my mid-thirties, and I think I may be non-binary. Is it too late for me to be questioning? I'm worried that the people around me won't take it seriously.

Background info:

I was uncomfortable with female pronouns as a kid and never felt comfortable around other girls, but I wasn't ""one of the boys"" by any stretch -- mainly I was just a shy weird loner who was bullied a lot for being ""ugly"" and was never fully accepted by boys or by girls, so I attributed my pronoun issue to that. 

During puberty I felt humiliated by the changes happening to my body, but I chalked that up to having parents who instilled me with unnecessary shame about my body, sex, etc., and isn't it kind of normal to feel that way during puberty?

Around college and into my twenties I learned how to present myself in a more femme way. Makeup, hair, nail polish, clothes. A couple of times I had butch phases, but they passed.

(Through all of this, I've been queer, but closeted, and at times in severe denial. Few people in my life know that I am not straight, and at the moment I don't see that changing.)

Almost a couple of years ago I had a partial breast reduction -- partial because only one breast was made smaller, in order to correct a pretty significant asymmetry. Ever since then, I have been happier with my body and have been gradually becoming more neutral/masculine in my gender presentation. I never even realized how much the larger breast had been holding me back until it was shrunken down to size. I sometimes wish I'd just gotten full top surgery because I hate having breasts some days, even though they're small and easy to hide. 

The other night, I was looking at myself in the mirror and I thought, holy shit: could I be both a woman and a man? Neither? Something in between?

Thanks for reading this far. Does any of this make sense? I'm not really sure what to do with the feelings I'm having. But I thought I needed to reach out."	"Welcome!

I'm not up for a full response right now but I just want to let you know that /r/ftmover30 exists and you may find AFAB/FTM/NB community and experiences there.  You are not too old, never.  Easy for me to say as a 20-year-old but it's true and I'm pointing you to the experts. ;)
Want to start out by saying no one is too old for questioning. I think probably there are people of every age who only started to question their experience of gender recently because information about gender and being trans is becoming much more accessible and widespread in recent history. You're definitely not too old to explore what makes you feel good, and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.

What you're experiencing sounds totally valid, and it's completely possible that you're nonbinary. No one can tell you for sure one way or the other except yourself, but it sounds to me like exploring your options might feel good for you. When I was questioning (which, in a way, is still an ongoing process) I spent a lot of time reading about other people's experiences, and trying out any gender affirming stuff that sounded good to me. There's lots of information & stories out there, & a lot of different ways  to shape your gender expression into a way that feels best for you. The only right or wrong is what feels right or wrong for you. 
If you're too old for questioning, then I guess I'm in big trouble.  I didn't figure out my non-binary, third gender identity until I was 48 years old.  I went on estrogen and had my orchiectomy just before my 49th birthday.  Pretty damn happy about it, two years later!  :)
hey, welcome! You're 100% NOT too old! Don't blame yourself for anything, society is just fucked up not giving people the freedom to explore and express themselves. I can feel that you went through a lot and I'm happy you're reaching out. I'm 26 and I know some trans folks who came out in their thirties.

As you're worried that people won't take you seriously. This can happen as nb isn't taken seriously often. Teens are told ""it's just a phase in puberty"" so I think it can happen at any age, sadly.

To me, all of what you wrote makes sense. Even though my biography is different in most ways. But I know these mirror moments and I think there're many references to not being cis in your past.

Reddit subs are really helpful for me and I wish they're the same for you.


never too old! society pushes us into these boxes consistently our whole lives so its no surprise than many don't realize things until later! I identify with a ton of your point here! (im 26 AFAB)
I also would note its great to have 'older' folks aka 25+ even be seen as NB or even questioning because then it doesn't seem so 'youth centered' ! best of luck and if ya ever wanna chat shoot me a DM! 
and feel free to PM :)
This totally makes sense!

I'm about to turn 35 and I've just now come out to a small group of people as being genderqueer/transfeminine.  I can also trace my issues with my societally assigned gender back to childhood and have always had an issue with masculinity, relating to other men, looking masculine, etc.  Despite the fact that I've had decades of experience roleplaying as a woman online, being a LGBTQ+ ally, etc., I still sometimes feel like I'm a fake or something.  Or like I'm making it all up or something.  And I also know that is bullshit.

So yeah, you're never too old to try to live the life you want to live.  You should keep exploring how you want to present gender and who you want to be.  I have a lovely therapist who specializes in these types of issues and I'd recommend finding one if you're so inclined.  After years of thinking about it, I finally started shaving my legs, painting my nails, and presenting as femme in safe environments.  I'm working towards being more out in public, but it's a process and everyone moves at their own pace.  It's awesome that you're exploring this and you should definitely continue to.  :)
Never to old! I'm in my late 20s and while I've had questioning-ish phases it never really hit me all that hard until recently (though does explain why I get irritated every time someone calls me ""Ma'am"") and I'd been wondering the same, like, ""shouldn't I have my shit figured out by now!?"" but no, not too old.
nah, you're never too old :) i was in my 30s too when I realized i was NB and came out. 
it's never too late to be questioning! check out celeste m. on youtube. they're 35 and also started questioning a little later.
I'm 35 and I started T and came out as transmasculine last year. I had top surgery 7 months ago. It's at times been prettttyyyy far from a magical happy miracle woo woo journey as the media loves to portray transition...but it's what I had to do and even though transition can be hard, I still feel like I'm better off now. Your experience actually sounds kinda similar to mine. It's never too late. 
Hey there!
I know you wrote this a week ago but I wanted to respond nonetheless. Minus the breast reduction surgery, which I have not had, I felt like i could have written this entire post. Everything you wrote makes complete sense to me. I am also your age, was queer and in severe denial for the majority of my 20s, which I know highly affected how I perceived my gender identity (cis woman trying not do anything to make myself 'look like a lesbian' and how i presented to the world (much more feminine and heteronormative and completely not my natural state.  It's never too old to question who you are, or really, return to the person you've always been. My view is, you/we have been feeling this way for a long time, we only just now have language that is able to fully describe our experience. There has been this whole part of me that's been really surprised to be going through this at this stage of my life, but mostly, as I look back on so many parts of my life, it makes complete sense.

Things I should have recognized as not cis earlier	"-I went by “Peter” and constantly wore a mascara moustache in middle school

-Have actually always taken every weak excuse to dress masc that I could

-Referred to it as “the drag instinct” jokingly

-First time I tried to make myself a binder I was just barely hitting puberty

-I HATE shaving my armpits and legs. I don’t mind the work, I hate the results

-I have always preferred traditionally masculine deodorants/colognes

-TW internalized phobia >!The assumption that non-binary people are just attention seekers because “nobody likes being seen through the lens of their gender.”!<

->!Ironically, shame because I assumed I was ALSO just attention seeking!<

-No idea how to quantify my romantic orientation because I’m technically pan but I do NOT like being “the woman” in het/het-adjacent relationships.

-I have never felt that my given name “fits” me

-Dresses and skirts have induced panic in social settings.

-I get VERY jealous of AMAB people because I would kill for some facial hair

But OF COURSE I still like my long hair and nails and even occasionally makeup so I MUST be cis I’m not a MAN jeez and everyone knows the only options are MAN and WOMAN gosh /s

Seriously though how am I only just figuring this out??? Does anyone feel like they had a facepalm moment when they realized they were non-binary? Like,,, I came out to my friends and it was the “yeah buddy you were the last one to figure it out” stereotype and I’m

Actually weirdly euphoric about it. It makes sense now! I can maybe even start doing the whole “self acceptance” thing. That would be nice. It would sure,, be nice"		lxngxt	NonBinary	23	0.97	2021-03-04 15:46:39
My new partner has built my confidence in myself so much.	"I came out as nonbinary around a year ago, and I've been socially transitioning ever since. Ever since then I've been more certain than ever about who I am, and also the least certain that it's okay to be who I am than ever in my life. I am surrounded by 98% cishet people and coming out has made me feel a little bit like a circus freak. While most people were fairly accepting, it was largely just not talked about. They called me by my chosen name (but very rarely used the correct pronouns), and just avoided the subject of my gender altogether, as if it was a shameful secret. Because of this reaction I really did start to feel ashamed of being nonbinary.

Then I met my girlfriend. We had matched on a different dating app a few years ago, and she's admitted to me that while she swiped right after reading my bio, she wasn't all that attracted to my presentation at the time. I was in denial about my gender and presenting extremely femme - long blonde hair, makeup, and dresses in all my pics. We chatted a bit but she ended up leaving the country for a while and we lost touch. Then, sometime around the new year, she came across my new profile on a different app. My hair is now short and dyed, and I present very androgynous/masc. According to her, she'd never been more instantaneously attracted to someone. We matched, met up for a date, and have barely been able to leave each other's presence since.

She has known from day one that I plan on top surgery, and she's not just supportive of me: she's *excited* for me. We talk all the time about all the things we're going to do after my surgery that my dysphoria prevents me from doing now. She says top surgery scars are sexy and that she loves that I know what I want to do with my body. I started low dose T a few weeks ago, and at first I was terrified to tell her about my decision because I was sure she would lose attraction to me. Instead, she was overjoyed for me. She notices the few tiny changes I've had so far before I do and points them out, always gushing about how attractive they are and cracking jokes about my newfound ability to open jars.

In short, she's crazy about me for exactly who I am, and even more importantly she's 100% on board for me doing whatever I need to do to feel good in my own body. The difference this has made in my self-confidence is like night and day. I honestly can't remember the last time I have felt this good about myself. I know that we're not supposed to need external validation to feel good about ourselves, but when the entire world seems to be telling you that your identity doesn't even belong in the public eye, it can start to get to you. I can't possibly overstate the benefits of searching for the people who will embrace you unconditionally, people who will not just be neutral to your existence but who will genuinely appreciate and celebrate it. I was starting to feel like those people don't even really exist, but I didn't give up searching and it paid off in the biggest possible way.

All of this to say, just... Don't give up. Don't settle for people who are ""okay"" with who you are. Put yourself out there (to the best of your abilities) and keep trying to connect with people who value the same things as you. Nobody can thrive in an environment that is merely indifferent to them; you deserve to be celebrated."		te1yc6	NonBinary	23	1.0	2022-03-14 16:50:09
your joy is their poison	"And now? the Daily Shaming! We've combed tiktok to find people who have FAILED to CONFORM! Look how much they fail to fit in. Aren't you glad that you fit in enough not to be targeted by us? (or *do* you fit in enough? maybe not! better watch to find out!)

* First up here is a video of a man, but he has on a DRESS. Like a WOMAN! Unimaginable! Everyone should wear the correct outfit for their gender. It's not fair that while we're responsible *other people* get to just run around having fun.
* Next up look at this girl! She's FAT but she says she's PRETTY! Impossible! What if this catches on?? People who haven't earned the right to be happy might be happy? Then only we at the Daily Shaming would be unhappy and how is that fair? It's not!
* This one is a non-binary person but they look more like one gender than the other as far as we are concerned. YES our opinion matters. Non-binary people must wear gray jumpers and CLEAR lipgloss-- pink is not allowed.  We at the Daily Shaming are already confused enough.  Please stop confusing us it's scary. STICK TO THE UNIFORM.
* And now we have a father who loves to braid his daughter's hair! Is this DAD or is this MOM? This guy has too many muscles for this activity. And now we are getting confused again. Please stop... Why isn't he worried about what the other guys would say? Why isn't he scared of being called gay?
* This next one says they are TRANS! Look how happy they are? HOW? We at the Daily Shaming still remember that time the water polo coach said that we ""swam like a girl"" and now people are running around being trans without a care in the world. Western civilization is crumbling.
* So many people WANT ATTENTION ... but who is paying attention to The Daily Shaming?? No one thinks to ask THAT. We are the real victims. Wanting attention automatically makes you bad. More people should pay attention to us saying this. Maybe our truth bombs are just too real?? That must be it. We are NOT crying right now you take that back!
* And now for a little BOY helping his sister with her MAKEUP. HE puts on makeup too! Madness! There is no end to all these people just... doing whatever they want... what gives them the right?
* This person said they are DISABLED and talked about their wheelchair but now they are STANDING. That can't happen. We on Daily Shaming can't think of any reason why that *could* happen. No, we have not thought about it for more than a few seconds, but why would we need to?

The Daily Shaming might just seem like mean spirited voyeurism, but we'll now try to convince you that what we are really doing is somehow saving free speech and preventing SOCIAL DECAY. You better keep watching and you better keep track of all the things we don't like or you could be NEXT. If we don't do our jobs more and more people will just do whatever makes them happy and... be happy even though they're supposed to feel BAD. We at Daily Shaming work so hard to fit in... it's not fair that our suffering means nothing. You can't just say ""well I don't want to do it that way"" you have to do as you're told! These are just the hard truths of life. Even if you do everything right, you still might not be happy...OK? NO. We are not crying again! We just have a very bad cold!🤬😢

Body image issues improving after coming out to myself	"When I was 15, a boy I had a crush on remarked that it didn't matter to him if a girl was chubby as long as her boobs stuck out further than her belly. For the past 15 years since I've internalised that ""rule"" and have done everything I could to live up to that cute boy's standard of beauty. When the push up bras didn't do enough, and when my chronic digestive issues caused bloating, I would be left with shame and disgust towards this sad sack of flab I've been destined to live inside. I hid inside hoodies and one piece swimsuits when I really wanted was a belly button piercing and a bikini with board shorts. 

I came to the realization that I was nonbinary in December 2017, and started my transition with testosterone injections in May. I wanted to get as far away from womanhood as possible without becoming a man and inheriting all the rules and codes that go with that side of the gender spectrum. I want to just be me. Cute and sweet, but gross and strong as hell. Nails painted one day, building my own furniture the next. Buzzed hair, no makeup, wearing a binder...under a dress. Because fuck the rules. I've wasted likely half my life being a weird girl not knowing I was actually something else entirely.

Since I've started testosterone, my inner self is starting to become my outer self as well. My voice, my muscles, and my genitals are all becoming what I've wanted them to be. I'm also starting to notice a good amount of fat redistribution, with it leaving my boobs and butt and finding a new home on my stomach. And thanks to my healthy intake of alcohol, pickle flavored chips, and gummy peach rings, I've started to develop the beginnings of a nice beer belly. But despite it being what I've fought against since high school, I'm not upset about my tummy being bigger then my boobs. I'm actually pretty proud of it, and I can't figure out why. What I do know is that this is the first time in my life I've looked down there and not felt disgusted about the squishy blob I've found. I fully plan on wearing whatever the hell I want from now on, regardless of the proportions of the lumps on my torso. And hell, maybe I'll even go get that belly button ring.

i don't know how y'all do this and i need some help	"(i don't know how to do this but TW for internalized transphobia?)

so i've known i was nonbinary for maybe six years, but for most of that time i made myself hide it because i felt a lot of shame about it. recently i have begun to try accepting it since it started becoming too painful to hide. i told my girlfriend and one of my friends who is trans. my girlfriend desn't really seem to understand. she basically says like ""why can't you just learn to accept yourself"" and stuff. i guess i understand she's worried but i don't know how to tell her that this *is* part of accepting myself. i'm planning on getting top surgery and she is really worried about it but i don't know how to explain to her that i would rather tear my flesh off myself than be stuck with these useless lumps of flesh on my chest that stop me from doing what i want.

i have a lot of dysphoria, especially socially, and it seems like everyone i know makes a point of gendering me as male. i hate it and it feels like i am constantly pretending to be someone i'm not. but i know it would be just as painful to be seen as a girl all the time so i don't know what to do. i feel like i am trapped between a rock and a hard place. everyone seems to constantly push gendered expectations on me and i am tired of it but i am so used to hiding my feelings that i don't know how i would begin unraveling this mess. i want to pick a new name but it seems really difficult to pick a unisex name because they all seem to lean to one side gender-wise. (i think the name i might pick is Micah Sage, but i know micah is used more often for guys and it bothers me. is dylan more unisex than micah? because i was thinking about that too. i can't tell someone let me know pls)

a long time ago i changed my presentation and name to a more masculine one and people pretty much assumed i was a dude because it's less complicated, and i just went with it because it was different from being gendered as female. and it felt good because it was different, and i kinda believed it for a long time. but now i'm realizing that it's just as uncomfortable to be pushed into the male box as it is to be pushed into the female one.

so like i have some questions as a baby enby:

1. how do you all deal with society forcing you into boxes you don't belong in? it causes me a lot of distress but i don't know how i can stop it or ignore it. i want people to see who i actually am because i'm tired of pretending, but no one where i live even knows what a nonbinary person is. and i feel too shy to explain it. most people where i live speak french and it doesn't even seem possible to have unisex pronouns in french. heck every single noun is gramatically male or female in french.

2. how do you ask people to use another name and pronouns? (i think i would like either they/them or a mix of he and she pronouns.) i feel like asking people is a huge burden and is also embarassing. i think i have some internalized transphobia because i have no problem changing what pronouns i use for other people, but i always misgender myself inside my head. i feel like if i ask people that kind of thing they won't understand. i'm really introverted and i don't like asking people to do stuff for me. my girlfriend is trying to use my new name and pronouns but i'm not out to anyone else so she doesn't usually get the opportunity, and also english isn't her first language so she has difficulty using they/them

3. are there any unisex informal terms to use for yourself? like how people say dude or girl, is there a nonbinary word for that? i know there's enby but i would like to learn more of them

4. how do i stop feeling like a massive black hole of disgusting shame? literally i feel like a caricature of an sjw and i feel like everyone would make fun of me if i came out. i have a lot of anxiety so maybe it's just that. my feeling about my gender seems to be really easily affected by what i see. like if i watch a cartoon where they make transphobic jokes, i feel like i am shrinking, and i feel like maybe i'm not nonbinary after all? maybe i just want to feel like a special snowflake attack helicopter? and i feel really ashamed. but like the other day i saw a poster of a person outside who had a nonbinary flag on their shirt, and even though it was a really small thing that 99% of people wouldn't notice, it made me feel a lot more confident in the moment. like, maybe it's okay to be like this, and i'm not the only one? idk. anyway how do i get more confidence in a world that seems to constantly be pushing nonbinary people down???"	"[deleted]
>(i think the name i might pick is Micah Sage, but i know micah is used more often for guys and it bothers me. is dylan more unisex than micah? because i was thinking about that too. i can't tell someone let me know pls)

Dylan is more often a 'guys' name too, I'm AMAB and it was my middle name, but don't let that stop you, there are plenty of women named Dylan too in more recent years. 

>i hate it and it feels like i am constantly pretending to be someone i'm not. but i know it would be just as painful to be seen as a girl all the time so i don't know what to do. i feel like i am trapped between a rock and a hard place. everyone seems to constantly push gendered expectations on me and i am tired of it but i am so used to hiding my feelings that i don't know how i would begin unraveling this mess.  

This is pretty much exactly how I felt that led me to realize I was nonbinary. I transitioned as a trans woman years ago, forcing myself into the 'woman' box felt like just as much of a mask.

I don't have a lot of answers for you, since I just came to realize I'm nonbinary in the last year or so, and haven't figured out what I'm going to do about my own similar problems. I just wanted to say you're definitely not alone, and it's okay to be like this.
First, Micah Sage is a completely rad name, and I don’t think Micah is any more or less neutral than Dylan—either would be fine. You can always use “Micah Sage” as your name rather than just Micah which to me has some big enby energy. I dunno what it is about nonbinary people picking nouns as names but I think it’s fantastic (I’ve been playing around with Robin for a while now but I’m not committed enough yet to ask people to start calling me that)

I’m not going to lie, your questions aren’t easy to answer. I’ve spent years trying to figure some of them out. I think the biggest thing that made me a lot more comfortable with myself is a bit of a cop-out really, but I live in a super liberal area, large college town. The majority of people I interact with are queer at this point, so that’s all so normalized to me that it’s really a great environment. Obviously you can’t just move on a whim, but these communities are everywhere, you just have to look for them. And internet communities like this are a huge help if you’re struggling with the people you meet in person. Personally, since I’m comfortable with my gender/sexuality/lifestyle, I try to do things that will tip off other people that may be less comfortable with themselves, so they know I’m safe—like, in my boring retail job, I wear a pin that has the trans pride flag and rainbow pride flag, and I get a lot of subtle comments. It’s that little moment of connection with other people that I know can really help. I’ve been thinking about knitting a beanie in nonbinary colors, because I love beanies 😂 Maybe on days that you’re feeling more comfortable with yourself you can wear something like that—who knows, maybe someone else will see you and connect with you

I definitely understand that it’s hard to feel comfortable with your identity when you feel very alone and like nobody else in your life knows what you’re going through. I wish there were more concrete things I could tell you, because I know “who cares what anyone else thinks” is really bad advice, but without knowing your exact situation I’m not sure what would be more helpful. In any case, best of luck to you!
Omg I relate a lot! 

I thought I was ftm for a while but after I started passing as a guy for a while, I realized I kinda hate it?? Being called both he and she sucks and each is dysphoric in its own way. 

And I relate a tonnn with the name thing. I went from an extremely feminine name I always hated to an extremely masc name I also don’t like.. I changed it just to “fit in” and be seen as a guy, but I never really connected with it either. 

I really like micah and think it’s pretty neutral, def not masc imo.. I personally know all male dylans but it’s not necessarily a guy’s name either.. maybe ask ur friends if they can try them out for a little while see which one you like more?
Oh I totally feel your pain. I can say it makes me feel better to wear my pronoun pin in public and around everybody. I do get asked about it and you just kind of have to be brave and explain it because society hasn’t caught up with us yet. But it can be a great way to start a conversation with friends and ask them to use your correct pronouns. I bought mine off of Etsy for like four dollars.
this is cute, I will have to try it out :) thanks for the suggestion!
thank you, i appreciate it. i'm glad at least that we're not alone <3
Thank you! For some reason I like Micah Sage a lot more than either Micah or Sage alone so maybe I will just have both of them as my name. I would like to live in a more accepting place, I'm hoping to possibly move to Ottawa or something like that in a few years. In the meantime I'll check out some online support group thingies.

I like to sometimes wear a mix of masculine and feminine clothes. Maybe I could get a pin or something with nonbinary colours in case anyone recognizes it, lol. 

I appreciate your response, thank you <3
thank you! i think i will ask people to try them out for a bit. i relate a lot to your comment as well.
I think I might look for one of those. Or I might try to make one myself.
I went with a short lanyard/keychain thing with the nonbinary flag, so I wouldn't have to switch a pin around or wear a jacket constantly. I've had quite a few people comment on it, when I didn't expect anyone to recognize it. It's been really nice to hear positive comments from strangers, and it's a symbol that most unsupportive people don't recognize.
Of course! I was wondering if you lived in Canada, haha—the part where you said a lot of people speak French sort of gave it away. I have a decent level of French (academic more than conversational, unfortunately) so I related to the lack of a genderless pronoun as that’s something that’s low key bugged me for a while. 

Check out Etsy for pins/pride attire 😊 I saw a cool pin in the shape of a rainbow but with the nonbinary colors when I was searching at one point"	eby3o4	NonBinary	20	0.96	2019-12-17 16:35:00
Holy shit I think my parents are transphobic	"So I'm non-binary, living with both my parents and my little sister. It all first started with little stuff, like calling me by my deadname or by female pronouns. I was like ""Meh, they're just not used to it, it'll take a little time"" Then my sister started to do efforts on this, but it got even worse with my parents. They keep on getting mad or sighing/rolling eyes when I asked to be referred as they and that my name was Ash. They say ""C'mon [DEADFUCKINGNAME], stop being annoying and help us instead of talking shit!"" They also said to ""cut the bullshit"" when  I was complaining about the lack of enby rights in France (that's were I live and you have to choose between make our female on your ID and stuff). My mom also seems to be a part of the TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist). I always knew she was a feminist (more like a feminazi but eh), but not at this point, not before she started saying stuff like ""you can't be trans AND be against sexist clichés, because gender identity is just a bunch of clichés"". Then I brought up the whole ""J. K. Rowling is transphobic"" thing, and they were like ""Maya Forstater did nothing wrong, plus I'm sure you don't know the whole story (at this point they were just trying to prove me wrong, fucking childish)"". Oh and also, my mom refused to get me a chest binder (because I'm trying to look a little more androgynous) for Christmas, cuz it ""was a shame, I'm soooo pretty and feminine"", or she was ""scared it would hurt"" (she even said that people who said it didn't hurt were probably paid by a brand, like wtf?!). None of my parents also want me to shave my head (my hair is already pretty short, but I wanna change my style), but that may just be not wanting me to make stupid decisions that I'd regret (which already happened a couple of times '^^)
So... do you think they're transphobic?

Sorry for the long ass post too haha"	"I would just shave your head without their permission.  They don't own your body.  Similarly, I would see if you can maybe have a friend order a binder for you and pay them back or something like that.
If your parents say transphobic things and do transphobic things then yes, they are transphobic. All you can do is decide what your boundaries are and then assert them.

If you don't know how to assert your boundaries you first need to state them aloud - ""I will not be referred to by deadname, my name is Name, please use it"" and then whenever they are crossed you need to state them again but this time with a consequence within your control ""I've told you to please not use deadname, if you do it again I will leave/hang up/etc."" If they push back or of they cross the boundary again you need to follow through with the consequence. 

If you are unable to assert your boundaries for some reason (financially dependent on them or afraid for your physical safety or other similar reason) then you need to find ways to stay sane and work on getting to a place where you are able to maintain your boundaries. 

Remember that you deserve respect, and that your boundaries are not negotiable, you belong to you and no one else.
Argh, so sorry about that... best of wishes
Yeah, your parents sound pretty transphobic to me. Get out as soon as you can and never speak to them again, would be my advice. I mean, maaaybe they'll get better one day, but it's not your responsibility to try and make them better. Your job is to take care of yourself; their issues are just that, their issues. I'm saying this as a NB person that ran away from my parents, and honestly it's so freeing to get away from a toxic environment.
Okay that’s it Ash, I’m your mom now, do you want some cookies? Maybe a warm cup of tea when you get home after a long hard day.
About the binder, my only close friend (the only one I trust about money or kinda personal stuff) lives on literally the other side of the country, and he's 14. So I don't really know how to pay him back (unless if he talks to his parents about it, and I don't really know how he could explain that lmao) And about the hair... I'd have to save A LOT of money because the only hair dresser I can reach on my bike is EXPENSIVE. Tho I'm gonna try, what are they gonna do when they find out? Ground me? I don't even go outside
The thing is that I'm a minor, and will be for 5 years... so I can't really leave, except if I just go to a friend's house for a while, not they'd call the police and I'd get in trouble...
Might be worth looking around for cheap hair clippers to just buy, if you haven't already? If you want it the same length all over I reckon you'd be able to do it yourself
You can leave the room? Even if they follow you, just as a clear signal that their behaviour isn't acceptable. But don't do that if you fear reprisals. Always mind your safety first.
That's the problem, I'd want something like really short on one side, and kinda long on the other
Lock up in the bathroom. Seems like a good idea lmao"	eh92mi	NonBinary	20	0.92	2019-12-29 18:03:16
I just came out again on Facebook	"A decade ago I came out as gay. Last year I told my wife and best friend I’m non binary and queer. But to everyone else in my life I haven’t had the guts. I posted this super long post I doubt anyone will read. But I did it. And that’s a step to being honest about who I am. So yay! 

....”””””Happy Pride month everyone! I don’t normally go out of my way to post about pride. I’ve had so many people ask me why someone should have LGBT pride? When straight people don’t have pride to be straight. Why should there be gay parades and not straight parades?   

Peter Boghossian says this better than I can so I’ll quote him here, “LGBT pride does not mean being proud of having been born lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans.

It means being proud of having survived.

LGBT pride flag
It means being proud of living in a homophobic, biphobic, transphobic society — a society that commonly treats us with contempt at best and violent hatred at worst — and still getting on with our lives. It means being proud of flourishing, in a society that commonly thinks we’re broken. It means being proud of being happy, in a society that commonly thinks we should be miserable. It means being proud of being good and compassionate, in a society that commonly thinks we’re wicked. It means being proud of fighting for our rights and the rights of others like us, in a society that commonly thinks we should lie down and let ourselves get walked on — or that thinks we should be grateful for crumbs and not ask for more. It means being proud of retaining our dignity, in a society that commonly treats us as laughing-stocks. It means being proud of loving our sexuality and our bodies, in a society that commonly thinks our sexuality and our bodies are disgusting. It means being proud of staying alive, in a society that commonly beats us down and wants us dead.
It is not easy to do any of this. Despite the many advances LGBT people have made over the decades, we still live in a society that commonly thinks we should be ashamed simply for existing. It is incredibly difficult to listen to people denigrate us, taunt us, humiliate us, bully us, shame us, from the earliest days of our childhood until the day we die — and still flourish, still be happy, still be compassionate, still fight for our rights, still retain our dignity, still love our bodies and our sexualities and our selves, still survive.

It is not easy to do any of this. It takes work.

When LGBT people talk about LGBT pride, when we attend LGBT Pride celebrations, when we say we’re proud to be gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans, this is what we’re talking about. It is a hugely important aspect of LGBT history and culture. And when people mock it and denigrate it in public, many of us take it rather personally. Experience has taught us that when people treat the concept of LGBT pride with hostility and contempt, they tend to treat us — our history, our culture, our struggles for equality and rights — with hostility and contempt.”

I’ve struggled my whole life to be completely honest with who I am to everyone I love. In fear they wouldn’t love me in whole. That they would think a part of me was disgusting. This post is to tell anyone who takes the time to read this every part of about me, I’ve shared with you over the years was genuine. I wasn’t always proud of who I am. But as I’m growing up and being reminded everyday I am loved and accepted I am growing to have pride. If you knew me as the little girl in 90s frilly dresses, that was me! If you knew me when all I wanted to do was wear boxers, Steelers shirts, swim and watch football, also me. Through the awkward teenage years when I dated men, here’s the truth, also me! I was attracted to a couple guys. When I was a young adult and got pressured from my family to say if I was straight or gay. I said gay. Because it was the part I wanted them to accept the most. That is also me. I identify as gay, as queer, and I still find men attractive. Me in my twenties that didn’t leave the house with a low cut shirt and tons of makeup because I wanted everyone to think I was pretty. Me, when I shaved my head, bleached it blonde, tried every color I could get my hands on. Also me! It wasn’t a melt down or phase. It was me being myself without worrying what anyone would think for once. If you’ve seen the rare pictures of me questioning if people would still find me attractive if I cut all my hair off then you seen a side of me that is vulnerable. I’ve wanted to since I was a kid. Maybe someday I’ll get the guts. This year I’m taking a big step and being proud of who God has made me and is making me. I always felt God wanted to rename me. After years of questioning and not wanting to hurt anyone’s feelings I’ve embraced my name as Ace. This year I will change my gender to x on my driver license. Because it’s just another aspect of myself I need to learn to be proud of. This doesn’t mean you don’t know me if this is new information. In fact it means you now, know me more. I’m happy to share my pride with everyone now because it means I survived all the self doubt. I found out through it all my family loves me no matter who I date, what I wear, or eat (the pescatarian Year’s where hard on them lol), or what I go by. And now I’ve found a wife that makes me feel comfortable to share who I am with her and she makes me feel so loved and happy. So my goal this month is to share my pride with everyone. So they know they can be prideful of their struggles and fears too. That they too will be loved and accepted if they have the courage to be genuine.”””””

If anyone reads this give me a sign. ❤️ Ace"	"❤

I'm coming out as nonbinary 28/f.	"Throw away account because I haven't told anyone else.  

&#x200B;

My low self esteem comes from a need to protect myself from the trauma of being a failure because I tried to be myself (non binary at age 8) but was shamed into being someone else by my family. I'm an only child and constantly sought my parents' approval growing up. This easily led to me constantly seeking anyone's approval and feeling physically horrible if I failed at anything. 

&#x200B;

It is exhausting trying to tip-toe and act constantly. I feel like I've been carrying an anvil around, making everyday tasks seem surmountable. My brain is always wondering what people will think of me. If I'm going to be accepted. 

&#x200B;

But I don't have to live this way anymore! I'm a grown-ass human and can be who I am. There will be people who accept  who I am and there will be people who won't. I'm going to surround myself with the people who accept me as I am – merely a highly evolved ape who received a body with DNA that produces traits that make some people uncomfortable. 

&#x200B;

I am breaking out of a life I was doomed to live. I have love to offer and love to receive. I can be happy. "	"Hi!
I just want to tell you, that you most definitely are NOT a failure, that you are a precious human being. 
I really hope you get a future with more happiness than your past & that you'll find friends who will accept and love you as the person you are.
Thanks for the trust to submit your post here, i hope you're having a great delightful day!

33 years old and possibly non-binary and in need of advice	"Hi folks, I'm new here and fairly new to this whole thing, looking for some advice/clarity. I'm a 33 year old woman/afab who think I might be leaning towards the gender fluid spectrum. Here is some back story:

From as far back as I can remember in my childhood I was attracted to women. I came out as a lesbian in my early teens, and for about a decade I was also very fascinated with androgynous gender expressions. In that time and place where I grew up there was no concept about non-binary or gender fluid as a gender identification, had that been a thing with which I was familiar I would probably have identified as such. I remember my goal was to look like ""a boy who looks like a girl who looks like a boy"". I cut my hair short and was binding my breasts for a while, but it wasn't a lot of dysphoria associated with it, mostly just not wanting to associate to any one gender, but exist in-between, or as both simultaneously.

When I was 22 I had dated my first girlfriend for four years, and things were headed down a path of stability and life-long commitment that I increasingly felt I wasn't ready for. I wanted to go out and see the world (and other people - she was my first) which lead me to break up with her, which I did in an awful and messy way due to being young and emotionally immature and unprepared for dealing with this. In this whole chaos I ended up dating a mutual friend, in secret, and when this came out me and my new girlfriend were shunned by our group of friends, which incidentally also happened to be a large part of the queer community in the city where we all lived. A year and a half later me and the new girlfriend broke up, and shortly thereafter I ended up dating a guy from my school. This was the last nail in the coffin for me in the eyes of the queer community, and I was no longer welcome there.

After that, I for some unknown reason have mostly been attracted to men. I grew my hair out (unrelated event) and was horrified what a difference it was to be on the ""correct"" side of the whole sexuality/gender expression spectrum in terms of how people treated me (""correct"" in the eyes of the bullshit made up rules opposed on us by society). I haven't been with a woman since then, not out of some principle, just because I have always only gone with what feels right, and as young never questioned or felt weirded out by my attraction to women as it felt completely natural to me, and now I mostly feel that way towards men (and tomboy girls). Then things just kind of went along this way until a little while ago.

All throughout this time, though, I have always dreamed of having a man's body in terms of a beard and a penis. I will have dreams about this at least once a week. I have mostly thought of this as ""ah bummer, I really wish I could have this but I guess it'll never happen"" the same way you might dream about flying or such. I will add that this isn't combined with any particular dysphoria around my female body, just a desire to have that as well, or sometimes instead of. Then a month back a friend of mine was visiting me from the US. She is very involved in the queer community where she lives and we talked a lot about this, I expressed my feelings that I no longer have a place there because of mostly dating men, and probably to a large part from that trauma of being shunned by my whole circle of friends (I now have new, amazing friends). I remember how annoyed we were when people would claim to be gay and then only date people of the opposite sex, and I didn't want to burden the community with that, also I have had a lot of guilt around my own sexuality happening to perfectly fit the whole, made up stupid cliché of ""it's just a phase"". I have felt that while for me, personally, my sexuality just is what it happens to be, if I disclosed it to others it could be harmful for the queer community. So I just don't have a name for it. My friend who visited had a much more forgiving look on things which was inspiring. Then one day we compared dreams of the previous night, and I recounted one of my reoccurring dreams of waking up with a dick and being all ecstatic about it. I then told her of how it was such a shame that I could never have that. She just kind of said, well maybe you can explore that some, and it was like she kicked open a door by saying that. I have not been able to get it out of my head since. Pretty much after that day I have had this intense longing to present more as male/gender fluid, I'm cutting my hair short next week and am so excited to try this out. I'm also trying to flatten my chest with sport bras and such.

I guess my question is, I just don't know what to do with this. I feel like I can't claim my place within this community for the reasons stated above, and I don't know if what I'm experiencing is gender fluidity or some related identity.  I read somewhere that wanting to dress a certain way doesn't make you gender fluid as that is rather a state of mind than your outward expression. This feels different than an aesthetic choice, though, but I also don't dare to trust my instincts enough as clearly I'm changing between polarities (gay/straight, femme looking/not-femme looking now, I guess?) and it seems to take some decade to circle through these phases too. Also it has just been a month, so who the heck knows, even if it feels like a revelation, like I have unlocked some aspect of myself. And also I'm 33, and all the other people who struggle with these thoughts seem to be around 1,5-two decades my junior. I don't want to impose myself in a community of people who experience a whole lot more profound feelings of dysphoria/gender identity than myself, which I also recognize is kind of a messed up way to look at it. This is all very new and confusing, but also very exciting, but I feel lost and without a road map, and very alone in this. My career forces me to move around a whole lot so unfortunately seeking out support groups and such isn't possible. Any suggestions or clarifying thoughts would be greatly appreciated."	"It doesn't matter how you dress or who you date. Ask yourself if you think you're a man or a woman. (Not based on social roles either. What do YOU think?) If not, then ask yourself whobyou think you may be. That's only way to ever really know.
I feel like my story is pretty similar. I missed connecting  with the queer community and dispite wanting to date women I kept stumbing over straight boys. (They just kept falling in my lap) My whole life I've never fit socially with girls or women and I've always been confused at how people treated me -because of my feminine appearance- but I just went with it because it was easier. I've wanted male attributes as long as I can remember, perhaps you've seen the comic where Calvin tells his mom he is going to grow a ZZ Top beard? Yeah that's me. Now, at 41, I'm micro dosing and trying to connect with the community. It is akward being so much older but I think there are advantages to it as well. What I'm getting at is feel free to dm me if you want to compare notes.
I wish I had some advice but all I can say is while I haven't lived through the same things, a lot of the emotions and experiences you've described sum up my feelings too, so you're not alone. It's confusing as fuck in the first place, then add on top of that the confliction of whther or not you belong in a community, it's isolating. From what I've seen on this sub the people are very open to the vast range of experiences, identities and expression. Maybe hang around on here a while, see if you can relate to others, and continue researching and experimenting with different identities.

For reference I'm specifically a 23yo afab demigirl, but I'm so cis-passing and have no real dysphoria (that thing about ""shucks, a penis would have been cool"" is SO TRUE ISTG), and demigirl and nonbinary in general are so rarely understood or even known outside of lgbt+ circles that I just go about my life as female most of the time. I'm trying to break into lgbt+ circles to make friends who I can be around while exploring myself, but I feel like I've missed the opportunity now that I've graduated university. Again, you're not alone, no matter how complexing it feels, so here's some solidarity :)
I am in my late 40s, male factory equipment, masculine-presenting, and still in the closet to everyone except my wife and my healthcare providers. Almost every local LGBT group I have found seems focussed on youth, and as an enby, I feel like a minority within the ""T"" minority. For so long, I have not even had the words to describe myself. The concept of nonbinary gender identity has been a life raft for me. The only other enby I know in my country is 1000 km away, and online only, never met in person. I feel so isolated. But I know that the only way forward is to make local friends, so I am going to try, by contacting local groups, when I have the courage.

Social media is dominated by excellent young people, such as the fine members of this subreddit, so it is easy for older people to feel  left out in the cold. Be sure to check out r/translater for people who transition later in life. We might not be as visible, but there are many of us.
I feel like I could have written this myself, only I dated guys early on and then realized after that I have an attraction for women.  I was a girly girl when I was very young, and family still sees me that way.  I have a shaved head now and I worked on diesel trucks for a while too.  I also am a massage therapist, so complete opposites really.  I dream regularly of having a penis, and my husband (yep, married a guy) recently said something about wishing I was a dude, and my first response was yeah, I do wish that. 

My husband and I are polyamorous and he was recently dating a nonbinary person who explained that maybe I wasn't just female and I really felt that.  I do not think that I am only female, but I do not know how to describe myself.
Also older (43) and just saying hello and you can join our club.  Nobody here has shown any signs of kicking me out for being crotchety yet 😉
I guess that's where my confusion stems from. I'm definitely not male, but I think I might not be 100% female either. Or possibly just confused.
Thank you for these words! It's good to see that there are more people sort of grappling with similar issues...
There are more. You could be neutral in your gender, you could have an aporine gender (instead of male or female related), you might even have a xenogender for all I know. Or you could be partially male or female.
I long struggled with this. I don't feel like a man or a woman, so what am I? Welcome!"	cnzuze	NonBinary	18	1.0	2019-08-09 09:16:17
It is with much shame that I must make a confession	"I hate wearing skirts. I hate how it feels having my legs exposed to the air (it's just weird I hate it my legs must be covered oh god there's a breeze it's horrible) and I never wore shorts before hatching, and skirts, even long ones, are like shorts but worse.

I have failed the entire community."	"That is an egregious violation of the Non-Binary Uniform Code. A representative of the High Council of Thems will arrive at your residence in 3-5 business days to confiscate your membership credentials, and any pride flags you may have acquired. 

(Seriously though I see what you mean. I like skirts sometimes, but it's a very vulnerable feeling.)
I own 6 gray hoodies my enby credentials cannot be questioned.
Upon review, you are correct. The Law of Hoodie is a sacred cornerstone of NB, superseding all other regulations. We apologize for the misunderstanding.

Taking Pride in being Non-binary	"Hey folks, hope you're all doing great!

As 2022 comes to a close, I've been reflecting on how much my life has changed this year and how happy I've been over the last few months, as my ""true self"" has finally been able to come to the foreground and be seen by everyone who knows me. 

In 2022, I came out as non-binary to everyone at work, in my social life and in my family, I started therapy, and I started presenting how I want to - tentatively at first but with increasing confidence as time passed by throughout the year. 

Having an open and welcoming community of loud, proud, and beautiful people like this one gives me so much strength and makes me truly thankful and elated to be a non-binary person myself. I love logging onto reddit and taking inspiration from everyone's incredibly varied fashion styles, smiling at other's happy selfies, and sympathising with fellow people's issues. 

Despite what many in the world may still think, I'm genuinely proud of who I am, and who we are - and I'm learning to love myself and my identity a little more every day. 

So thank you all for being your amazing selves without shame, fear, or doubt. It's so, so important to have places like this subreddit and I'm honoured to be a part of it! Keep being awesome! x"	Well said x	zq85ea	NonBinary	17	0.95	2022-12-20 00:05:57
Dating straight cis dudes	To best describe my situation pretty much everyone in my life reads me as a cis-woman , even if they respect my pronouns. I have identified as NB for 9 years now, and I’ve never dated straight people, not that my identity has ever been easy- but it was easier to explore with fellow queers. I’m with someone now who has a pretty rigid concept of feminine beauty, and while he wouldn’t shame me he def wouldn’t embrace me. I feel a little shitty and weird when I think about wanting to shift how I look, I feel like he isn’t down to support a more masculine presenting me. He is definitely straight, and definitely hasn’t been exposed to non-binary people and I just feel alone and frustrated. I want to be desirable and more masculine or at least less femme. I know it’s not all him and largely society and not having NB/queer friends . I’m probably ranting to the wind but how tf do you handle cishet partners 😥	"Personally it’s the same as anything, if you’re my partner we gotta support each other 100% in who were growing to be if were gonna share life together. If one of your partners goals in life is to achieve a certain job position you’re with them on every step it takes to get that. Same thing with your identity, if you’re living a life in which you’re building the person you are and creating comfort for yourself you gotta have support to keep achieving it. 

This guy may not be super versed on lgbtq info and experiences, but if he’s serious about you then it should be simple. If ya really like someone, you just want them to be happy.
My husband is straight and cis. I didn't start questioning my gender identity until I was 30, we'd been married for 8 years, and I didn't start asking him to call me Cole and confess I was pan/demi until 2 years after that. I grew up with SO much internalized homophobia, and I didn't even know there were more than 2 genders until I met a non-binary person in grad school. My husband has been awesome and supportive, he mainly just wants me to be happy. I dress up cute for him in feminine things in the bedroom which he loves and I don't mind, and I wear what I want most of the rest of the time. I've never been particularly ""girly"" don't wear makeup, or much jewelry so it wasn't a huge transition there. My only problem really is because of the way my body is (extremely curvy) if I try any ""masculine"" clothing everyone assumes I'm a ""butch lesbian."" Not that there is anything wrong with that but as that's not my identity it feels dysphoric to me. So I mainly wear jeans and printed t-shirts when I'm not feeling feminine, and skirts and pretty tops when I am. That's kinda where I am at. As for your partner, it's all about education and also about finding a balance that everyone can live with. It may be that your partner truly is not attracted to ""androgynous"" or ""masculine"" presenting partners. That doesn't mean he is a bad person or that he is gender phobic, just some people have strong feelings about what they find sexy. You kind of have to figure out together if you living your true self and him having specific needs or feelings are compatible. Are there times when you would feel OK dressing feminine for him (like in the bedroom or out to a romantic dinner) or is that a compromise you're not interested in making? Do you want to be in a relationship with someone who can't embrace the full you living your authentic life? These are things you need to explore with yourself and with each other.
I feel this, but I don't have much advice. My two longest relationships have been with cis dudes. One of them got it without me even saying anything, and the other one didn't. With the former I was invited to a James Bond themed party and was hung up on having to dress as a 'Bond girl' when he said ""I figured you'd just dress as James Bond."" With the later he liked it when I pegged him but didn't like it when I wore a button up and a bolo tie to a wedding. 

I guess just be yourself, see how the other person reacts. Don't bow to bullying or emotional manipulation. Being comfortable in your own skin is priceless. Being comfortable with your partner is kinda the next thing on that list."	imib4w	NonBinary	17	1.0	2020-09-04 15:44:32
I'm going to a party tonight (paradise lost themed) Soooo I decided to go as the devil himself. It's been ages since I was able to flex my masc side in public without fear or shame.		"First off, that looks awesome! I am loving your eyebrows, and the horns look cool as well.

Not sure where I belong.	"Hello everyone. I’m new here, but I’m still not quite sure if I belong.

Growing up, my parents encouraged me to develop my individuality from a very young age. I pursued whatever interested me, whether it conformed to traditional gender roles or not. I had a vague impression that some things were “forbidden” to me because I was a girl, but my gender didn’t influence the way I saw myself for the most part.

When I was seven, my parents and I moved to another country, and the culture shock, homesickness, and stress of moving made me very insecure. I began behaving and presenting very femininely in order to ward off my poor self esteem and negative body image. 

Many things changed while we were gone, and once we returned home, I felt out of place once more. I wanted to be graceful and elegant, but I wore baggy, androgynous clothing in a futile attempt to conceal my insecurities. I wanted my body to develop in a feminine manner, but once it did, I was too awkward to talk to my parents about it, and they were too awkward to talk to me either. Consequently, I began to associate my female anatomy with shame, secrecy, and distress, feelings which persist years later. 

I met my girlfriend (who’s MtF) when we were fourteen. Before she began transitioning, I automatically took the submissive, traditionally feminine role in our relationship, but now I naturally gravitate towards a more masculine role. I realize that not all relationships require the traditional masculine-feminine dynamic, and ours certainly doesn’t conform to “traditional” standards. Yet, her transition prompted me to reevaluate my identity, and I’m beginning to realize how many parts of myself don’t exactly fit within the gender binary: partaking in ultrafeminine things like putting on makeup induce a feeling of intense wrongness that borders on dysphoria; I dress androgynously as much as I can, and I prefer to dress as male characters for Halloween/ComicCon; and although I enjoy working with little kids, the notion of my own potential maternity seems strangely foreign and wrong. 

I know that I’m not a trans man, and I’m fairly sure that I don’t quite count as a cis woman. I get a warm, fuzzy feeling whenever I think of myself as a nonbinary person. It just feels somehow *right*. Yet, I fear that I don’t fulfill many of the traits associated with nonbinary identities either. I don’t mind having a feminine body, and I don’t expect that I will ever want to pursue a medical transition in any capacity. Female pronouns don’t bother me, although I mostly use them for convenience rather than because I feel some profound connection to them. My name is quite feminine, and I don't want to change it either. Most troubling, I still have severe anxiety and self esteem problems, and I fear this might be just another coping mechanism. I genuinely can’t tell if I actually belong in the nonbinary community, or I’m just a confused cis person who’s trying to be more “special” than they actually are. 

I'll be going to university in another country soon, so I'll have the opportunity to change the way people perceive me, and I'm not sure how I want to present. I'll likely still dress androgynously, but should I actually come out to people there if I'm still not sure? I don't know. 

I’ve told my girlfriend and one of my closest friends about my concerns, and they’re both immensely supportive and understanding.I’m immensely grateful to have such a wonderful support system, but frankly all this is still somewhat overwhelming. I realize that I need more time for self-reflection, but I hope that perhaps someone here can help me make sense of everything that’s going through my head. 

Thank you so much for reading this. I’m sorry it’s so long. If nothing else, I found it helpful to write everything down.

TL;DR, I don’t quite fit within society’s definition of femininity, but I’m not sure if I’m validly nonbinary either. Do I belong here or not?"	"If non-binary feels right then it probably is. Nobody can tell you how you feel and nobody is going to say you're not welcome here. Btw - welcome to the sub :)

I think theres a general feel in the nb community that we must look and dress a certain way (generally opposite to our assigned genders) otherwise we aren't 'nb enough' but to me we are non-conforming anyway so fuck all that. If you're fine with female pronouns thats fine! I am too, and a few other nb people I know. You don't have to go by 'they', you don't have to wear a binder, or shave half your hair off. You do you, present yourself in a way you're comfortable with.
""I know that I’m not a trans man, and I’m fairly sure that I don’t quite count as a cis woman.""

You're not making this up. You sound like you are non-binary. Your quote above is the defining statement. 

PM me if you want a facebook group suggestion. <3 
Totally in tears reading this right now, because you could be describing me to a T right now.

I'm going to come back and comment properly here soon, but I just wanted to say that. Holy crap, are you not alone. 
you are very valid! i'm another non-binary person who doesn't want to transition medically. you are just as valid as every other trans person.
a lot of what you stated here are things that I have felt and experienced. I'm an afab nonbinary person either, and I have no interest in surgeries (at the moment) but I'm on t injections. and I'm honestly jealous that you feel okay with the pronouns most people gender you with, because that is one of the biggest areas of suffering in my life right now. 

as far as coming out, just remember that how many people you tell or when you tell them has no effect on your gender identity. choosing not to tell people makes you just as nonbinary as telling everyone you know. a lot of this is comfort level, knowing your audience, and being realistic about your own boundaries. this shit is messy and weird but best thing is you don't have to know all the answers. the only people who may *demand* answers are people who don't understand you (e.g., cis people) and you don't have to hurt yourself just to try to get someone to understand. trust the people you trust, know what I mean?
Thank you so much for your insight and support. I really appreciate it. :)
Thanks!
No problem :) 

Just read this and it probably sounds like I'm having a go at people who do present more nb but thats not the case. I'm just trying to say that people who don't present more nb are valid too. Sorry if anyone read my above comment and thought it was abit aggressive!

Anyway OP, if you want to come out maybe tell a few close friends and your partner first. If you don't want to right now then wait awhile theres no rush :)

Important thing is you're feelings are valid, if you want to chat more I'm always available for PM.
Thank you so much. I think it will be helpful tell a few more people. :)"	6pls42	NonBinary	16	0.94	2017-07-26 04:39:34
How do you normalize nonbinary or living gender neutral? I don’t fully feel like any gender but I struggle with stigma and shame		"I’m struggling with the exact same thing. All I’ve done is just try to take baby steps. I’m a teacher and I just got a new job and I worked up the courage to introduce myself using the gender neutral title “Mx.” which I much much much prefer. It was scary but so worth it and it makes me feel brave to try to take more steps with my gender expression.
I think it‘s just a matter of exposure. We just have to be ourselves and don‘t hide (unless it‘s an unsave environment) and eventually it will be more normalized. Think about how long it took to accept homosexuality (more, it‘s unfortunately still not seen as normal) so if we keep being ourselves and expose ourself to the world, the more used to it the world will get"	p9o6bm	NonBinary	17	1.0	2021-08-23 00:07:43
I knew I was nonbinary long before I had the terms to express myself	"I was cleaning off my external hard drive today and I found some old files from 2007 that I had completely forgotten about.  In 2007, I was fresh out of undergrad and had recently been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum.  I was voraciously reading every book about autism that I could get my hands on, but at that point in time we just didn't have as many authors on the spectrum writing about their own experiences.  Most texts were by parents or doctors; I remember voicing my frustration about this to my own parents, and they suggested that maybe I should work to fill that gap and write my own book.  That summer I tried to put a manuscript together.  I inevitably got distracted (oooh, grad school!) and shelved the book project entirely.  After finding these files again today, I took a look at a few of the chapters, and the one I wrote about my experiences with middle school and puberty just hit me like a ton of bricks.  HOLY SHIT 2007 me did a really good job articulating that I was nonbinary, even though I had no idea that others genders existed outside the male/female binary.  I didn't even know the word 'nonbinary.'  I had no idea other people felt the way I did.

Finding this chapter was both a revelation and a gift.  I'm not yet out to anyone except my therapist and reddit, but I wanted to share what I wrote back then with \*someone\* because this feels like such a monumental discovery.

>With the onset of puberty, my entire foundations were rocked. In my youth, I had derived comfort from sameness. The prospect of change and deviance from my comforting rituals terrified me. My personal motto was simply “Change is bad.”  
>  
>Autistics often find comfort in sameness and regularity. The new and unexpected are threatening and stressful. Temple Grandin likens this characteristic fear to a similar frame of mind she has sensed in cattle. Cows, especially in cattle chutes, are apprehensive of new objects and stimuli--for example, a strange shadow or jacket thrown across a fence--and if it was not there before and the cow has not been normalized and acclimatized to the stimulus, it is often spooked by the new experience.  
>  
>This cow-like state of mind was exactly where I fell around the age of twelve. I was in no way prepared for the drastic changes that would occur with puberty, and when my body began to change, I was completely unable to cope.  
>  
>For someone who so reviled and feared change, the very notion that my body, my actual self, was undergoing radical changes was the ultimate in horror. My body was rebelling against me. I was unable to stem the ever encroaching tidal wave of change, and it was as if the one thing I felt so secure with--myself, which had instituted the strict regime of non-change--was engaging in treason against me, engaging in the greatest no-no of all: transformation.  
>  
>What struck me as most terrifying was the fact that I was transforming from the state of being a child into being a woman. I did not want a woman’s body. I was used to and comfortable with my non-gendered child’s body. The very concept of breasts scared me beyond measure. I was not ready to give up my flat, androgynous child’s body. I was used to living a relatively non-gendered existence.  I had never given much thought to being one or the other, a girl or a boy. I was just me. I did not think about or care which category I fell into. I was what I was and gender identity and gender roles did not particularly enter into my frame of thought of self definition as a child.  
>  
>Therefore, the trauma of my traitorous body going and changing on me was compounded by the consuming fear that I was indeed female. I remember one particular instance in seventh grade, when our class had to split up by gender, so we could all get “The Talk,” and I was absolutely frantic. I felt I did not belong with the girls, but I did not feel I belonged with the boys either. It was not that I felt I was in the wrong body, I just felt I did not fit in either place. Nor did I want to be in either place. I was already embarrassed at the thought of the pending discussion of genitalia, and I was repulsed by the idea of the binary of male and female when I simply wanted to stay behind in the unsorted category of “child.”  
>  
>Gender had never been a big concern for me, and now with puberty, it was becoming a very big deal. Girls were becoming interested in boys, and dressing in less childlike clothing to show off their new shapes, and I was stubbornly digging my heels in against the impending tide of change. It was all around me, people adopting these new gender roles as they became aware of each other and the changes occurring, and I wanted nothing of it. I just wanted to be me, unaffected by being a he or a she. Just a me.  
>  
>I realized that I had several options. Either I was to embrace the change (not likely), ignore it entirely, or actively attempt to stop it. I opted for the latter choice. I cut my food intake dramatically, hoping that in denying my body nutrition, I could stunt its traitorous growth. I was on what was basically a starvation diet, attempting to keep the changes from occurring through extreme deprivation. This eating disorder was compounded by the fact that I was tremendously stressed by the new and horrific changes in my life, and one of the few things I could control was food. I ate practically the same meager meals every day: toast, rice and lettuce. My food intake was one of the few things I could control and derive comfort from in its sense of sameness.  
>  
>Yet somehow, despite my starved, skeletal state, my body continued to develop. I wore gigantically baggy clothing to hide the thing that caused me so much shame--not my own withered physique, but my disgusting *female* body that defied my every effort to keep it the way I wanted it... how I felt it was *meant* to be.  
>  
>I had increasing numbers of panic attacks because of my constant state of fear and edginess. What truly threw me over the edge, however, was the onset of “true womanhood”--my first menses. I mourned for days. There was no going back now. I really was a girl. I felt my childhood, and my life as I had grown to know it, were over. I had to accept this hideous role assigned by the girl-boy binary. But that did not mean I had to like it.  
>  
>The other girls in my class had long since undergone this pivotal change, probably since they were getting adequate nutrition, but the fact that was happening to me was in fact very normal and natural afforded me no comfort. It did not matter how natural the process was, or that it occurred in roughly half of the population. It was not what I wanted or what I was comfortable with, and I was consumed by a horrific sense of shame and an extreme feeling of filthiness.  
>  
>I remember my mother, noting the changes in my body, suggesting that we take a trip to a local department store to buy me a bra. To me, bras were just another symbol or marker of femininity and female status, and I dug my heels in with all my might. I recall running from her as she pulled the car out of the garage, retreating in a fit of tears and panic to the orchard, hiding from both her and the villainous bras in a bramble patch.  
>  
>Whenever she would attempt to coerce me into the department store, perhaps under the pretense of purchasing socks or some other trifling, non-gendered item of clothing, I would experience perhaps some of the worst meltdowns of my life. These were knock-down, drag-out fully-blown autistic meltdowns. Screaming, kicking, you name it. I was thirteen.  
>  
>My mother, of course, could not understand what my objection to bras was. Most girls my age were more than happy to don the garment, excited about their new bodies. I was completely unable to articulate my fears to my mother, only truly aware of a sense of extreme and inescapable panic and dread, whenever anything remotely touching upon my changing body and new responsibility as a gendered being was brought up. I just knew that I wanted to run, or scream, or better yet, just disappear.

I suppose it was incredibly eggy of 2007 me to have written this and not put 2 and 2 together and realized I'm not cis.  But I didn't have the words or the terminology to articulate this extreme sense of otherness I have always felt.  I guess I just feel like I found definitive 'evidence' of me being nonbinary, lol.  Like I'm some kind of archaeologist and I just unearthed a precious artifact that proves all my hypotheses... but at the same time I'm crying, because I wish I would have had the words to define myself all those years ago.  Things would have been SO much easier."	"Thank you for sharing this life experience with us. I resonate quite a bit. The insight you have given me into my own childhood is quite vast. You are a wonderful human. Your vulnerability is not in vain! 💗
Hey, thanks for sharing something so personal with us; we really emphasize with a lot of the points and experiences past-you had. We might've been able to write the exact same thing if we were any sort of functioning in '07. We're autistic too, and on some level we always knew we had some gender 'wrongness' since... basically the start of puberty, but honestly, till we were introduced to the Non-Binary term/ideals, nothing really felt right at all, we sat around doing mostly nothing with the feeling except feeling horribly non-comfortable with our self. We just wanted to stay like 10/11 years old, in our nice, mostly-non-gendered, child body. We hated all of it.   


Though--We differed in that we tried to lean into it... guessed it was gonna happen anyways? Turns out: Totally doesn't work either XD. Ended up massively depressed, about 150LBs over a healthy weight, with a dissociative disorder.  


Doing a lot better now!!
thanks for sharing :) i hope it will help a lot of people out
What a find! It's always amazing to see people knowing themselves, even when they don't have the full language to describe how they feel..

If you haven't read it yet, check out Uncomfortable Labels by Laura Kate Dale. It covers her experience as an autistic gay trans woman and might resonate with you. It's still on my to read list, but the rest of her work is amazing so I'm excited to find time to read it. Much love."	tt92rs	NonBinary	17	1.0	2022-03-31 20:35:38
Getting misgendered in NYC	"I spent the last 24hrs running all around the city and the whole day was magic in all sorts of ways. 

Far from my first time there but it’s still new enough that I appreciate (probably toooo much) the unique little exchanges that happen with strangers. There were a couple, though, that specifically stood out and have been really empowering even though they technically shouldn’t be.(?) 

All of these things would have made me cringe not even a year ago, yesterday wasn’t the case. 

Right off the bat I was walking around Chelsea and got some cat calls from people on the street and in cars. Some of it was them hitting on me, some of it was them yelling sissy, all of it felt good? 

I’ve been presenting more androgynously and throughout the day (but especially in SoHo?) I was called sir, miss, him, her, and often heard storekeepers yell, “have a nice day ladies!” Or something to that effect. Months ago any of those comments would have made me feel shame and frustration but now it’s like a complete change. 

Still need to process it all, I slept for maybe an hour on my childhood best friend’s bed in Brooklyn. 

TL;DR: I got comments from strangers and occasionally mistaken for a girl the whole time and it was actually pretty sickkkk✌🏼"	"So I’ve noticed the votes on this post fluctuating a good bit and am wondering about what sort of opinions it’s causing? 

Genuine question, because I still don’t know how to feel about it all myself and it seems to be making some feel one way or another."	dccvo8	NonBinary	17	0.96	2019-10-02 16:48:41
I feel great with graphic artistic makeup, it's a shame that i'm not confident enough and too scared of being misgendered to wear it everyday.		Broskiiiii you are fuckin gorgeous! I know confidence is hard to find, hell, I‘m really not the most confident person. You will find confidence one day homie just hang in there. But very nice makeup!

Less than a year in	"I’m over thirty.
I’m a mom.
I’m a wife.

I realized nearly a year ago that little things in my life added up to my being non binary. When I was little, I had a deeper voice than most and never felt comfortable playing the princess or being dainty. As I got older I grew into my femininity to a point. It never felt right though. I felt like I was too big for my skin, pretending to be a girl or a woman but I never identified as a boy. Then I started reading about gender theory in grad school. We didn’t have the word “non-binary” then. We’d say “ambiguous gender identity” and that seemed comfort but shameful. A year ago I went to see a psychiatrist and she asked about my gender and sexuality. I easily said “pansexual” but then she said “Okay so cis-pan—got it.” That’s when I paused and realized that that term felt wrong. I’m not cis—I don’t identify with my sex assigned at birth anymore than the car I drive or my brand of toothpaste I use. It’s liberating especially when I bought a shirt that said “Femmes can be thems” and a pin with my pronouns (they/them)."	"Thank you for sharing, and good luck on that exciting new step in your journey! I'm happy that you've even found some merch :D
Thank you. I bought the shirt with money my transphobic bio father gave me which makes it doubly satisfying.
Indeed. Money very well-spent, if you ask me!
It’s super comfy too! I love a good t-shirt!"	gqees7	NonBinary	15	0.94	2020-05-25 16:46:29
Can we normalize not responding“it’s fine” when people apologize?	"This isn’t even community specific… but I feel like gender non-conforming communities are in these situations farrrr more than others (whether it’s after intrusive/inappropriate questions, in/unintentionally disrespectful statements, ppl who chronically misgender you, etc.)

I know it is a knee jerk reaction to just say, “it’s fine/ it’s okay/ no worries,” when people apologize… buuuuutttt it’s really not. 
And I don’t mean it in a way that you are like holding a grudge or trying to make someone feel bad/ shame them. 
It just the principle of the matter: it is not your job/responsibility to absolve someone of their guilt after they fucked up. I think most of the time the apology is just to make the guilty party feel better, not the person on the receiving end of their shitty behavior. 

Alternative suggestions: 
- Thank you for your apology.
- I appreciate you apologizing. 
- I accept your apology [idk why but this one feels awk to me but is a perfectly fine response]

You can make it more specific and end with food for thought:
- I appreciate that you are taking responsibility for your words/actions and I hope this experience will help you avoid making the same mistake in the future. 
^there are many iterations of this

Lastly… if you do feel the need to assuage their guilt in some way (if they are truly sorry or it was unintentional or you are trying to dispel any potential weirdness from them in the future ) i think there is a big difference btw “It’s fine/okay” and “I am fine” …. Or even “we are fine”
-To me, “it’s fine” almost implies that they did nothing wrong or have nothing to be sorry for.
- But “I am fine” is more of a statement acknowledging that they put their foot in their mouth, but you are not allowing their carelessness to bring you down. I also like to follow this up with “I am fine+ BUT I hope this experience will help you avoid making a similar in the future or putting someone else (who might not be fine) in this position.”

~ IMO ”we are fine” usually entails more of a personal conversation or statement about your relationship to the person (personal, professional, etc), e.g. “we are fine, I appreciate you apologizing and also acknowledging/respecting my POV.  I understand that you didn’t mean any harm and I am glad we had this conversation so we can just move past this. ” 

Anyway… that’s just something that bothers me when I see other ppl being disrespected and then they are stuck in the uncomfy position of having to excuse someone else’s bad behavior for the sake of civility. I think these are some good ways to respond and deescalate while still holding people accountable. 

Shout out if you have any other ways you like to respond :) or just anything you need to clear!
{clearing: getting something off your chest in a safe space so you can acknowledge it and leave it behind}

☺️☺️☺️"	"I absolutely understand this sentiment, and I agree we should be more intentional about wording. I’m absolutely using these suggestions, although I usually just want to get it over with and go back to the conversation without making it a big deal. It really sucks that a lot of the time you have to choose between correcting someone and possibly damaging your interpersonal relationship or just excusing it.
Honestly I tend to always respond that for the simple reason that I want them to stop?

Like, I really don't want people to apologize for misgendering me, I want them to not do it again you know? So my normal response is 100% ""It's fine, just don't do it again.""

It's just... way more uncomfortable when someone apologizes, and the bigger a deal they make about it the more I just want to move on :v 

IDK I guess at the end of the day I just super don't care if they feel guilty or whatever. If someone has done something unintentionally wrong it legitimately is fine, I trust that they'll do better next time, and if they've done it intentionally or knowingly wrong then they're awful and apologizing isn't going to help that, I'd rather move on and remove them from my life. Just my two cents :)
Yea, I feel like for mid-conversation misgendering it’s like, “it’s fine, move on please😅” but if it’s like… ok we need to have a talk about using my correct pronouns (with a chronic offender).

Huh, reading back… what if instead of it “it’s fine” when you’re mid convo and just trying to quickly move passed the err you just give a quite little “thanks,” tiny head nod and just keep going. Same principle still applies.
I agree with you. I think there are certain things like misgendering that can be just a purely accidental slip, so I don’t think it always falls into this category. 

I mean full disclosure I’m not even out to most people and I also tend to take a very Australian approach where I just don’t take anything personally. I am very protective of others but kinda just don’t give a shit when it comes to me. 

But I was thinking about this in areas of my life (outside of my gender identity) and then I came across a few posts that made me feel like this might be helpful to others in this community."	sbe40b	NonBinary	14	0.89	2022-01-24 05:13:24
NonBinaryProblems: Bra shopping when your boobs are 300 km away	So, I ran into a very nice bra in a department store today. It was a longline sort of model and they had the size that should be bang on for me in stock, which normally just doesn't happen with longline bras. The thing is, however, that I have felt pretty masculine the past few days and hence didn't bring my breastforms when I went to visit some friends back where I grew up, meaning that my boobs, which I really do need to determine whether or not a bra is indeed the right size, were over 300 km away. I ended up not buying the bra because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it if it ended up not being the right size. It's a shame though, because I really liked the look of it!	"I'd love it if some people shared some of their more light-hearted NonBinaryProblems in the comments as well!
I've often wanted to start a ""inconsequential advantages"" thread. My wife says the biggest is not leaving the seat up.
Personally I would have gone for it, I've bought quite a bit of stuff and ended up either returning or exchanging it if it didn't fit or I couldn't get away with wearing it.  Then again it's usually from Kohl's and their store is less than a mile from our house so it's not that much of a hassle for me.

My biggest problem is being stuck in this conservative state and not being able to express myself outside of my own home as much as I would like sometimes.  I've been growing my hair out for 2 years now, it's probably about shoulder blade length and I absolutely love it!  Problem is one of the guys I work with is constantly giving me shit for it and has taken to calling me a hippy, which couldn't be any farther from the truth.  I get along with the guy and I know he's just messing around and all, but I'm not a f-ing hippy.

My second biggest issue is my mom.  I prefer women's jeans over men's, I like the way they fit and I love how they make my a-- look probably just as much as my wife does.  I have a few pairs I really love and that I can get away with wearing, some even to work.  Unfortunately my mom just assumes that all my jeans are too small for me and last year went and bought me new ones - which I very VERY rarely ever wear, I think I may have worn them once.  I acted like I loved them and thanked her but I really, REALLY hate men's jeans.  They're too loose and baggy, they don't accentuate my body, and I don't find them even remotely flattering.  
If you ever run into this situation again, just go for it! Returning the bra is a hassle, but really only a minor inconvenience in the long run 

And since you did say so, for me, a NonBinaryProblem is forgetting my binder so throwing on an extra shirt and walking/running *really* close to the ground so as not to jiggle anything (which I find more funny than anything)
I would have to say my wife also considers this an advantage, she doesn't ever have to worry about falling in during a midnight bathroom run.  On a medical note awhile back I read an article that said that the human body was not designed to pee standing up, that it may cause prostate problems and could actually be one of the leading causes of erectile dysfunction.
Normally I would agree with you, but this particular department store no longer has a branch near where I live. And since I'm not planning to go back to my hometown for at least another 4 weeks, returning it wouldn't be easy. 

Haha! Took me a while to figure out what you meant:p I envisioned someone sliding across the ground at first:p Thanks for sharing!"	857x8g	NonBinary	14	0.95	2018-03-18 00:28:23
I Don't Know Where To Begin	"So this is going to be a long one. I'll put a TL;DR at the end.   


I'm 22, and just finally came out to my boyfriend as nonbinary. He is one of two people who know. But he is the first person I have told that it would directly affect.   


I have known that I wasn't just a girl since I was in my early teens. I learned what trans was and thought for sure that that was me. I don't know why, but I knew that it had to be me. I was probably 14 when I came out to my mom as trans. She lost it. She wouldn't allow it. She sobbed and sobbed, and made me feel so guilty. So I did what I always do. I tried to make it easier for everyone around me and just clammed it all up.   


I ended up having to do the same thing about being bisexual when I was 16, because someone in my christian choir group found out and told my youth pastor who told my mom. There was a family intervention, and I closeted myself again.   


Overtime I did realize that trans wasn't quite for me. I didn't really want to have a penis or lose my boobs. I just didn't feel like a girl all the time. I still kept it well squished down. In fact for the last 8 years I've avoided watching videos about it or looking at things. I did on occasion, but felt so much shame and pain that I decided to just avoid it.   


I have a beautiful boyfriend who is amazing to me. I can't believe I've found him. But I've kept this a secret from him too. I thought I could just keep doing this. Just keep pretending I'm just a girl and thats it. But I could feel myself becoming unhappy. I can feel this need to be free but I can't act on it. After all, what straight man would want an NB person for a partner? I really didn't think he'd get it. Especially by some of the things he's said in the past. (to be fair though, I fed into it trying to protect myself.)   


But it turns out, he is in fact not straight. I found out just a few days ago that he is bisexual. I was the second person to ever know. So i only felt it was fair that I told him my secret (he already knew i was bi). He was totally okay with it. He was actually so casual about it it struck me. It was the most anticlimactic thing, right next to paint drying (im not mad about it). I also realized it was the first time I really got to come out, and not be outted.   


  


So now that I know hes okay with it, and that I can do this.... I'm still terrified. I still have so much internal transphobia (I don't think thats the right term. I'm not trans). I've just fought myself about this for so long and now suddenly I don't have to anymore and I don't even know how to handle it.   


I have myself convinced I would be ugly as a boy, that i can't pass, and that people will hate me if i try. I was made to feel like something was wrong with me for so long I still feel like there is. Like I shouldn't be this way. I'm trying to break free. I want to break free. I just don't know how. 

&#x200B;

does anyone have any advice or their own story to share? I don't know where to begin with myself. Feel like I'm trapped inside a body that isn't mine. I don't know how to fix it. I don't even know how i can express the masculine side of me.   


TL;DR closeted NB finally came out to someone in their real life and is having a bit of a crisis over being able to express themselves  
"	"It takes a long time and lots of positive reenforcement to feel strong enough to come out. Rely on strong positive sources amd use that to slowly find yourself. Looking up other NB people, read their blogs, watch videos, soak it in. I know it hurts at first but it will get you thru that fear and educate you. You aren't alone. 

I know you said you aren't trans, but being NB is covered by the trans umbrella too. I am also NB and thought theres no way I could be trans. ""Not trans enough."" In time I found a comfortable place under the term. Even if you don't want to transition, doesnt mean you don't belong. I encourage you to read trans blogs as well, for they all have very similar stories. 

In the end, look to other sources to open up and I hope that makes you feel more at ease with your identity.

You're totally right. I need to start allowing myself to learn, and get comfortable with who I am. It was so scary for so long. I don't have to be scared anymore though. 
This is really insightful and totally spot on. Like i went to downstairs and instinctively closed the tab to here even though hes 1. asleep, and 2. knows. Thank you so much ;u;
No you don't. I know I felt so loved reading about all the other people out there, and their shared experiences. I hope you can too. "	b8cw4j	NonBinary	14	0.95	2019-04-02 01:56:27
A Vase	"
A glass vase on a table 

Would be a shame if it was pushed

No one ever would be able

to fix a vase once it’s mushed. 


it falls and shatters all around 

the shards disperse and break. 

pieces of vase fall on the ground 

and cut those who try to take. 


i arrange all the best pieces together, 

tossing the ones that dont fit; 

removing miss, she, her. 

Now a mosaic, im proud of it. 


they ask for the art with the rest of the vase 

they get mad; they gave me those pieces!

i say i dont need the mismatched base

the dust, the edges, the creases


they put the pieces in but the shards hurt the art

they dont fit in there now, dont you get it? 

the mosaic cant take more or itll fall apart! 

i threw those away! cant you forget it? "	Amazing!	a6wepy	NonBinary	14	1.0	2018-12-17 04:17:05
Sorry if this is kinda heavy but. Do other people who are trans/non-binary feel guilty for it? Or shameful. Like I know me as a little kid was a girl but I’m not. And I feel like I should be a “normal” person? I’m really struggling with small bits of euphoria and waves of self hatred		"Yes I think this is normal but I hope you do not continue to live with the shame. Realization is rough and eventually you find a place where you accept yourself more. Having some kind of support system is good
I totally had that feeling, too! I definitely was a little girl. But now? I’m nonbinary. Just like I was a child, and now I’m an adult. I have stayed the same on some things, like being an artist. I’ve changed on some things too, like how i now like mushrooms, but I didn’t when I was younger. 

Once I realized that, I started to feel better towards me as a kid. She’s great just how she was being a girl, I didn’t “miss” something. Or if I did, it didn’t bother me! She’s just a little buddy, and I’m older and protective of her.
[deleted]
Ahaha oh you hit the nail on the head for me. That’s exactly how I feel, plus some shame regarding my family that’s so big and I’m seemingly the only trans person.
When I was a teen, my mom basically told me that if I pretended to be normal, I'd avoid going to hell. I still fight those feelings at almost 40 years old.
Yeah. Thank you. I really am struggling with slot of it and I think I need to get some professional help
Yeah. I’ve been working on that myself. She was a little girl. And with my stuff. It’s a lot of reminding myself there was nothing wrong with her and I’m not wrong either. We are just different and I have to be kind to her and me
Thank you. You almost made me cry. I really needed that. Just good to not be alone
Yeah. I’m glad I’m not alone. I’m working on it but it’s hard ya know?
Yeah. I just. I know it’s just me. I know my family will accept me or have to deal with it because my mom aggressively just wants me to be happy. It’s just my own fear. Guilt. And just. Self hatred
Exactly, 100% - you know exactly what you need, it’s just a hard thing to do. You got this!
Thank you. It’s just good to not feel alone so thank you"	rsimg2	NonBinary	14	1.0	2021-12-31 02:05:38
I feel so damn wrong...	"I'm amab, enby, and sorta, well maybe fluid is more apt but the crux of shit is that I feel like presenting as cis male is a 'lie' and presenting femme is a 'fraud'. 

I'm huge, hairy, and I mean, I can drift into chunky andro territory but, like, today I had a major site meeting, hosting a dozen contractors for a bid kick-off and I just put it all away and presented completely male. Button up, jeans, safety boots, at best I got a ponytail happening but that ain't exactly screaming 'wooo femme'. For this job I've got 30 guys in a room, total sausage party, and I just couldn't. I had to hide, and it makes me feel like I'm living a complete lie. This is happening more and more when I drop into boymode. IT's either I'm terrified or I'm exhausted, like when I had the flu I just couldn't put any effort into the upkeep required to knock back the masc (shave, tuck, wear anything but t-shirt and sweatpants). 

I manage to bring some femme into my daily life, I am on HRT, I am growing teh boobs, I have long hair and want it longer, I tuck and generally am in jeggings, yoga pants or the like. 

But, a line I cross where I feel, frankly, like a fraud. That I'm not really trans, that I'm just a sorta life-crippled pretender, because frankly I'll never pass. I love dresses, I love skirts, I wish to god my shoulders weren't so broad (and hairy) so I could feel comfy with off-the-shoulder stuff. 

Still, even with decent makeup and a denim dress and as much femme as I can pump into my plump-bodied gender-addled frame I still feel like I'm totally fucking full of shit because I'm not doing electro (can't really afford it right now) and I'm not probably ever going to make it into a 'full' transition. I'm not even sure it's possible at my age (42, I'm that weird old enby). 

Pardon the rambling, pardon the bullshit, I just, I talked about this with my pshrink today but it's still a thorn in my side. I don't know if I'm more torn up about not being able to pass, or that the world isn't really open to enbies who just fuckin' well publicly fail at gender. 

It doesn't help that fear leads to hiding, and then shame and guilt for not having more gumption, and then just straight damn sadness because this is all so freakin' hard. I try to follow my heart, but shit is fucked yo."	"My experience has been, and ive said this in another post, is celebrating myself. You should do the exact same thing. 

Celebrate yourself. 

I dont know that focusing on passing helps. I know it would frustrate me (because I wont ever pass, too much balding). 

Focus on acceptance and expression instead. Fact of the matter is , the only opinion about how you look that matters....is your own.

I have to boy mode myself during the day, but at night at home, its 100% girl mode all the way. But unlike you I am not a transition candidate nor will I be. And my partner, who is supportive of my journey, is behind me 100%. 

For me it is when I look in the mirror (and this took a long time for me to accept and embrace) I see a beautiful woman. No matter how Im dressed or what I look like. It is entirely a mental thing, and the physical stuff will take a hold later and work itself out. Whatever that means. Like you I love feminine clothing (Torrid loves me Im sure), and I love how it  makes me feel.  And I think that Im a gorgeous woman no matter what happens. 

We all have your back here. Hugs.
I'm afab and in an all female work environment, and my experience has been similar. It's super frustrating and invalidating to be stuck in a place that can feel so invisible. Some days it seems like no matter how hard I try, the people around me will always only see me as a woman, will never stop treating me like a girly girl despite everything I do to avoid being gendered, which can be discouraging because it can sometimes feel like there isn't a place in the world for nonbinary people. But finding more queer people to interact with outside of work has been helpful for me, and society's understanding of nb folks expands every day. It's never too late to be yourself, whether that's at work or outside of work. I get the thing about feeling like a pretender. Sometimes it can feel like living a double life, even if you're not actually pretending but just playing it safe- I actually had a nightmare a few days ago about a colleague finding out I'm nb. My point is, though, you're not alone in any of this, and we and the rest of the community are here to support you in any way we can. Keep on fighting, my friend. It's worth it.

This is one of the things that helped me so much. When I started transition it was as a trans woman, and there's pretty much always been a TON of pressure placed on passing. For years, I did what society said I needed to do in order to 'pass' as a woman, even though it didn't feel like me. It became another mask I hid behind, just like boy-mode before it, because when I didn't go through that, the world realized I was trans.

When I realized I'm nonbinary and stopped caring about passing, I felt a lot better. There's still shitty unaccepting people, there's still people who assume I'm a cis woman, but I'm actually happy with what I see when I look in the mirror, and I have friends and family that are happy for me. I realized I didn't so much mind people knowing I'm trans, what I minded was the treatment that usually came with it.

Finally I can look in the mirror and be happy with myself, because I'm just being myself.

nuance in gender: nby-phobia within the trans community	"obligatory delete if not allowed


I recently came to terms with myself being at least partially nonbinary. Personally I consider myself to be a nonbinary man (ftm+nby). I'm on T, present masc, pass, he/him. All the earmarks of being a binary trans male. Except spiritually i consider myself a little more than that. It's really hard to explain and I never expect anyone else to fully understand it. I've considered myself ftm for four years now and I feel like I relate 99% to binary ftm experiences. 

I made the mistake of trying to explain this in one ftm sub bc OP was having questions about gender and I was trying to use myself as an example. Well sweet lord almighty that brought out a bunch of angry guys. At first I didn't blame them, I did say I was nonbinary. However in the following replies i probably said I was a man 5+ times. It got to the point where it definitely felt transphobic? Like if someone tells you they're a man, you're supposed to *believe them*?? And I pointed out that it was similar to a cis person not understanding them. Well anyway I didn't want discourse to continue, I'm 25 for gods' sake i don't need that, so I blocked them and moved on... mostly lol. (I'm not trying to play the ageist card but it does seem like most guys who act like this are under 21 I'm just saying) 

Anywho, moral of the story it really made me aware fully of the nby-phobia within the trans community. I've seen multiple comments elsewhere shaming nby ppl and seeing ftms trying to distance themselves from nbies. It just seems really strange to me? Like at least for nonbinary people like me who consider themselves to at least be partially male/female, I'd wager our experiences line up at least 75%. We're all on the same team. 

Not saying this is true for every binary guy, but it feels like a lot of them got caught up in transmedicalist ideas and now view anyone who isn't exactly like them as non trans. 

I feel like gender is a lot more nuanced than a lot of binary people, cis or trans, want to admit. I'm not saying the binary doesn't exist I'm simply saying it's more wibbly wobbly fluidity than just: male, female, other. I am not ""other"". I'm not fully male either. To quote Garnet, I am an experience. 

Does anyone else have experiences online with nby-phobia and how did y'all deal with it?"	"Just gonna make this plain:  This sub does not tolerate transmedicalist, truscum, or exclusionary views that demand one somehow qualify one's gender by transitioning exactly as proscripted by whatever gatekeeper is demanding it today, ESPECIALLY as any category that revolves around the binary of the Common Two genders in western culture.

Non-binary is real, doesn't need to relate itself to the binary in any way to be valid, and can overlap with other genders in a variety of ways. If you think you should be here as part of your gender, you are welcome.
transmedicalists especially have a strict view of what constitutes as being a ""true"" trans man, even with others who are not at all nonbinary. it's a very toxic mindset to have, and an irritating one to run into. blocking people like that truly is self-care.
Oh gosh I'm also a nonbinary guy and I'm kinda relieved almost hearing another person talk about it, makes me feel less alone- if I were to describe it in the ""best"" way possible it's like I'm a boy but in another font, a different ""type"" of boy so to speak. Still difficult to explain or for people to understand though I get that.

I always felt like I was in a strange spot where I feel like I fit in *both* spaces, like whenever a topic comes up and I speak up I mention I'm a trans guy or nonbinary depending on the day or whatever is relevant, both are true for me but I'd get worried doing this mainly due to the expectations people have-

That trans spaces are rigid, that gender is rigid and if you're xyz you can't be this or be *here*, do this or say that etc just gatekeepy bullshit. It's hard being ""both"" and not feeling like you're """"invading spaces"""" when you have a more nuanced thing going on. Same situation with my sexuality, I consider myself gay and you already know how some people online take to nonbinary ppl iding with gay/lesbian so :/ 


I don't think I've directly had to deal with bs yet but I've watched nbyphobia from afar yes- It *does* feel like other trans people view us as the ""weird ones"" or the less trans ones and distance themselves as much as possible like you said- turning it into Us vs Them. Even if people don't outright say anything, you can FEEL the tension and the quiet hostility if that makes sense.

Back then I used to engage and be a very argumentative person but nowadays I have little to no energy for that nonsense, if someone went after my existence I'd just remind myself ""I don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for this"" and just block / move on.

I only educate if someone is open to listening.
The internet collects a lot of hot takes, because it’s the nature of the medium. We’re most likely to be motivated to post when we’re in a hot take frame of mind. The more chill a person is, the more likely they are to keep their peace.

So I personally try to let it roll off my back. That shit ain’t paying rent so it’s got no business living in my head.
I completely agree that the nb-phobia is rampant in the trans community, and especially the trans man community. I saw a thread the other day that really fucked me up, where trans guys were saying that 'trans-masc' (as in, afab nbs who leaned masculine and used that term to identify with) wasn't a real thing, that the only 'real' genders were cis, trans and nb (as in, some nonattainable, perfect androgyny neutral) and that any nbs who used terms like transmasc or transfemme to describe themselves were just cis and needed help because they were confused and needed to grow up. 

Being black and nonbinary, and as an afab nb who does, in fact, strongly identify as transmasc, that shit's not ok. There are already such limited spaces where I am allowed to comfortably and safely exist, and to find out that I can't even exist within my own supposed 'community' is beyond fucked up. Especially in this day and age. The world tears us apart enough, it'd be nice if we didn't do the same.
I had a binary trans ""friend"" who used to make me feel very invalidated. She used to frequent the truscum subreddit and although she said she left, a lot of the things she said about non binary people were really awful and transphobic. 
Even though I am much further along in my transition, she treated me like I was a confused baby transmasc and suggested I go to gender therapy. She also treated me like my AGAB when I rejected her idea of being trans. 

I find this is a problem in general with trans liberation spaces that arent based in transfeminist decolonial theory.  Gender self determination is such an important topic but many people are reserved to being trapped by the ""only two sex / genders and they are permanently ingrained in you at birth"" terf culture. Lots of people way too wrapped up in the mythos. Its very frustrating.

Anwyay im sorry you had to deal with that. I hope this year is better for you!

There is a fairly sizable portion of the non-cis community that can get extremely toxic. Honestly I usually avoid most of the community because of that. This,sub is usually really cool though and wholesome.

I have almost been in fist fights form things I've heard said about nb's, decent cis people (my husband is one so that made me see red), and anyone that is nor an extremist. The minute I bring my cis friends and partner in and people scoff in disgust is the minute I walk on and spit behind me.

There's also a portion of the community that's really chill and supportive though. I do have some Trans friends that are wonderful people and,they,are consideredfamily. It's discouraging but it's not everyone. Don't be afraid to defend yourself within reason and show them they picked the wrong person to mess with.
I've noticed a lot of really drastic purity testing from some of the youngest queer folk, trans men included, and there's better articles that explain what, but I don't have any on HAND... aaaah   why when I am ... uh. NYE'd.
Yeah… I’ve noticed there’s a general pushback in the broader trans community against a lot of things that should be no-brainers. There’s a lot of distrust of intersex people, for instance, as though the existence of mosaics or mutants is somehow endorsing transmedicalism. Or, because the intersex experience isn’t “standard”, it’s somehow invalidating binary trans people’s experiences. 

I dunno. There seems to be a lot of opinions about the “right way” to be trans, even among tucute circles. A lot of low-key toxicity, too. It sucks. Gender is a weird, wonderful, wild world, and I can’t fathom why anyone would feel the need to draw lines around it and claim “this is all there is.” 

😪
Oh it wasn't in this sub! I love this sub. Just venting.
Blocking is indeed self care lol
I'm glad I'm not alone! Sorry tho, it sucks. Its definitely strange to feel both binary and nonbinary. Personally I don't even know if ""nonbinary"" actually fits me. In doing some quick research I've found that the two suffixes supra- or epi- could work to mean ""above the binary"" but I don't want to sound arrogant when talking about my gender lol
I agree to an extent. I usually try to not initiate conflict. But in this instance I was simply defending myself. But you're right, it's impossible to get through to close minded people.
I think I might have seen that post too. I think at a certain point, some people just put us down to feel better about themselves to prove to cis ppl they're ""the good ones"" i hope you are doing ok now
Sorry your ""friend"" did that to you. I'm lucky that no one irl has done that to me. Just online. So I try to not let it get to me. 

>""only two sex / genders and they are permanently ingrained in you at birth"" terf culture.

This bit bothers me so much. I hate that people are so.... restricted. I don't want binary people to be invalidated but I want the binary to not be the default, ya know?
Exactly. They seem to take their anger out on us, which isn't fair
>Don't be afraid to defend yourself within reason and show them they picked the wrong person to mess with.

Oh absolutely. I give the haters a piece of my mind.
It definitely seems to lean towards young trans folk. Like 21 and under from my experience. Happy New Year!
>There’s a lot of distrust of intersex people

I'm new ish to reddit so I haven't seen any of this! How horrible. 

>Or, because the intersex experience isn’t “standard”, it’s somehow invalidating binary trans people’s experiences. 

This literally makes no sense how could anyone possibly think this?

>Gender is a weird, wonderful, wild world, and I can’t fathom why anyone would feel the need to draw lines around it and claim “this is all there is.” 

Big agree. People should just accept whatever gender someone says they are. It's not hard??
We do try to make this a welcoming, thoughtful sub, but we rely on our users to report what's fishy, so please do report anything that needs it if there's ever a problem. 

I know sometimes people feel distress over not being enby ""enough"", etc. and I don't want anyone to think they don't belong here because they can call themselves masc-leaning (for example). I'm glad to have a varied community with every stripe of non-binary person, to be honest, as it keeps us more aware that we're not a monolith and makes it easier to be respectful of one another's differences. 

The only people who should feel unwelcome here are bigots and dickwaffles, and I personally am willing to consider an apology from most dickwaffles once they are done behaving like clowns and might eventually let them back in. (Just in case any previous trolls ever feel remorse!)
Someone once told me, ""You can’t reason someone out of an opinion that they didn’t reason themselves into in the first place.”
Thank you, I appreciate that! I'm doing better now but yeah it was brutal. I just wish I could have said something to counter them but with so many folks agreeing it just really crushed me. I have to keep reminding myself that at the end of the day the only person's opinion that matters is mine and try and not let it get to me.
[removed]
Same. I'm actually trying to hold back a bit though due to being over aggressive when somethingis started with me. I won't start a fight but if one is started with me I tend to go in for the kill out of anger, which is not something you should be doing or really considering without it being self defense. Emotionally same but that's not usually as bad.

I grew up in a bad home where I was literally launching myself at my larger brother in retaliation or self defense of my mom. I won but it was a borderline to the death fight once or twice where the cops where almost called. Abusive households will do that to ya.

I need to learn the within reason part. It sticks that a lot for the community seems to have gone through similar stuff. Therapy has helped so much
Ahh gotcha! I do report anything I see if it's fishy, no remorse here lol but so far not in this sub. I definitely like having a variety of experiences to talk about here. Also I love the word dickwaffles lol
Oh that's good I like that. Thx
Absolutely. No one else is entitled to an opinion on your gender!
Yeah definitely mostly online. I think being online emboldens them
It's a fun word for sure! I like the combination of medium vulgarity with high absurdity.

Am I the only one really uncomfortable with the idea that a partner might see my body as 'binary gendered' (female)?	"Just want to start this off by saying I’m not trying to attack anyone with preferences when it comes what body parts or anatomy they are attracted to, and that this isn’t primarily about that. 

I know nonbinary people have different thoughts and feelings re: how they would like their partner(s) to view and interact with their bodies. And it seems quite common for enby’s to prioritize their partner acknowledging their gender identity, but not mind them being attracted to their bodies in a gendered way that corresponds with the general preference of the partner’s sexual orientation (e.g. being attracted to ‘female’ bodies for lesbians and straight men). And I’m happy that these enbies are happy, but when I think about this issue in regards to myself, I just feel really uncomfortable with that? 

For background info, I’m agender (genderless) and AFAB. I don’t often experience dysphoria but it seems to manifest pretty strongly at the idea that a potential partner may secretly or even openly be attracted to me only because of my proximity to either binary gender. That the only reason they physically find me attractive is because I look like a ‘girl’ or because they find my body attractive because of its female parts. I understand most people, especially cis monosexuals, are only used to thinking about and experiencing attraction in a binary way, because people register to them as either attractive Women™ or Men™, or having attractive Women™ or Men™ features. And so even with nonbinary people, it can feel like the strongest attraction they feel is to the parts they gender in a binary way, while tolerating the other gender stuff. And that just really bothers me. Again, not because I’m criticizing anyone else’s partner, if you’re happy that’s all that matters, but more because this just makes me very dysphoric. I would hate to feel gendered in that way by my partner. I don’t deny my sex is female, and I’m not at all trying to shame people who like female body parts because they primarily associate them with women, but I’m not a woman and I would hate to feel like my partner only liked those parts because they were unconsciously or consciously making that association. Having a partner intellectually acknowledge that I’m nonbinary and have that not fully reflect in their attraction to me (instead ‘treating’ me like a woman) makes me dysphoric. Having partners only be attracted to me if I fit into the narrow confines of a binary gendered presentation makes me dysphoric. I’m wondering whether it’s even possible for me to find someone who loves me and my body without immediately gendering them, or at the very least, without gendering them in a binary way. Because if they do gender my body in a binary way via their attraction, it feels like they're saying '‘I respect that you think you are nonbinary, but in all the ways that count I see you as a woman and like the parts of you that I experience as belonging to a woman’. Anyone else relate? Is it unusual to feel this way?"	"This is why I feel like I need an Enby partner. I need someone who sees me for me and not as a transwoman. Someone who loves that I'm not either gender in body and mind. I feel like it takes someone who also experiences it the same way.
I also feel pretty much like that. One of my biggest worries about being in couple would be that my partner thinks of me as a man and treats me as non-binary only to make me happy. But sadly that’s not something that can really be verified, so the only thing that could be done is to trust them. That’s one of the reason I’m not into dating even if I’d like to find a partner. That would be so hard to find someone that I can really trust on that but that’s a criteria I just can’t give up on because otherwise it would make me dysphoric and anxious.
I'm am bisexual and I find androgynous people very attractive. My idea of a perfect partner would be a tomboy or a transman but I would sill like them to have fairly feminine features. This is what it means to be agender to me. To express both masculinity and femininity simultaneously. I see your male features and you female features and that combination make you the attractive person you are.
I find it interesting that you put trans men in with tomboys that feels a bit weird because most trans men are more similar to cis men than they are to tomboys. At least in my opinion, I mean they are men. I am an androgyne myself but that feels a bit off or 'best of both worlds' like which most trans men and women are not particularly fond of and veers into cissexism for me.
That's what being agender is to some people but not to all of us. Agender doesn't automatically mean you are androgynous. It just means (amongst other things) that you are genderless. I'm fairly feminine and AFAB, and have no real plans to change that. I don't have a combination of 'male features and female features', I just have stereotypically female festures that I would prefer people did not view as inherently feminine or womanly. It's nice to know that there are people who find androgyny attractive, but I would avoid projecting that standard onto other agender people.
Androgyny is the opposite of Agender. Agender is the absence of either gender, Androgyny is the presence of both genders.
Apologies for my last statement genderless people are not nothing. i dont know what it means to be genderless.  I do know i consider myself non binery, I'm still new to all this. Also i find genderless people to be very attractive and someone like a drag queen to be very unattractive. Not too  yuk on anyone's yum or anything,  your all good  people.
Also I am agender not genderless. I feel the absence of something is nothing. I'm not nothing, I am a unique combination of masculine and feminine features.
This is different from my experience.

When I'm in my Agender mode I feel empty of gender. As though I'm just a person with no combination of features at all."	k3vpfu	NonBinary	13	1.0	2020-11-30 13:25:40

My name is Steve and I am telling my story of growing up intersex. 

I'm trying to get my experiences out there to hopefully help people that may be struggling with similar issues.

Non-binary is about as close to how I feel about my sex and gender as I can get, so I thought it would make sense being posted here too. Thanks for watching and any questions are most certainly welcome! I won't be offended.

But my lack of self esteem coupled with the shame I feel about being nonbinary makes me unable to fully come out to anyone.

I have two groups of friends. I never told them that I am nonbinary, they just understood the many, many hints I dropped. I was too ashamed to tell them directly.

The first group is accepting, one even asked for my pronouns, and they learned to use the pronouns I was using when talking about me. I still can't confess them my preferred name and let them use my dead name because I'm too anxious it will become a burden and/or sound ridiculous to them.

The second group is less accepting, even though there were days in which I exclusively used he/him  to talk about myself they continued to use the she/her (I am italian so not only they/them doesn't exist, but every. sentence. is. gendered). I know they don't mean me harm and it's just the force of habit and probably could benefit from me telling them directly to use certain pronouns. Instead I started to use she/her again with them so I don't have to feel embarrassed and don't have to correct them.

My brain is very sure I am nonbinary, it's been two years and a half since I made peace with that. But it wants me to feel shame and only shame about it.

I'll hopefully start to see a therapist soon. I don't know if I should bring up all of this, if I should bring up I'm nonbinary. It's a great source of struggle and stress in my life but I'm afraid they'll laugh at me or treat my gender like it's the issue. I'm in provincial Italy. The more I think about it, the more of a concrete possibility it becomes."	"I trust my friends in different ways and to different degrees. I have friends that I’m close to but not open with about my queerness. I try not to judge myself and figure out what my feelings about them are trying to communicate to me. I’ve realized that I have some friends that I’m not as close to as they think we are due to some things they said that make me not trust them around certain aspects of myself. I trust my feelings and don’t force a level of trust that my feelings are communicating against.
You're not alone. Not even all of my close friends know. It feels like telling them would put them in an awkward position, having to explain my pronouns. Rationally, it's ridiculous. They have loads of nonbinary friends. But, I can't ask them to respect my pronouns 90% of the time and then flip to binary ones in front of my family, coworkers etc.

Not to mention I can't be out at work. That's half my time awake spent in the closet  anyway. Makes it hard to justify coming out.
Yes, this sounds like a key therapy topic. You will likely need to talk about it a lot to figure out what is your normal anxiety/self esteem issues and what amount of it is actually being caused specifically do to the non-binary struggles.  

I don’t know about Italy (it sounds like you may be in more of a rural area) but in the US you can find therapists that work with gender issues. If that doesn’t exist where you are maybe look for a younger therapist that might be more hip.  If they don’t know about gender stuff and there is no other option you will need to advocate for yourself and teach them. 

Give them resources. Summarize articles for them in session. If they are especially good they may spend time to learn on their own so they can help you better. A therapist should never laugh at you or make you feel worse. They should be your confidant. Someone who is in your corner. Someone who supports you even when no one else does. Someone who listens to you talk about or explore the same topic again and again and again because that’s what it takes to work through it. 

Having a good therapist is wonderful and the fact that people don’t go to them just by default is mind boggling once I saw one. Everyone should see a therapist. That’s not to say there aren’t bad therapists out there. You might need to see at least a couple to find a good fit. If you come across one that is transphobic or invalidating then dump them. I’ve never had that issue but you should be in control. You’re the driver in therapy and the therapist should act as your navigator. 

Therapy is wonderful so I highly encourage you to go after it. It sounds like it would help you a lot. Opening up for the first time is hard (cue lots of crying) but after that the power and control it can give you to talk about and explore your feelings is life changing. It’s a real super power you can gain after some hard work. 

You can do it and things will get better! 🌈
I feel that. The variance in trust and therefore being mostly in-the-closet makes me feel inauthentic, like I’m lying to people about who I am to others and then I wonder if I am lying to myself. It’s hard stuff
I feel this so much and I'll reflect on your words. Thanks
I'm so sorry. I too have the same work problem. Glad I'm not alone.
Thank you so much. I went to a therapist when I was younger but I lied to them because I didn't trust them. That was so dumb of me. I hope I can trust this one. I really want to get better.
I would give it a shot. You could also ask them up front if they work with people who have gender questions/concerns. Sometimes you can ask this before even scheduling an appointment (at least in the USA.)  You might be able to email a couple therapists to try to find a good one. The system might work differently in Italy so my apologies if this isn’t how it works there.  

If you do get to the point where you realize you’re with someone you can’t trust or is a bad person you can stand up and leave or just never see them again and try someone else. 

It is a leap of faith though to talk to someone face to face about your deepest fears that you have been scared to share with anyone.  It’s worth it though and there should be legal protections in place to protect you and your confidentiality with anything you say to them.
Thank you... fingers crossed!"	105phj4	NonBinary	14	0.95	2023-01-07 13:51:16
struggling to feel confident after top surgery...	"First off i want to say that i do not regret getting top surgery. It was the best option for me and i feel much less dysphoric now. I considered a reduction but i plan to be pregnant at least twice so i was really worried about my breasts growing again because of that. With top surgery, i can get pregnant without feeling dysphoric. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's only been about 7 weeks so the scars are still pretty fresh. I'm not bothered by that because i know it's temporary. My problem is that i'm so used to conforming to a very cis standard of being beautiful as a woman. I'm used to comparing my body to women all the time. Especially because my mom was very misogynistic and shamed me for having small breasts as a teenager. So now even though i feel 100% more comfortable with my body and know i'm not cis (i'm trans/genderfluid), i still feel less attractive without boobs. I feel like i'm less desirable. So sometimes i'll catch myself wishing i had small boobs just so i can look more attractive or ""normal"" to other people. I know that people probably don't even notice my flat chest as much as i think they do. And i'll probably just get used to it over time. But i'd really like to hear some experiences/advice from other afab nonbinary people especially (but not limited to) those who are feminine-presenting."	"I'm AMAB. I have also had severe gynecomastia since puberty. I have natural 38G breasts. I present male (most of the time) with them. I do wear a bra full time but I'm still able to present male.

It's a matter of being confident in who you are. I do have a definite feminine side that needs to seem sometimes and those days I'm grateful for my girls.
Hey, I just wanna say that everybody likes different things and there are absolutely people out there who will think you are perfect. 

I personally find people with top surgery incredibly attractive. I’m trying not to be just superficial here, because life is a lot more than that. People with confidence who are comfortable in their bodies are the real heroes. But I will admit there is a side to me that likes flat-chested people aesthetically. They can present masculine, feminine, or anything in between and it works just fine. IMO you haven’t necessarily lost any of your feminine energy having the surgery. 

My only point about getting into my own superficial opinions was that if I exist, there are absolutely many other people who feel exactly how I do! I hope you can get past feeling this way someday soon.
To me, the most attractive people in the world are the ones that feel so comfortable in their bodies and let their confidence (even if it is faked at first) absolutely *shine*! I notice these people not because of their body type or because they fit into a standard. I notice them because they are unapologetically and unashamedly themselves and I can *see* how happy they are. 

I'm AFAB and present femme sometimes and am starting the process of getting top surgery myself. I recognize that I won't fit a male or female standard afterwards and I'm sure that will be difficult. I can't imagine exactly how you feel; you're ten steps ahead of me. Ha. 

I totally got validation when I dressed and presented super femme. Even though it wasn't the whole picture of who I am, I got attention (sometimes unwanted) for being hyper feminine. And yeah that can feel nice. 

But focus on how you feel. If you feel more comfortable, I think people will notice and respect and respond to that more than your chest. And if all they talk about is your chest...then that says a whole lot more about their insecurities and weird cultural standards than it says *anything* about you. 

But I'm glad you brought this topic up because you're absolutely helping me to have realistic expectations when I myself, am post-op. So thank you for showing me your vulnerability.
Yeah I’ll admit i miss the easy attention i got from having big boobs. I know its shallow but like you said it can feel nice. And you’re right, confidence is ultimately more important. This is a topic I’ve seen people be fearful of before top surgery but I’ve never seen anyone talk about actually experiencing it. So I’m glad i can add to your (and others) pool of knowledge. Physically transitioning as an enby can feel like such a mystery with really no way of fully knowing what you’re jumping into. It’s just such a new concept.
It totally is a new concept. And as someone who has big breasts and has for most of their life, presented femme, I know it's going to be a huge change for me when my breasts are gone. I'm watching every YouTube video and reading every post about nonbinary top surgery. But even so, I'm still going to have my own unique experiences and feelings about it. 

I plan on wearing dresses sometimes post surgery. I like dresses. They're easy and comfortable. I know I'll look very different in a dress without my massive tits. I'm trying to remind myself that I don't need breasts to be femme. It's more about attitude, yeah? 

And I'm also considering my option of wearing and padding a B cup (what my dream size used to be!) bra if I want to present *super* femme in a dress or something. It's easy to create fake curves. People of all genders do it all the time.

I mean...I'm already ""faking"" having no boobs when I wear a binder. Maybe I'd like to fake having small boobs when I no longer have them! We'll see how I feel when they're actually gone. 

But hang in there. I'm glad you're talking to this community about these things. As you said, all this stuff is pretty new. We're all still learning and will continue to learn.
i had very big breasts too! DDs unfortunately. i've also considered wearing a padded bra sometimes when i'm feeling extra femme. if i try it, i'll let you know! also, someone who has been helping me is pabllovittar on instagram. He's a drag queen pop singer and is of course very femme but he doesn't typically wear breast forms. So maybe seeing someone like him will help you visualize it too.
I will. Thanks."	cyz7b7	NonBinary	12	1.0	2019-09-03 03:05:31
Euphorically weeping in a skirt	"Yesterday my wife and I (41,nb,amab) had a big ol' fight. The specifics of that aren't really important here. It wasn't about gender, so yay for that ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

Also yesterday, I wore a skirt. That's still pretty new for me, so I guess this was the first time I've really sobbed while wearing a skirt. In the midst of it all, I felt a surprising sort of gender affirmation? And now I'm trying to pick apart exactly what that meant. It felt better and easier to experience those emotions while presenting my gender more honestly. That sentence seems really straightforward but took me 15 minutes to write.

It made me think of all the fiction I've consumed in which women in flowing skirts weep romantically. I should probably look around for more fiction about nonbinary folk :)

Unfortunately, my rush of euphoria was followed by some guilt and disgust -- the bits of myself that fear I look foolish or am somehow deluding myself and others. For these self-critical voices, there was something deeply shameful about finding a joy or solace in my gender expression while also dealing with the pain of the argument with my wife.

Anyway, I've changed the flair on this post a million times as I waffle about what I'm really looking for here, why I'm making this post. It was a complicated bit of emotion and y'all seemed like a sympathetic ear. Does any of this make sense outside of my head?"	"Embracing your identity and freeing yourself from AMAB expectations (perhaps to not cry, show emotion) makes sense and if externalising that through crying and wearing a skirt has been a freeing and emotional experience for you, then I can totally understand! And that's not to say that anyone of any gender needs to feel bad about crying nor do they need to wear a skirt to do so, but given the pressures that do exist and how freeing it can be to embrace one's identity, I can appreciate why that all aligned to feel like a euphoric moment for you, even if it was tempered with other emotions about the argument.
Thank you, kind person <3"	pxtq8z	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-09-29 11:50:41
Clothes!	"

I came out last year as non-binary and I want to buy some masculine clothes (I’m afab) but when I go to the “men’s section” I feel so shameful and out of place. My parents shamed and ridiculed me for going in the boys section as a child (they gave that up years ago but the feeling still lingers) Currently I’m mostly living in hoodies and clothes from my big brother which isn’t ideal lol.

 Anyone have any tips for getting over this “shame”?

(Sorry if I don’t make sense English is my third language)"	"[deleted]
I was going to suggest similar convince yourself everyone will think your buying for your boyfriend, which is probably what they'll actually assume.  The heteronormative assumption is that men can't shop for themselves and need a woman with better taste to do it for them.  

Bonus Valentines is coming up making the story extra convincing.
The same happened to me. I started by buying basics online and as I got more comfortable in clothes made for male bodies in public, it became easier to shop for them online. 

Something I told myself over and over during this process was that clothes themselves are not gendered. There's nothing inherently feminine about a dress, we put the understanding of ""female"" behind it. I started to say ""clothes made for male bodies"" or ""clothes made for female bodies"" because it's more accurate. 

Granted a lot of people still look at me, but how boring are their lives tho that a person shopping is a reason to stare? 

I hope this helps!
I remember getting my first men’s shirt. I was supper nervous it was like traversing a brand new world. I think I made my sister go with me and it was only the other half of the store lol. I’ve gotten more confident in myself over the years so that it doesn’t make me as anxious. At first I did use the ‘it’s for my brother’ excuse in my head in case anyone asked. No one ever did, so I stopped worrying eventually. You got this 👍
I can't really give any tips because I haven't worked up the courage to do the same thing but I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone in this! I've been out for a while now and I'm still afraid to go into the women's section to buy clothes so I have my friend send me photos and I pay her back (Maybe that could help actually whoops)
As someone who's amab i feel the same way about being feminine! Ive never been able to bring myself to trying clothes and stuff but recently ive been learning basic cosmetics like nails and eyeliner. You just need to take baby steps but idk if its different for me being amab and you afab but just take it slow is all ive got.
Omfg “like gollum with the ring” 😭😂😂that made me laugh so hard ✨thanks for sharing!
That’s actually brilliant! Tysm!!
Thank you so much!! 🥺✨❤️❤️❤️
Thank you! 🥺❤️❤️
Thank you! It really helps knowing that I’m not alone! ❤️❤️
Thank you!! That’s a great tip! I wish us luck in embracing our identities ✨✨❤️"	l0q3bm	NonBinary	13	1.0	2021-01-19 18:38:42
Enby figuring themselves out...	"Hi friends,

Felt like writing a post because the gender questioning has gotten a bit consuming mentally and thought I’d see if anyone can relate.

I'm AMAB, and as a young kid definitely remember wanting to do all the girly stuff. Makeup, nails, girls toys, mom's shoes, costume jewelry, etc. Was probably over the top more than most girls even ha. Was definitely like a baby drag queen in that way for lack of a better word. My dad made sure to shame the crap out of me. And after such an incident I remember staring in mirror wishing I was a girl. In elementary school definitely recognized myself as a boy but hated boy drag (like halloween, hated having to pick costumes from boy section), but always liked to play with other boys rather than girls. Loved my boy pack of friends. Actually just remember feeling somewhat different from the boys and girls since I liked hanging out with both. 

Puberty didn't hit me too hard, I remember it being a little weird but I also remember enjoying developing a manly chest, happy trail. When started to feel tingly down there definitely for boys. Watched a bit of straight porn, but always looked at guys, so started watching gay porn, reading gay erotica which was way more of a turn on. Even sometimes turned on by my boy self in the mirror.

Really butched-it-up in high school/college and became someone I'm not just to survive and fit in after dollying that hit in 9th grade really destroyed a more authentic version of me. Came out as gay at 22 and have lived a pretty fulfilling gay life. Multiple boyfriends (new one is amazing!), friends, enjoy the hilarity, play and the ""gender"" of being a gay man--for better or for worse our society doesn't view gay men as ""real men"" as Kate Bornstein would say. The biggest insult to me was always when people would say things like ""you don't seem gay"" or ""you seem normal."" I realize now that was more because I didn't feel like a normal guy at all (and some gay men definitely do!)

Flash forward to now (30's) and have built up the confidence not to run and to try to be my most authentic self and wanna put myself back together. Which I congratulate you all on working towards because its a real act of self-love. But really hard to untangle feelings, desires, previous stigmas and shame. There is a part of me that feels like super-duper gay boy: I'm super jealous of the young gay femmes on tiktok with their make up tutorials, crop-tops, lil Twink bodies, etc. But there is a part of me that feels more female than just a male that likes feminine things. At the same time, usually fluctuate between ok with an liking my body (which fortunately is a pretty well built but not overly hairless masculine body).  I also realized I spend way more time looking at f-->nb or f-->m bois than anything else and love that aesthetic. Sometimes I feel like a drag king who is doing a good job (which it doesn't hurt that many people have said I looked androgynous and questioned whether I was ftm based on my facial structure in the past). And I kinda like that male drag. Where when I look at m-->f transitions not a lot resonates (but is this just externalizing transphobia since I'm amab?).

So I've come to understand some things about me:

1) I'm some form of trans

2) Enby really resonates with my gender philosophy and I love the more nb masc asthetic

3) Still have some connection to gay male culture

4) Still have memories of really wanting to be female that don't seem to integrate well

5) Much harder to integrate nb into my life as a professional in their 30s. Almost wish I was mtf but when I think about ""what I want"" if I woke up tomorrow with a woman's body I feel like I'd say wtf

6) Gender is f-ing weird and understanding that it's not always static is somewhat helpful to me (both fluid in time and changing through your life)

Still working through all this, but any insights could be helpful. Just looking for some inner peace and seems hard to find. Some of it feels like I swing between the binary poles because I haven't fully accepted the gender spectrum without shame. Thanks for reading! Hope it resonates with someone!!!"	"I'm sorry you have been shamed away from exploring your identity and presentation - noone should have to go through that. I was shamed in high school because of my rapid puberty and tomboy appearance. I tried to hyper-feminize which was a dismal failure.
Flash forward to now, and at 46yo, I think I'm figuring things out. Don't worry about your age, and don't fear change. Life is challenging.
Hope this helps a bit. Be well.
Wow, this sound pretty much like me up to the high school grade part (still there), I'd say if it's bothering you not knowing what specific type of trans you are, just say nonbinary pansexual(or whatever general nonspecific label you want), and figure things out from there, that way you can come out to friends, try on pronouns, etc, and still have room to change and figure it out. I know for me, coming out as NB at first was just a huge relief(despite being in the closet for a total of two weeks) just because there wasn't any pressure to have an answer, and I could test what I liked and want to be. It's been a few months now, and I still don't know, but at least I'm out and can feel like I can be something close to myself, whatever that is.

Tl;Dr: be they, do crime

I hope this helped"	g0vgt7	NonBinary	12	1.0	2020-04-14 00:44:17
I came out as nonbinary in July, and while I felt great and confident then, I was also in the middle of a hypomanic bipolar episode	"So now I’m a little bummed but more stable and myself... and I’m regretting so many things I did, but I wish I didn’t regret coming out. Just wondering if anyone relates to regretting coming out, having mental illness, or both. 

Maybe I just need extra reassurance right now, but I really liked telling my friends I’m a nonbinary woman and so many people were happy for me and said it made so much sense (for one, I changed my name to more gender-ambiguous initials so people wouldn’t necessarily know I was female years ago), but a few people were confused, saying I seem so confident as a woman. 

Again, nonbinary woman and she/they pronouns make me the most comfortable in my own skin, which is important to me because of my mental illnesses, but not because of my mental illnesses.... and I know I’m not backtracking on coming out as much as I’m just trying to find the language that fits me. I experience a lot of guilt and shame for not being sure, or possibly stepping on my friends’ experiences because I don’t have dysphoria the way I see them experience it, and I don’t experience discrimination because I very much so present as a cis white (and hetero when I’m out with my male-identified partner). The biggest sign that I do fit in and what gives me some solace is that my best friend is nonbinary and I’ve dated two nonbinary people—I believe I might have been seeking out people I felt more comfortable expressing myself around and yet I was inside this community online and elsewhere screaming “I don’t belong here!”"	"It's fine to be figuring stuff out. You belong.
You belong. It's a misconception that gender dysphoria is a requirement to be nb -- there are many people who do not experience it. Dysphoria can also change over time. I don't have the same experience as you but reading your post I am reminded of something I've heard-- if you had few/no symptoms of mental illness would you still have these feelings about your gender. From what you've written I'd guess that you would say yes! I am happy to hear that you got some positive responses from coming out. But it's also legit if when figuring out more, you find new language fits you better. It's all part of a process. Best of luck <3
Thanks—this means a lot to me 
Thank you so much—this was useful to hear. I do think I would still have these feelings, sick or not, so that’s a relief to realize. "	96ow03	NonBinary	11	1.0	2018-08-12 12:41:17
Coming out to my boss	"I thought I'd share this story here, for some background I'm AFAB and prefer they/them pronouns. 

On monday I had a performance review with my line manager who is also the centre manager where I work, these meetings are as much for me to talk about any concerns/needs as there are for my manager to evaluate my performance. The meeting went well, she was happy with my progress. Recently I had to pull out of some overtime for a couple of reasons, partly because I had more stuff on that weekend than I realised when I signed up for it and partly because my anxiety has been a little worse the last few weeks and I needed to not overwork myself. 

One of the reasons my anxiety has spiked is because getting incorrectly gendered all the time because I'm not out to many people is starting to really get to me, plus my family still using the wrong pronouns even though I'm out to them. I think they're trying and I know they do love me, but the fact that they never get them right makes it feel like they aren't trying because they don't care and I find it hard to correct them.

My manager was perfectly fine with me pulling out of the overtime and brought it up only to ask if I was doing okay, she knows that I've struggled with anxiety in the past and I have had to take time off work for it before (this was 4 weeks sick leave with full pay, I love my job) I said I was stressed about stuff going on in my personal life, she said she was there to support me with anything, not just work related things and if it was important to me it was important to her, she asked me if I had anyone else to talk to about it (which I don't)

I decided to tell her and I'm very glad I did, she told me that a friend of her son was trans (MtF) so she had come across it before, she had heard of nonbinary but said she didn't really know a lot about it. She asked me if i minded her doing her own research about it and said she wanted to look into how to best support me in the workplace. She assured me that everything would be confidential (which I never doubted) and then when she wrote up the notes she didn't include my coming out (she wrote that we had discussed something personal) because those notes can be seen by the rest of the management team. It was a really positive experience and I'm really glad I did it. 

At this point I'm rambling a bit but I'm on a roll now, and I want to explain why I don't want to come out to my whole workplace.  I work at a salvation army homelessness hostel and I also go to the salvation army church in my area, because of the strong links between the two I can't come out at work without also coming out to my church. This is a shame really because I would feel fine coming out at work, we have a great team and while I'm sure none of them would know what non binary is, I'm sure they would all just go 'ok' and move on and not really treat me any differently. I also think the majority of my church would be the same, it's the minority who wouldn't. 

I do intend to come out at some point, I have a tentative plan to come out before pride 2020 so that I can go but I'm not sure yet. Sorry this got so long but I really wanted to get this off my chest. 

Also wasn't sure which flair to use so I thought I'd focus on the positive and go with YAY"	"I'm glad to hear your Salvation Army workplace is supportive.  I'm under the impression the Salvation Army policy is inherently transphobic, such as forcing trans women to be housed with men, but it's good to see that not all the individuals working for them are  transphobic.
Salvation army policy in the UK lifehouses isn't transphobic, I saw some stories on the internet about that stuff happening, I think in America, and that would not be considered acceptable in Lifehouses in the UK. (I don't know what American policies are)
The church side is run separately from the social services side, there's an unusually close link where I live because the church also does stuff for the homeless and work together with the Lifehouse to better help them. 
The church side has more issues about this but I want to fight from within it to make the Salvation Army LGBTQ+ inclusive, and there are those that think the same.
Yeah, I’m familiar wit the USA issues. I hope you can make changes that spread worldwide. ❤️"	e33p3e	NonBinary	10	0.92	2019-11-28 20:23:40
Dysphoria from my birth name, is it weird to change it?	"I'm an Agender / Gender-fluid male, and I've always hated my name.

It's not just a boys name, it's one of those harsh-sounding, uber-masculine names that makes you picture the king of stereotypes of when you hear it.

I've played with multiple other names when I was younger, but they never stuck 'cause kids in school are mean. Eventually I just told myself to deal with it and buried those gross feelings somewhere else.

Fast forward to yesterday at work - The topic of how poorly my name fits me was brought up by some co-workers. They all said they were so shocked when they met me, because they had heard my name before I started and had assumed I was someone completely different.

I'm 28 now, and this is the first time I've really thought about my name since I came to terms with my NB identity a few years ago. 

Now, suddenly everything makes sense: the shame when I introduce myself, the cringe when someone calls me, the disconnect when I write my name down or sign off on a email. I always just thought I hated my ""ugly"" name, but I've just had that lightbulb moment and realised it's probably gender dysphoria.

I fluctuate slightly in presenting feminine / masculine, but I generally float somewhere around the middle and am perfectly content with my male body. Finally, I've discovered how to take this step towards owning my identity, but now I feel like it's a strange thing to do at 28 with no desire to transition. 

Should I change my name under these circumstances? (I already know the answer to this, but I could really do with some encouragement as I don't know many other places where I'll find it). I'd love to hear any stories you're willing to share about this too :)

Thanks for reading, hope you all have the best weekend x"	"Yes. You don’t like it, it makes you uncomfortable. I would say, change it. Pick a name you like and you feel reflects you.
Absolutely, pick a name that suits you and makes you comfortable. Be proud when you introduce yourself
You didn't pick your name, and you don't like the one you were given. You should absolutely change it.
Definitely change your name if you want to. I did because mine was very feminine - Imogen. My new name is Dorian.
Name dysphoria is totally a thing! I have a very feminine legal name that has absolutely never felt like it fit. Finding a more gender-neutral or masc name in my early 20s, and being called by it regularly, was a huge relief to me even though at this point in my life I have no desire to medically transition.
Thanks for the advice, it's good to hear it boiled down :)
You're right, I should be proud. I get excited thinking about being able to introduce myself confidently, thanks for the comment :)
Thanks, it's comments like yours that are helping to give me some courage :)

Binders	"I’ve been thinking about getting a binder for awhile now, and though I’m full of complicated feelings about it (read as: shame and guilt for wanting it) I’ve decided it’s it my best emotional al interest to look into this more. 

So, do you have advice on brands, sizing recommendations/suggestions for someone who has never measured themselves,potential emotional pitfalls upon putting it on, tips or tricks for safety and cleanliness and anti-chafing or something you wish someone had told you but didn’t? 

Thank you. Much love y’all."	"Gc2b is a good company, and their binders are pretty affordable, comparatively. 
I’m still super new, so I don’t have much input for the rest. Definitely measure yourself so you get the right size, and remind yourself that there’s no shame in feeling what you feel. There are enough people in the same boat that *multiple companies* are producing binders and staying in business. You’re not alone, or even that weird
i second GC2B. Pretty easy to get on. Easy to peel off. Durable material. The first binder I ever got was from China and it was mega small and cut into my sides because it had three elastic bands on the side. Ow. 

Edit: much like a corset, it may restrict the moment of your rib cage a little. This can be a little scary or anxiety inducing at first. Even when I bind now, sometimes the first 20 minutes or so I have a bit of anxiety and feel like I can't breathe. I totally can. I remind myself that I am breathing just fine and that I can take it off at any time. Eventually I ease into the sensation and am comfortable wearing it for many hours."	clrxyd	NonBinary	11	0.88	2019-08-04 03:48:41

Feeling frustrated :(	So Before I figured out I was nb I wore Lolita fashion and lots of poofy hyper-fem clothes but I’m extremely masculine aligned. Don’t get me wrong I don’t hate femininity I do like it, have it and embrace it but I’ve been feeling so little of it... I don’t know if that’s confusing but like I feel like I’m 90% masc and like 30% fem (that doesn’t add up to 100 but I just feel like I’m extremely masc but not necessarily very very low fem) and I know clothes have no gender but I live in conservative Texas here there is just male and female in their eyes. (I’m going everywhere on topics sorry but idk how to go in order for anyone who actually reads this.) Like once I went to a concert and a “guy” was wearing (I put quotes because I don’t know how to gender them I hope that doesn’t come off a rude) a skirt and my family was quick to point out that it’s disgusting. So it’s like in my head that if your masculine looking you can’t wear a dress and because that person had unshaved legs it’s ingrained in my head that it body hair is gross and when I look at mine I want to like it but then I think ew I can’t show anyone this or they’ll shame me. It has happened to me many times :( but going back to the topic of nb and Lolita I want to wear it so badly but I don’t want to get misgendered :( I want to be referred with They/Them pronouns always no matter what I wear but I feel like if I wear a pronoun pin it’ll be “cringe” and I’ll stick out even more in public and little conservatives will be like “oh look it’s one of those snowflakes that doesn’t know their gender” I just wanna wear what I want without getting misgendered And I don’t wanna look dumb either :(	"I think there are plenty of nonbinary people in lolita and jfashion and decora so you're not alone there! It sucks living where people don't understand you but you won't look silly if you wear a pronoun pin - other people are silly for not respecting it. Be a fuckin snowflake with a cool new gender identity that confuses old conservatives and be proud of it!
There are many things imposed on people by sociality especially regarding people with masculine body /futures wearing fem clothing. It is something to be unlearned at least for me.I don\`t want my chest but I feel weird wearing girls t shirts??? over flat chest when I wear binder,despite me knowing that the cut of the t-shirt don\`t have gender.I also don\`t want to shave my armpits but feel that I must do it at some point although I don\`t like the feeling of the skin to some extand
Thank you so much for hyping me up :) I needed that validation"	ik6n1a	NonBinary	10	0.92	2020-08-31 21:06:57
Questioning AFaB	"I’ve been wondering about my gender on and off for a while. Since it’s a recurring question in my mind, I assume it requires a solution one way or another. 

## I’ve read the new rule about this sub being a space for NB and questioning people only, but I still don’t feel legitimate even as a questioning person. If this post is inappropriate in some way anyway, I’ll delete it

##From what I’ve understood, **being anywhere where you feel uncomfortable being unquestionably a man or unquestionably a woman can define you as NB.** Is my understanding of this is wrong, please tell me and ignore the following content which may be therefore uninformed. In this case, again, I’ll delete the post ##
* * *

The thing is, I don’t know whether the discomfort I feel identifying as a girl is a completely independent concern, or if it’s rather due to what it means to be perceived as a girl and its consequences. If female-presenting people weren’t so mistreated or infantilisized, I don’t know if I’d still be uncomfortable being constantly perceived as a girl. 

I know a lot of female-presenting people like to be constantly perceived as female regardless of the issues we face, and that’s totally cool. It may be worth it for them. In my personal case, it’s not

I like being a girl, but only sometimes. I wouldn’t like being a guy because I feel it would bring new problems about what it typically means to be a guy, and I want to deal with them as much as I want to deal with the problems brought by what it typically means to be a girl : that means not at all
* * *

For most of the people I know, girls are always supposed to :
* **to wear makeup**
* **to wear girl-shoes** (anything with a heel) 
* **to wear girl-clothes** (anything that either shows cleavage or legs. God apparently forbid you show both or neither)
* **to style their hair like girls** (still have to figure this one out)
* **to own girl-things.** My mom once refused to buy my sister a watch just because it wasn’t pink or purple. I was fuming
* **to always be tidy (for themselves and others).** A headmaster once shamed me when he walked on me cleaning my (I’ll admit it)  filthy boarding school bedroom, because « it would have been a bit more acceptable for a boy, but a girl... ». I to,d him it was an idiotic thing to say and was almost suspended
* **to never speak a word louder than the other and always agree with everyone.** Girls never « speak their minds », they’re « being aggressive ». Girls never « take charge of things », they’re « being overbearing », « bossy » or « snotty »
* **to look agreeable.** Girls never have a good reason to be in a bad mood, they’re « being emotional », they’re « sulking », they’re « manipulating »
* **to never complain.** When they do, they’re « being hysterical ». How many crazy exes have you found out we’re actually victims of abusive relationships ?
* **to be able to provide physical/emotional/sexual comfort**
* to a lesser extent, **to be able to birth children**

On the opposite, boys are always supposed to :
* **never ever touch a makeup palette even with a stick**
* **not wear girl-shoes**
* **not wear girl-clothes**
* **not style their hair like girls.** For most people it means not wearing it long. Funny thing is, I have semi-long hair and I’m often put down by my family for it not being feminine enough. I thought having long hair was enough for it to be feminine /s
*  **not to own girl-things.** Anything that’s pink/purple (turquoise and other pastel colors seem to count too), scarfs, handbags. For some extreme cases, clean underwear and housework supply seem to be included
* **to always be active.** You’re allowed to care, but only in an aggressive way. Not shouting, not shoving your opinions down others’ throats is seen at best as an exploit, at worst as « being weak »
* **not to show emotions, unless you’re shouting or spewing abuse at people.** Constructive dialogue is a gentle dream for most, crying is an admission of failure for most
* * *

I agree the last list is much shorter, but it exists regardless. There seems to be nothing worse for a guy than to be perceived as a girl. For a girl, *not* being perceived as a girl is a social death sentence in some places. Trans people are still being killed in the streets today

Guess that as long as being something is so constraining and dangerous, then I refuse to be anything at all"	"I am amab but I definitely hear you on the masculine attributes! I let my partner into myself about my nonbinary feelings, and she has said I have been way more affectionate because I am rejecting social norms about what is ""expected""!!
I have never been happier, I am wearing mascara to my job right now to test the waters lol 
If you dont feel either gender because of norms of each sex then I say F it in the B!! I hope you find yourself and where you fit!
Reading your two lists was kind of strange, because it's apparent how masculinity is defined by its lack of femininity. 

I am amab, and your bit about not being sure if gendered discomfort is internal or due to societal perceptions resonated with me. 

I was never too concerned with performing masculinity, like doing the sports or acting aggressive, but partially due to social anxiety I have an urge to act 'normal'. And when masculinity is defined by inaction, my sense of 'normal' turned into me behaving very passive and  despondent. 

It's as if my inclination to refuse to be anything at all backfired on me. 

Lately I'm experimenting with makeup, and with girl-clothes. And I'm still unsure of how I identify, or how to stop categorizing this stuff as gendered in my own mind.
This is exactly how I feel, and I identify as genderqueer. As in, I queer/dissent the fact that societal gender norms exist. I experience no dysphoria and don’t hate being called a “woman”... but only because I’ve had two kids and “parent” doesn’t encompass the shared experience mamas feel in childbirth and after. That being said, usually I express more femme but feel free to skip makeup or dress androgynous when I feel like it because I’m not confined by any gender roles.
>The thing is, I don’t know whether the discomfort I feel identifying as a girl is a completely independent concern, or if it’s rather due to what it means to be perceived as a girl and its consequences. If female-presenting people weren’t so mistreated or infantilisized, I don’t know if I’d still be uncomfortable being constantly perceived as a girl. 

Personally, I don't think the distinction of whether you'd be trans if society wasn't shitty matters. This is the world we all exist in, and while it's slowly getting better, nothing will magically make all of that stop. You deserve to be comfortable existing, and if something makes your life in this world better without hurting others, why shouldn't you do it?

>I know a lot of female-presenting people like to be constantly perceived as female regardless of the issues we face, and that’s totally cool. It may be worth it for them. In my personal case, it’s not

There's a long history of GNC women who are proud to be women, and I'm sure you know you don't have to be nonbinary to be gender-nonconforming. It sounds like that doesn't resonate with you at all, though, and it sure sounds to me like you're headed the right direction in figuring yourself out.

>I like being a girl, but only sometimes. I wouldn’t like being a guy because I feel it would bring new problems about what it typically means to be a guy, and I want to deal with them as much as I want to deal with the problems brought by what it typically means to be a girl : that means not at all

This is honestly pretty close to how I feel as a transfemme enby. I occasionally like to present very feminine, but only when it's for me, not because I feel like society says I have to. I started my transition as a trans woman, because at the time being nonbinary was pretty unheard of. That never quite felt right, and 'friends' originally told me I was just unhappy with how women are treated.

As nonbinary identities entered the lgbtq mainstream, so many of other people's stories resonated with me in a way that trans women stories never have. I know I'm very much not a guy, but I haven't really felt the need for any label more specific than nonbinary. Hopefully you find something that resonates with who you are.
Here’s the important thing to remember: anatomy and outward style don’t determine gender! Some people are cis men or cis women, and gender non-conforming outwardly, but they’re not trans because they’re okay with their gender assigned at birth. For me personally, I could tell my dysphoria was n-b dysphoria and not just internalized misogyny (which is something that TERFs constantly try to say we’re experiencing to invalidate our identities). As a kid, I didn’t feel right being grouped in with boys or girls. Had nothing to do with my hobbies, style, or choice of toys, but that was kind of a “mix” too. During puberty, my chest dysphoria and dysphoria around having a cycle was really bad, right away. I didn’t have the words to explain why I felt the way I did, at the time (unfortunately). “They/them” and sometimes “he/him” pronouns feel right for me. “She/her” and feminine gendered terms instantly make me feel like I want to crawl out of my skin, because I can tell the person I’m talking to is not really seeing me for who I am. They make judgments based on my face and body shape, which sadly will probably never change drastically, even with testosterone and top surgery. Also, “AFAB” (assigned female at birth) obviously doesn’t equal “woman”. So AFAB trans folks still experience sexism in a way, because our bodies are policed. Many of us are still affected by sexist laws around birth control and abortion, because some of us still have a uterus & the ability to become pregnant. Coming out as non-binary trans, as an AFAB person, doesn’t erase that struggle. That’s why I think all trans people & gender minorities belong in feminism, but that’s another topic for another day, lol. Internalized misogyny may be feeling like you wish you didn’t menstruate because of the stigma around it. If you’re trans, binary or non-binary, you might have dysphoria around that, and that’s not the same thing, but you can feel both. If I were you, I would consider trying different pronouns with close friends or even on the internet, and read non-binary trans folks’ stories. There are some great books out there! I really liked “How to Understand Your Gender” (can be found on amazon. It’s a great guide to exploring your own gender more, whether you’re binary or non-binary trans. It could help immensely). I also love “Sissy” by Jacob Tobia, “Gender Failure” by Rae Spoon & Ivan Coyote, and (my #1 favorite at the moment) “Trans Like Me” by non-binary author CN Lester. Hope all of that info helps in some way! I believe all of those books are by non-binary trans authors, if I’m not mistaken. The first might be by a binary trans author & a non-binary one (it was written by 2 trans folks). Good luck on your journey! 🍀
That’s comforting to hear someone had a similar experience on “the other side” of the spectrum !

Does that mean anyone that consciously breaks gender roles is somewhere on the NB spectrum ? That would mean a lot more closeted/questioning people than I thought

Mascara really brings out one’s eyes, that’s a lovely way to test the waters ! You already seem to know how to deal with haters anyway

It’s not a lot, but I’ve started wearing men’s tees some months ago. A shame they don’t do men shoes in my size tho lmao

Thanks a lot, and good luck in your journey as well !
I know that it doesn’t, but even the few times I feel comfortable presenting as a girl still don’t make me a girl. Something doesn’t fit, but I wouldn’t outwardly call it dysphoria. I may be feminine sometimes, but it still doesn’t make me a girl. Not completely at least

I just strongly wish I was just a person, instead of a girl, but I understand some other people feel comfortable being girls tho. But being a guy isn’t appealing to me either, even less so than identifying as my assigned gender

I don’t know, I don’t inherently associate having a uterus or menstruating with feminity, but it may just be my personal feelings about this. There’s a ton of girls who don’t have uteruses and don’t menstruate, and tons of girls who do, so I don’t think I have a problem with my genitals and the biological processes associated to them

I‘m aware that sexist laws will still apply to me regardless of how I identify as, as long as I present as a girl. These laws are unfair in nature and they shouldn’t exist in the first place, but since I don’t fully feel like a girl, applying them to me would not only be unfair but also completely absurd. And I would feel more comfortable calling this system out if I were truly myself

They/them feels just right. She/her just feels weird, and he/him is out of the question for me lmao

I’m sure all the books you’ve recommended will help, so I’ll make sure to check them out. Thanks for your kind advice !
I would definitely say you're more nonbinary than anything else! I would take stock of your feelings whether if you don't want either gender because of societal pressures, or you just don't feel like you fit either one. For myself I feel more comfortable and more myself when presenting more feminine or kind of in-between.
Like some dresses are amazing and I feel great when wearing one, but I dont feel uncomfortable in my regular clothes that I wear to work.
I feel everything in your post and this comment as well. Thank you for putting into words what I’ve been feeling."	dcov3s	NonBinary	11	1.0	2019-10-03 10:14:48
Just coming out	"Really just wanted to come out to someone. My parents aren't  really that supportive and refuse to admit that non-binary people exist and made fun of me when I told them I'm not staight and I'm not gay (cause I really just don't feel comfortable putting a label on my sexuality but know I like basically everyone). They are supportive of gay and people who are mtf or ftm just not non-binary or people who like multiple genders (my mom says that they just are faking??? or just like are confused?? My dad was just silent) Also believes their are only two genders. My friend and brother are supportive though, and they mean the world to me. But other than those two no one else knows. My school community is definitely not supportive. 

I just really wanted to tell someone and I figured here would be a great place to do so. I'm not in anyway ashamed of my gender. It's just kinda hard that I know if I come out about my gender, I won't be accepted. But I really hate being silent about it, and I just need to say it because its driving me insane not to. And I haven't been in the best place in general recently and might have relapsed. But this is something that I can say and feel zero shame about, and I really need to say it to someone.

So...

Am I NonBinary? Warning: Long - Questions Welcome	"It's coming upon the end of a the 2010s, and I've felt like I might be non-binary for a while, but I kind of want to decide once and for all before the year is out. So, much like I've answered many questions on the r/asexual, I'm going to describe my experiences and feelings as best I can here, and see how well they line up. Also, since I will be speaking from my own experience and doubts, please know that I don't mean anything as offensive, or doubting to the identities of others. Also, I understand that gender expression and gender identity are two different things, but I will be discussing my gender expression as it can be an indicator. 

&#x200B;

I am AFAB, and have never been really feminine. Growing up, I never really learned how to do make-up, or deal with long hair, but a lot of that had to due with emotional abuse. My grandmother (my grandparents raised me) was the kind of person who would criticize, but not really teach me to improve. As I got older she had to bribe me to do things like get my eyebrows waved because, “They're growing together!”I hated girly clothes because of the shame cycles associated with buying them. I've always been overweight, and so it always felt crappy. I hated the extra time that things like make-up and long hair took to deal with. 

  
 I also hated being a woman for a long time. I hated having periods that were sometimes so bad that I had to skip class. I disliked having boobs because they kind of get in the way. But other than that, I hated the social expectations put on females. I hated that my emotional intelligence was expected to be higher, when I've always been socially awkward, not to the point of autism, but some of the social issues associated with ADHD and just lower emotional intelligence in general. I hated that being overweight is always seen as worse in women, even though all genders experience social BS from it. Once I realized I had ADHD, I resented that it wasn't caught sooner because I was a girl and wasn't hyper like my dad was. I hated how some people had doubted my intelligence or ability in the past or else felt like I only got ahead because I was a woman, even though there have only been a few examples of that in my life, thankfully. I hated that I already had mental illnesses that made my life difficult, but this thing I couldn't really change just added to that. But again, most of that isn't so much hating my gender as hating the way I'm treated by society because of my gender.

  
 However, at the same time, I didn't want to transition to being male. For one thing, men have a ton of BS standards on them too that didn't fit me, and frankly, I know that the BS of being a woman is nothing compared to what trans people go through. So I don't really want to put myself through that. Also, I'm kind of fine with she/her pronouns, because that's what I'm used to now. The times I've been misgendered, once or twice when I worked at Subway and once by a professor in class, I wasn't terribly insulted. I was surprised the first time, but when the professor did it, I remember my friend was more angry on my behalf than I was. I was just like, “Meh, I was in the back, and I look a little masculine, and maybe his eyesight is crappy.”  

  
But a lot of this has changed over time. Now that I'm with an amazing woman who loves me unconditionally and reminds me that she thinks I'm gorgeous every day, I've come to accept myself better, including my female anatomy. She loves long hair (on both men and women), and I've agreed to keep it long, so long as she cares for it for me, because I can't stand her sad face whenever I mention cutting it. She isn't repulsed by the facial hair I grow due to chronic illnesses, though she does help me shave it because the way it grows wouldn't look great even on a male-presenting person, and she even thinks my faint mustache is cute.

  
 In writing with her, ironically in male characters, I've realized I do like pretty things. I like ballgowns and bright colors, and while I have no interest in buying them, I can admit that side of myself. However, whenever I dress in bright colors and really put in effort, I often feel like I'm just wearing a costume. And I also don't think liking pretty things, or any of my other interests, should be just male or female interests. I love musicals, video games, writing, sci-fi, fantasy, etc... but none of that should be gender specific.

  
 I feel like if I woke up with a penis tomorrow, I wouldn't be terribly fussed about it, except for the scientific concerns. When I play characters in stories or video games, sometimes I play men, sometimes I play women. I feel like my gender isn't a big part of me either way. I don't have a big interest in presenting more androgynously because I've developed a style I think is often separate from gender, and well.... I still don't like putting tons of effort into my clothes, make-up, and hair. I have given serious thought to a more gender neutral name, something that can be for either gender but is typically more often seen on males. Like, the opposite of Lindsey. Problem is, Alex is my mom's name, and that's got emotional baggage. And Sam is my love's name, so that would just get confusing. 

  
So, basically, am I non-binary? Or do I basically disqualify myself by not caring enough to really express it in any meaningful way?

  
 I know this was super-long, but I wanted to get out everything I can remember right now. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I'm sure I forgot stuff, because covering 27 years of experience is difficult, so feel free to ask me any questions that might help.   
 

Thanks all, and Happy New Year."	"hey this may sound rude but you don’t need this big essay on if you are nonbinary, Not completely a woman? Not completely a man? Awesome You are 🏳️‍🌈🌈NONBINARY 🌈🏳️‍🌈

seriously tho, there’s no right way to be nonbinary. if you feel like you are then you are :)
No one can be 'disqualified' from being nonbinary / trans. You don't need to justify your gender. All that matters is what feels right. Do you feel right thinking of yourself outside the gender binary? Then you're nobinary. 

There's no correct way to express your gender, and you don't need to be super androgynous to be nonbinary. I'm a trans guy, and in my day to day life I have no problem with people assuming I'm a binary man. I don't really feel like one all the time, and people I'm close to know I'm a nonbinary guy, but I just present and a slightly effeminate dude. Your nonbinary identity can just be for you if you want -- expressing it outwardly isn't a qualification. Presentation =/= gender. 

Just focus on your feelings. There's no ""correct"" answer, just what's right for you.
Non-binary is simply being outside the gender binary norms. You are outside that, so you are non-binary.

How you feel about that and what you do with it will be unique to you as an individual. 

We're all very different, the only thing non-binary people are guaranteed to have in common is that we don't conform to gender norms. It's in the name. We're very diverse.

There are niches and sub groups/labels. Discovering those might be interesting for you, it might help you answer questions about yourself. Exploring the non-binary spectrum takes time though. You've discovered what you're not, now you can discover, create, and define who you are.
I guess its something I've been thinking about for a while and I was afraid of being seen as a poser, claiming a label I haven't ""earned."" That's why i just laid it all out.
Ive looked into the basic labels. Sometimes I feel gender-fluid, sometimes I feel agender.
Some people might throw something like that at you someday. But they're wrong. Brush it off and stay positive if it ever happens. 

Nobody else can define your gender for you, and you have no obligation to present a certain way, use certain pronouns, or anything else they might try to push on you.

Be yourself, present how your comfortable presenting, use the pronouns you feel fit you."	egqgh1	NonBinary	8	0.85	2019-12-28 12:56:27
AFAB feeling their femme side again...	"Hi everyone! I love this beautiful subreddit. Seeing the pics of you all brings me so much joy. 

I came out as non-binary almost a year ago. Since then I’ve gotten really into more masc presentation. I cut my hair short, wear mostly men’s clothes, etc. 

However, lately I just can’t deny it — I miss being femme! I was pretty femme before coming out —I guess you could say Tomboy Femme — and I just miss it. I miss the clothes, the nail polish, and feeling fabulous! 

But now, I’m dealing with so much shame and imposter syndrome. I’ve recently started going back to work in the service industry and everyone calls me “she”. I feel this will only be exacerbated by more femme looks. Most of my friends are cis and I fear they will think I’ve just been faking something. 

The thing is, I know I am non-binary, it feels so much better to me than being “a girl”, ever since I was little I knew I was not “a girl”, I wanted to be able to be fluid, not pinned in a box. And that’s all I want now too! I love having my chill masc days but I am dying for some sexy femme nights! Is this allowed? I’m so confused 😫

TLDR: I’m AFAB, been doing a heavy masc presentation since coming out last year, now really yearning for femininity. Struggling with imposter syndrome and confusion and looking for support!"	"Presentation doesn't define gender. You can present as fem as you please without invalidating your non-binary identity. Will people see you and think that you're a girl? Maybe so, but people not understanding non-binary gender identities is hardly new or rare, and in the end you don't get to control what other people think. Live your authentic life and make the presentation choices that bring you joy.
Present however makes you happy! Feeling like you have to present masc because you feel like you need to fit your NB label isn’t gonna make you feel good! There’s no gate keeping here! You know your NB and that’s awesome and you are always welcome! Present fem, present masc whatever you like just be true to how you feel and be happy 🥰🥰
Ok I'm in the same boat as you. I'm Afab, and while I have some mild dysphora about my breasts, I do like my hips, genitals, make up,...

I've known I'm non binary since a long time but only recently realized that I want to present that outwards, get top surgery, and so on. I was really confused about myself and did a lot of research in the last month (I kind of needed to justify it to myself). So here are my conclusions, maybe they can help you:

We live in a society that likes to put people into boxes. Currently the boxes people will try to put you in in regards to gender are either male or female. Even if you mastered the androgynous look, people on the bus or on the street that don't know you will check you out and wonder in which of those boxes you fit. They will look at your curves, your clothes, your hair, will listen to your voice and in the end they will most likely decide to put you into one of those boxes, which is shit. The thing is, this is most likely not going to change, even when society becomes more educated on the topic of gender not being binary, because there are nb people that don't look completely androgynous and there are binary people that look androgynous and both of those things are completely valid. We can only hope that in the future people won't just assume your gender but ask you what pronouns to use for you, even if you look more like a binary-gendered person.

I know that is kind of a shitty, sad outlook, because the ""best"" thing you will ever achieve is to make people think more about you gender and wonder what you are. And while I understand that it can be nice and kind of fun to have people wonder about it and be confused, if you prefer to wear and do things that are more associated with one binary gender, things boil down to one question: Do I prefer to do and wear those things or is it more important for me to confuse people and maybe make them wonder and maybe question the whole ""putting people into boxes"" thing? This is a decision you have to make for yourself, I've decided that I prefer to just do what I want and fuck random people and what they think of me, but both choices are valid, it's your body, your choice and your gender.

If your friends think you are not a valid if you don't present androgynous, they don't get what being non binary really means. Things like make up, hair style,... are only gendered because society said so. There is no other reason for it. Your gender identity on the other hand is not a social construct. I, for example, have some mild dysphora about my breasts and will get top surgery soon and I'm like 98% sure that I would also want that if breasts were not associated with the person having them being female. I can't explain to you why and how that works but that's how things are for me.

Conclusion: You are completely valid, no matter how you look and what you do!"	n6gz2q	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-05-06 20:35:28
Is This Internalised Transphobia?	"I feel like I can't use the term ""trans"" to describe myself, because I feel like I don't really qualify... I know the term technically refers to anyone who does not identify with their AGAB, but I still feel like using the term trans to describe myself feels like I'm coopting a term that is not meant for me. 

I'm nonbinary (they/them). I don't really experience a lot of gender dysphoria and don't want to pursue HRT or physically transition. I go back and forth a lot between thinking that this is a term I can use to describe myself, and feeling extreme guilt and shame for even thinking about using this term for myself.

Also, please don't be mean in the replies. This is something I'm really struggling with and I'm just looking for constructive answers and not to be shamed for it... thank you! This is a wonderful community of lovely people, and I'm really grateful to have found such a supportive space here :)"	"If you don't judge other people in your situation for using ""trans"" to describe themselves, you shouldn't judge yourself for it either. 
I've struggled with this for a long time, until I realised that and gave myself permission to be who I am, including the labels I chose to describe myself. It's given me a lot of freedom mentally, and it helped me to really get to know myself.
Yes that's internalized transphobia. You can call yourself transgender. 💜
Or even internalized gatekeeping. You count. You aren't ""less trans"" cause you're not binary trans! I know that's something I struggled with initially because I didn't want to intrude on spaces I didn't belong in
I relate to this so much omg ;;;
This is very true. I’d never judge another person in my situation for using the label. Thank you for this reassurance, it means a lot :) 💞
🥺 thank you. You seriously don’t know what it means to me
That’s exactly it!! I don’t want to feel like I’m intruding. Thank you for the validation and reassurance. It seriously means the world to me.

Posted this in WitchesvsPatriarchy but realized it maybe is more relevant here. I’m not sure. Does anyone else have a spiritual community / spiritual friends that still keep talking like only women menstruate and it makes them somehow more connected to spirituality, etc?	"As a non-binary witch / spiritual practitioner that happens to use hormonal BC to treat endo, I’ve got some bones to pick with a friend. Anyone else having these feelings and experiences?

TW: will discuss transphobic micro aggressions and menstruation 
.
.
.

.
.

So I started to befriend someone in my town that I met through my local Buddhist community. We seemed to just click right away! She felt very open, understanding, and nonjudgmental. 

Then I started following the spiritual coaching business she runs with her sister on IG. They preach freedom from “controlling your cycle” (against hormonal BC) and they also keep speaking as if only women menstruate or have uteri, etc. I don’t think they’re intentionally excluding trans people. I more get the feeling that they don’t know many and therefore haven’t had to think about the way they talk about biology? I dunno. 

They’re always having these “women’s circles” where they talk about nurturing your womb space and leaning into your menstrual cycle... 

I’m trying to decide if I should reach out and express to this friend of mine that this is exclusive of people with my experience on many levels. 

I’m a non-binary person that menstruates but also has endometriosis that I gladly treat with hormonal birth control pills. 

I’ve also never seen them acknowledge their privilege as middle-class, white, cisgender women when they talk about things like the law of attraction, manifesting...

So, thanks for reading my rant. What are your thoughts? Any other enbies that menstruate getting sick of all this divine womyn womb talk within spirituality? Anyone else feeling shamed for using hormonal BC? Are any other enbies generally feeling isolated in their spiritual communities because of all the talk of the divine feminine/masculine? Where is the divine non-binary movement???"	"They sound like white feminists with little to offer in the way of meaningful spiritual practice. Why engage with wook-lites at all? People engaging in sacred moon-cycle anti-BC woohoo tend to be transphobic as fuck anyways, 50/50 they either ""just don't get being trans"" or think you're simply tragically out of touch with your ""divine feminine."" I would stay far away.
A lot of this new-age wicca stuff is really just repackaged neo-platonism which reifies existing (mostly northwest european tbh) cultural constructs by essentializing and mythologizing them.
I want to add that I have not come out as enby directly to this friend of mine. I post about it on IG but I don’t think she sees all my posts cause she follows a lot of people. So she may not even realize someone in her circle is enby
Well I guess I’m confused and having mixed feelings because this friend doesn’t talk like this in her day to day and I also just felt such a strong connection already before she started posting stuff like this so I’m just frustrated 🤷‍♀️
The way she talks about spirituality in person is way more nuanced and humble
Oh for some reason when I read your comment the first time, I only saw the top half of it. That 50/50 you mentioned is what I’m worried about too. Bad either way but if I find that this person just thinks I’m out of touch with my womb and my identity is a problem then you better believe I’m heading for the hills. And as far as moon-cycle worshippers being generally transphobic, I don’t have much experience with them so far so that’s good to know
I wouldn't trust anybody who adopted that woo-woo to make a buck. If you do feel a strong connection then it may be worth reaching out! Note that I'm a bitter transfemme and so for sure have an axe to grind with sacred wombyn nonsense, take my advice with a grain of salt :)
Just take care of yourself and don't let anybody talk shit about who you are! Some people suck and just aren't worth your time. Best of luck either way, I sure do hope you find good people.
Thanks for the realness 😄🙏
And best of luck in finding folks to share sacred time and space with!
Thank you!"	m0jjm6	NonBinary	10	0.92	2021-03-08 16:32:05
"Advice on being comfortable with ""gendered"" interests?"	"Hey all, I'd appreciate any advice. I struggle a lot with interests that could possibly...invalidate me, in any way. Things considered assigned-gender-ly. I know what you like isn't based on that, but that's not the issue. I am afraid of being seen as less/not nonbinary by other people, or making nonbinary people in general look less valid. I know these people can't really be pleased and hiding what I like isn't going to solve people not believing or respecting us, but still... It's not only interests that bring up this insecurity, it's anything I do or say that might make me seem 'immature' or uneducated, since ""you're only nonbinary because you're young!"" is something that stuck with me since I was a teenager. 

It keeps me from being vocal about some of my favorite things and I carry a lot of shameful interests and I'd like to enjoy them more openly and genuinely. I just don't want to live my whole life being ashamed of things that make me happy just because of how people will view me or the community for it. "	"For me a lot of it comes down to reminding myself that 1) I can't control the ridiculous assumptions cis folks make and 2) I don't owe anyone a reason for my interests, likes, or dislikes.

People don't need permission to like baking, or sports, or video games, or fashion. 

I'm amab and have never really liked topically masc things, but tbh, I'm an introvert and I don't like getting attention. As a result my presentation is pretty generic and I really pass for a man. I try to just make sure I'm doing things that I want to do and that make me feel like myself.
Don't forget, people assume girls like cooking but many famous cooks are male, same for sewing/fashion. Guys like sports and computers? Many female athletes and coders (especially in the early days and often overlooked). So screw scociaty and do what you enjoy. You go human!
I reach out to or at least make myself aware of men and nonbinary people in my hobbies that are coded feminine (which is silly but reality is that things have gendered stereotypes) as a way to force the acknowledgement in my head that I’m not alone or invalid. I mean, this is one of the big reasons why representation matters, right?

If you’re comfortable with it, blogging, posting, or making videos about doing your hobbies or focused on your interests as a nonbinary person could be really validating for yourself and others. Lord knows not everyone is comfortable with exposure though, so it’s only one suggestion.

Even though I am a cis-gender male, I hate these gender stereotypes. One thing that might help is to choose friends that will accept you genuinely even if you don't fit the gender stereotypes. 

For instance, I am an engineer but do more technical writing than calculations. I also enjoy classical music, like theatre and art to a point, hate organized sports – especially spectator sports – and competition. This means I am more often in contact with women than men, and even in the male dominated activities, I have weeded out people who weren't comfortable with my lifestyle. The result is that I have friends and acquaintances of either gender who accept me for who I am.

I have also decided quite some time ago to stay away from any gender-based or sex-based activity. If I can't be part of a group where *all humans* are welcome, I don't belong there. That has actually cost me more ""friends"" than my eclectic tastes, but it has helped me sleep better.

So in a nutshell, you might have to get away from some ""friends"". The remaining ones should not question your identity simply because you are involved, say, in knitting or organized sports (!).
Thank you for the response. I have very plain fashion as well, so I'm not really passing as androgynous or other than my assigned gender, which doesn't help with the whole being-seen-as-not-nonbinary thing - I guess I'm just afraid of the idea of ""Well, you look like a duck, you quack like a duck, what do you mean you're not a duck?"" 

I'll make more of an effort to hammer your reminders home. It's all true...just hard to kick this for me. 
It's the truth n\_n I just feel like there's so much of a higher standard / more restrictions, when you're trans...it's unfair but I feel so much pressure to live up to it. I will remind myself that's not fair and reasonable people don't expect it of cis people so why should they expect it of us? Thank you for your response. 
Maybe someday. I think I'm too insecure for that now but one thing that helped me embrace being 'openly' (some places, at least) nonbinary in the first place was the thought that maybe I'd make it easier for someone else. Because seeing older-ish nonbinary people when I was a teen was something that helped me enormously. Thanks so much for the response
My friends and family are great. If I am being honest, embarrassingly enough I think it's more that I spend too much time on the internet reading people's opinions. I've gone through this cycle 3 or 4 times where 1 site starts feeling toxic, I cull who I am following...but then I just move to another site and start reading or following people that say or share (most to criticize) unfair or cruel things. I know it's unhealthy and I think I need to shift my mindset away from [this site / person is upsetting me, I need to cut myself off] and towards [I'm paying way too much attention to other people, gotta disconnect and focus on what makes me happy]. I love the net and all but I don't think it's great for my mind to be saturated with what everyone else thinks, ALL THE TIME. Just hard to do other things (both because I am kind of addicted and because physically a lot of stuff is difficult now because of disability). I'm gonna try harder to spend time away from it all now...a lot is still possible for me that doesn't need me to be connected 24/7. 

Thank you for response, I really appreciate it :)"	9nayvt	NonBinary	12	0.94	2018-10-11 15:29:44
Pronouns and why i don’t tell people them.	"I just wish people wouldn’t say what gender we look like. I  wish everyone asked for pronouns, and only told you what they see if you asked for honest feedback. I mean i always got confused for a girl as a kid and it wouldnt have bothered me if they diddnt then say something mocking or shaming after. 
As a kid i liked being friends with girls and dressing up like that but i was just shamed for it so much that i still cant be comfy with that side yet

Its hard because the only time people have used fem pronouns with me is in mocking/degrading/abusive situations so even when i am fem i really dont want to be refered to as such. i get bad vibes as soon as someone refers to me as that. Like rape vibes and its obiously not accurate but i probbably have ptsd and dont like being looked at in that way sometimes..
Im too insecure to ask people to use pronouns so i just let then call me whatever they see even if say they start using fem pronouns and i feel more masculine/nonbinary.
It does feel dysphoric but i just dont want someone to laugh at me when i say “oh i feel like don’t have a gender today”"	"Personally it's because I'm still gaslighting myself into believing I'm not anything more than a weird cis guy
cisgender people don’t question their gender babe <3
Same… its like its wierd being guys that look like girls.
I mean, i m 5”9 have a girls butt and big hands and size 10 feet and have never weiged more than 130lbs.. tried so hard to build muscle and everyone telling me i need to put on weight and lift but i just cant and no body gets why.
So yeh, its hard not to feel freakish or strange when your body is a hybrid of both the genders and your brain goes back and forth from feeling like a guy to feeling like a girl. Its really embarrassing for some reason i just want to fit in

So we everything still up in the air for me. I think it always will be. I dont know if i will ever find peace and happiness or a soulmate that actually loves me for me.
I wish i could tho. Its all i want. To be around people that actually love and care about me for the person i am and not the way that i look.

I hope you someday self actualize and become
This might be true <3

And from your post history I get the feeling you could use a hug 🤗"	zeks9h	NonBinary	10	0.92	2022-12-06 22:52:20
Starting T Anxiety	"Hello fellow enbys! I am an AFAB 25 yr old nonbinary individual. I'm writing this post to ask for some help/advice.. support? Idk just maybe thoughts from individuals who have gone through this already I guess. 

I recently started gender therapy after years of feeling not exactly like a woman but also not a man and after reoccurring thoughts and curiosities about taking testosterone. I used to identify as butch but it didn't feel exactly right. Starting gender therapy was a major step for me because I felt so much shame for feeling how I do and not feeling right about going to gender therapy until I sucked it up & started. The therapy has been absolutely amazing and exciting because I was able to feel comfortable and discuss myself with another nonbinary individual (my therapist) who is incredibly supportive and knowledgeable and knows every resource ever. That being said, I started seeing a provider for T after discussing HRT a lot with my therapist. 

And here I am.. After all the ups and downs, fear and excitement, research, and discussions, I'm in my bathroom. On the floor. In the dark. With my box of Actavis testosterone  gel packets in my bedroom (prescribed half a packet 12.5mg/day for now to start slow). 

I feel excited but also scared. 

Fears..
- Am I betraying the part of me that is a woman?
- Am I hurting my body?
- Is the possible increased aggression going to make me an asshole?
- Am I going to be ugly? (I know this sounds really silly & dumb but I like my face!)
- Will I get attacked? Bullied?
- Am I going to develop pelvic pain? 
- Are my small breasts going to shrink? (This is more just a general question)

Excitement..
- Omg I can finally be me! Which for me is..a butch dyke & a gay man smashed together (pls don't hate me xD idk how to explain it)
- My work outs will be more fruitful!
- My voice will become lower
- I'll achieve the more androgynous look I feel
- I'll feel more comfortable with myself

I start tomorrow morning. It's such a small dose & I know I'm freaking out over probably nothing but for me it's scary. 

Thank you for reading this shaky baby's vulnerable post.

New&confused	"Hello! I am new to Reddit and identifying as non-binary and just looking for some support. I guess it’s more of a rant so apologies in advance.

I’ve always felt some sort of “off” about my gender, or rather, my presentation/expression. I am AFAB and in general haven’t minded using she/her or being called a woman. I have identified as a lesbian for the last 7 years and feel pretty comfortable with that community. 

For years I couldn’t quite find my footing. I dressed fairly feminine in hs, a mix in college before slowly skewing more towards masculine clothes, but that didn’t feel right either. In the last few years, I’ve been more comfortable in the middle, dressing slightly more androgynous. I am definitely read as a cis woman, maybe a lesbian if anything. 

I’ve had thoughts and quirks for years that I either didn’t notice or thought they were crazy. Every time I try on an outfit or a new piece of clothing for many years I instinctively compress my boobs to my chest to see what it would look like flat chested, and immediately feel relieved. I am so envious of men with flat chests and women with small boobs. I recently bought a compression bra that has felt amazing, but I think I’ve resisted wearing only binders/sports bras because it doesn’t make me feel sexy and also maybe makes me feel less desirable as a lesbian (?). I can’t tell if my desire to be feminine is genuine or because it’s how I’ve seen myself and wanted to be seen by partners.

But when I would see boys who dressed feminine, that was when I felt the strongest desire and admiration, but not in a romantic way necessarily. But I thought it was crazy to be a woman who wanted to be a feminine boy/andro person. And I was confused because I thought to myself, “if I like looking feminine, why does it feel so goddamn uncomfortable when I do it now? Why do I want to wear a bra with a flat chest but hate wearing one now?” I came to the conclusion (helped immensely after reading posts where others felt the same) that when I dress feminine now, I’m read and see myself as a cis woman, whereas I’m most comfortable being seen as an androgynous, non binary person who can embody masculinity and femininity at different times to different degrees. 

The thing I have been most stuck on right now is the thought of top surgery. The only reason I’ve come to all these realizations in the first place is I let myself imagine getting a breast reduction, and the thought of top surgery crept into my head, and I frantically googled things like “lesbians getting top surgery” to try to figure things out. But if I got a breast reduction all I could imagine was the doctor telling me how small they could make my boobs and feeling disappointed that my chest wouldn’t be flat.

When I came out as a lesbian, I actually came out as bi. Not because I was attracted to boys, but because I felt like it gave me some remnant of heteronormativity and I was scared of just being a full-blown lesbian and the shame associated with it. Later, I couldn’t even imagine why I did that, I was so comfortable and grateful to be gay. I’m worried I’m doing the same thing now— I’m fighting the idea that I could actually be non-binary and might want top surgery because it just feels too overwhelming, even though it also feels right. I suppressed admitting to myself I was a lesbian until my best friend basically asked me point blank because she knew, and I’ve often looked at NB people w/ top surgery and thought “I’m not that type of person”. But I think it stems from fear and stigma more than anything.

I never have overwhelming chest dysphoria— on good days I can recognize that I look beautiful, but they still just feel like they’re just “there”, not a part of me. But while i don’t hate my boobs all the time, when I get dressed, I’ve really never once enjoyed how I look with my boobs showing even the slightest. There are so many things, including feminine things, I think I would love to wear with a flat chest. Also, in a weird way, top surgery just feels like it would restore my body to “neutral”, like a blank canvas I could do anything with. I think I would even love having longer hair more with a flat chest. 

I think part of my issue is the trans narrative that is perpetuated that you have to hate your body to want surgery. I don’t mean to dismiss anyone who feels extreme dysphoria, but I think a part of my brain feels like I’m not trans enough for it, or that I have to despise myself to want change, which I know logically isn’t true. But I guess a tiny part of me is worried about regret? But when I think about it, I’ve spent so much more time being envious and fantasizing about a flat chest than I have really genuinely loving my boobs (probably a sign that I used to wish I had a medical reason to get a mastectomy bc then I could get the surgery without explaining anything).

I know it’s nothing I have to decide right now, but I’m feeling overwhelmed thinking about it, and the fact that I haven’t really come out to anyone. I’m lucky in that I know everyone who I care about will support me, but I think I’m most worried about telling my gf. Even telling her about a breast reduction was difficult, and she said she’d support me but (half jokingly) as long as I didn’t go all the way and remove them. I think she was worried (speaking generally) about a partner transitioning to a trans man (which I’m not), so I’m not sure how she’d feel about me being NB, but I’m worried it won’t align with her lesbian identity. It’s hard bc I still want to ID as a lesbian, or soft butch or whatever, which I know I can, but it’s more complicated in a relationship.

If you’ve read this far, I’m very impressed, this is the first time I’ve put all these thoughts down. All I can say is, after finding a few non binary people on Instagram and desperately searching for people who looked the way I imagined myself, and found this Reddit and the beautiful pictures people post and the words written I thought only existed in my head and the support people give each other, my heart has swelled immensely. I can’t wait until I can fully embrace myself the same way."	"Also a new somewhat confused enby here! I feel that if you have given the situation this much thought and feel so strongly about it then top surgery is probably for you and by the sounds of things I doubt you will have any regrets with that situation but sit with it as long as needed to make the choice with full confidence. It can be difficult finding your place as a enby I for one would like to go on estrogen but I dont want breasts so im kinda out of luck there im lucky enough to have great feminine legs and butt so that balances my figure out enough to feel okay with my situation. Good luck on your 
Journey!!!!
Thank you so much! Yeah, I agree, and am happy to hear you’re also figuring out what feels best for you. Best of luck to you too!"	l8ece7	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-01-30 05:01:29
A little help with deciding my gender	" Hi I'm currently in my mid-twenties.

Throughout my life, I've identified as a girl. As someone who's afab, that's what people told me I was anyway. But I was never particularly feminine, in presentation and mentally, too, I guess. I liked wearing looser-fitting shirts that hid my curves and figure, wearing sports bras more than regular bras because they gave me a flat-chested look that I loved, and I liked letting my leg hair grow out and feeling fuck all towards the idea that i needed to shave. The only stereotypically feminine thing I liked was having long hair. This style or presentation kinda fell more along the lines of a long-haired tomboy or skater girl, if that makes sense. But I felt happy and at peace with it. 

But as I grew up, my mother (and other women, men, and society) urged me that I needed to mature into a more ‘womanly’ presentation. I had been completely fine with my body or even people labeling me as a girl, so long as I got to be myself. But I learned that in this world,  'girl' means i have fuck-tons more image-based expectations than 'boys.'  But...I just went along with it because I thought that was just what girls and afabs all had to do and that there was no other option.    

But two things I want to mention though before I go on:

**1)** I've always wanted to either remove my breasts or just have ways to flatten them whenever i want. I wouldn't mind having bigger breasts if I had the chance, but more often than not, I gravitate to liking a more flat-chested kinda look.

**2)** I've always wanted to get my uterus removed or at least make it unfunctional. The idea of \[my body\] carrying a pregnancy has always been genuinely repulsive to me. I've tried imagining what it'd be like, but it's just not truly for me. Additionally, I've never and still don't see the reason why I need to \~embrace\~ menstruating every month when I don't intend to be pregnant - (tiny rant), there's like this weird pressure for afab people to \~be at one with\~ the fact that we bleed. I genuinely hate it and usually when I've brought it up to cis women or try to find resources online on permanently stopping menstruation, I always find gaslighty shit like """"but you need to embrace it because it's a natural part of being a woman."""" It's always been uncomfortable and dismissive of my experience.(tiny rant over)

But because binding my chest and liking its flattened look, not wanting a uterus, not wanting to carry children, and hiding my feminine body - this all made me wonder if I truly was cis. But I ultimately pushed the thoughts down and tried focusing on life. 

Then about 2 or 3 years ago, I found some hyper-femininity channels on YT. These are videos that basically teach girls and afab people how to present more femininely in order to basically look more attractive \[most often to straight men\]. The women who made these vids usually talked about how freeing it was to embrace femininity after they had long rejected or abandoned it due to living in a world that favored/respected masculinity.

After stumbling upon these, I thought by that presenting more femininely than I had ever have in my life, then something finally would click, and I would start finally feeling cis or ""like a girl"". I had been so gaslighted into believing that something was wrong with me for not feeling like a girl, that I thought this was my answer. 

Soon, I bought a shit ton of pastel skirts, dresses, accessories, etc and wore them frequently. But quickly, I realized that I felt like I was performing femininity, instead of it being a very natural part of me. And it left me feeling more confused.

But this past week something marvelous happened. Because the summer months are here, I've been trying to go outside more. I've been putting on sports bras again, loose-fitting t-shirts, and shorts that show my unshaven legs. Things I haven't done in a loooooong time. And I've been feeling so much euphoria over seeing my body like this. It's the same appearance that I loved as a child - the same one that I had been shamed about by women, men, and society - felt like home to me. And I think it clicked that this presentation is 100% home to me. It's always been home, and I'm now more solid in saying fuck all to anyone who tries to shame me ever again.  

But I do still wonder which gender do I mostly resonate with? Overall, I don't think I ever hated or felt dysphoric about my female body (just my breasts and my uterus - and sometimes i've wanted a more androgynous face and voice). But I hate with a fiery passion how \[in America\] femininity and feminine expectations are forced on afab people, instead of letting us have the choice to express/embrace it to our own desires or not. It's fucking toxic.

Alot of people in my liberal circles have come out as nonbinary, and for a little while now, I have been, too (more specifically as a demigirl/woman). I know pronouns don't equal gender, but to get away from the ""she"" label for a bit, I've been wearing they/them pronoun pins, and adding they/them to my accounts while I figure things out. So far:

**+**I like agender, because I've read that it means that a person just wants to be seen as a person, not as a gender. 

**+**I like demigirl, because I resonate with being biologically female, and to some degree, the concept of being a woman, but I hate gender norms/expectations so much that I don't entirely want to put myself or let myself be put entirely in the binary again. Plus, I also like demigirl + agender, for times when i’m fine if I’m seen as a girl, but also want to just be a person without binary expectations).

**+**I like trans masc, because of the whole enjoying having a flat chest, hiding my feminine figure, and I don't mind being perceived as a soft-masculine person sometimes : )

**+**I like genderfluid, because I enjoy having a flat chest, etc... while also still enjoying stereotypically feminine things from time to time (skirts, dresses, pastels)

**+**And then there's cis. I don't mind if I’m cis, but I’m not entirely certain about anything yet.  

I've been researching alot, and I still don't know yet, so if anyone can help in figuring out my gender identity, even if it's beyond this list, that'd be great. Also, this was long as hell, so if you made it this far, just want to say thank you : )"	"Wow, are you a clone of me? I've been through almost exactly all that stuff. I've never liked the idea of being girly or feminine. I like baggy clothes and don't care for my chest. I didn't shave my legs for the first time until after high school and I've never worn makeup. 

I grew up with my dad and brother, and after high school I moved in with my mom since she wasn't a huge presence in my life. She insisted I be more ""ladylike"" and I wore my first dress when I was living with her at 19. I started wearing dresses and feminine clothes. I sort of like feeling pretty but also it just showed way too much of me. 

I've never wanted children or to be pregnant and also hate my uterus. Birth control has been a blessing. I'm one of the lucky ones who stopped having periods altogether on it (I have the implant, Nexplanon, so I never forget to take it).

It took until last fall (I was 27) to realize that I'm not cisgendered. 

Now I can't help you choose what to categorize yourself as, but for me, I know that I don't want to be female. I don't feel female and I never really have. I used to daydream about being a boy because it wasn't being a girl. But I also know I'm not a male. But I do have a female body. Without the boobs, I'm okay with that as my uterus doesn't trouble me due to my bc. Male clothes make me very happy and comfortable and give me euphoria. So I reasoned that I'm in between. More female in body, but presenting myself as more male through clothing. If the two genders were a spectrum, I am smack in the middle.

To me, this means I'm non-binary. I'm happy with that label and I use neutral pronouns and everything. I'm a spouse, child, sibling, and potato. I'm okay not going further into it, but if I did I would consider myself agender. I'm not one and not really both and I'm neither while having qualities of each. I use what I am to kind of mix the two to create androgyny. 

So, a long comment for your long post haha. In the end, labels don't matter. Do what makes you happy!
Thank you so much for your response! I loved hearing your story so much and it was validating for me. I highly appreciate your openness (and how you label yourself as a potato haha). Thank you, this helped out alot!!
You're very welcome! I'm happy to share my experiences. I tried to give enough detail without writing a novel, haha. 

I must confess identifying as a potato was something I took from another enby here. I love potatoes, so I thought it was great. 

Happy to answer any more question you have or just chat! 😊"	nhyhja	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-05-21 17:48:02
"Encountered a weird/gross ""ally"" today."	"Met a freind of a friend this new years (as well as several other people, most of whom were cool). She's the type of person who left the city for college (which tends to be a weirdly commen trait amoung people I can't stand for some reason) so I won't be seeing her often.

She was compleatly cis het, and got weirdly excited when she learned I was trans. She tried to take a picture of me, and kept talking about how ""proud"" of me she was and how I was ""cute"". When I mentioned I was recovering from surgery that made me without either set of genitals, she started asking some really uncomfotable questions, and then said I was, ""so pure and clean now"".

Eventally it came up that I have a girlfreind (note that I'm afab) she said a lot of really homophonbic stuff about how I should try dating guys, and how it's such a shame I'm with a girl. 

I tried sutting an apple with a dagger while making eye contact with her, and that seemed to get her away.

I really wish progressive cis people just treated me as a normal person, and not like... a cool bird. God, it feels like this generation has a woke version of heathers."	"I’m sorry if this is a rude question, but what surgery leaves you without either set of genitals? I’m afab non-binary and didn’t know that existed as an option.
Its called nullification. Basically srs but without adding a penis, and just leaving me nice and smooth."	ruisa5	NonBinary	10	0.85	2022-01-02 20:38:18
My friend group have been super supportive of me	"I came out to my friend group as a demiboy (I'm amab) before we went camping over the weekend. They were all super supportive and politely inquisitive. And while we were camping, during an unrelated discussion, they were all talking about taking a trip to Scotland and wearing kilts unshamefully (they're mostly guys). We also had discussions about parents shaming us for acting non-masculine and how stupid doing that is. Also my closest friend (who is also nonbinary) is coming shopping with me this weekend so we can help each other get over our anxiety about shopping for clothes in the opposites sex's section. 

I am so happy that I've found people to hang out with that don't believe in toxic gender norms. They've made my recent coming out so much easier than I could have ever expected. I don't think they'll find this post, but nonetheless I wanted to say that I love them all to death. 

And to anyone who feels like they can't be their true self because of the people around them, there is still hope. There are people in this world who will accept you for who you are and let you be free in your own body. They may not come in to your life now, but they will eventually. Be willing to put yourself over other people and leave behind people who make you feel trapped or invalidated. My love goes out to you and I hope you can find good friends and people to surround yourself with <3"	"Thank you for this 😊❤️

Am I experiencing Bottom dysphoria ?	"Hey!
I’m trying to find out the difference between bottom dysphoria or if it’s less or something more. I identify as Asexual and female, it’s the time of the month where things usually trigger me, idk I get anxious and depressed more than usual and I think and think. Even tho, Who am I to complain? When I can just suck it up and live when others suffer more than I do? Being genuinely serious though, just wanna know. 

Questioning more in depth of why I identify as ace:
________________
I was thinking, maybe I’m asexual because I’m uncomfortable having sex? (( even though I’m not attracted to anyone but it can play a part, some aces are sex repulsed))
I’m not comfortable with my vagina, I feel depressed and sad almost- like I wanna rip my skin apart when I do have sex. Even simply pleasuring myself, after I’m done- I feel relief but at the same time I just get a crushing feeling. Like why? Almost shameful but not. 
________________

Body hair/my vagina:
I never shave down there, I don’t know why I don’t know, I just don’t. I don’t feel compelled to, even though most prefer ‘shaved’ when they have sex and that also occurs in my mind. If I shaved would I be more satisfied? But then I picture it bare and I feel no relief, in fact I feel more gross. I hate the way my genitalia looks to, why. Why can’t it just poof. If it was pretty would I be happy? Would I feel satisfaction? I don’t know. Sometimes I feel a itching feeling, like irritation. It hardly comes up, if I’m thinking about preforming sex, or getting undressed for someone. I wanna hide myself. I could careless about my boobs or any other part of my body. I just don’t feel comfortable with my vagina. I cry sometimes, wishing I was born with a dick. I would be out of place though wouldn’t I? Can’t have both words. Would sex be different for me if I had a penis? When I do have sex I feel like almost a phantom limb, I feel the action of preforming like a male but I can’t act on it? The idea of strap ons make me slightly less afraid of sex but still, it’s not the same. 
______________

Body:
Sometimes I look at my face and think I need a more defined jaw line, 🤷🏻‍♀️. I’m fine with my boobs, but that’s because there small. If I had actual boobs- I feel like I’d cry. I’d die. I like my feminine body but sometimes I feel like I crave something more. 
Clothing;
I feel extremely hot and bomb af when I’m wearing masculine cloths. But who cares? I don’t base myself off of items or anything of the sort. I’m a perfect mix, even my hair. I feel fine in dresses, suit and tie. Even though I dress in the in between my whole life.
_____

I don’t quite know if I left anything out. Pronouns, cloths, those things don’t matter to me. I don’t care how others see me, I don’t feel any sort of emotion when someone says she/he/they. Who cares? But who knows, maybe I do care. I’m in the in between like always. All that matters is the actual feelings. I won’t label myself, I just wanna know if it’s dysphoria I’m experiencing because then I want to try to tame it so I can experience peace."	"If you haven't already, please flair your post.

I’m confused and scared	Hey, I’m Leo and I’m a trans guy. I had a long confusing journey with my gender, and IDed as nb for a significant part of it. I kinda excused that as being too scared to “go all the way” once I came out as binary trans, but thinking about it I feel like I might not be binary. I still love my masc name I’m on T and it’s changed my life for the better and still want to be perceived as male but a couple days ago I got someone who seemed confused when they saw me and instead of shame I felt that joy again, the way I did back when I was in the closet and androgynous. I think I might be an nb dude, which is so scary to me bc I’ve spent so much time trying to prove I’m ‘really male’ and I feel like I’m not nb enough to actually be nb. I’m scared and probably never gonna come out about it but. This is something.	"Yeah, the struggle with ""how trans am I"" is real. Maybe it will help to think of NB as being a very big space. Being defined as ""not-X"" has its problems, but one of the nice things about it is that there is room for a lot of identities in there. I know of multiple folks on HRT and/or surgical transition who still identify as NB. Strength to you!
The way I see it is like, you wouldn't shame a bisexual person for not fully committing to being gay or straight, so don't shame yourself for not being fully male or female."	cacbsl	NonBinary	8	1.0	2019-07-07 21:36:35
Social dysphoria	"I hate that I get very dysphoric when people misgender me and yet can't work out the strength to tell them I'm NB. 

My flatmate just said jokingly about me : ""I'm special, I'm not like other girls"". I'm AFAB and I've felt like I wasn't a girl my whole life so I really couldn't laugh. I really wanted to come out but I ended up saying ""I want to answer to this on so many levels"", closed myself and the conversation ended awkwardly

I know he is trans-friendly and all that, so why couldn't I just say ""Actually I'm not like other girls, I'm non binary""? 

I hate the shame I feel, I hate that I feel like I'm hiding who I am, being untrue and hypocritical, and at the same time I still feel like maybe it's not there and I'm making it up..."	"Welcome to dysphoria. Confused agender here so I say the easiest way to get the words out is with writing or a cake that has the nonbinary flag on it. Try it, it really works
I feel like no one even knows what the non binary flag is and what non binary means here. And that if I come out I'll have to justify it over and over again. People will force me to say personal stuff and then disregard it anyways
I don't know what to say, I mean your right but saying your nonbinary should be enough but in the end no one will truly understand but you have to keep strong otherwise you'll lose and losing means that no one will ever try to understand so explain it to them time and again so they can at least try to understand. There will be people who will never understand and that's ok just explain it to the people who will try to understand."	h179cq	NonBinary	9	1.0	2020-06-11 20:26:14
Feeling ashamed about my identity	"Lately I’ve been struggling with being NB in certain areas of my life. I’m part of an awesome community based around my favorite hobby where I have plenty of other friends who are all extremely accepting, and a few of them are NB as well. I’m out at work and everyone on staff is supportive of my identity. In these situations, I feel validated and natural. I’m 28 and have identified as NB since I was 10, though at the time I didn’t have a word for it, I just told people I didn’t feel like a boy or a girl.

However, I’ve been struggling when it comes to interacting with people outside of my inner circles. I tend to get misgendered a lot, both by patrons at work and by strangers, and it’s emotionally exhausting. It makes me feel like my identity is a burden I’ve been forced to carry. Sometimes I wish I could’ve been born cis so I wouldn’t have the weight of getting misgendered constantly pushing me down. I feel so resentful for having these feelings, even if they only pop up occasionally, because I am overall comfortable in my identity.

I was also recently rejected by a friend I’m very romantically attracted to because I identify as NB, and it’s making this weird shame feel so much worse. This friend knew my identity prior and has been supportive of it, and is undoubtedly an ally. I know my friend didn’t do it to hurt me and is struggling with a lot of internal problems as well, but having that as the first stated reason for saying no to me cut deep, especially because this friend has shown attraction back to me so I thought it would go well.

Sometimes I feel like it’s my fault for not presenting “androgynous” enough for people to inquire about my identity before assuming. Sometimes I resent being NB because it feels like it just makes life harder. I feel so ashamed about these thoughts and wish I could own being NB like I see so many of my amazing other friends do, but sometimes it’s just so hard. It’s been a struggle lately.

Does anyone else struggle with similar feelings of shame, and what sorts of things do you do to help cope with it?"	"Thank you for reading my post, and thank you in advance for any insight and support. I very much appreciate it.
I accepted myself as nonbinary within the last year. So, I don’t have solutions to offer, but can say that so much of this resonates with me.
Idk if this even helps, but for me I've told myself it doesn't matter what others think or perceive me as, because their worldview is not my reality. I am able to live within my own reality knowing that my identity and place is real and authentic for myself. I also don't really tell strangers unless gender specific subjects come up. But tbh, I HAAAAATE when people say ""sir, excuse me sir"" but I like it when I'm perceived as a woman and ""maam'd"" simply because that means they aren't as sure about their gender perception as they think. Again. That's personal, but I think it helps to remind yourself that the opinion or viewpoint of others is not yours and not your reality.
I've said this before in this sub but i don't owe anyone androgny. Neither to you or anyone else. I haven't been solid in my gender identity for that long but I have had a visible disability my whole life. Believe it or not there's a hell of a lot of overlap so in a way I've had a lifetime of practice. There are times I would have given anything to not have my disability, I've had people make weird/hurtful/absurd assumptions about me because of my disability, and I've had people not want to be romantically involved because of it. All stuff I had to deal with because I'm nonbinary as well.

It's gonna sound trite maybe but at the end of the day it's not something about yourself that you can change. You can absolutely closet yourself if that's something you need to do, though I don't recommend it. Really your best option is to be yourself in spite of all that. Some of it won't change. Most people are binary so no matter how you look people are gonna make assumptions. But at the same time you are also gonna find your people. Friends that support you and people that want to be with you romantically regardless. And those are the things that matter. 

The other stuff is always gonna be unfair and exhausting but it gets easier when you have the good stuff to focus on. I understand none of what I said is easy. But it *is* possible I promise."	1251fde	NonBinary	8	0.91	2023-03-28 20:35:42
Pronouns in bio?	"Ok not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know where to post if that’s the case! 

I’m non-binary, but not fully “out” yet. My close friends and many strangers know, but there are still a lot of people in my life I’m not ready to tell. Plus, I live in a conservative place. 

I’ve noticed a lot on social media lately mostly cis people making posts like “PUT YOUR PRONOUNS IN YOUR BIO ITS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.” I’m pretty sure they’re directing it at other cis people to normalize sharing pronouns. And I do know a lot of non-binary and trans ppl who also have their pronouns in their bio. Personally, I feel so uncomfortable with having my pronouns in my bio at the moment, mainly because of the people I haven’t told yet. Is this ok? I share my pronouns with others when I remember, and personally, my pronouns are pretty flexible so I’m usually not too bothered when I’m called the wrong ones. I know that’s not the case for everyone though. 

At the same time I feel like I’m inconsiderate for not including pronouns in my bio online. I feel like I’m just hiding in shame. I feel like people who don’t yet know I’m non-binary assume that I’m just an inconsiderate cis person who doesn’t care about pronouns. 

I’d like to know peoples thoughts on this, please!"	"from what i understand, the point of cis people having pronouns in their bio is so that is is seen as something anyone can do. A lot of trans/enby people tend to have pronouns in their bio, which can make them a target. Having cis people participate makes that somewhat less likely to happen. If you don’t feel comfortable having pronouns in you’re bio that is completely fine. It takes courage if you are trans/enby. Take your time. I hope that was helpful in some way:)
My demi-husband and I both push back at people who say things like that because it would have made us uncomfortable when we were eggs; indeed it was someone asking them to state their pronouns in a meeting that was one of the things which cracked their egg.

Often the response is “oh, I hadn’t thought of that, I didn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable”.
Whatever you feel comfortable with is fine. You're doing great.
No one cares abt ur pronouns and ur not non binary. Not a real thing

Non-binary and body hair	"Ever since I started growing body hair, I have always wanted to remove it. I don't know if this is because I associated hairless bodies with femininity or if I actually prefer less hair. I think it was mainly to do with me having control over how I looked, without having to explain it to anyone else, and the highly gendered body hair appearance in western culture surely made little me want to feel prettier and less hairy. As I noticed these feelings, I felt shameful over them and wanted to hide them. I then decided to grow my facial hair as much as I could, and have kept it ever since. Firstly it was as a sort of disguise, to ""trick"" others and myself into being my masculine assigned gender, and then it just kind of became my look later in my 20s which I do like for the most part. Now that I am out to a few people, include you all on here, I do want to experiment with body hair more, what I truly like and what I don't. Like with body mods, I am way more comfortable experimenting where others cannot obviously see, and leave the rest of my body the same masculine self I have presented as for so long until I am comfortable with my gender identity and expression. Does anyone else get euphoria from body hair/lack there of? And how can I work to uncouple my mind from less body hair making me feel more feminine. I always encourage and want my friends, especially those on the feminine side of gender, to grow their body hair and think it is attractive and resilient for them. But at the same time, I want to wax off all my hair below the neck, especially on my arms and armpits as I hope to be braver and wear more sleeveless clothes. 

Just wanted to throw this out there if anyone has any thoughts or experiences around body hair similar to mine."	"I have dark hair, and one thing that feels very ""non-binary"" to me is leaving the hair as it grows and bleaching it. I kinda love that it's something different than just shaving/not, and if it's established hair, the bleach lasts for easily a month before there's enough new growth to be worth redoing it. This is of course not at all to invalidate your wishes for your own body!! I've just been surprised by how much I like the bleached hair, and it doesn't feel like nearly as much of a commitment in terms of letting other people see it.
I have very much very dark hair, and have begun using depilatory cream to remove it from my hands and fingers. I wondered if I'd end up wanting to remove it from my arms entirely, but I ended up using a trimmer to just cut down on the arm hair, which was almost as pleasing a result as removing the other hair. That said, the hair on my hands and fingers starts growing back within a day or two, and can feel kind of stubbly, which I also hate. I'd like to figure out a way of dealing with this that isn't expensive, because I'm afraid laser removal might be the only real way to get rid of it, and I am wayyyyy too poor for that.
I generally spend >half the year hairy and <half the year between clean shaved and a bit stubbly for my leg and armpit hair.

I have these conflicts about shaving because sometimes I think I look better with leg hair and sometimes without. Then add on the social pressure that if I’m wearing traditionally feminine clothes I feel like I shouldn’t have leg hair. Well, that makes me feel conflicted about whether I’m upholding ridiculous standards by caving and shaving, or if it really doesn’t matter and it’s my body my choice so if I want shaved legs when I’m wearing a cute sundress then by golly I’ve a right to them. But the other side pipes back up saying is that really *my* desire or do I secretly just want to avoid any potential public shame?

Considering I end up with shaved legs most summers, then obviously the desire to feel more right in my clothes wins over any political ideology that I should be an example of not caving to the razor. 

Armpit hair is more tricky because I almost never *want* it shaved. But it’s easier to get through a summer with less of it, so sometimes I compromise and trim rather than fully remove, but if there’s a special outfit like a formal dinner where I’m wearing a dress then I shave purely to cave to what’s deemed Profeshunal.

There you have it, tmi about my body hair habits.

Fwiw I live in an area where there are enough people that no one pays nearly as much attention to me as I think they do, but I don’t see/notice anyone nearby who presents in feminine style and isn’t shaved, so it technically stands out when I do. If I wanted to I could visit districts where dyed armpit hair would be rad and par for the course. It’s just not my neighborhood.
I am super hairy, but fairly blonde. I get neither dysphoric nor euphoric from it. It is just something I don‘t care about, since it‘s easy enough to leave and light enough to not be super visible instantly. (It‘s always funny when someone is close to me and sees my body hair and goes like „whaaaat? You‘re so hairy!“ lol)
Regarding facial hair. I never liked it for myself. It comes in dark for me. I spent a lot of years clean shaven, with the occasional exploration into sideburns and or a goatee. I felt this facial hair worked well with makeup when I would go out.  I also felt the goatee and sideburns weren't too overbearing in my expression.   But grooming and shaping the hair definitely helps with my opinion of it. Maybe it's that agency or as you put it, control?

In the end everyone should pursue however they feel comfy. 

Have to say I've enjoyed reading  this discussion. It's nice to find and read about other's feelings about, and ways of dealing with, body hair. This is not something I could discuss with the company I usually find myself in.
that is a really cool idea and glad it has worked for you! I might try this too as it does feel very much in line with the aesthetic I would like too. How difficult is it to bleach and have you tried any other dyes or colors? And what kind of reactions have you gotten when/if anyone has noticed?
Bleaching is really easy, there's a kit where you combine some powder and cream and then just smear it on for eight minutes, I think, and rinse off and you're done. I usually use half of it to do both my legs, for example. Where I live it's a little uncommon but not shocking to see either men with shaved body hair or women with unshaved, so I've gotten second glances but nobody's said anything. No other colors yet, though I have definitely seen people with dyed armpit hair!"	u2cobe	NonBinary	7	0.9	2022-04-12 23:44:54
Name confusion!	"So I was looking up nonbinary names and found one that just kinda... hit different...? Like, it felt comfortable. Like air? I don't really know how to describe it. But I'm not sure how I feel about this new feeling. I've always just kinda... accepted my birth name and haven't delved too deep into it because I was dealing with bigger trauma issues. Now that I've been working on them, I found this name that gives me soft feelings, and I don't know how to what to do with it! I'll be talking to my therapist about it. She'll probably say something along the lines of. ""You've been hurt in your childhood and now don't know how to handle positive feelings, since the only feelings you were used to was shame and that became your normal."" Or something like that... Anyways, I just wanted to vent a bit about this new, weird thing in my life."	"If it makes you feel that way, then use it!!
\^\^\^ agreed! if another name makes you feel better than your birthname does, why not use it!
