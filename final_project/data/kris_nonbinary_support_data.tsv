My 76 year old papa is trying so hard and I never expected this kind of support from him because of the era he was raised in		"Whatever era they were raised in, some people just gain enough wisdom through their lives to know what really matters. ❤️ Thank you so much for sharing; this is truly heartwarming.
I love that he starts with baby girl before asking if you want a boy/girl b-day card. But he's trying which is awesome!

Also, happy birthday to you!
He's a little confused but he got the spirit ❤
This is very sweet, thanks for sharing.
Ugh this is quite sweet. Thanks for sharing haha
This would have meant the world to me too. Yes, he is definitely trying which is more than we can say for a lot of other people.
This is so sweet! I love it. Also do you go by Ellis? If so, you're the first other nb besides myself I've come across named Ellis! 🙂
Oh no, my heart; this is too wholesome.
💗
I think they make “grandchild” cards if that’s something you’d be interested in? This is so sweet though. He’s doing his best 💜

Elderly transphobes are bad for their time too.

But your papa is sweet and deserves recognition too.
sorry but i can't read ""hey baby girl"" normally anymore 💀😭
So sweet
Aw how sweet to try. There are going to be things in 50 years that we won’t understand, but we can try
If I had a wholesale award I’d give it to ya.
Awww... that's so sweet!
Damn that’s nice of him
This is precious.
Aww, this is so cute.

BRB crying 😿

When I'm a confused old fart, screwing up my grandkids' neopronouns, I hope they point it out to me. So I can spring out of my lazy chair and do The Carlton.
I am also called Charlie and my pronouns are also they/them :)

Edit: And yes I agree.
It's not quite the same thing but I always love reading r/AccidentalAlly
Yes! I found the name on an article about older gender neutral names and fell in love. I’ve been using it for about 3-4 years now

Hiya recently came out as Non-Binary going by the name Luna and They/Them pronouns. Unfortunately my family has not been supportive...		"Luna, I absolutely love your aesthetic!

I hope your parents will come around. Stay in there! <3
1) Luna, I absolutely love the clothing and hair colour combo, very close to my aesthetic and it's always rad to see!
2) Hopefully it's only a short term thing and once they get their heads round it they get their s*it together and start being supportive.
3) if they start being terrible try to reach out to someone local immediately so you have backup on the worst case. 
4) Congratulations on coming out! It's hard to do and I'm constantly impressed by people keeping at it!
We’re your family now
Hi Luna! Congratulations on the self exploration and journey. It can take time for family to understand which is BS in my opinion ... It's been 2 years since I came out and my mom is still convinced they/them isn't grammatically correct. I've bluntly said, ""Are you telling ME that you know more about me than I do?""   
She made up some BS excuse and how she ""supports me"" but ... then ... doesn't show ANY support.   


Right now, chosen family will be your best humans. Sadly our society does gender policing of AMAB folks soo much and view it on some sort of attack. You are beautiful and valid and we are here. Definitely reach out to a local pride group, and make sure that you have people who see and validate you. 

Your family is wrong and losing a beautiful opportunity to support and hold space for a beautiful human who is learning and growing to know themself more each day. 

Love your whole look! <3
Look at me, I'm the family now!

Plus, your aesthetic is awesome, as is your name choice! Reminds me of a lot of songs about the Moon: *Luna y sol*, *By the rising of the Moon*, *Mesecina*...
I love the hair, Luna.
Luna, you are EVERYTHING! You look radiant & confident, don't let anyone take that from you! Queer Fierceness 🏳‍🌈🖤✨
Hi Luna! I love your top and vibe so much!
Also you are rocking that hairstyle!
All the positive vibes~!
Hey Luna! 
You know, as a queer person you get to choose your family ☺️
We love you! ♥️
i know how u feel, my mom is transphobic and still refers to me as female. my dad is fine as long as i dont join a cult, and my siblings are to young to understand. i hope thing will be better for you.  also love the hair.
Ahhhh Luna!! You look so awesome :3 keep rocking it
luna suits u!
You are awesome. Never let anyone make you think otherwise.
We support you Luna!
Sorry to hear that Luna, hopefully your family comes around soon. I adore your everything. I WANT TO BE YOU!! Love your hair. Love your clothes. Love your face. You just look incredible.
Luna is a cool name
Luna is a gorgeous name! Can I also just say how much I love your style, omg that shirt...
Yaaaas, Luna! Congrats! Love the blue in your hair.💛
I’m sorry about your family… maybe it will just take time, family Is forever and they probably will come around eventually. Side note you look amazing hun❤️
I support you Luna!🌙💝
I love your look! And what a beautiful name! I'm so sorry that your family isn't being supportive. I hope they will come around.
Luna is a cool name and so is your hair
i absolutely adore your shirt and smile!
We support you Luna! Love your name and your style! I hope you find your people and that your family comes around and loves you for you who are 💙
Luna is such a beautiful person, and they have a lovely smile!! 💖
That’s sad to hear Luna. :(

I absolutely love you style/outfit, you look stunning in it! I hope this brightens your day. :D
I have a pet toad named Luna.
I'm sorry your family won't stand behind you, Luna. Truly their loss if they don't get themselves together and accept who you are. No matter what, a chunk of the internet has your back.

On a lighter note, as others have also said, but I'll echo it: your sense of style is *fantastic.* You really rock *you,* even if your folks refuse to see it.
I love your hairstyle!
What annoys me is that the kind of people that arent supportive also seem to label themselves as like free thinkers and ok with everything, allies, when they arent involved with it. 

Eg my mother supportive of gay friends, not of me being bi. Family being totally fine with me dressing (quite frankly ridiculous as a teen haha but wearing a total mishmash and not having an obvious gender)...differently and being all yeah thats just them they dress weird. But as soon as you put a word to it ‘non binary’ its like hell no thats not ok. 

You CAN get support you need elsewhere. I dont contact any of my 4 parents now im an adult and ive never been so happy
💚💚 family is the worst sometimes 😪 I hope you’re able to be yourself regardless!
And your hair is amazing!
Hang in there Luna! 

Celebrate the win you just had though, you’re finally free and it’s out there now. 

It took my mom a longtime to come around, but she finally did. You got this! Keep shinning!
You are a fabulous person, Luna! Awesome wardrobe and hair! :)
I have no clue how your family could be unsupportive when you look that good
Luna I love your outfit and hair. You also have a great smile. I'm in a similar boat where I simply could not find out to my family. However, I have plenty of close friends who have been amazing.
you look wonderful, I'm sorry your family are bigots
Luna I aspire to be you in the most not weird way possible
Fuck your family, im your family now and i 100% support you!
YOOO POG YOUR AMAZING I’m proud of you:)
Omg that smile in the second picture! You're too freaking cute!! 😍
I hope your family comes around and in the meantime, know you are surrounded by love and family can be chosen, too. I’m happy for you and proud of you. :) btw ur outfit is SO cute
Hey Luna! I must say, I absolutely adore that outfit! And I'm really sorry that your family doesn't accept who you are. It's disappointing that some people consider themselves ""family"" when they don't even accept your identity. Welp, you have us! We'll love and accept you no matter what because you are valid and deserve love and respect! 💖
Luna is a delightful name, it suits you! I'm sorry your parents haven't been supportive, I hope they change their mind because you deserve acceptance~
Luna, you are amazing
Hey, Luna! The name's Bea. Nice to meet you. You look amazing
Love your style!

Sorry about your parents. I hope you have other people in your life who support you.
You look so androgynous!
Firstly, I'm so sorry about your parents, I hope they'll accept you soon!

Secondly: OH MY GOD I am totally envying your gender, a very cis thing for me to do, but nonetheless, your aesthetic is immaculate
do you know anything about Heathers? you look soo much like JD from the movie. I love your style :)
Your vibes are immaculate and I am your family now, if you need support lemme know 😊
Heya Luna! Nice to meet you. Fab hair!
We'll be supportive, btw Luna great choice in name I love to see a fellow Luna & it suits you, also you look cool as hell
I love the name Luna ☺️☺️
I love your sense of style and the fact that you’re embracing and exploring yourself ❤️ also the name Luna is so pretty, such a great choice. I hope you are surrounded by safety and support eventually, and that you have affirming friends 😊
You’re stunning! Don’t forget to remember that
You got the big drip FR FR tho
Sorry to hear about your family I hope your friends are supportive or you can find a support group! You look awesome!
Luna's a badass name though, you're family is nuts to not support you since you have such good tastes
Dear Luna 

When I first saw your image I thought you were wearing one of those robes monks wore in the middle ages

Sincerely, Pax

P.S. Luna is a very nice name.
Luna, I'm so sorry to hear that your family isn't supportive. Please know that you are valid and deserve love and support. If you happen to have tiktok or Instagram Jeffrey Marsh is a huge source of support and information.
Luna, your name is as cool and amazing as your hair!!! Your look is 🔥. Family isn’t always supportive, but a lot of times they end up coming around. And sometimes we find our true families later on. You’re amazing, stay true to yourself
Your outfit is AMAZING.
I'm not out to most of my family because they're bigots, I'm sorry you're going through that. But I'm proud of you!
sorry Luna :( i'm glad that you have the opportunity to understand yourself a bit better and you have nothing but love and support from me and the rest of this community!
Fuck family memebers
Luna, you look awesome!! Love your hair!! I understand having unsupportive family, sorry you have to deal with that too. Try not to let them stop you from being yourself <3
Lord you are freaking GORGEOUS Luna! 😭😍🥺
Look at us Luna. We are your family now :)
I’ll be your mom!! I’m so proud of you!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Luna you seem very cool! Love your hair and outift.
Omg you got some looks!!
I adore your style! Can I steal your hair style?
I love your aesthetic!! And I know it probably doesn’t mean much from a stranger online, but I’m 100% supportive and if you ever wanna text me if you’re not doing too good, I got you. I reckon we’d get along
Let the Queer community be your family😊
Amazing outfit and I love your hair ✌
Can I be you
[removed]
Luna,you gave me a heart attack! Moreover,i adored your hair.Peace out <3
I love your hair! How do you style it like that?
You look absolutely amazing! Welcome to the world of non-binaries Luna!
I fucking love that name, Luna!! And you’re hot af.
Well Luna, I think that is a lovely name and suits you very well ❤️ please feel free to reach out! I’m always looking for enby friends!
Luna I absolutely love your smile, your clothes are super pretty too and your hair looks epic <3
Haii! You're so cute I love your outfit 💕 I'm sorry about your family not supporting you. That's why you've got us!
Luna. WHAT THE FUCK YOU LOOK GREAT. Your hair is amazing, and that shirt is just- AAA
Be you, be happy! You also have a great smile, keep being yourself!
Hi Luna I love your outfit!!❤️❤️
Looking great, Luna! :)💙✨
Hey Luna! I love your style
Hey Luna, I see that you're seeing plenty of this already but you look awesome, you are valid, you seem totally awesome and your family is wrong. :D
Cool shirt. Does this style have a name to search?
So sorry your family hasn’t been supportive! I know the feel. You look amazing! Love the hair and your name totally matches it!
Also this is a compliment but you remind me of Christian slaters JD 👁👁
Great name and gorgeous look! 

I'm sorry your family isn't there for you and hope they will come around. In the meantime, please know I'm sending internet mom hugs if you want them and you can hit me up for mom advice, support, and encouragement any time you want. You are perfect just as you are and I admire your courage and ability to be true to yourself. Stay strong, dear one.
Oh my goodness, Luna, you look amazing! I can't think of a name that fits your vibe better than Luna *and* can I just say that your haircut looks absolutely killer with your face shape?
You almost look like Daniel Thrasher
Congrats on coming out, it’s never easy. You also have the same name as one of my black cats, it really suits you
I’m all about your whole look
Hot dang! Keep rocking it <3
Your hair style is amazing for your face shape 😍
You certainly look as cool as the moon!
bby i will adopt you. 

you’re doing amazing. i’m so proud of you.
Amazing sense of style! I'm sorry you're in a situation that isn't accepting, hope you can find a way out soon.
You are a confident and amazing being and your parents are dicks if they don't support you.
WOAH i love your style!! keep bein you bud!!
I'm sorry your parents weren't supportive but that doesn't make you any less valid!! You are valid and loved and I support you. Love your style too btw
It’s strange that your parents dont support their obviously stylish kid. I’m sure they’ll realize how much cooler you are now eventually
You are absolutely adorable omg 😍😍😍
People, especially older ones, have such a hard time with the non-binary concept, they’re so entrenched in the binary roles.  Hopefully time, love, and seeing you live your most authentic life will turn them around!  Cheers and best wishes!!
You seem like a sweet person! Here's hoping for you to meet a family to love and respect you and give you all the support you ever need! We all can be your far-away family right now!
Also, you look real fine ^_^
Luna you are so adorable, I wish I could pull that off, I’m looking for tips as an amab nb person myself, all the ideas I’ve seen other than you have just made me look like I’m ftm. I really hope your family come round soon, that’s why I’m still in the closet. If ever you wanna talk just ask for my Discord, I’m always on there.
Thanks 😊
I totally agree! I love how their nails match their hair!
Thanks I have am now an opshopping addict ahha, Thanks for the advice will keep that in mind 😁
I'm so glad my family includes not only Luna but also GothCatButt
Yes
Yes. Drink plenty of water and eat your veggies.
Awwwh thankss 🥰
Yeah in the past few months I have bought too many skirts and crop tops ahahah
It sure has 😁🥰😊
Yeah it's crazy because throughout my life I didn't really fit into social norms in terms of personality for being (amab) but it had been locked away because I was never in safe environments always had straight friends who treated me badly because I was different, I just never quite fitted in with most guys. I would of been in my element if I got into a friend circle of gays or girls because I can be quite flamboyant and just because of my gentle friendly nature. But the way things went never allowed for that. But i have grown and feeling amazing about my growth as a person despite my current situation with my family
Awhhh thankssss 😊
I know righttt, I own too many skirts now!!! 🤪
Yeah I have a very good circle of friends, moved into a queer flat at the start of the year where I have been able to explore myself a lot more. I love it here so much.
Yes i have had that before, I used to have black hair and I looked just like him
Awh thanksss sure do 😜
Yeah sure it's nothing fancy
[removed]
[removed]
Like the color or?
Awhh thankss 🥰
Also your outfit you posted the other day was very cute!
I don't know it's just a females sports lace hoodie I believe, found it at an opshop
Yep I have been getting a lot of that, I used to have black hair and the resemblance was pretty good
Thanksss
I obviously can't speak for Luna, but personally, if I'm gonna be surprised by an asshole in my face, I'd rather it be a GothCatButt than a judgmental human.
We're all family here.
You’re welcome. I can’t not complement someone who looks remarkable.
I don't think it's possible to have too many skirts and crop tops...
Yay! 🥰

Luna, I hope live a happy and healthy life where you can dress and express yourself however you want! :D
Lol. It looks great.

Aw thanks :)

My mom edited a meme she thought suited me for her fb. Can’t imagine a more mom themed type of support		"Sounds like a win to me
LMAOO great mom /gen
This is actually accurate. I was totally a Belle growing up. Brown hair, loves books, and was one of my favorite movies. 

I still like Belle fine, but just looking at my closet it’s all been replaced by Stitch.

Mom support! Nice!
Yo mama's such a badass she gave birth to u. :3
I needed this wholesome post today :)
Oh that is just too wholesome and awesome. A good mum at work there.
I love your mom
Ohana means family!
Gender role models as a boy:

- Andy Griffith
- John Wayne
- James T Kirk

Gender role models as an adult enby:

- Tom Selleck (mustache and booty shorts)
- Neo (trans allegory)
- Elim Garak (Queer icon)
- And now Stitch apparently

I am already growing a collection of silk Hawaiian shirts, so I guess its inevitable.
That's so sweet! <3
Always happy to see supportive parents
My personal goal in life is to have Belle's looks, but keep the Stitch energy. Also it's very sweet of your mom <3
LMAO my mom calls me “spawn”
Epic mum W
That is kind of wholesome
Awwww so sweet
Win win!!
X’D amazing
Yall who else wants this homie’s mom to adopt us? Cuz this is an awesome mom right here.
Damn i would give away my tits for a supportive mom like this. Both my parents make it a point to say ""there's my DAUGHTERRRRRRRR!!"" and deadname me every chance they get.
I live for super supportive parents like this!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
YAY IM HAPPY FOR YOU
Can I steal your mom
Your mom clearly has genius level vibe detection skills XD
She seems like a sweetie pie.
What a great mom
That's super cute
this is so gender omfg. also, your mom is fantastic.
Peak supportive mom behavior
Honestly, i love this
I wish my parents were like this
My mom just sent me the original and made no acknowledgement of the gendered language despite me being out for 2 years.

Edit: not to bring down your post! Glad your mom is supportive!!
that’s so adorable 😭
aw that's nice of her.
This is. So sweet. I wish my mom was like this
She been making more and more efforts to be inclusive and supportive in small ways like this, even editing old posts, and it means everything to me
im imagining this in the most literal sense. as in your entire closet is full of identifal stitch fursuits
thomas sanders
I love it!
Just sent this to both of my parents
It definitely took a several years for my mom to get to this point. I’ve been out for 9 years and only a few years ago did she start seriously making an effort. She never blatantly misgendered me, but she also didn’t try to gender me correctly either. I’m lucky to have a mom that eventually reached this point and does genuinely care enough, but it did take time
I’m sorry for your situation, I hope it can eventually improve as well
Idk if it’s the weed or just me or both but this makes me wanna cry 😭 ina good way!

I made the leap and finally came out as non binary (they/them) to my friends and family. I was disowned and laughed at by my parents (as expected). But the amount of support I've gotten from my friends and husband and offers from complete strangers to take the place of my parents warms my heart.		"How bittersweet-- I am sorry your parents failed you, as it is their job to support you no matter what. I am glad you are supported by others, though (and you have us, too)! You look really happy in this pic, too, with such a bright smile.
Family is whoever loves you. Welcome to ours.
Thank you for taking the steps needed to be genuine to yourself. Doesn't seem like they were much like what family should be to begin with, anyway. 

I'm a big believer in defining and creating your own family, anyway. Fuck people who call themselves 'family' but would rather protect their assumptions before starting with love, patience, compassion, and understanding.
You are giving Big Queer Joyous Energy and I am in full support! <3
I’m so sorry you weren’t accepted by your parents, that’s always so hard to deal with. Remember you are valid and loved no matter what!!
Look at that smile! You are radiating right now! Congratulations! I'm so sorry your parents reacted selfishly, and I hope they come around.
You are glowing!! I'm so excited for your heart!! Welcome, we have your back!!!
Congratulations, you made the leap, and the people who mean the most to you were supportive! Also fuck your parents
Congrats on coming out!!I'm sorry parents had to do this but just know that there always will be people to support you and it doesn't have to be family in particular- i'm happy for you overall
I'm glad to hear that your partner took it so well. My partner's support has been the #1 thing in keeping me sane and making me feel accepted.
I think family is just like gender in that sometimes the one you're born with just sucks, and your ""chosen"" one is better. Hope you're doing okay
Screw your parents, I'm your dad now. Brush your teeth and don't stay up too late, I love you <3
You are incredible and I wish you all the love and comfort in the world, no one deserves to be disowned, let alone over being your truest, most honest self. Well done for being so brave and courageous
You are an inspiration to those of us who have yet to come out!!! I'm so sorry that your parents were not supportive but thrilled that you had a great support system/found family in place when you took this step! Bask in the joy of being 100% you from here on out!!!!
I'm so happy for you that you were able to find a  loving support network from your friends and community in spite of your parents. congratulations on coming out!
So happy for you finally being able to be yourself. Sorry your parents were not supportive but always know there are lots of people out there that do support you and love you for who you are. You will always have love and support from me.
It's your parent's loss. I, for one, welcome you to this family. I'll happily be your silly be-mohawked au(nb)ty!
Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful image with us🙏🏾🖤. I too have been disowned by my parents for revealing my authentic queer / enby self and luckily now live with a loving, queer, Islamic couple of colour and have cultivated a safe space to be myself with others 🙌🏾 it’s such a shame that mostly black/indigenous diasporic families are a lot quicker to reject their children than white families due to the long standing colonial legacy. My DM’s are always open if you ever want to talk x
I am very glad that you have great friends. keep surrounding yourself with people who support you and that you support.  I would suggest disengaging from your parents as much as possible and go live your life. It is on them to approach you after this in my opinion and your choice to LIVE. 

You are striking!
I’m most definitely younger than you but I will GLADLY become your ma-pa
The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.

I feel ya on being laughed at by your family. But this community is so supportive and we will support your journey all the way!
Congrats on coming out! Found family is a cornerstone of the LGBT+ life - we're happy to have you with us
Screw your parents, they in no way deserve such a lovely person like you. I’m so proud of you for taking a leap of faith and showing who you truly are!
Always got love from the chosen fam 🖤💜⚪💛 
Also I love the fit!
You are absolutely adorable and your smile shines like a sun. Welcome into our community ❤️❤️
Congratulations! I'm sorry your parents failed you, but welcome to our family!
You are wonderful and brilliant shing star and I am so glad you have found yourself <3
Congratulations! You are wonderful and valid! Welcome to your Non-Binary family!
We stan supportive partners! Good luck babe we love and appreciate you 💕💕
Welcome to the family what's your name
All the love in the world to you for being so brave!
Lots of love please consider me a member of the community willing to support you!
I am so sorry about your parents, they are going to miss out because you are an amazing gorgeous human being, I am so glad you have the support of others who appreciate you for who you are because you are so strong and deserve the best!!
Sending you lots of support and love! I’m so sorry for the way small-minded have reacted, but I am SO happy to have your clearly radiant self be a part of our family, and I’m so proud of you.
I’m so sorry to hear about your shitty parents. You don’t need their validation anyways. You are loved more than you will ever know. Welcome to the fam and congratulations, love. 💜
I’m so proud of you, your smile is so bright and warms my heart. Welcome to the community!!! I’m so sorry about your parents. I’ll be your parent
You look so happy I love it
congratulations love 💛💛💛💛
Much love💜💜💜
It's a shame your parents weren't supportive. Dont worry though, we're all here for you along with many others :)
Since your parents can’t see how wonderful you are, I am your parent now 💕😤
we love you!!!
Well, you are still adorable! It doesn't matter what your parents think!
It doesn’t matter if you were raised in the states or consuming mainstream media you are bound by a lot of the indoctrination still

Heard that I wasn’t trying to tell you to do I was just saying the difficulties of being enby and out it’s beautiful but the world hates us but even more when our intersections of oppression are compounded so yes congrats bb you have found self love but the world won’t see just not yet much love to you and your journey. I will say no more 😷💛🖤

I'm gonna start crying, hun
Now that I know what it's like to be out of the closet, I'm never going back ✊🏿
Yes Dad 🥺💜
I wasn't? And even if I was, I had an extremely unconventional upbringing. As a black person, things are just different. Please don't bring this to my celebration. It's unnecessary and frankly, nonsensical to speak about with a stranger you know nothing of.
Obviously the country is stained by white supremacy... That's the point of the BLM movement... Obviously I'm stained and affected by it, otherwise I wouldn't be protesting, voting, donating, and petitioning. Don't come here as a non black person telling me what I experience as a black person in America and what I need to be doing. Stay in your lane, please.
I don't know what club you're a part of hun, but I don't think we're talking about the same one. No destruction here.
Aw me too
I'm not gonna lie, this comment wasn't even directed at me and I'm still about to cry 😂😭
For real though your parents don't know what they're missing. I know it hurts now but the pain won't always be so sharp. Take it and change it and give it back to the world as love and kindness. Your freedom is an inspiration to others, and your happiness and health are more important than fitting in.

I'm used to them not being there for me, this is nothing new. I moved out when I was 16, for reference
I'm not white????
It's really disappointing when the people who are supposed to look after you fail at it, but it seems like you have a good support network and a husband who loves you so I hope you'll be OK."	hl2utb	NonBinary	2259	1.0	2020-07-04 12:53:30
Passed my thesis defense! Thanks for all the support last week y'all		"Congratulations! Excellent outfit :)
Hahaha I love the slippers. I did my thesis defense on Zoom and 100% also wore slippers.
Congrats Dr. u/riley-archer ! 

How big was the snake? Did they make you catch your own since it was remote? 

(Ht u/cyancandlelight for reminding me of the snake.)
Yay!!!  Congratulations!! 🎊
That's awesome! What's your thesis, and in what field?
can’t decide if i want to be you or be with you
holy shit!!!!! good job!!!!!!!
[deleted]
Them slippers are sick af
so cute, congrats!
Congrats!!
I need this outfit XD
I spent a solid minute trying to figure out what was bugging me about this fit. It was the slippers 😂
Nice one, good job my biochem homie.
Congrats! 🥳
Congrats! (Also, I see those FFF slippers YES)
Good on you!! Also great outfit 😊. I hope to one day pull off hair that length, you look fab
Congrats!! 😁
oh my god congratulations and you look magnificent
Congrats!!! Also, you kinda look like Brandi Carlile!!
your outfit is killing it. CONGRATS!
Thank you! Haha the slippers really tied it all together
Hehe love that, yeah it's the move. Pros of zoom defenses. (Congrats btw!)
Haha thank you!

They mailed it ahead of time, actually. And thankfully it was a pretty small.

Edit: didn't have it in me to kill the snake, going to keep her as a pet
Thanks!! I'm so excited :)
Thank you! :) 

My main project was in drug delivery for cancer vaccines. My degree is in chemistry, specifically biological chemistry.
the timeless queer dilemma
Thank you!!! :)
Haha thank you 😝😝
Thanks 😝😝
Thank you!!
Thank you! :)
Are you kidding? The slippers were my statement piece, they tied the whole thing together 😝
Thank you! ☺️
Thank you!! Lol yess they were the move 💁🏼‍♂️
Aw thank you! :)
Thank you!! 😊
Haha thank you!! 💁🏼‍♂️
Thank you!! And tbh I had to look Brandi up but now I'm flattered
Thank you!!
I’ll never get rid of my grad school slippers, they’re the best.
Can I ask what your thesis was about?
Very stylish I rate this a sharp af /10
Yeah for sure! The degree was chemistry--bio, specifically--and my main project was using peptides (small fragments of proteins) in drug delivery for cancer vaccines.
That sounds amazing and so important.  Thank you for researching it.  I’m sure it will help a lot of people ☺️🙏🏻
Thank you, that's very kind. 😊 I don't know thay my work will directly help people, but hopefully it at least contributed something to an important field."	hux6sk	NonBinary	2148	1.0	2020-07-21 00:19:21
I support this		"Excellent suggestion. I put forward the motion that all enbies should aquire a shoulder crow familiar at once.

Transferring your consciousness and becoming one with the crow should also be encouraged.
If you don't have a crow, a snake around your arm is a nice alternative
I raise you head frog
*I am Blothunder, you can call me bloodhound*
Ok, but when are we to acknowledge their capability of subjective experience and self-consciousness instead of treating them like they are simple government espionage drones reclaimed as fashion accessories? #crowsarelivingbeings
If you wish for a more ominous look, acquire a raven instead and if the event is formal-er than you were planning, give your shoulder friend a little gold chain to match yours.
No! Don't! those are drones!
Lot's of witch energy. I like it.
Just make sure you don’t get a raven. I bought a bootleg shoulder crow from China because I was too cheap for a real one, and it wouldn’t stop reminding me of my ex, Lenore.
Can I get a parrot instead? Corvids are scary lol
Does anyone know where I could purchase a pre-trained accessory crow?
Also elf ears! ❤️
Typo alert: It never *goth* out of style.
i approve of this. nothing is more in fashion than an entire murder of crows following you around
Harper Finkle, that u?
Instructions unclear. Acquired a raven and became the allfather.
Now, how does one go about *training* said crow?
I miss my crow.
Crows not available in my country (too neotropical). How to proceed?
i welcome a crow should a crow want to visit
If you cannot find a crow, a parrot is fine too
I require this for my daily life
Put a bird on it.
Damn kinda reminds me of the drawing i Posted a couple days ago ( does this count as self Promotion? Hope not haha )
Me but with my rats lol
Ok I’ve got lots of nuts and friendly crows to work with.
you're so right
.........(-ω- )
What About Ravens Though, Are They Just As Good? Wikipedia Informs Me They're Friends Of The Dwarves While Crows Work For Orks, So I Gotta Prefer Them.
Can enbies on a budget use a pigeon?
upload your consciousness into the CrowBot3000™
dangit i want one now
how about head raven 😳
Came here to comment this

(Also hey I think I saw you on the apex sub before)
*Allfather give me sight!*
Came here to say this. We have to start realising that the sapient creatures that will destroy humanity aren't gonna be robots, but corvids!
Yep, r/crowbrows is good for that. It's nice to see all the diffrent little personalities folks get to meet
Birds don't exist!
Ugh, hate when that happens. One time I bought a one with different shading from eBay and I got a pigeon painted black! (It wasnt a crow but the pigeon is now my friend :>)
For real though I hope people don't get crows or ravens as pets. That's like a pet eagle. You're either a wildlife rehabilitator and know it's fine or it's unethical. Parrots are hard enough and can outlive you
Yes, but only one that gobble gobbles in an enthusiastic manner
I personally prefer frog but head raven is also valid
Lol you probably did
I, for one, welcome our new corvid overlords.
Por que no los dos?

One thing that i love about nonbinary ppl is that we have the most support for us POC 💖		"❤️❤️❤️ I love it here because I don’t get as sucked into “passing culture”. It’s really helped my mental health. I’m happy you get good vibes of your own
I'm binary trans and have most of the transition still ahead of me. I don't care about passing that much. I love this place because the people in it are so good at combining masc and fem elements in a way that looks great.
/r/nonbinaryover30 is an equally friendly and accepting place for those of us older enbies.
I love this community. I'm a binary trans woman who used to identify as NB and I still feel way more comfortable here.
yeah, im on a few trans subs and it's like enby folks literally don't exist there, and its sad how few POC I see (and even then, they don't get nearly as much support as PWOC ((people without color)) which is sad). this place is one of the best trans spaces on reddit imo 💜✨

edit: woah yall, PWOC was meant to be a joke and a play on words of POC, sorry if I got anyone upset. it wasn't meant to be insulting.
I am a white trans woman who does not and may never pass and I feel this in my bones. It's _sooo_ bad on r/traa. My spouse is non-binary. I have at least three good friends who are also non-binary, my best friend and several others who are transmasc, and I cannot help but notice fucking.. elitist? classist? some other word/phase that fits better? so many ""pro trans"" spaces are happy to exclude BIPOC folks, and anyone who isn't a white, conventionally attractive trans woman. It's disgusting.
I like traaa well enough but sometimes it feels like you have to be a passing white catgirl (or a bruh girl if you want to be subversive but you still have to be passing and white) or if transmasc you have to be a mischievous “femboy” 😐

I’m glad you feel accepted here
I’m very male leaning and barely identify as non binary anymore but I still think that this stands, passing culture absolutely killed me and continues to do so because it was so ingrained into me before I even figured out that I’m trans (I started watching transmasc YouTubers at around age 11) because passing was obsessed over so greatly and never served as this optional thing to make yourself feel better and rather as THIS MAKES YOU A TRENDER! THAT MAKES YOU A TRENDER! DONT DO THIS YOULL LOOK LIKE A FUCKING LESBIAN! To the point where I was so depressed in how I looked and the things I enjoyed not because I disliked them but because I thought they were the reason people denied myself. I’m so proud of all of you on here and I hope that your behaviour will be infectious to other communities as we need positivity for all trans people, not just those who cater to what cis people want from us appearance wise. Thank you for creating an environment where we can just exist
Glad we can be an accepting place for you all! I hope that more people will follow suit as any POC I've met are stronger than I'd ever hope to be. Especially those who are members of the LGBTQ+ community.
Way to forget ftm subs exist, tho 😭
So...Benefit of the doubt for a lot of peoples bias's. In my life I lived a primarily small town canadian life, moving every couple years due to my fathers job. I have known mostly Native americans as my only bipoc immersion growing up. With that in mind, when people want to be passing I would need to reference my life and experiences to give an opinion. Short of white or native American...its hard to say either way on my end. Usually i default to complimenting their choice, since i got nothing else i can constructively do.  


BUT heres the thing. Since socially coming out and enby and seeing people of all walks/ages/styles trying to pass masc/femm/andro I have personally expanded my views. Can I 100% give a perfectly accurate view? No. But I can now mentally index similarities and maybe suggest things to help.   


Thing is, I am one of the hesitant people who hasnt openly asked about my look/fit/aesthetic...because I am an overweight amab. Its super hard for me to see myself as anything other then a potato.  But I at least feel this community would be neutral/supportive if/when I finally do anything like that. So 100% agree with op on this. We as a community try
We're here, we're queer, we're supporting each other year by year. The only rule is don't be a jerk. 💜
I’m so glad to see that this sub feels more inclusive. I’ve spent a fair amount of time in more general trans spaces and it really does look like 99% white binary people, obsession with passing culture, and a shit ton of gatekeeping. Not that everyone there is bad or anything, obviously there’s nuance to everything and all that, but it’s not the most friendly environment generally. 

I’ve always loved this sub too because I just feel so much more welcome here as a Jew and a non-native English speaker, but as a white person I’ve often worried that my POC siblings might not feel the same, as most trans spaces have an issue with being predominantly white. I’m so glad to hear that you feel at home here too though- I hope we can continue making this a place where everyone is welcome. 

And if there’s anything I can do, or that we generally can do, to make this a better place for trans POC, I’d love to hear it. It’s beyond important to me that everyone has a place where they feel heard and comfortable as themselves, and I really hope this can be one of those places.

Edit: Damn, this was longer than I meant it to be. Sorry about that. I like the meme, it’s very accurate. All the best to you (OP) and everyone here. 💙
I'm a white (mostly) passing trans woman, and even I am sick of most trans spaces on Reddit. For a while I followed them all and actively participated in them, but it was terrible for my mental health. Now it's basically just this sub, tgcj, and transtimelines, and it's been wonderful for my mental health. r/transpassing is a hellhole.

I love the queer community because of how diverse it is, but seeing other queer subs become homogeneous selfie subs for white trans women makes me really sad. I love seeing queer POC on here, but it still is predominantly white unfortunately :/
r/ftm and r/ftmfemininity are poc friendly subs, too.
Absolutely why i joined this sub.
It's funny because it's true
I enjoy seeing all the different people. The different skin colors, shape, weights, body goals, aesthetics.
Tbh it's so weird how the trans community can be so heckin toxic. I love you guys and I am glad y'all fight with me and others against gender norms ^^
Blaire White
What I've noticed is the severe lack of support for AFABs though
As I've said before, you're only as valid as you allow yourself to be. We'll give you all the support you want/need, but if you don't accept yourself, you'll never be valid in your own eyes. We love everyone here 💜
Do you mind if I ask how other subreddits end up not supporting POC? It's something I think I'm ignorant to?

I know I usually don't see posts from POC in a lot of trans subreddits (I don't see many here either, tbh). I usually sort by ""hot"" though on reddit by default, so I figure what posts by POC there are don't get upvoted as much. I upvote POC posts whenever I see them as much as possible, since I know algorithms tend to bury POC.

However, is there something else that goes on that I don't know about? Something else systemic I don't see?

I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more... not white trans girl memes on /r/traa. I'm very tired of the trans girl coder wearing a skirt and stockings stereotype, lol.
Lol the casual FTM erasure in this post is pretty funny, ngl
Ummmm. Sure….
same!! i see so many people dressed and presented however the hell they want, regardless of gender expectations and it's so inspiring
Same. The idea of 'passing' is a valid safe space for those that need it, I just don't like it being a requirement.
Honestly same, not being able to pass or even knowing that it was an option not to made me feel terrible and set me back. I created so many dumb rules for myself so finding a space here has really helped me find myself better
Real shit!!! Only other sub i frequent that isn't like that is mtfbutch and ~~tomboy~~ MTFTomboy
honestly same here, I’m so much more comfortable being able to be fem without not feeling “trans enough” since IRL for me passing is a pretty big thing safety-wise, especially rn so it’s nice to be able to be myself without getting shit for it
Sammme I identify as mostly male now but this sub has good vibes and people with amazing styles so I don't plan to leave
I’m slightly sad this exists because I love the older enbies here and would feel weird joining since I’m not over 30 yet. Please post here too! I want to see alllllll the enbies, including the ones who are older. It helps me ignore the “it’s just a phase” shit I get.
Holy crap thanks for posting this! Didn't know it existed, and my thirty-something ass sometimes feels weird hanging in a space with lots of teenagers.
omg my people! Thank you for this link.
oh nice, I never knew that sub existed!
Omg I didn’t know that sub existed! Thank you!
Thanks for posting!!
love hearing this. x Shame you don't feel comfortable in your own spaces though!
I'm out here trying on the trans subs
I see some push for less binary presentations, but yeah...the photos are rather monotone
what does ""a person without color"" mean?
> PWOC

I don't want this term used for me.  I have color.  It's pale pink to very light brown in various places.  You can call me white if you want, but I do not want to be called a PWOC.

Edit to respond to downvotes:  I guess I don't have the right to express an opinion about what people call me.  Very ironic for this sub.
I think the word assimilationist might be a good way to describe it. There's a lot of queer spaces I've been in where it feels like folks are desperately trying to fit into white supremacist cis-hetero-patriarchal norms. It's great that some folks feel safe and affirmed in those types of spaces, but that's not queer liberation. It forces queerness into these frameworks of things that are able to be easily accepted into the current systems instead of  challenging the broken systems we live in
r/traa doesnt allow selfies. who would you tell someones skincolor?
Honestly r/traaa feels more like you just can't be transmasc at all sometimes, let alone a femboy.
Also, I find r/nonbinarytalk to be pretty good as well.
Those aren't good subs for poc tho. What are you talking about?
Does feel like some casual ftm erasure and the fact that it usually isn’t intentional is almost poetic at this point lol
r/transgendercirclejerk strikes again 😭
To clarify, I wanted this meme to make a point about general trans communities with ftms and mtfs. Obviously ftm subs wouldn't exclusively support trans women. They're not for trans women; they're for trans mascs.
Potatoes are amazing! To torture a metaphor, they go great with a lil extra salt, or spice, or you can even get them *saucyyy* 

Point is, even if you feel like a potato you can still play with how you jazz up. You sound thoughtful and friendly and we're here for that :)
I also think there is often too much pressure from people in a lot of these places for people to do HRT. It's not such a simple brain-dead no-duh decision for everyone and folks act like it is.
Sometimes you’ll see memes in traaa along the lines of “self hating alt right 4Channer to catgirl pipeline” or references to such. It’s not really fun as a POC to have to see white transfems go “lol I had a phase where I was so self hating and in denial that I projected all that hatred onto trans people and other minorities isn’t that so funny anyway now I wear thigh highs and skirt go spinny wheeee” (obviously hyperbole) but it’s simply inappropriate and unnecessary in shared spaces and is super uninviting to non whites and white people who never went through that awful “phase”. It’s not super rampant but I don’t think it really has a place in spaces like traaa where the memes and jokes are supposed to be funny or relatable (though honestly a lot of the memes in that sub lately have been highly personal and specific vent “memes” that are kind of uncomfortable lol)
yea what the hell
I highlighted white trans *women* as the main people that get supported in general trans boards bc also white trans men get erased a lot. I'm not sure what your point is
yeah it's honestly mega varied, as it should be! God, I love being nonbinary.
Yeah exactly. I have some really close people in my life who pass and for them it's both validating, alleviating for dysphoria and safer for their daily lives. For me, I don't like the expectation and I like challenging cis centric beauty standards, but ultimately we should just be able to do what we like without external pressures
It stopped me from coming out from age 21 (did stay out and got a gender dysphoria diagnosis age 23 then went back into the closet without starting hrt) til age 37.5
I'm gonna have to check those out. thanks lovely! 💖
Same here lol, im only 18 so I’d feel awkward joining a sub intended for an older audience but I love seeing EVERYONE in the enby & trans space, especially older enbies, helps me deal with the “it’s just a phase, you’ll get over it” shit as well
You're welcome! I know the feeling. I didn't even know what ""nonbinary"" was until 2 years ago, and I'd been married for 10 years by that point. I feel like the older enby crowd can relate a little more to these types of issues.
I don't feel UNwelcome. I just feel like there a fewer expectations in NB spaces. Plus like 1/2 my friends are NB so it feels like home lol
my issue with the majority of trans subs is that it feels like 80% of users are 16 or younger
basically a white person lol
ok damn sorry about that
Assimilationist is _absolutely_ the right word, thank you! 💜
Its classic white feminism tbh. Throw as many people under the bus to appease the patriarchy white supremacy cause at least maybe you'll be on the second rung of the hierarchy. I can't fucking stand it, nothing makes me more angry then white feminism. People need to learn intersectionality.
It’s blatantly obvious when someone’s speaking on their lives experience and there’s no racialization informing it

The meme mentions all other trans subreddits only supporting white trans *women* that pass. So it's like the ftm subreddits don't exist.
[deleting bc formatting made my comment look totally unhinged and Cute-Inspection said it better, lol]
Ahhh, okay! That wasn't super clear from the meme, thanks for replying and clarifying  🧡

IME most ftms stay away from/are pushed out of mixed groups because of that same dynamic, so yeah, with the clarification I'm totally feeling it and agree. I'm glad this sub is different.
Thanks. As a person I just try to be upfront and honest, while doing what I can to let everyone be happy. 

And I am kinda jazzing up. I am slowly working on a solarpunk outfit, cause the happy energy vibe is nice
The whole stigma around HRT in mainstream, especially binary trans subs, is awful. People act like it's some silver bullet that magically makes you pass as your preferred gender within a year or two. I hate that people measure how long they've been transitioning by how long they've been taking hormones. Transitioning is so much more than taking a pill or two daily and expecting the rest to just follow - it takes time and effort, and a lot of experimentation with who you are and want to be, to have a successful transition.
They're not the main people that get supported in transmasc and FTM subs 🤷🏻‍♂️ no shade, the way you worded it was just funny because it implied there aren't any.
My correction, mtftomboy*
💞
Yessss, thanks a lot for sharing!!
What’s the issue with that? People of any age can realize they’re trans
You can just say white! 😊
So, do poc get filtered out somehow based on discussions?
Ah. Yeah. I have just gotten so used to being ignored in trans spaces that I didn't notice.
Sorry for the lack of clarity in that case! I'm not in any exclusive mtf subreddits bc the general trans ones are bad enough for being dainty-white-girl centric and pushing standards that a) don't apply to all of us or b)  are impossible for us to attain. I'd imagine exclusive mtf subreddits would just make me feel shit about my femininity. 

This is no shade to white trans women, whom I love and should express themselves however they like, but v much shade thrown towards unattainable white beauty standards.
I agree yeah. I think it's also worth noting that medical transition for nonbinary ppl is so confusing because there's many things we don't want that sadly can't be avoided with current technology. Besides the fact that transition is far more spiritual than it is medical, it's not so simple for us enbies to want one thing or the other.
of course, but it brings the level of discussion down to the level of the age group. the daily rave about wearing a skirt to school for the first time for example makes me feel old as shit and i'm not even 25.

just wish there were more adult oriented lgbtq+ subs. only one i can think of is /r/bisexualadults
The kids are alright; I love them

And it makes me so happy that every time adult trans people make a post—especially our honored elder trans people—so many young people see it and can feel that connection to a broader community across generational lines, through history 💚
Of course they can! But adults are having a very different trans experience than kids are, and it's nice for us to have a separate space to discuss that sometimes, where it doesn't feel like we're putting adult experiences into a teenage space.
true, but i saw someone else call white people that and i thought it was funny lol
No, I don't think so. I think OP exaggerated a bit when they said ""all subs"".
I'm sorry to hear that. I do have hugs if you want:

Yeah, I can definitely agree with that. I guess I don’t see as much of the younger trans folks on those subreddits, so I don’t think about it.
R/translater (I think that's it!) Is good. There's some that I can't remember the names of exactly but they were like, ""trans over/after 30,"" sorry I can't be more specific
Hey, I was young too once! I don’t think something like someone’s personal identity can be gatekept, and when you’re younger is precisely the time to be experimenting and discovering things about yourself, and talking to older folks of those communities to better understand. Wish I had done it more when I was younger.
True!

David Tennant on This Morning	Just incase anyone didn't see it David Tennant wore a nonbinary pin on this morning yesterday! He supportiveeeeee. I almost happy cried, I gathered he'd have nothing against it but it feels great to be supported by an actor I grew up watching :)	"[removed]
When he has normal hair he doesn't even look like an actor. He looks like a kindygarten teacher who calls raisins ""nature's candy"" and forgets the lyrics to the wheels on the bus. Basically Flanders.
Love that he walked off and immediately started eating the pudding they had.
If you haven’t seen it, Staged is a great comedy show, it stars DT and Michael Sheen, and their families, and was filmed over lockdown.
Considering how many British media personalities have revealed themselves to be terfs lately, it's a huge relief to me that I was right about David Tennant because that one would have crushed me.
I love him. He's always such a warm and wholesome presence!
God I knew there was a reason I was obsessed with him as a teen.
I didn't even question why this was on this sub. I just assumed everybody liked David Tennant.
God I absolutely love David Tennant
I got a photo with him at a comic con once on my birthday and he wished me happy birthday and it was the greatest moment of my life
I always knew he was the best doctor
Yay! My favourite Doctor loves us!!
I saw this on tumblr the other day and *my heart*.

I wasn’t even particularly familiar with him until a few months ago when I decided to watch the tv adaptation of Good Omens (yes, I do live under a rock), and it took 0.0001 seconds for me to respect the guy. He seems lovely, in as much as I can say that about someone I’ve never met.
Unrelated but he looks so cozy
Awwww 😭
chad shit
And I thought I didn't love him enough 😭
oh no i love him
I love this man
My favorite doctor 🥺❤️
love this fella
this makes me so happy, hes the best doctor
Kinda sad I missed this... stopped watching This Morning because Philip Schofield has become intolerably annoying 

Also I'm not usually awake when it's on, but when I have been, it's because of him 

To the subject at hand: that's pretty cool!
DAVID TENNANT IS NONBINARY??
Brilliant, Molto Bene!
David is one of my favourite actors.. And this solidifies my love for the man!
I heard his kid is.
Well, he *was* a Time Lord…
lol i had the same thought, ""is *he* non-binary?"" and then laughed at myself
r/oddlyspecific
Him playing the nanny in Good Omens basically
>nature's candy

those are blueberries, not raisins lol
Well they're actors

They're supposed to look like anything
Yessss 😂
pudding is good!
I keep seeing clips on tiktok but I really need to watch the whole thing
I feel you! God that would have been too much. This whole comment section is warming my heart too
You stopped at teens? 

*oh wait I’m still technically a teen for another year. Ah.*
I thought I was on either Doctor Who, Good Omens, or David Tennant sub before I saw the comment. Ugh I love him so much.
I got a photo with him too and he was so nice. I’m hoping to meet him again next year and get another photo and an auto. He’s a truly amazing person.
No I think he's just doing it to show support
Not as far as I know, but he does play an agender character in Good Omens! He's not human, tbf, and presents masculine with he/him pronouns most (but not all) of the time. But Neil Gaiman is great about inclusivity so I highly recommend his works.
pardon my slow reply but ICYMI, Tennant has a nonbinary kid! 🥺💕
[removed]
which one of the dozen? lol (kiddin)
>!He *is* a time lord according to google insisting on giving me spoilers.!<
Once a timelord, always a timelord
nonbinary people can use he/him pronouns though?

I love the

NOT ANYMORE BABY
argument between david and micheal
Same! And when I saw that it wasn't I was like ""valid"" and upvoted anyway lol.
he did have that beautiful hair during quarantine? with the headband? i don't think he cares too much to flag masculine.
Neil Gaiman and David Tennat are some of the most wholesome famous British people (honourable mention to Sir Attenborough too)
Yeah it's really heartwarming.
I heard it was Wilfred but can't find any info on it, idk
it's all that wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff. 

He is a great human (Time Lord)!
This comment in itself is spoilers
Spoiler veil please, for those who still don't know!
sure, and i realized i was making an assumption
I literally will accept any pronouns (except neo)
Hold up, there's a THIRD season?!
I can't find the post but on georgia's ig she once wrote ""(...) so happy you came out to me (...)"" under Wilfred's birthday cake but as far as i know its the only ""proof"" we've got so its not really confirmed
Indeed it is and yes he’s pretty great
How do I do that? I would have done to begin with if I knew how but also it’s plastered across every social media too including Reddit ads unfortunately.
What’s wrong with neopronouns?
Yes, just released recently
Put > ! and ! < on both sides of text you want to hide (without spaces)
Nothings wrong with them, I'm just not personally comfortable with them being used for me
Nothing is wrong with them. Nikki just doesn’t use ‘em
Thank you!

Came out as NB to my husband last night! He was amazing and supportive! Yay!!!!		"Ooooooo look at all that yarn! Are you a fellow knitter?
Congrats!!! I know how scary that can be, so proud of your courage!
you have the flawless skin of someone who drinks water and minds their business. 

love to see it.
This is something I need to do with my partner. That had to be scary!
That's so good and sweet! You have such an amazing husband, and he's got an amazing spouse in you :)
Congrats!🖤🖤🖤
Congrats! Currently waiting on the right timing to come out to my wife as well. Super nervous!
Congrats! Also, you must be my twin. I have a similar haircut, hair color, glasses, and yarn collection (crocheter)! Also, I love your shirt!
[deleted]
Yay!! So happy for you!
Happy for you!
congrats<3
Congrats, I came out recently to the guy I'm seeing and he's also supportive (only person who knows irl).
Ayyeee good job dude!!
Yay! This makes me so happy to hear.
I did the same! So happy for you!!
Woo hoo! 🎉🌈♥️
That makes my heart so happy!
I did it, and everything went better than what I hoped for <3
Yay! Congratulations!

But, importsnt question: where did you get that shirt???
Congratulations! So glad you have a supportive partner, makes all the difference (it did for me!). Also, gentle reminder: NonBinary= Enby, Non-Black=NB , NB is usually used in tandem with POC, to describe Non-Black People of Color
A few days late here but I just came out to my husband last night, too!! He was also super supportive. Such a good feeling to have accepting and supportive partners 🥰
That’s awesome!!! Never too late to be excited, glad you have a supportive partner tooooo
Yeppers!!! I’ve been on a yarn diet this year so spending most of quarantine using up my stash!! I’m thinking I might make NB Pride socks once I’m done with my never-ending Comfort Fade!
Thanks!! Took me a while to accept it myself, but once I did I’m sooo much happier for it!
Haha it’s true I drink a shit-ton of water!! Appreciate it 😊
Yeah... timing is everything. I had to wait till we were in bed, already having a discussion about LGBTQ+ things, and casually slipped it in like “yeah, understanding sexuality is crazy, but what about Gender Identity?! Like.... me, and how I’m feeling...”
It’s true- when I came out as Bisexual he was super supportive, I don’t know why he would be any different with this but I definitely won the husband lottery 🥰
You can do it! I'm the wife of an enby who told me about a year and a half ago I think? Being supportive to them has allowed them to come out to their friends and family as well. I love my enby. 🤗
You got this!! I sat on it for two weeks before the right time presented itself!!
Aaah I love a good doppelgänger!! Yarn nerds unite!
Haha I love me some low-poly sharks! Honestly it was the fact that now I don’t dress up like this for work anymore, I really lost my sense of identity... which led me to realize I needed my Andro/Masculine fashion to be really happy!
Thanks so much!!
Thanks so much!! 🥰
Thank you!!
Thanks!! I love how accepting he is!
Aaaah great job!! You as well, it’s sooo releasing!
I think Marshalls? A while ago; but it’s def a men’s shirt!
Oh I’ve been burning through my stash during quarantine. I’ve made two blankets for my full bed
Woah! And i thought my stash was huge 😂 I’ve mostly been making reusable grocery bags!
I feeeeeel that! It's so great to finally like.. make sense of everything you've felt over the years too, you know? Wishing you and your husband many more years of happiness 🥰
Are you me? Lol
Same tho. It’s such a good feel!
It’s really more impressive looking hung up like that, it used to live in bins, but I like seeing everything I have!
Thanks so much!!"	hyapsz	NonBinary	1755	1.0	2020-07-26 17:19:44
in desperate need of support right now… some transphobia from my little brother this morning		"Wow, incredible, it's almost as though father's day is about *acknowledging* *how well they shoulder their parental duties towards their children*. It's almost like any parents' day is inherently about the parent/child bond, of which, surprise surprise, the child is a part.
It sounds to me like your brother has some serious personal issues to work out on their own. If they can't handle it, that's their own issue. It sounds like your brother still has much to learn from your dad.
regardless of what your brother says, you are who you are. you are what you wanna be. im sorry that happened to you, its shitty. you dont deserve that..
So just giving someone a quick thank you for respecting your existence means making the day ""all about you""... Stay strong friend, I hope your brother will understand you someday.
Your little brother is 100% wrong.

Fathers day is literally about the relationship between you and your father.

If he didn't have children, he wouldn't be a father, so yes, you are kind of important to his identity as a father.

Anyways, he's fully out of line and you shouldn't back down on any of this, you're the older brother, your father agrees with you, assert that.
How dare you thank your dad for being such an awesome dad on Father’s Day! /s
How is thanking a supportive dad making Father's Day all about yourself...? You're a good kid, I love you.
Uhh, when giving people compliments on their special day (bday, Mother’s Day, etc), you can choose an empty, generic greeting, or you can make one that is specific about something you appreciate about that person specifically to let them know you put thought into showing them love today. 

You did the correct option. This lad is a fool. Saying “thanks for supporting me dad, happy Father’s Day” is not making it about you. It’s giving a specific compliment.
Remember that chosen family is a beautiful thing.
Why is it that queerphobes insist on painting us as selfish for even **MENTIONING** anything about our identities?? My dad did the same thing and I'm starting to wonder more about that. I'm sorry you're having to go through this. Like others have stated, thanking your father for **respecting** you is not at all selfish. Your brother is talking out of his ass.
Wow how dare you thank your dad for respecting you on Father's day. Clearly youre a selfish individual for mentioning yourself even once on such a holy day devoted to him. It's not like the holiday is a celebration of him being a good father or anything. Your brother is a jerk and is clearly reaching. I'm so sorry. Hope the rest of your fanily treats you better

Checked out your profile and i just have to say, you look badass. Love the hair
Sorry your sibling sucks
I’m really sorry 🙁 we all support you here ❤️ stay strong. (Sending virtual love)
What a shitty thing to say. I'm sorry, man. That sucks. I hope your brother stops sucking. ❤️
I'm sorry your brother is being a jerk. FWIW, I think 99% of what people thank their parents for on Mother's/Father's Day is how they have parented them. For example, ""Thanks for teaching me to ride a bike and fix a car, and for always being there for me! I'm so glad you're my dad!"" is not about the dad's identity as a human separate from parenting, and it also isn't making Father's Day all about the kid. Thanking him for something as substantial as being a supportive and loving person in a sometimes transphobic world is also not making it all about yourself. I think this is just another example where some people think existing while trans is inherently more selfish/sexual/offensive than existing while cis. If your brother is sometimes a reasonable person, you could ask if he would feel the same way if someone had said ""thanks for supporting my interests"" or ""thanks for always making me feel safe and loved"" or some other non-gender related thing. If your brother isn't reasonable, remember that you don't have to have this conversation with him, you're allowed to just.... not answer.
You are beautiful.
You *are* valid.
You are loved.
im sorry but your brother is an asshole
1. your brother is stupid and needs to do some research before talking shit, because Father's Day is a day you thank them for taking care of ***you*** and others (Like siblings). So, yeah you can make a text about your dad being accepting
2. Hope things go better for you just remember that you'll get through this.
thank you everyone for the love and support❤️💖i can’t express enough how much i appreciate it.
I’m glad your father is supportive ❤️ i’m so sorry about your brother though. it sounds like he’s not remotely open to changing and that is not a reflection of you. if he is not going to put genuine effort into your relationship it’s unfair to ask you to. however you choose to proceed with y’all’s relationship is your call. I don’t talk to my brother anymore, not because of transphobia or homophobia but it’s still hard. i’m sorry ❤️
My little brother is also a transphobe.  We had a huge fight on Mothers Day. Seriously family holidays seem to be a big trigger. 
Anyway I told him flat out I didn’t want a relationship with him.  Haven’t talked to him since and it feels great.  Life’s too short to waste time on idiocy
Damn that’s fucked up, he should just let it go, he’ll my dad ignores it completely but my grandad is at least asking what it is
“Well it’s a good thing all that matters is what dad thinks about it. If me explaining to him why I think he’s a good father makes you so angry, that’s your personal issue to work through.”
Idk how old your brother is, but he could learn to be a little more open minded and like educate himself on trans/nb people:/  you found it important and thanked your dad bc it was important to you that your dad acknowledged you, and for that your dad was in the spotlight. 

Many hugs for you OP, you also don't need to treat your brother like family if he's not going to respect you. Make your own family w ur friends 💙
You are valid. You matter. You are who you are and that person is beautiful 🖤.
Ah yes disrespecting Father’s Day by thanking your father for being a good father- anyway I hope your little brother stops being a transphob or at least gain some basic human decency to not deadname you.
did he expect you to say nothing about what your dad does for you?? thats like kind of a big part of fathers day??
> “you made your fathers day text about you”

Yes. Thats what those are for— thanking your father for what he has done for *you*. But little brother seems to be the one who is actually selfish, since he made this fathers day all about himself and his shitty opinions. Also, gaslighting divergent people into thinking they are selfish is a common abuse tactic. You do not have to fall for it.
Ooh, he's being a little prick.
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if he just feels kinda jealous because he's thinking of acceptance of your gender as special love he isn't getting. I'm not saying you should forgive him, that's your decision & I don't even know you, but if for even a second you think this is really about you at all it's not.

He's just growing up & it doesn't excuse it, he still needs to understand it's not right, but it definitely isn't anything about you or any effect you're actually directly having. If it wasn't your gender it would've been any other kind of care he doesn't need in equal amounts.
You brother sounds like an ass
Ahhhh…I see he’s an immature and jealous little shit. I’m sorry OP. (Hugs)
What is your brother’s problem? 
Trying to cause a fuss over nothing 


Father’s Day is not just about the father, but the BOND between a father and their child, so how is thanking your father for trying making it all about yourself??? 

There was no big issue to begin with and both sides are chill and suddenly a third wheel comes outta nowhere to wreck everything.
Aww, it's always so disheartening to see how common this is. We'll get through it friend, I hear you and see you for you :) <3
You’re valid and loved :) your brother obviously needs to get his head out of his ass and stop reaching for any reason to shit on you. Thanking your father for being a good dad and accepting you, especially when that’s not an opportunity all trans kids get is totally normal. It isn’t making the day about you. 
You choose who you are, no one not even blood can dictate your identity. Stay strong friend! you’ve got this, and remember to appreciate those who support you and don’t get hung up on those who don’t.
I'm sorry, that's really shitty. How's your name?
Father's Day is literally a day to thank fathers for being good parents. Part of being a good parent is treating trans kids respectfully.

Your little brother is making Father's Day about him by using it as a tool to drive a wedge and justify his disgusting, selfish, and bigoted behavior. Absolute projection.
What a backward child, just ignore him, he doesn’t understand. You’re wonderful just the way you are, and Father’s Day messages between you and your dad don’t even concern your brother
I hope this is just immaturity from him and that he grows out of it soon 💞 if he’s a cis dude, then this is maybe him being willfully ignorant of trans stuff, which if that’s the case I also hope he grows out of that, too. It sucks either way, and I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. Remember to be kind to yourself and do something nice for yourself today ♥️
I hope he educates himself and understands how inconsiderate he's being, in the meantime you should assert your boundaries and expect that they are respected, and don't feel bad because you were not selfish at all 💓
How else are you supposed to wish someone a happy Father’s Day? 

“Thanks for being my dad!” 

Oh wait, *my* dad. It’s all about how he’s *your* dad now you made it all about yourself how dare
“Thank you for being a great father, this is part of why you are a great father”

“Wow. Making it all about you!”

You can’t have a father without the kid. That’s insane on your brother’s part.
Wow that's rude! I thanked my dad for being an amazing ally to me on Father's day. Duh my Father's day text is about me I'm what makes him a father! Your brother seems more selfish than you in these! Sorry not all your family supports you, hope he comes around.
I mean you expressed something that your father did that you appreciated as your parent. I think that's fairly appropriate. I don't really think you can get more specific then ""great dad"" without talking about things that your dad has done *for* you.
""Thank you for being a good dad to me""

""yOu MaDe fAtHeR's DaY aLl AbOuT YoU"" you brother is an asshole
father's day is about thanking dads...for being dads...you literally did that. happy some family members are making the effort. sorry about your brother dude :/
The correct text back is a ""You just proved you're an asshole.""
You didn’t make your Father’s Day text about you. You told your father why he’s a good father and you appreciate him. 

Fuck your little brother.
Your brother is being an ass
Aw honey :( 

I’m really sorry that happened to you. Your brother is hating on you for doing something really sweet and heartfelt. Don’t listen to him. Thank your dad and celebrate Father’s Day however you please. 

We’re all here for you :)
Can someone explain to me how, on God’s green earth, telling your dad about something he does that you appreciate is at all “making father’s dad about you”? It doesn’t make sense. Also, he doesn’t get to talk about rudeness when he can’t even call his own sibling by their name. Just saying
Isint father's day about remembering what you father did for you? Isint that what being a father is being there for the kids?  Wtf is your brother on?
Well he’s definitely not the favourite, then.
Fathers' Day is about how awesome your father figure is and why. That's one of the reasons it's a hard day for folks with shit fathers. Or whose fathers have died. 

I'm not a parent but, when someone thanks me for doing a good job, it means so much more if they have a specific example. Like, at work, thanks for doing such a good job on the newsletter is nice. That, plus something like the layout was really well done, makes it better and feel more genuine. 

In a way, Fathers' Day is about the kid(s). How else would they be a dad? It's kind of like a performance review. 😂 

Letting your dad know that he's appreciated and that you recognize all he does makes you a good son, not a selfish son.
He has a lot of growing up to do
I'm really really sorry, I want to give you all the hugs (>;-;)>

I know it's hard to always remember, but there are those out there who love you and appreciate you and cherish you for who you are, and there are also those who look up to you and admire you for choosing to be who you really are. We are always here for you whenever you need us to be ❤️
I feel like your brother might be having that feeling a lot of younger siblings have that they're 'lesser than' the older sibling, which can produce a lot of jealousy. Think that your parents only care about you and not them, which could be quite a contributing factor to their attitude here. It's also one of those transphobic cliches that is seen a lot in media and online, that we are all self obsessed etc etc, so that could also be part of where this is coming from. 

Thanking your parents for what they've done for you isn't selfish in the least, as many people above have mentioned. I hope your brother can understand that his actions are very harmful not just to you, but to many other people himself included. I'm sure your dad appreciated such a heartfelt and intimate thank you message :)
This is not transphobia you are just so self centered and have a feeling of entitlement. Live how you want but get over yourself
That's gross. I'm sorry your brother is such a fuckwad
Sending love and support
One day he'll understand, but it's going to suck till then...
absolutely incorrect. the whole point of fathers day is to thank fathers for what they have done for you. thats exactly whats supposed to happen. utterly foolish. your brother is being incredibly mean and i hope that he comes around. no matter what your identity is valid!
You see there's a difference between ""think"" and ""am"".
What? On the day which commemorates the *relationship* between you, you had the nerve to express gratitude for the very thing the day commemorates? How dare you!

But for real, isn't the very concept of ""father"" dependent upon the male figure being in relation to the person they've fathered/parented? I mean, fathers day can't NOT include the child(ren), can it? Without the child(ren), the idea of father is null, so to NOT mention you and your relationship to your father would negate the whole point of the holiday.

I'm sorry your brother isn't getting it, and I'm happy that your father is (or at least is trying to). You're doing great, and the relationship with your father is what matters--don't let your brother make it about him and his feelings about his displaced privilege and identity ;-)
This has little sibling energy all over it. Resist the urge to be a bitch back, and show them how to be graceful!
not to sound like an ass but your brother needs to be decked in the face
Tell your little brother than an enby dad says this.

""You're gonna grow up one day and regret the things you said. Because your sibling loves and loved you so much but you couldn't put your pride to the side to love them back. You ignored their attempts to give you love because of your pride. Suck it up and love your sibling or one day when you're sad and alone. You'll have nobody to blame but yourself""

A real kick in the pants never hurt anybody.
OP I'm so sorry you have to deal with that BS. You are totally appropriate to talk about the things that make your dad a good one on fathers day - that's kind of the point (and thank goodness your dad seems to be a good one!). 

Your brother needs a kick in the shins and an education, but I doubt it'll help for a while, if ever. Try to protect your energy around him until he reaches the basic level of human decency that is respecting who individuals (especially you!) are. You don't owe him engagement, or really anything at all until he behaves decently. Don't even feel like you need to respond unless you personally find it helpful. Regardless of him, you are perfect the way you are. You are loved, you are gorgeous, and you are competent.
You’re valid and your father is amazing, and for thanking him for being a great father on Father’s Day is what it’s all about. I hope your little brother comes around. Just keep radiating positivity and kindness, but also as it’s been recommended…set boundaries. If he’s going to be unkind to you then you need those boundaries in place so you can remain kind to yourself. Sending lovessss💖
My younger brother and I don’t have a relationship either. Years ago through to today, he rants and raves about how everything I do is “for attention” and how I “ruined the family”. Mind you, I live 3000+ miles away and see my family about 1-2 a year (IF that) and pretty much kept my transition and career moves to myself. I am completely independent from my family - financially, emotionally, etc. We are just *now* reopening lines of communication and connection.

Anyways, for years my brother and I would have these nasty arguments, just awful, that lingered for weeks and then we’d apologize (because I’d give in or seek a compromise 🙄) and it would start all over again. I had to learn to set boundaries and I cut him out from my life to the point where whatever he said, I just couldn’t get riled up about or invested. I started ignoring texts and calls that were triggering or meant to start an argument. I screenshot everything just to have as proof (he will vehemently deny, lie and twist stories) but otherwise, I’ve detached.

I strongly believe he has a personality disorder, but that’s not my job to convince my parents (who deny it even when he abuses them) nor him to get help. It’s also not my job to save anybody who has abused me or hurt me.

It’s okay to detach, even from family. And I know how much it hurts. I feel like once I was able to process what it meant to detach, it felt like grieving a dead family that was still alive, they just don’t want anything to do with you. It hurts. But coming out of that has given me peace and integrity and the strength to live my life on my terms.

Best of luck and I’m sorry you’re going through this.
You think you are a dude. becsuse you are a dude .
A good dude
Would love to come round there and stove his head in the muggy little incel
Aw that's super tough, dude. Sounds like he's having a hard time understanding you. Hopefully as he gets older he will get more educated. I had the same problem with my sister. She eventually came around!

I'm really glad your dad is being supportive. Father's Day is the perfect time to let him know you appreciate his support.
I don't know anything about your family, but it sounds like you have a supportive Dad... maybe your dad could talk to your little brother about it? Or you guys talk together?
Sounds like you have a great dad! If only there was a day that was set aside so that you could express your appreciation for that.
it's a journey of acceptance your brother has to go on, on his own

there's nothing you can do for it but provide time and space

im so sorry it hurts
Ok. So that fathers day thing about you...sounds like a callout. But you literally have the highground. You were thanking father for going out of his way, and possibly comfort zone, for you... as his own choice on his day, if this message implies the situation right (boomer mindset in the family)  


Yeesh, the fact that thanking someone for their effort is now a faux pas in anyones mind.
You are valid 💛
Oh wow. It’s so wrong to thank your father for being supportive and being a great father to you. You’re obviously making it about you while thinking him for being so great.🙄
Giving reasons you love your father and appreciate the type of father he is to you is meaningful and I'm sure it was appreciated. I'm not sure how you're supposed to celebrate father's day any other way. Father's day is not a 2nd opportunity to celebrate his birthday, what you said couldn't be any more appropriate any other day of the year.
Your little brother sucks but you seem great.
Tell him he's a cringe Bencil sharpenerino lookin' ass
oof, I'm sorry friend :/
And your little brother is making a conversation that is nothing to do with him about his feelings on it?
I wish I had a dad like yours, don’t listen to your brother who clearly doesn’t understand the basic jist of Father’s Day.
Murder him. Period.
That is so highly toxic. That’s Fucking awesome that your dad is trying. Sounds like your younger brother has some growing up to do. You gotta just cut ppl out who pull that kind of shit. Because most likely they aren’t worth the effort. Keep following your strut. And be happy. He can live in the shadow of being someone who isn’t happy with themselves.
yes, about your appreciation for him
Time to go no contact!
No offense but I want to slap your brother clear across the face for this shit.

I'm so sorry about this...
Isn’t that the whole point of Father’s Day? Lmao
Father’s Day

Is about appreciating what the father does for you…

What is he even talking about???
I am so sorry that you have had to go through this. I hope you know that you are valid and loved
Slap him to the moon and tell him to stfu and respect your rights. Or call him a girl, and your sister and he'll see how weird it is to misgender people
If you’re close enough I’ll drop kick her for you (yes that was intentional)
Your brother sucks big time. I never would've thought that siblings would be more transphobic and straight up shitty than parents...
""Hey dad thanks for being chill with me being myself.""

""Wow way to make it about yourself.""

Ah yes, logick.
Father's day, one of the days to celebrate how we appreciate how our parents love us, and you've done that by pointing out you appreciate how your father accepts this vulnerable aspect of who you are. Not out of place. 

Like if that's all you did it sounds like its just your brother, maybe that hes one of those people that sees any lgbt+ mention as 'in your face' because it goes against his idea of the norm. Anything one thinks is abberant is 'in your face' if a big huge thing you can't help but notice. Which, firmly places it as a him problem.
You are a wonderful and special being. You have gifts to give to the world. You have people to love. You are worthy of a bright and beautiful life
ur brother sucks
didn’t you make your dad a father lol
Sometimes I wish there were moderators as good as the ones in this sub but in real life... ""mods, take care of my little brother plz""
God he's so frustrating 🙄
your brother has obvious gaps in understanding what fatherhood consists of - and what it means to have it validated by a transgender son
Father’s Day is literally about YOUR relationship with YOUR dad, how YOU relate to YOUR dad. If your dad being supportive to you is something you value, it’s is very much appropriate to be thanking him for the support on Father’s Day. I’d wager your brother isn’t really annoyed about you “making it about yourself,” he’s just being defensive because he doesn’t want to admit he doesn’t support your transition.
How “little” are we talkin’ here? They sound pretty immature if you ask me…
You thanked him! On Father’s Day! That’s what you’re supposed to do! What a mess!
this is why we should sacrifice the transphobes/homophobes
Exactly! There's nothing wrong with putting something you appreciate about your dad in your ""happy father's day"" text. In fact, it's a little low-effort if you don't.
You said this in much better words than I could.
Maybe might need to poke the good ole youtube history to check they didn't end up in the alt right/ fash playground since that's so incredibly  easy these days
Quick note, OP is nonbinary, and I am unaware if they are ok with the term, “brother.”
I make it a point to say that I’m not asking for anything more than basic respect and just like you would like your gender and sense of self respected. I do too.
Their brother IS an ass
not related but happy cake day :D
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day :)
It was the best guess I had. He/they, transmasc, seems more like a brother than a sibling, so i took a shot in the dark.
Sibling is a good alternative if you’re not sure
not necessarily. I know several people who very much dislike being refered to in the neutral because it implies that they're not actually the gender they are and that the speaker is just compromising halfway to avoid conflict.

I was trying to be affirming and this person seems firmly on the masc end of the spectrum.
Sure, but their flair says nonbinary, so best not assume their gender."	vp34kr	NonBinary	1754	0.99	2022-07-01 15:11:04

I was depressed, neglecting myself and uncomfortable with myself until I came out about a year ago and got in shape. I have never felt so good and confident. Best part is, I'm blessed with a very supportive husband.		"I LOVE ur outfit!

Awe that’s really kind of you! If it’s alright to ask, where do you typically buy clothes from? (especially your outfit in the picture- I’m a big fan of layering clothes to get two colours on my sleeves like you did in the picture)
I’m not from the US but I have access to plenty of online stores.
<333
Thanks, family!
Oh lol the one on the right
I completely understand. I have one somewhat-supportive parent and one parent who I'm no longer in contact with as a result of their bigotry. I'm so glad you have a supportive partner, having someone cheering you on while you work on being authentically you makes all the difference!
I'm sorry if things have been hard for you. I hope they're better now. You're strong and keep being amazing ♥️
It's alright. I have a lot of trans and non-binary friends so I have support, just not from my parents. Some big pieces of transition are starting to fall into place for me (like top surgery plans–I'm so excited!). My biggest stressors right now mostly have to do with finding employment and housing rather than support!
I have that in the plan too! Saving while I'm weighing on the result vs sacrificing my fitness routine during recovery. I wish you'll get to sort out things soon and able to catch a break. Looking forward to your further updates!"	j7tmuz	NonBinary	1604	1.0	2020-10-09 05:56:19
9 months post op and feeling myself. It's amazing what happens when you are in a supportive environment		"The no nipple look is freaking cool idk why. It just is.
I love the blue tattoos! The look so interesting and satisfying and I'd love to have something like that -- are they a cultural design or just cool swirlies?
Heck yeah! You look amazing and happy, thanks for sharing, it made me smile ☺️
This is what I want my chest to look like. You look awesome! I'm so happy that you feel like yourself! 🖤
Ooo, love the siren ink
I love the kitty at the end.
tats and cats. love it.
We simp 🔥🔥🔥
Your smile is touching your eyes, and what matters is how you feel in this configuration and no one else's asthetics matter but yours.
How do you feel?
I MtFtNB and considering the freenips as well. curious what helped you decide to go that route? Kind of on the fence, I know tattooing them on is always an option, but I think I worry a lot about non acceptinf folks, etc, especially at the beach which would be nice to be able to do again without worrying how my ""chest"" would be considered as a they/them person with ""moobs/. boobs / or whatever""
AAAAAA YOU LOOK FANTASTIC!!!
There’s a no nips option?! That’s so dope!
Being as I'm currently taking a long binder break in a public womens bathroom and feeling very awkward, I needed to see this, thank you
I bet that cat’s fur must feel so soft on your chest!
can i ask why you chose to leave the nipples off? i’m genuinely curious
You look amazing! Also dope tattoos!
damn, you look incredible!!!
So so happy for you!  You look so happy! And your tattoos are amazing!  I'm planning sine once I'm post op too.  But first got to get the booba taken off.
Woaaaa You look so great :000

I would really like to look like you :')
Nice i love the look! Very unique I've only seen this one other time I think. I cant help but want to ask why though. Please know that I mean you no offense I was just curious. Btw your very attractive.
Did they remove the nipples?
Keep your head up cute friend 💓
woahh
I hope you don’t mind me saying this but you’re so hot! What a great look. Smokinnnn!
You look awesome! I hope this isn't too weird to ask, where'd you get the underwear or shorts w/ all the eyes? 👀 Do want
Awesome tattoos and congratulations on the successful top surgery!
Looks awesome! I am so happy for you my friend🤍
So happy for you! Congratulations
You look amazing and you're incision lines are soooo clean. I'm jealous. I have a consultation in a few days and I'm mostly on bard with trying to keep some kind of A-cup look for the husband, but plan C is is totally clean mastectomy lines like you have, it looks amazing.
Looking awesome! How much time did it take to heal?
Your cat looks so done in the last pic, I love it
I want your hair so badly
You look *powerful*. And we're... we're sure you're not some fey creature, come to enchant us all, yes?
How does it feel to live my dream 😔🤚/j honestly tho your results look so good!
You’re looking amazing! I’m so glad you’re doing great!
You're giving me 'it's tough to be a god' vibes and I love it
Look at r/freedthenips then!
I had a friend that got their nips tatted back on cus they didn’t like the no nip look lol
NipZero©️
Not cultural, but they are a design taken from a video game called Borderlands
Start making a folder of reference photos for your surgeon if you're planning on getting top surgery. That's what I did and it made me feel more assured in my results going into surgery. But thank you so much. So sweet 🥰
THANK YOU 🫶🏻
🥺 too nice
Best I've ever felt. Glad it shows a bit!
I thought it was easier to add nips (with tattoos) than to take them away. I left the conversation open literally until my surgeon was marking me  before surgery and I was so sure about no nips that it was just what came easily. 

As far as unaccepting people, I just say that I had a bilateral mastectomy and no cis person asks questions. The idea of cancer, even if I never said it was cancer, keeps them from running their mouths.
I’m not OP, but there are a lot of reasons. 

It’s more complicated surgically, can make healing more difficult, doesn’t always work (nipples can die), you don’t usually keep a lot of feeling in the nipple anyway post surgery, can be asymmetrical, doesn’t serve a purpose (little to no feeling in the area and you can’t feed a baby with them), and some people are planning on getting tattoos over them anyway so why complicate things further?
Had mine before the chop but plan on getting more! Good luck on your future surgery!
But you look like you! And I'm sure that no matter what you feel about your body, no matter what changes you do or don't undertake the underlying youness does and will shine though and make your look amaze, chosen body or no.
Why in terms of what? No nipples? I was worried about not having control of the appearance of them and the healing seems strenuous. I plan on having my chest tattooed and didn't feel the need to tattoo over them.
I had a bilateral mastectomy (also known as top surgery) and chose to not have my nipples grafted back on. Hope this explains it well enough.
Thanks 🥹
MeUndies! 👍🏻
Such a huge compliment
Lol i didn't even notice the no nipple at first, but it's cool. Sometimes i wonder if maybe I'm gonna do that (if i ever manage to get top surgery, gawd i hope so). My nipples are like, very large and pale (well the circle around them), i don't know what they would do with them if i tried to keep them...
It definitely isn't for everyone. I'm thinking about getting breast reduction and getting rid of them.
Oh my goodness I can't believe I didn't realize that. Thank you!
I was gonna say it was either Borderlands or AtLA!
Thank you for the advice. I'll do that. And you're welcome. 😊
Best of all, being able to go shirtless if you wanna.
Thanks for the insight. I am always curious peoples thought process and what led to the result. As someone AMAB I dont think the masectomy would need to be explained (vs my current breast size from usage of estrogen which does raise questions). I wih I knew someone personally, I only know people who had breast reduction or removal.  Still I find nipple interesting like if a woman removes them are her large breasts pg now? I mean they serve no purpose for me, in any case hope you are happy, the results look great.
y’know what that’s fair
Fun fact I have weird pseudo-nipple sensations near or on parts of my scar. But yeah you pretty much nailed every reason I had.
Awww Ur gona make me cry :'))

Thanks
Cool that make since i like tattoos to. yours are cool. Wish i had the guts to even get a surgery i do not so im very proud you were able to do what makes you happy.
Oh ok! Would look cool as shit with like a silver jacket or something~ idk I like it I thought about maybe doing that a while ago
From what I've heard they trim the edges to fit the chest better
They trim them if you get DI. That's what my surgeon did and they're much, much smaller now. Mine were originally very large.
Really the best part is not feeling like I have to bury myself in hoodies.
Also, if you don’t have nipples, you can’t get zucced online for topless pics
Oh that's good to know, thanks
Cool, thank you for the confirmation! ☺️
And now you can wear anything damned thing you want and not have to flip when you look down.

What’s our take on this?		"Yes. I would use makeup, in fact, I’d use MORE makeup because I see it as a form of self-expression and not a requirement for beauty. I hate “natural polite makeup” but that’s what I’m supposed to wear. I want wild facepaints, colors everywhere, bold eyeliner, I want more. 

Leg hair, I’m glad laser exists, but I would definitely stop shaving so often .
on the surface, sure. i agree that the cosmetics industry does prey on insecure people, usually women, and it's important to examine whether we do these things out of enjoyment or just because it feels like we ""should"". however these people are both TERFs -- number one has some cool ass stickers but also refers to trans people as 't words' lmao. number two posted a picture of a trans woman with the caption 'autogynephilia.' the message of *this specific post* is nice, but i don't trust either poster or their views on gender.
My wife and I have found this to be a point of conflict. 

She is a cis woman. She has grown up being *expected* to do these things, and has become tired and resentful of the expectation for many of them. She doesn’t always avoid them, but she hardly finds them empowering. If everyone stopped using them, I expect she’d find it no great loss.

I’m AMAB, transfemme-nonbinary. I grew up being *expected* to avoid these things, and punished socially if I didn’t. I have been empowered by them. If everyone stopped using them, I would be sad that it would make it that much harder for me to continue for myself.

It’s a point of conflict between us in as much as—even though we know this about one another—it’s easy to forget the other person’s perspective. Sometimes it’s hard for her to take sympathy in my joy, and hard for me to take sympathy in her frustration.

We keep that conflict check by remembering that feminism is in part about creating a world where everyone can be freed from the burden of gendered expectations. Both experiences coexist in harmony when such a burden is lifted.
Maybe shaving wouldn’t be as common, but men chose to shave/not shave. As for makeup, it’s absurd to imply that it wouldn’t still be a thing, I like makeup for the same reason I (and most people) like clothes, it’s self expression and it makes me feel nice.
The implicit assumption is that makeup and shaving your legs (?) imply self-hatred, and I think that assumption is super shaky, at best.
Hey, first time commenting! I'm a binary trans woman who just likes lurking and seeing all the cool enbies around! The two OG posters are for sure trans exclusionary radical feminists and I looked at the poster that shared it and they have a comment where they refer to neovaginas as ""surgically created holes"". So...kinda uncomfortable for sure.

Edit: also not a massive fan on how the OOP is fighting with women in the comments who like shaving and doing makeup by essentially saying they're coerced into doing so by society itself. 

I agree on how women are pushed into doing these through a patriarchal society. However, women should be able to choose without being told they're doing it simply for men and society. It removes their agency.
For makeup I probably wouldn't; I wear makeup to participate in something, not for the pure joy of it.

But I actually like the feeling of having hairless skin as an end in itself (if only my skin didn't attack me for it...)
I agree that the pressure on women to wear makeup whenever in public and to shave legs in particular in the summer is not at all a good thing. 

In a million ways, women are told they are not enough. And in order to be enough, they have to look good to other people. 

That is a toxic take. 

The NB take, it seems, would be to take from all genders what feels good. That is a healthier perspective. 

But women in our society are generally not fed that option, nor are they celebrated for making the decision not to shave legs and beautify.
I don’t shave or wear make up, but this message really doesn’t sit right with me. Some people genuinely enjoy shaving and wearing make up. It makes them feel happy. It’s a form of self care and love. It’s true that a lot of these industries prey on people, but it’s wrong to say that they exist purely because people hate themselves.
I don't really shave but I love my makeup. I didn't wear it for a few years but now I really enjoy it.
I actually started getting more into makeup when I came out lol.

Also props to our friend the other commenter for seeing that these were terf messages.
As an AMAB who's really in the bear subculture...

Everyone who finds me attractive thinks I'm hotter with a beard and body hair. It still makes me dysphoric.

Everyone thinks I'm hotter without makeup. I still love wearing it.

I shave my body and wear makeup because it makes me feel good, and for no other reason (amusingly, both my partners love my beard so much that my compromise is to bleach it instead of shaving).
I think the caption on the post is accurate re: how critical and exacting beauty standards are and how that feeds the beauty industry. But as for the questions in the image, I think that will be different by the person!
I hate this kind of messaging.  I've seen hair removal reduced to ""arbitrary beauty standards pushed by capitalists for profit"" in a safe trans space before and it made me uncomfortable.  Regardless of whether it is pushed by profiteering companies, disregarding it as nothing more than that invalidates/dismisses both my dysphoria and euphoria as nothing more than gullible consumerism.

The way I have felt about my body hair since puberty, and the way I feel when I see myself in makeup and nail polish are not up for others to dismiss as nothing more than marketing trickery.
Get shinigami-eyes. Both of these accounts will show up as TERF. The talking points (especially the first one) are also commonly used to be transphobic (trans women being objectified because they shave, but then the goalposts get moved and shaving is considered unfeminine, yada yada).

The point is built on a kernel of truth, which is what makes it sound like it could make sense, but you have to do the legwork yourself to make it make sense. What is implied with the “would you?” What is the actual question? Is it questioning social pressure to follow a status quo (through physical effort to look the same)? Is it asking about insecurity? Is it calling you a sheep for not dropping these habits? It’s very r/im14andthisisdeep to say “what if society was different, would you also be different?” like yeah, duh, to say you are in no way influenced by your surroundings is egotistical and vain at best.

To answer the question: what’s our take on what. They make no point. They ask no question. They vaguely wave at something and end it with a question mark.
I don’t like how people conflate the issues of capitalism and manipulative market tactics with people who just do shit that they like. It’s so black and white. Not every person who wears makeup has been brainwashed by the beauty industry. Not everyone who shaved or wears a bra hates their body. For a lot of transfems, this is GENDER AFFIRMING. 

It’s not feminism if it doesn’t consider ALL intersections and equality of ALL genders.
It's very black and white neolib white feminism. It ignores how many beauty standards are routed in racism and ableism. Like yes, these companies are preying on your insecurities, but where did those insecurities come from? We cannot divorce the ""choice"" to shave and wear makeup from societal pressures, but that doesn't mean people who do those things hate themselves or are bad feminists
Looked them up and the screenshot people are literally virulent TERFs.

This shit is basically dogwhistles aimed at trans women. By implying that gender performance is inherently taking an active role in your own oppression, a take one step removed from “she obviously wanted it in that outfit”, they imply that trans people are attempting to “infiltrate” womanhood.
I technically agree with everything stated, but this kind of messaging might easily lend itself to the false conclusion that makeup and shaving itself are the problem. That people should be shamed for using the one thing that helps them not feel bad in this world.
Gail Dines is a TERF
It ignores men and nbs who enjoy those things and consume those products (and many others, becsuse male beauty standards exist too), and also assumes women do those things because they hate themselves or because they feel they have to. Sure, some do. But many just enjoy it. And that's OK.
I think this is a super complex issue, and it's hard to unpack what we're doing for gender expression, and what we're doing because it's expected of us. Like trying to figure out, am I doing this because I want to or because it's expected of me is hard, and it's a long journey with a lot of misteps. I think for those of us between genders it's particularly challenging, because how do you know what nonbinary is even supposed to look like? It's all so different, because we're all so different. I think it's a long confusing process, and it's OK to be unsure where you sit with all of it.
Sometimes things feel nice tbh,as a trans guy/enby thats been really important with experimenting with makeup and shaving. Makeup is art and its freeing for some folks!!
Yeah the beauty industry is predatory but idk i don't think all of it is inherently bad. I feel like that's black and white thinking and very silly. Makeup has been around forever and its probably going to always exist even if patriarchy totally collapses. 

For me, I'm transmasc nb, I like makeup and i wear it essentially to play with color. Do i think it makes me look pretty? yeah i guess, but its more about expressing myself? A lot of the time i just wear it around the house. And i don't bother shaving at all. I like my body hair. 

Also fuck gail dines.
I think the original post/quote ignores the fact that there are other reasons to do those things besides hating yourself. I’m thinking mostly of makeup which some artists go really wild with in impressive ways.
I think the problem is that there can be a huge social pressure to shave your legs and wear makeup. But the flipped pressure to NOT shave your legs and NOT wear makeup is also fucked up. 

I have personally been made fun of a lot for my hairy legs when I was a child, and for a while that made me shave my legs to fit in. I also did used to wear makeup because I wanted to fit in and was insecure about my appearance.

Now I shave my legs if I want to (I do like how smooth they feel), and I only wear makeup when I feel like it. And I have learned that wearing makeup to cover my acne makes me feel ugly when I take it off, so I don’t do that anymore. 

But that balance of what feels right is a very personal thing. And just because wearing foundation everyday is detrimental to my mental health, doesn’t mean it is to someone else. So I think what’s missing is nuance. Everyone should do what they want. But it’s also good to be mindful of why you wanna do it.
Tbh I very rarely do either of these anymore
Just gonna touch on shaving: YES! 

I HATE hair anywhere on me except the eyebrows and top o' my head. And this isn't because I don't like how it looks, it's because body hair feels TERRIBLE. If I were trapped in a space ship floating through empty space, destined never to see another human again I still wouldn't like how hair feels and would want it GONE.
To me the worst part is implying that fitness is a thing people do because they hate their bodies when actually exercising is one of the most important things you can do for your mental & physical health.
I mean.....

I can answer yes to the shaving question with no hesitation. Body hair is not a pleasant sensory experience for me and I feel better when I'm smooth just about everywhere except my underarms (which is the thing I don't shave).

And as for makeup, I only wear it when I am feeling fun/costumey anyhow, so yes I think my habits would be similar if not quite the same.
I'm sorry the clothing industry? Seriously? Like, seriously? People would still need clothes, even if they loved their bodies. Like seriously WTF?
Not Non-Binary but Transfem, I find both can be validating and euphoric, makeup and the stuff they are talking about can be good or bad it depends. Fat shaming people to go to the gym- bad, someone wanting to go to the gym so they feel better about there bodies/ get buff because they want to be not told that they have to be- good
No one should feel like they have to wear makeup. But we shouldn't condemn those who want to. Personally, I like having the option of a mascara stache. Or covering up my acne for a night out. I don't wear makeup most of the time, but I'd be upset if someone told me I shouldn't for the same reason I'd be upset if someone told me I should. Similar ideas about societal dress codes and controlling what others wear in a different package. Enforcing preferences is what leads to the oppression the image-maker wants to avoid.
The cosmetic industry is the only one they listed that is an overwhelming majority of women, everyone wears clothes, tons of men go to the gym, and what even is a diet industry?
These tired goofy ass TERFs always dropping these “gotcha” takes that completely ignore the history of cosmetics and hair removal that long predate the exploitative capitalist hellscape of false dichotomies we’re all forced to live in. Tell me you’re examining beauty and gender through a white colonial lens without telling me you’re examining beauty and gender through a white colonial lens. Just can’t with these morons.
If gender as a concept was just removed from society that would be pretty swag
people can make the choice to use makeup, shave,
or look a certain way. nobody forces them to. im tired of seeing the same beauty standards but that doesnt mean im gonna change myself to look like that. capitalism is a problem but we also need to take accountability for what we participate in - thats the biggest “fuck you”. ill be myself & thats good enough for me. beauty standards do not affect me
This gives me “not like the other girls” vibe and I really hate that.
I already don't do either one. :P The last time I shaved my legs and put on make up was for a specific photo shoot.
Just saw this elsewhere and thought of it from trans/envy perspective. Which I hadn't before. Used to be vehemently anti-makeup. Understand it more now. Thanks for posting here.
Nah, I like feeling slippery smooth. Plus for some reason it hurts when I don’t. And I just don’t wear makeup anyway except special occasions. Nobody has ever commented except one shitty boss. Do you.
It's complex! I think humans have used all these technologies of altering and adorning our bodies - cosmetics and shaving, movement and clothes - for a really long time, so I believe that yes, we/some of us would still be using them even if there was no cultural or social pressure to do so. Similarly, we would still be caring for our health and fitness and be looking to style our clothes. In a world without corporations dictating these things, I think different forms of norms or conventions would arise in time, likely less facilitated by marketing and corporate interests and more by what people like/pass around in their groups, but they would perhaps be more flexible and amenable to change through our own communities and would likely be less exploitative and more participative.
This is underestimating the people who just genuinely enjoy these things. I hate body hair. It has nothing to do with society telling me what does and doesn't look good (especially as a AFAB.) I wear pants, never wear tank tops, and I'm sure as hell the only one seeing my bikini area. Still shave my legs, underarms and cooch (unless I'm being lazy.)

I go out without makeup probably 360 days of the year, if not more. I still choose to buy it and wear it when I feel like it. 

Of course the industries thrive more because of people's insecurities, but it's not these things would never sell if you got rid of everyone's insecurities.
i think i would still shave because i just don’t like having body hair 🤷but i think i would be a little bit more confortable having body hair if nobody else was doing it..
If nobody wore it, it would be very expensive and so I wouldnt be able to afford make-up lmao
Considering make up and waxing dates back to 6000 bce in Egypt done by both men and women, the first to appease gods and the second to avoid lice: yes. 
I mean I just shave my chin. But yes.
I had this job I hated in Texas before I was out as NB (am AFAB). My mom said I had seemed so happy at that job. How I’d gotten all dressed up and wore makeup. & I had to tell her no I actually hated that job but I had to do that makeup and shit because it was expected in order to look “”presentable”” at that job per my direct superior. Despite it wasn’t customer facing and I was in a tiny cube face to a computer screen. 

I hated it and it made me feel cheap and sleazy to have to do so much. After almost a year I asked for a 25c raise as I was paid under min wage & this would get me there— and was fired on the spot. I was doing the work of four people doing a real estate / ad book, creating all the ads and the layout. 

I’m absolutely still crushed about the things that were left at my desk that I never got to retrieve. But because I had to cake on makeup, my mom thought I was happy. Super gutting, tbh. 

It took me a lot of years to readjust my relationship with makeup in order to enjoy fucking with it.
If no women did it, I would still have sensory sensitivities and not be comfortable wearing pants with unshaved legs.
Honestly I Don't Think I'd Just Suddenly Start Liking My Leg Hair If Nobody Shaved Their Legs. I've No Qualms With Being The Only Person In The World Who Shaves Their Legs I Just Want To Get Rid Of It! (Which Unfortunately I Currently Can't As I Neither Have A Razor Nor Know How To Use One :<)
My leg hair is itchy, I'd probably still shave it. That said, I only started shaving because people started pointing out that it was long and ""gross"" and it made me insecure.
I already don’t shave my legs. I never understood the point because it doesn’t fit my aesthetic. I dress for me. And that includes all body mods and what hair is and is not shaved.
i shave my armpits because i dont like having hair there, and i like to wear glitter makeup because ooo shiny eyelids

but i’m also not the target demographic for those products
I shave due to sensory issues. I use makeup because it’s fun and it helps cultivate the look I actually want to present to the world and myself in my own photos. Compulsory beauty is terrible, yes, but the OPTION for these things is much appreciated.
Like everything, hair removal and makeup should be a choice. 
E.g. since I was a teenager I (afab) have had dark hair on my upper lip and was teased for it a lot in school. The older people in my family encouraged me to remove it because it isn't ""feminine"" but I didn't want some teenage boys to win. 
Now I'm 23 and have been in a stable relationship with a man who makes me feel beautiful every day. I have also decided to get laser hair removal on my upper lip FOR MYSELF. Because I can afford it and I view this as an act of self love. Not because I feel ugly and think I would look better without a ""moustache"" but because I just thought ""why not"". That's the ideal scenario for everything.
I have tried not shaving my legs, and the pain from the hairs catching the inside of my trousers always has me shaving about once a month. Underarms? No pain, no shave, but I do trim occasionally. 

Makeup I wear only when going out for goth night, and I prefer the Floki/Lagertha inspired viking battle look, so I'm certainly not trying to look pretty. ""Fearsome and not to be trifled with"" is my goal, so the makeup industrial complex can operate, or not, and that hardly affects my life. 

I make it sound so breezy but obviously it took a while to get here.
For shaving it's a 50/50 for me personally.

If other people didn't shave I never would have thought to try or realized that I do enjoy having no body hair (for myself). 

When I first started shaving it was because I wanted to fit in since everyone else was, it was my original motivation.

Now though, I don't shave for conformity but because I enjoy it for myself.

I have some sensory things and having hair on my body can be really annoying for me, making it really uncomfortable. When I'm hairless it feels nice for me and the discomfort is gone. 

I don't think body hair is unhygienic, I just don't personally want it. 

When it comes to make up, I usually don't do it.

I don't like it very much and will only do it for special events (not even then all the time). 

I like special effects makeup because it's fun. Besides that, if I do makeup it's just a little bit of eyeliner without the wing, maybe mascara and lip balm (which I wear anyways). 

Shaving and makeup should be left up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to do it and there shouldn't be judgement or pressure either way.

If someone doesn't want to shave? Good for them. 

Someone wants to shave? Also good for them. 

Someone wants to wear a full face of makeup? Lovely. 

Someone wants to wear no makeup? Great. 

We're all individuals with different needs and interests. As long as people are happy doing what they're doing and no one's being harmed, all the power to them ❤️
Because you know, there isn't anyone else who shaves any part of their body, or wears makeup for any reason-

This is just more TERF bs trying to tell women and people in general what they can or can't do. 20 bucks says these same women would look down on anyone with a huge wooly beard or a large port wine birthmark on their face that they chose not to cover with makeup.
Cosmetics should be there for those who want them, but no one should feel pressured into needing them.
Seems like a terf Trojan horse. As if to say that if women had the same attitude towards beauty as men, trans women would somehow not be able to claim womanhood. Maybe I’m overthinking this.
Let people do whatever they want, you want to wear make up wear it, you want to shave body parts do it. Or don't if that makes you happy. The idea that somehow feminists cannot do anything deemed ""girly"", and for that matter that non-binary people have to be androgynous or masc presenting, should have died out in the 80s
I'm pretty sure the poster is a terf. I don't disagree with it though, neoliberal commodification of everything is disgusting.
I like shaving my legs. Not a societal obligation for me. I just like smooth.
I don't shave my legs but I do wear makeup when I feel like it and have the time. I think of it as a tool to express myself. I definitely fell victim to the belief that makeup would make me pretty and feminine and therefore accepted by people but it doesn't matter what other people think if I don't accept myself first.
Literally do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're doing it for you, because it makes you happy, and not because of someone else. (Also as long as it doesn't hurt you or someone else.)
Sexism hurts everyone, not just women, but also men and nonbinary people.
Idk if this fits here, but I’m more on the transmasc side of NB but I frequently shave my legs because I like the texture. I don’t wear make up quite as much, but I’ll accessorize or do other things to make myself feel cute. Fuck capitalism, but I’m not going to stop working out or doing things to make myself feel good to be anti.
feels misogynistic. there's no wrong way to be a woman, regardless of personal relationship with shaving or makeup. same is true for enbies, there's no wrong way to be an enby.

the fact that they're terf shitheads is just icing on the cake
Sexist bullshit. One example of what shit people do in the name of feminism. If you're about  equality you don't think those are used by women only.

People have many reasons why they choose to be in the weight they are.

In what reality only reason to go to gym is look pretty?

I shave around my genitals because I want to see them. I'm way too lazy to shave somewhere else or make up. Others can give ideas but they don't do anything to my decision. I go to gym because you can't be boxer if you're physically unable for it. You can't just read a book and know things in theory. I bulk or cut when my trainer says so. I am naturist so I would love to be naked in summer. In winter that would be deadly.
I think it's describing one part of the truth as tho it is the only truth. Industry does all of these things, but also every human culture has self-decoration in some form, sometimes very strong and intense self-decoration, with no capitalist motive.   


And either way, you might not want to play along, and if you don't wanna, you maybe shouldn't.  


And either way, you might want to play along, and if you wanna, you maybe should!
How would women liking their bodies put the clothing industry out of business? Are they saying we'll all just live the rest of our lives naked? Like even if somehow we all decided we want to do that, that's hella cold in winter and is gonna increase risk of sunburn in the summer.

Also, gym industry? Working out isn't always (just) for looks. Like, I work out so as to prevent my knee from getting any more damaged resulting in me no longer being able to walk. No matter how much I like my body, I'll still need to keep training if I wanna be able to walk.
Cosmetics have become an art form. Just do whatever makes you happy yah know
I don't understand the rules on that sub. 


>Good comment: I still shave because  I struggle with feeling less feminine if I don’t.

>Bad comment: I shave because it makes me feel best.

>This forum expects more than “I am a woman and I chose this therefore it’s feminist/OK/without implications”


Am I stupid or something?
Dude I want steel fangs,  like would the large scale of the industry go down sure but women in prison use Kool-Aid for makeup so like it's honestly a personal thing so like eh
Yeah, I don't think I'm really insecure that my eyelids aren't naturally black with purple glitter. Oh these standards 😩
id probably still use makeup because i like how i look in it, and i love the look of body hair on me but hate the feeling so i *have* to shave (sensory disorders suck ass) a lot of things like diet industries would die but i don’t think makeup would because, for so many, it’s so much more than making yourself look “better” but it’s an art. (and honestly maybe working out would be more targeted at strength? it’s something many girls stray away from because men criticize muscular afab bodies sooo heavily)
I've seen radfems post this if that tells you anything, so my reaction may be a bit muddied by that, but i think it's still safe to say it's not that great of a post. Like, yes, capitalism is insidious and will market in any way it can. That's the real problem, not cis women who want to shave cuz they just like the feeling of it or cis women who want to wear make up for themselves or for fun. Anytime a post blames cis women using their own autonomy to engage in something totally consensual, I have to question why and what the person's reasons are. Most of the time they're angry at the wrong thing, ie, cis women in porn/sex work 'objectifying themselves' (have literally seen radfems say they're begging to be raped. Um fucking ew.) and not the typically cishet men who don't understand porn is acting and not an automatic 'yes' from every woman. Also, make up has been around for...a long time. Well before it was marketed to cis women exclusively. The entire acting industry would probably be able to support it itself even if all western women stopped using it lol. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for body positivity for women, but many women just enjoy these things for themselves, not because they're doing it for anyone else, and to call that bad just seems misogynistic to me.
That aint wrong but destroying the businesses wont help. Destroying the stereotypes is the way to go. We should be allowed to choose when to shave and when to be hairy. It just gotta be depending on the individual's choices not society's expectations
These people are both TERFs, so their opinions are invalid.
I already don't do make up despite everyone using it. I never got the hang of it and I don't care. Very rarely when I feel like it, I put on some lipstick or simple eyeshadow and that's it.
I like this image, and its absolutely true that a huge amount of women would not do either of these things if there wasn't a market capitalizing on their insecurity and on patriarchal beauty standards. This is not to shame women who do wear makeup and shave, or to say that makeup cannot be used as a form of artistry, but I genuinely wish more women would seriously interrogate their relationship to beauty and the beauty industry. 

I'm making an effort to stop shaving despite it being something I was taught to do in order to be attractive my entire life. Funniest reactions I get are when women describe it as a ""political"" thing for me to do and say they wish they could stop shaving. Why are certain people's bodies existing in their natural state considered political?
I grew up with the expectations of a woman. I shaved because that's what was expected of me and was shamed otherwise. Makeup was something I felt like I needed to learn, like a life skill and I felt as though I was ""behind"" because I could never get the hang of it. 

Does the cosmetic industry and the patriarchy prey on women's insecurities? Absolutely yes as it is a means of control. Can we still do these things for ourselves? Also yes. After growing out of these expectations, and fighting through the deep-rooted insecurities, I now know what my cosmetic preferences are.

I haven't shaved in like 4 years, and while this is partially due to lockdown, I had already started to not shave my arms and upper legs beforehand. Plus I was 15 at start of lockdown so obviously I still had a lot of self discovery to do regardless. I rarely do makeup due to sensory issues but I wish I knew how to eyeliner because that is cool as fuck.

ETA: Makeup can be so gender euphoric at times. I like presenting feminine sometimes but it sucks because I am perceived as a girl. I want to be fem in a gay way
I do agree that much of capitalism is dependent on women hating themselves 

And I think it's a fair question to ponder if you'd do it if it wasn't expected of you.
i’d shave my legs because i hâte body hair, i’d do my makeup because i find an odd sense of masculinity in a bit too much eyeliner. hell i might use a bit more makeup and shave a bit more for the sake of self experession rather than it being seen as something i should do since i’m afab. idk though i’m lazy af
I have never shaved my legs (too much work, shaving my face is already annoying enough) and dislike makeup (I think it's a sensory issue mostly).  Probably helps that my sister growing up didn't shave her legs or wear makeup so I don't see it as a part of femininity.

But if you were to add heels into the mix, I have a love hate relationship with them.  I feel drawn to them but fee like they make stand out more than I want due to height and the sound they make. But if no one else wore them would they even appeal to me anymore?  Probably not.

But that is why I gravitate towards non-binary, I just pick and choose what I like and avoid what I don't without regard to gender norms.
Yes I would still do both. Makeup is fun like art. I don't use it to cover insecurities not that I think theres anything wrong with that but for me its a form of self expression. I also just prefer myself hairless I just think it looks better and its a personal thing I don't feel pressured to shave.

But there's definitely a huge issue with Americans shaming women for not shaving and even have friends that were pressured at work to start wearing makeup.
The fact of the matter is marketing's entire function is to convince the target market of it's product that they have a problem. 

And the only solution is Product ™ - yours for only $999.99!

Unilever, the same company that owns Axe with all its problematic ads, also owns Dove.

Rainbow capitalism exists not because of corporate acceptance or genuine pride. ""Her-she"" chocolate, Green M&M - don't get me wrong, I like those especially because conservatives cry for a whole news cycle about it - aren't really authentic.

It's just not doing it is less profitable.

I remember a Financial Times article once that examined a retiring, childfree couple's retirement plans. FT's article claimed - among other frivolous charges - that the couple *needed* to buy the newest SUV model every 5 years. For ""security"".

Capitalism relies on something that transcends gender - but does disproportionately affect women and minorities: insecurity and fear.
I recognised the OP. She's a well known transphobe and anti sex worker sticker maker on Tumblr.
As a trans non binary person and sex worker from the UK, I don't think content from those who oppose my existance should be given a platform . Regardless of whether their takes sometimes make sense they are ultimately still promoting a radfem ideology and therefore dangerous narrative.

Thanks for reminding me that I gotta teach myself makeup. Thay shit looks amazing on people and I wanna look cute. (And confuse people even more than a beared person in a skirt already does)
I mean people will still be shaving their legs and wearing makeup. Just out of personal freedom than following any social pressure.

Makeup will still be used in theatrical performances and to make the characters more animated. People will shave, but only if they feel their own personal discomfort with it as opposed to trying to look feminine or whatnot (I say this as someone who still feels itchy with body hair).

We just won't make a fuss about shaving or makeup. Like if a person chooses to do it, let them. We see no reason as to why people should or should not do something based on some dumb rule.
Patriarchy and capitalism play rule in this. Patriarchy have always created beauty standards and gender roles and push them on women to show dominance and control, so women always feel obligated by those roles and then by time they became normalized, such as body shaving; and then by the rise of market, capitalism toke advantage of that and started creating products with persuasive advertises to convince women to buy them. Also, body hair shaving is a westernised/colonized idea, as body hair was considered normal in many cultures like Persian.
Ultimately whatever makes you happy and comfortable is most important. 

I saw someone else say it was TERFy and I agree, all or nothing mentality leans into TERF mentality and the ""we hate men"" mentality. 

I personally am AFAB and look pretty feminine but I don't participate in shaving or wearing makeup unless *I* want to. It has a lot of trigging things for me about it. And at one point in time I felt this way about these activities. But I've seen a lot of makeup artist videos and them just having fun and enjoying it. And although I know I don't enjoy it, it doesn't mean others don't. 

Capitalist industries most definitely perpetuate gender, gender roles and push gender conformity. That shit I hate. The pink tax is real. 

I would encourage you to look into intersectional feminism. Basically it comes down to the patriarchy harms everyone. Intersectional feminism ideals include everyone, trans, Non-bianary, men, women, POC. Ultimately it's human rights. People should have the right to live their life the way they choose.
I am angry bc a lot of products contain ammonium salts, chlorides, n stuff. Which PPM is ""fine"" but logically I cannot move past the fact that i *know* what I am being dosed with a lot of these coming from many sources, beauty products being one. I try to get the cleanest stuff I can find, but at the end of the day my power as a consumer is limited and does not help everyone else. The only way to fix it in my mind is to destroy the systems which perpetuate it, and to demand accountability in the production of these things. 

Some stuff would probably still exist after the destruction of capitalism (like makeup, shaving, etc) -- but wouldn't be marketed or culturally enforced in the oppressive ways that it currently is. 

You know. They make you feel like you gotta fix yourself with products, keep consuming snd giving them money, but also fill the products with shit and exploit the workers as well.

The last bit about boycotting -- It is true that if we all woke up tomorrow and decided to boycott all beauty products, it would have an effect on the industry. However, there are people with valid reasons for using products, and it feels unfair to them to take them away. Beauty products existed before capitalism. 

I think this dips a little into consumer culture in general. I think there is a point where you can buy into it too much for sure. For myself, I feel like I got tricked into buying stuff (like certain anti-frizz products) that is not very good for me or the environment.
I’m staunchly anti capitalism (I do like wearing makeup I think it’s fun) I deeply approve of this message.
obviously it's right. you'd have to be either an idiot, or someone who's never experienced misogyny as a woman to think otherwise.
i would still shave for hygiene and i wouldnt feel pressured to put on makeup
I think it s a good opening to discuss gender and everything that it implies. Even without society I d still like to shave though. I think it depends for everyone
 Not me tho i see makeup as art and i’m very passionate abt it
I would wear lipstick and stuff even thought no one wore it, It's fun to do make up and stuff like that, Especially with purple and black, you can express yourself in your own style with make up and i think that is what makes me like it so much
I probably wouldn't shave, I already don't shave my legs but my underarms I started and they get to itchy if I don't
I'm already beautiful, this stuff just makes me even more beautiful
I still wouldn't shave or wear make up. The last time I wore makeup was at prom and I didn't want to wear makeup then.
I don't usually wear makeup cause I am lazy and it's gonna get washed away eventually over the day. I only do it to be fancy, like for a date or special occasion. The only pressure I have is my mom who insisted on me wearing makeup on some occasions. I really don't like being Fakeuped
Shaving is fantastic for my sensory issues and makeup is art but I wear it on my face, I do them because I like them not because I'm told I'm ""ugly"" without them
Yes because hairs are gross

And no because makeup confuses me
I agree on the fact that no one should have to shave or use makeup, but if someone likes makeup, that’s valid too. The shaving one is more of a grey area, as it isn’t exactly an art or a hobby like makeup is.
I don't normally wear makeup unless I want to dress up. And I don't shave my legs or pits unless they start to bother me. I'm an afab gender queer and I hate gender norms. My husband is the hairyest mf I know and if he says ""you should shave your legs"" I laugh at him and tell him it's my body. I like a clean shaven feel and look though. I've tried both and I just like it better smooth...personal choice. Though I don't shave for other people. Wanna go swimming and havent shaved? I'm still going haha people have an issue with hairy pits in a bikini they can go cry its my body.
Basically I feel like being NB allows me to pick and choose what I want to engage in. I don't shave my legs but I do wear makeup! That's just what feels right for me!
I'm not doing either, never did (afab btw, so it was actually ""expected"" for me) but I'm considering trying make up for self expression
Regarding shaving - I only did it because my mom tought me to do so and made comments if I hadn't shaved. At one point I realised I don't need to, so i kinda stopped, now i shave sometimes when I'm in the mood, but not regularly (also I like to keep warm during winter :D). I admit, I like the shaved look, but I've never actually had anything against hairy body parts. As long as you have good hygene, who cares if there's hair on your body.
Regarding make up - never wore it. I used to be a dancer, so I wore make up for competitions, but stage make up is something completely different from every-day make up. Nowdays I sometimes put on a crazy shade of lipstick or eyeshadow when I go to a party, but that's it.
I don't do it because of sensory issues, I literally cannot stand the feeling of it, but I'm not gonna just others for doing it
I shave, but I don’t put makeup on
A better question is if there was no pressure to do this would you. No one doing it may be active deterent to not feel completely out of place. I don't do either but it's not feminist to imply women only do these things to attract others. It is feminist to instead point out that it's fucked up that unaltered feminine bodies are considered inately unfeminine.
I never *hated* myself even as a woman. I wore makeup mostly to cover my complexion because I personally wanted more uniform skin and disliked my acne-scarred natural appearance. After coming out though, I cut my hair, quit wearing as much makeup, and quit shaving my legs (AFAB here) as experimentations in my non-biased expression. It answered questions for me about how my expression changed with my now open identity. I’m still wearing light makeup because I like it and wanna play up my eyes, but I’m not shaving my legs anymore and my showers are SO much shorter. For some that never question why they shave their legs or wear makeup except to fit a beauty ideal, that’s not inherently wrong either but only they can answer if they’d be happier NOT doing it. 🤷🏼

TL;DR: for me, it’s always been about what I liked but marketing is a powerful magnet.
I agree, I do those things when I want to for myself and no one else, and it took me a while to get to that point.
Hall yea I would!! It's all bullshit anyways! We just think it's wierd because we were told to think it's wierd!
I will. Never. Ever. Give up my eyeliner. Other than that, the makeup industry can suck it. Gotta have my eyeliner though. Call it guyliner if you want. It’s the 90’s babe in me.
AFAB here, I don't do either. I tried to, though, as a teen, just to fit in, and the disphoria was freaking overwhelming. HOWEVER! everyone should be able to present whatever way they want. If the signifiers of femininity, that feel like trappings to me, feel empowering to you, go for it.
I don't shave my legs.

I wear make up rarely, like... randomly or on special occasions.
Yeah, it's very much true.

I would still shave and do my makeup tho
No, I wouldn't shave (and I don't) and yes because makeup is a creative and artistic thing for me. I don't wear it to look ""presentable"" but I'm also not a woman.
I already only wear makeup because I like it. I make my eyebrows match each other and do eye makeup because I like how it looks. I also don't do eye makeup because I also like how none looks.

Shaving my legs is a different story. I only do that out of fear of judgement at this point. If no one shaved their legs, I wouldn't. At least not until it gets to a certain length - tight pants and long leg hair don't mix.
Liking my body is the reason I go to the gym. To look after it.
People like to feel smooth and express themselves creatively with makeup. Style and fitness aren’t exclusively held up by patriarchy. Does patriarchy pressure people to look a certain way, yes absolutely. There is a pressure for women to be fit and pretty to be appealing to men, and for men to be fit to protect women. However, people’s desires go beyond that, and these industries don’t have to be defined by this pressure.
I mean, I don’t do either already… but it’s nuanced
Idk I never did despite being AFAB 😐
Makeup is art for my face. 

I think a lot of people would wear it, regardless of industry pressure.
I’m fairly indifferent to makeup, but as for shaving? The whole “body hair is gross” idea got warped in my mind and backfired on me. I don’t like body hair below the neck on anyone, not even cis men.
I already don't wear makeup because it makes me uncomfortable, and as for shaving, I do it rarely. The only time I shave is when I wear something that exposes my arms or legs and even then, it's only because ""gIrLs WhO dOn'T sHaVe ArE gRoSs"" and I'd rather not have to explain to people that I'm transmasc and feel comfortable with my body hair.
I no longer shave but I do still wear makeup!
i just read a social commentary on media peer pressure regarding shaving.  fashion continued to show more skin :  specifically Gillette targeted women to be 'civilized'  .  while I refuse to allow society to dictate body hair,  the claws are sunk deep.  maybe bc I had an elder sister & mom both leg shaving constantly.  On principle I dont shave but I admit Ive got Stockholm Syndrome -  I shave my legs before the beach.  and hate the psychology behind it
I like the feel of smooth legs and makeup looks cool. (funny enough though I don't shave my arm pits)
I feel like the idea that women or fem presenting people *need* to shave or it's ""unhygienic"" is deeply rooted in dehumanization of women and pedophilia. 


There's nothing wrong with shaving if it makes *you* feel good, and it's very hard to step outside of the expectation society places to be hairless, but I feel that body hair needs to continue to be normalized, because it is, in fact, normal and perfectly healthy and as hygienic as any other body part. 



In short, do it for you if you want but never be ashamed of your humanity.

And a counter question: if you'd never been taught having body hair was wrong, would you still trouble with removing it?
Only occasionally, for fun. One of the downsides of capitalism is that it encourages businesses to create and enforce needs to sell product, which obviously wastes time, energy and material on something no one wanted until they did.
honestly, the euro-centric standards has taken over the makeup industry, so although makeup has a been a right of passage for many cultures, we are just a small portion of who's actually using makeup.
my hot take: fuck off anti cropos, i wanna look pretty for my gf :)
I do think that these industries and trends profit off telling women that they're gross, unprofessional, or unattractive if they don't do these things. For me, stopping wearing makeup was empowering because I only did it because I felt like I needed to.

But there's nothing wrong with these things in general. Some people do like having smoother, hairless skin. Some people enjoy wearing makeup as a form of self-expression. The issue, I think, is that there's a disparity in who is exposed to these options and the social costs of not conforming. There are probably a lot of men who would enjoy wearing makeup or shaving their legs if they weren't discouraged from doing so, and there are a lot of women who only do these things because they're taught it's what women are supposed to do. And trans people (binary and non-binary) can experience additional pressures related to their gender expression, as well.
It's true
It’s not 100% wrong lots of modern industries arose from marketing saying you’re repulsive if you let your body be natural. But that’s marketing, fashion arises from creativity too so cosmetics would still exist, shaving maybe less popular but self grooming is still a comfort thing for practicality. Basically the industry would still exist but it might be less guilt trippy. Also men are subjected to this stuff too it’s not just a women thing.
The was exactly the conclusion I came to with shaving. I still shave my armpits because I don't like how the hair feels and my deodorant is FAR more effective without the hair. My legs? I realized that the only reason I ever shaved them was because it was expected of me. My showers go a lot quicker now.
I haven't shaved in years but makeup yeah I probably would. If makeup didn't exist but face paint did I'd probably use face paint. I like dying my hair and adding extra stuff like makeup
I don’t shave my legs but I sometimes wear makeup. I don’t care what other people do. I just don’t want to be shamed for not shaving anything.
""If nobody else wore jewelry, would you?"" Yes! Because it looks good!  
I like my pretty little rocks and tiny bits of shaped metal. Is the jewelry and mining industry massively exploitative? Yeah, obviously. Is it propped up by a dependency on folks hating themselves? No! People just like pretty things, and things that let them express themselves.  


I like my painted nails. I enjoy the ability to add adornments to my body, the artistic creativity it affords me is fun! The beauty industry isn't getting my money because I hate myself, it gets it because it has a monopoly on tools I want to use (although I do generally favour smaller indie companies with ethical practices and ingredients, I do what I can).  


The whole sentiment of this post is just drawing false exaggerated conclusions that don't even apply to women, let alone everyone else who do these things.
People have always decorated themselves and I don’t see why they’d stop just because a certain exploitative economic system would hurry up and fall. It would be nice keep on enjoying it even if I had to make a little kohl and something with a darker red and something that evened out skin for no other reason than the enjoyment of it.
I stopped shaving 6 years ago and identified as cis. I didn't have an issue dating, infact the attractiveness of the men I dated went up exponentially. Nobody needs to shave if you don't want to and society will get over it eventually.
I just noticed that my answer there can actually also fit as gender parallel ... and I stand by it =):
I never really liked make up, but worse I had a ""not like other girls phase"". I had to learn that it's not the likes or dislikes, the way that people like to dress or present themselves that I hated but how they hurt me, how they made fun of me and how they actively caused me harm. I once hated people who wore make up. I thought they were superficial, putting on an act and only pretended to like it through social pressure and while that can be true for someone, I'm not a mind reader so shouldn't have made such bad faith assumptions.

So my take is this: Make up is a form of expression, some like it some don't and there are many styles same as clothes. 

The key words here are: like, choice and freedom.

 A person has to decide if that's something they like. Same as an odd hobby the person might not know if they like it before trying or getting good at it which leads to the...

...choice that there exist options to choose from that are available to that person to find what they like but include...

...the freedom to wear and like and to not wear and dislike make up. There shouldn't be shaming and hate in either direction. No discuss towards those who don't cover up skin flaws and no bad mouthing and looking down on those who like to wear lots and special make up.

It's face paint and part of someone's aesthetic and style and same as I had to learn not to assume someone was an awful superficial person because they looked like people I made bad experiences with, the same we have to acknowledge that it isn't the make up we have an issue with, but we have an issue with publicly shaming, hurting or harassing those who personally don't like it. We dislike that behavior and not a product someone else might like and can bring true joy.

The line gets blurry around it when you aren't sure you personally like it but you like not being harassed or even getting compliments but that is something every person has to question, explore and discover on their own as no one else can help with that. 

What we can do and should aim at as a collective and/or society is provide that space to figure that out. The key points of freedom that provides a honest choice are in a collective hand.
I still would. Not because I am trans but my but of the tisum' makes it to where if I wear pants with leg hair it hurts and not having jeans on feels wrong
I think it’s okay to acknowledge that society has a role in our choices and find our individual paths of healing. I don’t wear makeup or shave because it has a bad connection to womanhood for me but really care about my skin and feel devastated about acne from my own aesthetic preference. I feel like terfs talk about dismantling the system but have never given logistics on how that could be done practically and without harming trans people. As individuals most people are doing the best they can to cope.
I very much enjoyed freeing myself from those things as part of coming into my nonbinary identity, but I'd never suggest that anyone was doing anything wrong by harmlessly affirming their gender in any way that feels good to them. 

If you want to wear makeup and/or shave for yourself, then by all means, you should.
I already tend not to shave or use makeup, but sometimes I do it for me specifically.  Mostly with the makeup because I like art and it’s like art but on my face-
Both practices are ancient.
i kind of agree a little bit but people should be allowed to do these things if they want to
I would continue to do both - my body hair isn't soft at all, so i genuinely can't go without shaving without skin irritation or hair splinters. And makeup is a choice for me anyway and yet I still do it.
Nearly three years ago now, I stopped shaving my legs. Everyone around me, minus a few friends, treated it like I was doing something radical.

Like I wasn't taking care of myself, all because I didn't shave my legs.

The truth is, I just don't care about shaving that much- and I love the gender euphoria of seeing hair on my body! 

Still, I'm told that I HAVE to shave- that it's ""not right for girls to have hairy legs"". Of course, when pressed why, they have no real answers just ""well. Just because!"" 

Fuck the beauty industry.
If nobody else did it, I’d still wear my eye-shadow, my eyeliner, my oversized cardigan, hair ties, my baggy pants, and my nail polish. I currently do it DESPITE societal expectations
Meeeeeeh...

The desire to chance one's own body and beautify oneself is much older than capitaliam.

And not exclusive to one end of the gender spectrum. It was unacceptable for men of a higher social class to appear unshaven in public, or even at dinner at home, in Regency England. Today, it's still hair. Razors, trimmers, hair loss treatment, there are entire parts of the industry that cater to the masc end.
Nah these industries wouldn’t go outta business, tf? Cosmetic clothing industries wouldn’t go out, people still like to look nice, just cuz not everyone wants to doesn’t mean e v e r y o n e doesn’t. Diet and gym industries wouldn’t, people still want to be healthy, and those two are both crucial in doing that for most people. People like and feel empowered by different things. Personally idc what anyone else is doing, I’m stickin to my own thing, which is looking the way I want and feeling the way I want, and everyone else should do the same. How people achieve these things is just different for everyone.
It started like that but now it's a comfort thing. I like makeup because I feel it's fun and I don't wear it when I don't want to. Shaving is a comfort thing, I can let my legs go but I need to shave my underarms for my own physical comfort not social comfort
I shave rarely and haven't worn makeup since high school, I don't even when others do
Bottom line there’s no reason to ever take away choices. Socially forcing people to take a specific choice, like expecting women to wear makeup, takes away choice.
I don’t know who “our” is but I don’t like it much. I’d still wear makeup and everything because it makes me feel nice.
Well if you want to get technical if no  one did it the items wouldn't exist anymore... Just sayin
I kind of agree. Does the pressure for feminine presenting ppl to do these things exist? Yes. Do I enjoy doing them? Yes
I personally don't think things would change so much that those corporations end up going out of business, seeing as there are a lot of folks who know they aren't ugly without these products, but like the way they look with it. I worry that that change would motivate some people to bully others into assimilating with the new status quo. I mean, that already happens in some situations. When I bought Hogwarts Legacy despite being nonbinary and disgusted by Rowling, I knew that I was alienating myself from the rest of the trans community, as I had already seen happen when I refused to force myself to hate something that helped me live to turn 22 just because the creator is a terrible woman, but the vicious things people have said shocks me. While I find Rowling repugnant, that does not change my feelings about the Harry Potter series. Separate the work from the creator. That is how I view it.
I get the problematic elements of the makeup and clothing industries but keeping yourself fit, at a basic level, is just a way to stay healthy and avoid problems that affect your quality of life.
Here is the thing the second post saying capitalism is depending on women hating themselves is somewhat correct some industries that prey on people would collapse, however, some people love their bodies and use it as a form of expression as other have said so I kinda see where this post is coming from but not exactly
The clothing industry? Are we all meant to walk around naked or?? 🤔
Sometimes I like to feel pretty
I'd still shave
I don't know, fitness is really important to me and I by no means hate my body. I'm happier now that I'm more fit. I feel pretty much the same about all of these things, I would hesitate to say all of this or even necessarily any of it is contingent upon women hating themselves. Seems like an oversimplified analysis
I wish more people would see this kind of take with a bit more nuance. I personally believe that, if it weren’t expected of AFAB people to look a certain way, makeup and shaving (at least as they’re practiced now) would be significantly less common. That being said, I have no issue with people choosing to partake in these types of regiments as a form of self expression. 
You can be all for individual expression and personal choice while still acknowledging that your choices don’t exist in a vacuum. It’s much more complicated than “beauty routine bad” or “beauty routine good”.
At this stage I would shave my legs because I like the feeling afterward. I've gone unshaved and shaved. Makeup I don't know. I also feel like if no one wore it it would t exist.
Do what makes you happy
I never cared enough about my appearance (except for my hair) to use makeup in the first place.
I'd still do as self expression. Unfortunately my lips and eyelids aren't black and gothic naturally nor can I change the pattern of my skin to include spider webs and upside down crosses and Eyes of Ra/Horus. I don't shave my legs all that often anyway either so nothing would change for me there.
I currently do neither, so no. I will say I up on makeup rarely if I'm feeling it though.
Shaved legs feel really nice.  I would continue to do so.
I shave for myself, not cause others do it
Yes... I don't wear makeup to hide myself. I wear makeup because of esthetics. I don't even wear makeup most of the time. Mostly just because I don't feel like putting effort into it when I'm just home alone. 

And shaving the same story. Like no one tells me to shave. I also don't shave because I feel ugly with hair, but more because I like it esthetically if I'm shaved
Yes I would shave because I'm happier that way and feel cleaner, I have never wore makeup so idk
yes i'd still wear makeup. i don't wear makeup because of insecurities. i do it because i like it and use it as a creative outlet.
I don't shave my legs or wear makeup, but I stopped doing it before I stopped thinking of myself as a girl. I think my take at the time was that it was bullshit that I was expected to do certain things or not do certain things because of my gender and that anybody who was going to tell me that I had to could go jump in a lake. I feel sad for and confused by people who seem unhappy about these things and yet still required to do them. (If they are actually required to do them, then I just feel sad, not confused.) If someone is happy to do these things, then that is great, right? Because it is good that they are happy.
I already don’t wear make up so obviously not; I don’t know if I’d shave or not if no one else did, tho.
... i dress very goth i already do what not many ppl in my area do lmao, I do it cuz its fun (and shave cuz i HAAAATE how hair feels on me it's not a pressure thing for me personally)
Shaving? No.
Since coming out I stopped shaving my legs and armpits. It makes me feel masc and I honestly only did it in the past because I was trying to force myself to feel cis.

Makeup? Yup!
Even on my more masc days, I wear makeup. I've never worn a ton, but having blonde eyelashes makes me appreciate mascara.
Personally, I don't care either way if anybody shaves or wears makeup or doesn't. I don't usually bother shaving but sometimes I will randomly because I felt like it and when I do wear makeup it's because I just felt like it and I wanna put on excessive amounts of black eyeliner lmao most of the time I'm not even seeing anybody or going anywhere when I put on makeup, but if I am it's because I thought it would look cool with whatever outfit
I think this is mostly to an AFAB audience but personally I'd do anything that could defy society's norms lmao
I hate foundation but I want to just do weird shit with eye shadow.  Eye shadow can be soooo much fun and you can get real creative.  I would just wear weird shit every day.
I absolutely know people who would. They would have less worry around it. But a lot of people genuinely like wearing makeup and having less body hair.
“If nobody else did/wore it, would you?” 

If nobody else did it, it would be pretty hard to find resources to do it. Many paper and canvas paints are toxic to wear on the skin or ingest which makes them unsuitable for use as makeup or body paint, for example. But I wouldn’t doubt that there are still people who would go to the effort of reinventing the products needed for it just because they want to. And if I had ease if access to them, and felt like it, then yes. I would.
Yass queen 😚
I was told around the time my legs were getting hairy that I should shave. My mum even bought me an electric one for Christmas one year. I never understood why I needed to shave my legs, but I did it anyway, so my mum wouldn't bug me on it. A year ago, I even did laser hair removal, about 4 treatments. Then, when I opened up to my mum, she stopped bugging me about shaving.
So now I've stopped shaving and I'm freeee!!! Hairy legs, baby! 
Though people look at me seeing me as a woman, then just a human.
as long as it won't hurt anyone
I only shave due to societal expectations. I do not wear makeup. Other people should feel free to do what they want.
I think it is absolutely something to consider for yourself if the things that are seen as obligatory gendered activities you're being asked to do feel right to you, but the other commenter in the post is only partially right. It would be entirely revolutionary to the beauty industry if women loved themselves, but to conflate that to nobody at all wanting to wear makeup or shave isn't fully true. Some people genuinely like it and there's nothing wrong with it, just be as low-waste as you can while enjoying the medium to the maximum extent you wish to pursue.
I stopped shaving my legs a year and a half ago, and I’m never going back 😂 far too much effort, and my skin always hated it anyway. 

I would probably still wear makeup! I’ve finally gotten to a point where I only wear it when I actually want to, it’s a fun art form for me!
I don't wear make-up to necessarily be pretty, and DEFINITELY not to fit in. I wear it to look more masculine and elf-like and to express myself, aka look like a walking candy store. I could not care less if others don't find it pretty. Shaving probably wouldn't give me dysphoria anymore, but it still irritates my skin. So I would continue to not shave.
Makeup is art to me and I stopped shaving my body like 3 years ago and I only shave my face cus I like how my jaw looks when I kinda contour with hair
No and no.
At this point in the game it's not the insecurity of \_just\_ women lmao
I shave because I love the feeling of clean shaven skin. Idgaf if you shave or not. I love feeling my own skin smooth.

I would also wear makeup. I love the freedom of expression and I enjoy putting it on. However I'd only wear it for me. Not to impress someone else.
Make-up is a form of self-expression, and I just don't see ever giving it up. I match my eyebrows and eyeshadow to the different colors in my hair for example. I don't do it because others are, and I feel like that is possibly true for the majority of people who wear make-up. We just like it for ourselves. 

As far as shaving, sometimes I don't mind the hair and other times I need to be hair-free. It is a personal choice. When I was younger, I was made to believe I had to be hair-free otherwise that meant I was dirty, and it took me a long time to realize that was not true and was just others' expectations and their own insecurities projected onto me. 

I agree that societal views as well as the beauty industry (and others listed in the pic) do contribute to people believing they have to do these things to look presentable and that is something we have to, as a society, overcome but that does not mean that if we participate in these thigs that we hate ourselves or that we are doing it for others and not solely ourselves.

This was a really longwinded way of me to say that we are all different and our reasons are our own but societal expectations may play some part but are not the end-all-be-all of our choices.
I don’t wear makeup to follow social norms or be beautiful I wear makeup to look like a sexy ghoul
I already only do either when I feel like it, so yeah, when I felt like it lol 🤷‍♂️ I haven't given a damn about what the general public thinks about my appearance since I was single digits, I think.
I weat makeup once every couple months, usually only at home, and then it's creative stuff. Recently I made myself cheetah ""tears""

About shaving, I'd still shave my armpits because they get itchy with long hair and with the private parts I'd still trim them as well because it's simply uncomfortable. Not sure I'd shave my legs though. I do it in summer but if it wasn't an expectation I probably wouldn't
I don’t shave because it gives me allergies, and I wear makeup, because I like to look cute, I really don’t care what everyone else has to say or not about it, even if it stops being normal, I’ll probably stick to wearing it as usual tbh
Idk I don't use makeup. I'd maybe feel better about my hairy legs if other fem people had them but I never notice them to begin with so idrc
Absolutely i would
I already don't do either, so can't really comment.
I think I'd still use makeup because i love it, it's a great form of artistic self-expression and i love every method and skill you can use from it.
i don't shave my legs partially due to laziness LMAO

i don't use makeup, but i definitely would still continue skincare mainly because acne is a goddamn pain in the ass
You could say the same about literally any product tho
I really couldn't care less what other people do with their body hair, I had partners who have much body hair and don't shave it and it didn't bother me at all. Me on the other hand, I just like shaving off body hair because I feel better without it, not because there's a beauty ideal (plus I'm AMAB and most people don't know I'm NB, even though I'm not making an effort to hide it lol). 

For makeup, I rarely wear it, when I do it's nail polish (which I usually wear for a few weeks because idc if it gets scraped off), fake freckles/moles or very rarely black lipstick that I only put on my upper lip.

For me, shaving and makeup are means to express myself and my identity, not portraying any kind of gender standard or whatever.
U do u boo, capitalism shouldn’t get in the way of your fun and or euphoria, just never mind other people and do you
The feeling of touching waxed legs is heavenly. I would still do it
I would probably use makeup if i knew how to actually

AND paint my nails  
and my mood just get a lot better when I shave my legs  
those things are all ways to body expression and I think nobody should neither be forced to do them by society nor forced NOT to do them
I would and do, not much make up as I suck at it but not the point.
I would probably do both
Yes, all body hair is gross 😡 and who doesn't wanna be MOAR pretty? 😅😂
No to both. I don't do either
I always felt the need to shave and would feel embarrassed when I didn’t. One day I just decided not to shave in order to get over my “fear” of being seen with body hair. I haven’t shaved since and I honestly feel so much more comfortable with my body the way it was intended to be
And I thought TERFs couldn't get any more cringe
I literally refuse to wear makeup if im expected to do the no makeup makeup like why bother
I'm gonna start calling it ""natural polite makeup"", it's so spot on I love it! Pretty much my entire makeup collection is wild colors, the softest ones I own are more for blending out or creating a base rather than wearing it alone. If I'm spending any money on makeup, it better be so it shows up (aside from foundation/concealer) or else I feel it's a waste of money
Ok but like imagine how fucking fun it would be if that were normalized in society.  Maybe not as in wearing it to work because that would get inconvenient after a while, but imagine going out in the evening and everyone is all done up with all sorts of cool makeup.  Everyone putting in effort and having their own style.  Maybe not everyone would enjoy that, so even if it were just specific places that would be cool.  Not expected but accepted.
Yeah! I love doing great big winged eyeliner much more than ""a touch of foundation to smooth out my skin texture."" I basically never do the latter.
Wow, thanks for doing the research here.  I’m totally down to delete the post if you think the author’s background is significantly problematic (I don’t have tumblr or Twitter or whatever they’re on)
God Dame it, every fricking time! Of course it's a terf,
Every time I think it seeing something nice it's either a terf or a neo Nazi 😞
This is so beautiful and I’m glad to have read your balanced perspectives.  You and your wife sound awesome!
This is such a well rounded take! Thanks for sharing
as an AMAB enby I think I understand where she is coming from. Gender expression standards are not comfortable to everyone of that AGAB. I feel relieved to not have to adhere to some gender standards for my AGAB. However, cosmetics is something I actively choose, against the societal shunning of AMAB people who do

not every cis woman likes makeup, but they are expected to. Non-femme presenting people are not expected to, so we get a choice in the matter so to speak

one of the earlier signs of me being enby was my disdain for traditionally masc ways of presentation, and I felt very relieved when I understood that I can just give the middle finger to the patriarchy
Agreed. I just like how I look with eyeliner, doesn’t necessarily mean I’m insecure about how my face looks, it’s like a cherry on top.
Makeup has been around since at least Egyptian pharaoh times. And historically, it was worn more by men in many other cultures. 

I wear it for basically the same reasons you do. It’s an accent to my features (not a cover) and a part of my outfit or look.
It's also been around for a long time in diffrent context. Like cultural or symbolic.
Yeah makeup for me atm is having crosses instead of eyebrows (those suckas shaved right off) massive winged eyeliner and blusher on the tip of my nose so I look like I have a cold 😂😂 so yeah defo ain't in my book to look like a ""pretty girl"" 😂
I've heard of a woman who's husband literally has never seen her with out make up,
She would make up at like 5 I the morning everyday to put on her makeup before her husband's awake.

She's not doing this for her at this point :/
If you feel my drift
Yeah I agree! I do both but I do it for me not for others. I don't do makeup often but when I do I really do it so that I feel pretty and good. My husband actually perfers me without it!.
Sensory issues are driving the bus for me.  I can’t stand the way makeup feels on my face, so I don’t wear any.  I like the feeling of shaving my legs and don’t like the feeling of pants touching leg hair, so I shave.
I didn’t get that assumption at all. That may be what some people think but it’s not necessary to hold this viewpoint. 

I absolutely agree with some of the critiques of this message and how it’s being presented, but it also resonated with me very deeply. I grew up doing all this stuff, with my predominant motivation being fear of being judged if I didn’t. I thought I HAD to wear makeup and shave. It was incredibly liberating to realise that I don’t have to do shit! It was a societal expectation, but not one that had to be met. I felt fine doing all of that, but I realised I actually felt better by giving myself the time back in my life

Anyway I guess my point is that self-hatred didn’t feature in my thinking at all, so it really surprised me to hear you say that
I know that there are people who wear makeup because they feel they are ugly and they have to. The perpetuation that women have to wear makeup to look presentable is real. BUT makeup has been around long before capitalism and has not always been a gendered issue. Makeup can, has been and should be reframed as a form of self expression and a form of art. No one should feel they have to wear makeup. It should be enjoyable and plenty of people do find it enjoyable.
Well, it does take an absurd / disproportionate amount of time and resources.  So we must be crazy if we do it ;)
you're right, plenty of women wake up one day and decide that, out of nowhere, with absolutely no patriarchal or misogynistic influence, ""i want to look like a prepubescent girl""
Don't think, be certain. It is super shaky and problematic vision. Those are the same people who implies that transmascs are self-hating women and that gender dysphoria don't exist
Yeah I can see that OOP is giving really TERFy vibes in their commenting.  You all here helped me learn to look out for and call that out.  :)
Never heard the term neovagina before. Sounds so cyberpunk
Thank you for this! Something about this analysis came off as TERFy to me
[deleted]
It’s interesting that this argument re: “shaved legs feel good” is flipped for AMAB people.  Before I started questioning - I wasn’t even given the choice to shave my legs.

Which begs the question - does it really feel good or is it mostly social conditioning?  (I don’t have enough hair to really feel the difference). If it was objectively good, wouldn’t men catch on?

Edit: the answer is usually patriarchy
Yeah, I don't like how the original message felt like it was shaming people who choose to shave or wear makeup. I'm AFAB and I definitely do feel societal pressure to do those things (especially shaving).
Yeah, it’s also way oversimplifying and passing multiple issues off onto cis women. 

If we interpret it as, the only reason for makeup is to become more attractive - it’s been studied objectively that attractive people make more money and are happier, and it is especially true for women. This post also smells of alpha-males-want-natural-women.

What I am really concerned about is the pollution aspect of the make-up industry.
It’s true that that’s a thing it is, but it’s also other things too
I love this haha.  You’re totally right - I am glad I learned so much from the community here.

It’s funny you call out r/im14andthisisdeep because I feel 14 as far as exploration of gender expression goes… 😂
Interesting point - there was another person who explained the social aspect of it well.  I just find it interesting because what is gender affirming is obviously defined by society - so yeah, you’re right.
Now that you point it out I can totally see it.

I will admit to thinking this way due to my own internal transphobia but everyone here helped me understand the situation better and I feel more prepared for my transfemme journey.
But would you want to shave your legs if leg shaving was never a thing?
The OP telling women in the comments that they're wrong if they shave or vice versa is definitely misogyny. And all the trans comments are down voted. I get bad vibes from that space.
Lol yeah!  When you’re GNC your very existence is political to some, even if you don’t do or say anything.
This is a really good take.  I realize as my income grows that there’s very little reason to change my lifestyle - because I’m just moving money into things that don’t really matter.  Now I’m focusing on what makes me happy :)
You dropped your /s
no problem! personally i don't care whether the post is left up or not (original is from tumblr). it's not like we're promoting them or anything. it's important to be able to recognize TERF dogwhistles, as they're often more subtle than outright transphobia. all-or-nothing condemnation of makeup and shaving is often one of them -- and i don't mean personally choosing not to partake in them, but rather saying that the entire industry is evil and that there's no valid reason for a woman (or anyone else) to shave or wear makeup.
Leave it up! We can all learn in the comments!
Nothing wrong with showing problematic people. Just give context is all, and this comment section is great context.
Absolutely true! I'm Eastern Cherokee. and masc presenting people in my tribe wore way more makeup, accessories, and fancy flashy clothing than the fem presenting peeps. AND they plucked all their body hair - it was a right of passage. Plus piercings and tattoos were the norm for everyone. So, I try to live by THOSE standards. The more piercings, tattoos, cool makeup, outlandish accessories, and bright colors...the better. If anyone says shit I just wave my hands around like an idiot and let them know my ancestors have now cursed them and their entire future line.
AMAB here, I don't ware makeup cuz I'm scared I'll get the shit beat out'a me for it 🙂

I want too tho :/
Sounds like banger makeup tbh.
Well, yeah, but that doesn’t apply to everyone is what I’m saying.
I agree. I'm Autistic, and I have sensory issues with foundation and mascara. I can't stand it (but eye-liner is fine, apparently? 🤷‍♀️).  I love the sensation of soft, smooth, heavy, and tight things. The action of shaving my legs and underarms has structure and routine, so it's soothing, and I absolutely LOVE rubbing my smooth legs together after I hop into fresh sheets when I go to bed.
Hey you know what you’re right! I didnt think about how my socialization probably affects my relationship to these activities. I can see your point that these things could be compulsory for some people, and that sounds horrible. 

I think both of these things can be true at the same time, and I think that what we’re both saying is that people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies. I appreciate your perspective a lot.
I think there’s a solid argument though that on the contrary it’s self-love. It can be about engaging with your body and having agency, rather than frantically hiding your imperfections.
No more crazy than men who shave or use make up, or nbs who do
I’m not sure I understand what you’re saying.
It does doesn't it? I like it, im taking control of my body and making it my own.
How? Do tell, person that refers to Blaire White, a trans woman, as ""he.""
I personally think it feels nicer to have smooth legs, but I've just decided it's not worth it. I nick myself too much, it takes a lot of time, and I get so many little red bumps from it anyways. I definitely think more men would at least consider shaving their legs for the sensory feel of it if there wasn't a stigma going against them.
I didn't say what I was assigned at birth in my comment.
I’m amab and I shave my legs bc it feels good 🤷‍♀️. I also wear makeup for fun sometimes. I think if the pressure was taken off of women to do these things some women would and some wouldn’t. Likewise if men didn’t feel insecure about doing these things more men would.
I know cisgender men who shave for swimming or biking and really like the way it feels. I personally like the way my unshaved legs feel.
A good rule of thumb is to be wary of anyone saying all women everywhere have it the same (especially if they act as though women are universally reviled and the lowest social class): either they’re ignorant or actively misleading you. Furthermore, anyone who uses terms like “the west” to make sweeping generalizations about an entire hemisphere of the earth is typically going to have a bad take on things.
what a stupid question lmfao
How Should I Know? Looking Into A Different Reality And Seizing My Thought Process From Within It Is Unfortunately Not Within The Purview Of My Abilities. 

Although Considering There Are Actual Advantages Of Shaving Leg Hair (For Example It Decreases Drag While Swimming, Not Useful For Everyone Obviously But It Is For Professional Swimmers), And We Have Records Of It Being Done As Far Back As Roman Times, It Seems Unlikely Such A World Could Exist Unless Human Biology (Or The Laws Of Physics) Is Notably Different, Or Human Culture Is *Unimaginably* Different.
toxic for sure
I didn’t know that’s a TERF thing to condemn but also to still partake.  Seems hypocritical…

Admittedly the reason why I bring this up is likely my own internal transphobia (and getting cold feet for starting HRT).  The doubt here is whether I’ve falsely attributed gender identity and gender presentation.  The best sub to discuss this is most likely this one.

That being said, the whole narrative of “we only do this because society tells us to” is something that resonates with me because I’ve applied that thinking to masculinity and learned to reject the parts of my AMAB upbringing I don’t like.  For that reason I’m still continuing on my transfemme journey.
So, I heeeeavily disagree with your dogwhistle accusation here. These are common standing points of second generation feminists, a subset of them are Transphobe, a bigger subset is queer critical, but to say they are all terfs is like condemning the evolution of feminism in itself.
That’s awesome. This will be my new response to assholes 😁
Aww that sucks. I wish I could beat a MF for you.  Come to Denver. It’s pretty free. You can wear what you want.
Yea of course! I guess it's kinda like the pro choice vs pro life debate, like you can have pro choice people who would never abort a baby y'know?
yes!!! the grasshopper rub! you get it 😩
Honestly That Makes A Lot Of Sense. If I Love Myself, Why Would I Let Myself Keep Living In A Body I Don't Love, When I Could Easily Make It Better?
as in, no one does that.
[deleted]
I was referring how your statement “I like the feeling of hairless skin” is flipped for people who underwent AMAB socialization (as in: “you *should not* want/like the feeling of hairless skin”).  Wasn’t making any assumptions about your AGAB.
Would you mind please explaining why this is a stupid question?
I wasn’t really looking for an answer, it was just something to provoke thought.

But presumably you don’t shave your legs to reduce drag or because the Romans did it?

EDIT

I’m sorry for being so flippant, I just couldn’t resist.
sorry i don't think i explained the TERF viewpoint very well -- generally, they believe that makeup/cosmetics industries are predatory and immoral (this part is true) AND that anyone who chooses to wear makeup or shave their legs is only doing it for the male gaze, even if they say it's for their own pleasure. again this isn't exclusively a TERF viewpoint, but it's enough a red flag that i want to investigate where they're coming from, hence me searching the usernames from this post.

i definitely agree that there's an element of societal pressure when it comes to makeup and other 'feminine' actions. it's important to be aware of that, but it's also important to understand that many people want to look and feel nice just for themselves. 

good luck on your journey! it's awesome that you're still questioning and learning about gender stuff, it's endlessly fascinating.
I think people like this tend to underestimate the value and meaning of what society “tells” us to do. Humans are a social species. The things we do often have a social meaning, and often *only* a social meaning. They’re symbols that communicate messages. We can critique the hierarchical power structures that create and manipulate meaning, but the argument that “you wouldn’t do it if others didn’t do it, therefore you’re being forced to do it” is such a… vapid argument. Obviously we wouldn’t do things with social meaning if others didn’t do them, because they would have no meaning. It’d be like claiming that you wouldn’t speak a language if no one else did. Like… yeah, no kidding. Why would I speak a language that no one else speaks? It would literally have no meaning.

We can critique the capitalistic manipulation of human behaviour without resorting to some weird essentialist conception of semiotics.
Dog whistles _inherently_ have innocuous origins or they wouldn’t be dog whistles. 

_Trans Exclusionary_ Radical Feminists do indeed tend to be second wave (so, radical and not liberal) and therefore they _use_ those common standing points in part to signal to others who have their beliefs. 

A dog whistle is a red flag, not a stop sign. It can genuinely mean nothing. If you’re offended by people being cautioned to double check for their own safety I can’t say I agree.

On top of that… People who are still radical feminists specifically without pulling in elements of third and fourth wave feminism tend to believe lots of stuff people don’t necessarily agree with, trans exclusionary or no. I would still avoid some of them. 

Hence the other two waves. The amount of critiques of prior process since the seventies is high, high enough to often inspire libraries by other later wave feminists’ writings. No harm in proceeding with an eye out.
Define ""queer critical"". Come on.
Is Denver better then Ontario QwQ

To be fair I haven't experienced any problems yet, tho I really don't put myself out there that much, maybe I just scare myself with the news lol
Exactly!
I think there are two things happening simultaneously here possibly. One is that I feel like doing these things is really liberating and feels freeing and like a marvelous and wonderful way for me to engage with my body, and also that it’s taboo and there’s a lot of shame wrapped up with it I have to grapple with, due to the way I was socialized and the ways I was required to interact with my body as I developed that relationship. 

The other is that people socialized differently from me feel that these ways of engaging with their bodies are actually compulsory and oppressive, and that the reasoning behind that is patriarchal. 

I think those are maybe different perspectives on the same thing, which is binary gendered conditioning in our relationships to our bodies. I hope there is room for both of those things at the same time, because it should be that we can engage with our bodies differently and that’s ok. And its also totally unacceptable and oppressive that these activities are compulsory for some people, in spite of the fact that its oppressive. What do you think about that?
Thank you! She's a total badass I agree.

And blocked.
because leg shaving exists ?
>I wasn’t really looking for an answer, it was just something to provoke thought.

If You Ask Me, Asking A Question But Not Expecting An Answer Is Often Quite Silly. Although Of Course You Didn't Ask Me, And Perhaps Giving An Answer When Not Asked A Question Is Equally Silly.

>But presumably you don’t shave your legs to reduce drag or because the Romans did it?

~~Actually I Don't Shave My Legs At All, I Neither Have A Razor Nor Know How To Use One, But If I Did I Probably Would.~~  
Well Yes, I Was Just Giving Those As Examples, Reducing Drag Isn't The Only Practical Benefit, And I'd Bet Other Ancient Cultures Perhaps Even Those Before The Romans Did It As Well. The Reason I'd Do It However Is Quite Simply That I Do Not Like My Leg Hair. I Do Not Think It Looks Good, I Do Not Find It Comfortable, And I Do Not Consider It To Have Any Practical Use For Me.
I feel like shaving is nice because it makes tall socks more comfortable, and soft clothes feel really good. Also, convenient things like sports bras feel a bit nicer when shaven. Many people wont care about any of these factors, which is perfectly fair. 

The thing about attracting guys is funny, because the sort that may care about such things is also a sort that I would prefer to avoid.
on the other hand, just because society expects something doesn't automatically mean that thing is bad or you're being coerced. some things are just neutral.

besides, human beings are social creatures by nature. wanting to be accepted by society isn't wrong, it's a fundamental drive for almost everybody! presentation is a big part of how we built social rapport.
Okay I see your point, and sure I agree, buuuut- what I mean when I say ""society is forceing us to do something"" or something along those lines I'm talking about the endless advertisements you see, those actors are not real people, they do it because they are told to, and we do it too because the messageing of the ad makes it seem like we're dirty or gross or something like that if we don't,
Just think about like carrying a handbag or wareing skirts vs pants. I'm pritty sure most AFAB people would rather not need to carry easily stolen external storage and rather just keep everything in there (""male"") pants. But they don't because it's ""wierd"" so says the purse industry.

I just think if there wasn't so much society pressure from thinks like ads and such people would do thinks because they want to and enjoy to and not because they're scared of a social crucifixion.
Love this.
essentialism is a hallmark of neurotypicals though. they have to reduce absolutely everything down to absolutely nothing. if anything makes them feel small or different it should be destroyed instead of understood correctly.
thanks for expressing this much more articulately than I could have
I’m not sure if it’s better than Ontario (I haven’t been there yet). I’m also in a pretty queer friendly neighborhood/area, so maybe I’m not getting a full picture. 

There are a lot of problems with high rents, homelessness and petty crime. Other than that (lol), you can freely wear whatever you want and not be bothered (for that reason at least).
:D
It was a hypothetical question. I thought it was obvious, but I guess maybe I should have outright stated it for the benefit of people who didn’t get that.

I asked it in order to to encourage people to consider the question from a new perspective.

I don’t see how this is stupid.
You have an extremely narrow conception of what a question can be if you believe that they are only a tool for eliciting information.

Sometimes the answers a question can produce widen our vision beyond the narrowness of a problematic perception.

Maybe asking someone who has been through some really tough times about the main things they learned from the experiences will help widen their frame of reference and imply that perhaps it wasn’t all wasted time. You aren’t asking the question to accept find out what that person has learned. 

I don’t think this is silly.
i understand where ur coming from. i just don’t know how it helps to imagine a world without it since we’re already here... it felt like you were coming for the commenter above you for sharing their experiences with it and kinda invalidating them
I Never Said Asking A Question For A Reason Other Than To Elicit Information Is Silly, Simply That Asking A Question Without Expecting An Answer Is Silly. Heck You Even Mentioned Answers Here. Even If The Answer Isn't Expected For The Person Asking, Or From The Person Asked, It'd Usually Be Expected.

 If Your Desire With The Question Was For Me To Think About It And Come Up With A Reason For Myself, That's Still An Answer To The Question, Perhaps Simply To Myself But An Answer Nonetheless, And You're Still Expecting It Regardless Of Whether I Share It With You Or Not. And If I'm Going To Come Up With An Answer Anyway, Why Shouldn't I Share It? With Humans Being A: Social Creatures And B: Not Perfectly Intelligent, I Believe More Interesting And Useful Thinking Can Be Done When Multiple People Engage In It Together Rather Than Just One Person Alone.
It’s helpful because it makes you think. It  might possibly make you reconsider you opinions and beliefs on a subject. Maybe I’ve just had too much therapy over the years, but this questioning and self reflection is so useful. The concept on *not* questioning your beliefs and opinions seems utterly alien to me. 

What do I associate shaving my legs with?

Why do I think this? 

Where did I pick this opinion from?

….are examples just off of the top of my head.
So first off is there a reason that all the words in your posts begin with capital letters? It’s very uncomfortable to read.

I wasn’t *expecting* an an answer because people often ignore what they don’t want to hear, especially on social media platforms. But I wasn’t offended to receive an answer. You’re misunderstood my point. 

I agree that useful thinking can be done when multiple people engage together. But I don’t believe your dismissive reply of “how should I know……etc” really furthers any kind of deeper understanding.
lol dude. i’m a deeply introspective person as well, and i love to consider these things for myself. i appreciate that you’re assuming you’re much more knowledgeable and profound a person than me. or that you’ve attended more therapy.. it’s not a competition. i have existential ocd, so trust me when i say i understand thinking about things all day long. again i feel the tone of your comment was the issue. as if the poster hadn’t considered that before
>So first off is there a reason that all the words in your posts begin with capital letters? It’s very uncomfortable to read.

Apologies, I'll refrain from doing it in this reply. Not really a reason, To my knowledge, Just a thing I do. 

>I wasn’t *expecting* an an answer because people often ignore what they don’t want to hear, especially on social media platforms. But I wasn’t offended to receive an answer. You’re misunderstood my point.

That's Fair, I guess that is on me then. Not sure why someone wouldn't want to hear a simple question like that though. 

>I agree that useful thinking can be done when multiple people engage together. But I don’t believe your dismissive reply of “how should I know……etc” really furthers any kind of deeper understanding.

That's fair, It wasn't exactly a useful response, I'll agree, Although I suppose what I was saying is, For me, It's not a useful question, By itself atleast. It asks me to ponder something I find effectively impossible to ponder; A world in which nobody ever shaved their legs. While on the surface this is pretty easy to imagine, There'd just be a lot of people with hairy legs, Going deeper, Which I'd need to do in order to determine my own feelings within said world, Brings up other questions I cannot answer, Namely ""*Why* did nobody ever shave their legs in this world?"", And without answering that I cannot give a useful answer to the original question. Perhaps this is just a quirk of how I think, I don't know.

Or perhaps, On a deeper level, I don't know why I want to shave my legs, And that is why I cannot answer. Or I guess I *do* know why, I want to, I don't want to have lots of leg hair, Simple as that, But why I want that, As with why I want basically anything, I cannot answer, As wants are not conscious actions; I cannot choose what I want, I simply want it, In this case at least the want is an intrinsic desire. Did some external stimuli impact my desire for it? Maybe, I don't know, I'm not sure if it would be possible for me to know, As that would require an understanding of my subconscious far greater than I currently have, Not just in the present but also in the past, Possibly the distant past (Which considering my good memory, Or more specifically lack thereof, Would be quite challenging.).

I suppose, To summarise, Yes, I gave a sort of non-answer to your question, But that's all I know how to give, For a number of reasons I simply do not possess the required knowledge to give any deeper or more meaningful answer.
The tone of the comment could not be more neutral.

Maybe the poster had considered it, maybe they had not? They were free to answer in any way they felt fit to. Or not reply at all. 

Also I’m not assuming anything regarding knowledge levels or how profound we are. I don’t know why you would think that I made these assumptions. I was responding to why a hypothetical question might be useful.
Thank you for a very interesting post. I find it fascinating to hear someone’s thought process described in the way that you have just done.

It’s not always easy to imagine a world where things are very different. But it is interesting. And how you consider things can be interesting.

So instead of asking “why *didn’t* people shave their legs, how about asking why *do* people shave their legs? Not shaving is a “natural” state of being after all. 

From a practical point of view I believe the practice really took off when pantyhose/stockings became widely used. That’s probably the reason women (because it started as a female thing) didn’t shave their arm hair (some women do have quite hairy arms).

But then you can look at what shaving legs means on a deeper level. And I mean both in terms of society and you personally. Do hairless legs represent femininity? Youthfulness? Do you even care what society thinks about you?Where does your discomfort with leg hair come from? For all I know it could be an idea picked up in childhood that you haven’t re-examined? Or maybe you have thought about it deeply already. I don’t know because I don’t know you as a person. Maybe you have thought about it deeply for a long time. But your reply might change something inside someone reading the comment. It might even change my opinion. 

My personal view is that body hair isn’t inherently physically uncomfortable. I don’t believe that as a species we would have evolved to have something that causes true physical discomfort. My belief is that the discomfort comes from a psychological perspective. I must add that I have no evidence to back this up, but it is my genuine belief.

But please don’t take that to mean I’m making a judgment on people who want to shave their legs. Just because I believe that issues regarding body hair are a societal issues, I understand the importance of it still. You still have to find your place in the world and be comfortable.
>So instead of asking “why *didn’t* people shave their legs"", how about asking ""why *do* people shave their legs?"" Not shaving is a “natural” state of being after all. 

Well as stated before there are a number of practical reasons (Particularly in sports), I presume shaving your leg hair (and other body hair) could help stay cool in hotter places, Although as I don't live in hotter places I can't say for certain. Either way, It likely started with a decently small number of people doing it for some practical reason or another, And then others saw those people, Thought it looked nice, And, Perhaps not knowing the original reason it was done, Started doing it themselves. While I don't think it was anywhere near as common in the present, There are seemingly ancient examples of people doing it for aesthetic reasons. Although Of course in the present day it's not always done for practical reasons or because someone saw it and thought it looked nice, In the Anglosphere atleast I believe it's common that women are effectively told they need to shave their body hair lest they be ugly and unwomanly, Which of course wouldn't actually be the case. (None of this is from my personal experience by the way, Just second-hand information from like 2-3 people maybe, And more primarily from just reading about it online, So forgive me if I made a mistake.)

>But then you can look at what shaving legs means on a deeper level. And I mean both in terms of society and you personally. 

I mean honestly I'm not sure it really matters for me what it means on a societal level, As I don't feel that really affects me. Personally I don't think I really associate it with anything, I guess I do with femininity a bit, But I don't think that's the reason I want to get rid of mine, Not the full one at least. I mean I don't think leg hair looks bad or anything, Or that there'd be anything wrong with me if I didn't get rid of mine, I guess part of it could be that I think it looks better on me specifically, As I have decently thick leg hair but almost no visible hair on my torso and arms, So it just creates a kinda weird inconsistency, But again I honestly don't know. It's far from the only thing I do or want to do for reasons entirely unknown to me. 

>My personal view is that body hair isn’t inherently physically uncomfortable. I don’t believe that as a species we would have evolved to have something that causes true physical discomfort. My belief is that the discomfort comes from a psychological perspective. 

I'd argue that *all* discomfort is primarily psychological, It's basically your brain going ""Hey I'm not sure it's really healthy for your body to be like this/do this"", Sure in some cases it's actually something that *is* unhealthy, But in many cases it's not, And in either case it's coming from the brain. Although even if we assume that some is physical, I don't think that could rule this out as being an example of that, As human culture and practices evolve far faster than our bodies do, We are *constantly* doing things our bodies didn't evolve to do, Simply because we started doing them before we had time to evolve to do them, And perhaps we'll stop before then too. And who knows, Maybe we *are* in the process of evolving away leg hair, Just rather slowly, I don't know.

I just came out to my parents (the only people left to tell) and they were actually supportive!		"Congratulations!!! That's so pog and I'm so proud!!
Proud of you! Someday... maybe I'll be that brave! Not todayyyyyy
Yay!! Supportive parents are the best! 💖💖
I know this is really odd and I completely understand if you don't want to say but is your name Marbles by chance? You just look exactly like my close friend's sibling and it would be an absolutely crazy coincidence if you had the same name.
it’s such a good feeling! i’m so so glad you’re having this good, shared experience with them, and that they love you unconditionally. lots of love here too!!
Congratulations!! 🎉🎉
Ayyyy
thats awesome!! i hope all continues to go well :)
So glad for you ! That’s so cool !!
Congratulations 🥰
Congrats!
Wat onstuimig van ze ;) 💙
What is “pog”? Second time I read it today! 😀
Honestly, very surprised! I did not expect them to be
My name is not Marbles. However, it’s incredibly close to that name!

My Dad visited the other day an stuck this in my tree. I think he is trying to be supportive.		"Looks like he may be succeeding? :)
Yeah I suspect it too 🤔😅
Can I have your dad for a day?  🥺
Awesome 💞
That’s beautiful! Good for him, and I’m happy for you 🥹
That's so sweet!
So nice
Nah if you have other siblings he’s just trying to remember which one you are. /s
thats so cute!!! <3
Awww! Wholesome dads are the best!!! If I was openly NB my dad would kick me out of the house for sure.

You should tell ur dad you appreciate the gesture.
Love this
Awh! This is super cute
That... is incredible wow
:')
That's so fucking cute I can't even
That’s so sweet😭❤️
My dad does something similar but with rainbows. He’s supportive of me being gay but he doesn’t really acknowledge my gender. But he’ll see like a keychain or something and he like  LOOKS ITS RAINBOW DO YOU WANT IT it’s so cute. I think it’s his way of saying I support you without being outright because he’s ✨emotionally constipated✨
Awwww, that’s so sweet.
HEY CAN I- CAN I HAVE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT FOR ANYTHING? FROM ANYONE BUT ESPECIALLY PARENTS? It’s such a small gesture and yet the nicest thing my father has ever done is said “oh cool” when I was asked what I’m gonna major in in college. I heard people telling him to do that.
non-binatree
That's so nice I love that
This is too wholesome! 💛🤍💜🖤
You better thank him and let him know you appreciate it!! That’s so sweet 🥹
He is. That's so hecking sweet
The way I would bawl my eyes out
🥺🥺💞
i cry 🥹🥹🥹
your dad is so wholesome... I'm not very close to my dad but I would save this flag in the Xmas ornament box and put it up every year because this memory is gonna be so precious, like, forever.
This Is sweet
aw that’s so sweet! good for y’all

That is straight-up adorable. And such classic dad behaviour xD
It's so good to know that u have a supportive parent!!
You are valid as hell and brave and cool. Love, a random internet parent.
❤️❤️ thank you so much, I lost my parents
 pretty early
I'm so sorry to hear that! That must be hard. I hope you still have some good supports in your life. It's hard, but things get better and/or we get better at dealing with all this nonsense

If you ever need a random parental support, feel free to message me. I'm not always quick with responses due to disability, but I'd be happy to be there for you if you need it.
Ok I tried not to but I'm crying tears of relief

These are all so cute! I need that patch.
These are great! I love the designs!
I got that landscape one too, I really love that design. Got it on my backpack with a couple others. I quite like your other ones too.
I'm late to the party, But Lookhuman carries a lot of stuff too if you're into it! (And credits artists)
SHOI-RA
Yeah, for sure! The landscape pin is from JessicaElizabethCo and the She-Ra sword is from TatianasArtShop, both on Etsy. The patch is from Etsy too, from a shop called Ainsyeager. The floral pin probably isn’t available since it was part of a special pre-order from Doki Rosi on Twitter. They have a ton of other great floral art though, and they may open those pins to general sale in the future!
Deff would want to buy a landscape pin. Got a lil firewatch vibe
Oh no, that’s dreadful that they’d say that to you. Well I’m glad you’re here and proud to be who you are!! Sending good non-confirming vibes your way
Me too!
***for the honour of gayskull***
Yes!! My absolute favorite. I have wanted a sword pin for the longest time.
Me too! The creator has a bunch of subtle pride pins that I’ve wanted to get for friends for a while.
Tara! Hi hi hi! And yesssss I love the sword so much. I popped it on one of my favorite hats so I can take all those good good spop vibes with me everywhere.
Thanks! I think mine’s gonna go on one of my hats. But my camping backpack is a good idea too!

Just a quick psa for you peeps		"In support of the english language, but also myself, please use ""neither he nor she"" to refer to me.
Roses are red,  
Violets are blue,  
Singular they  
Predates singular you.

Seriously. Chaucer used singular they in The Canterbury Tales way back in the 1300s, and it was presumably in use for longer that that. Back in those days, ""you"" was actually strictly plural; it was directed at a specific group of people. If you wanted to refer to a single person directly, you'd say ""thou"". Or ""they"", if you were speaking of an individual to someone else.
They are wrong, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains in https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/. Besides the historical usage, use of singular they for non-binary people has become a part of the evolving language. As the article concludes: “Even people who object to singular *they* as a grammatical error use it themselves when they’re not looking, a sure sign that anyone who objects to singular *they* is, if not a fool or an idiot, at least hopelessly out of date.”
When someone says something like that to me, I say something like this and then sit back and wait for the penny to drop…

I know a teacher like that. They never use the correct pronouns and they always say to me, “if I met a person claiming to be non-binary, I’d never be able to use their correct pronouns because they can’t expect me to use ‘they/them’. They would just have to put up with that because they are wrong - ‘they/them’ are not singular pronouns.”
😂 In junior high people called me ""hesh"" from ""he/she"" (because the teachers had objected to their first choice of ""it"") and I knew it was supposed to be bad but couldn't even mind.
such an annoying non-debate
So many teachers are wrong about this. It's fucking pathetic, honestly. It's terribly sad, too, but it's more infuriating than sad. These people shouldn't be teachers. It is forgivable to be grammatically incorrect sometimes, but those who refuse to look into this particular issue and admit fault are bigots who just want a reason to invalidate non-binary people.
Despite the fact that the rules of grammar are presented as if they were as real and rigid as forge-hardened steel, they are merely *conventions*.  For example, one should never end a sentence in a preposition - or so the rule goes.  And yet one can break this rule by saying ""welcome aboard"".  Aboard *what*, though?  That uncertainty is frail logic supporting the rule.  ""Welcome aboard the ship"" removes this uncertainty.  After all, the function of a preposition is to describe the relationship between a noun and some other word or phrase.  And yet this amended sentence still breaks another rule since it lacks a subject.  ""Welcome aboard the ship, Carl"" resolves that difficulty.

But here's the thing:  if Carl is boarding a ship and steward third-class Aspen looks directly at them and jauntily belts out ""welcome aboard!"", Carl isn't going to be confused at all.  The subject and pesky noun that we're supposed to be yoking that to with a preposition are handily handled by context.  If Aspen instead said ""welcome aboard the ship"", it'd feel a little odd.  What the hell else was Carl boarding?  And to tack Carl's name on the end just makes it *weird*.  Supposing that Carl has never met steward third-class Aspen - a fair guess since we have no reason to suspect that Carl is on the crew of a ship large enough to require *multiple tiers* of stewards - Carl is likely to spend at least a few minutes puzzling over how Aspen knew his name.  

Ignoring the oddity of how Aspen knows Carl's name - something that'd likely occupy Carl's mind for at least a few minutes as he makes his way to his room among the thousands of other people boarding the cruise liner - we find that Aspen actually managed to break yet another rule by using more words than were required to get the idea across.    ""Welcome aboard"" conveys the idea with perfect efficiency. 

Using ""he or she"" is a case of spending three words when a single word would do the trick.  The singular form of they is positively *ancient* after all.  What's more, using ""they"" in place of ""he or she"" covers the most common use case of singular they:  when the singular noun-bearer in question is indeterminate.  ""A person boarded a ship and they were warmly greeted by one of its many stewards,"" is a fine example.  But if I rewrite it as ""A person boarded a ship and he or she was warmly greeted by one of its many stewards,"" you'll likely note that it feels *wrong* somehow.  This is likely you stumbling over that oddly complex ""he or she"".  You are likely to do this *even if you don't know about the rule*. 

And that brings us to the wider point.  Singular they, much like plural they, is so common that it is nearly invisible.  There literally isn't a rule that says ""Sara went to the pier where they boarded a ship"" is incorrect.  A great many readers are inclined to argue otherwise.  The reason is simple enough:  Sara is traditionally a feminine name and so we *expect* a feminine pronoun.  *99% of people named Sara* would want you to use a she in that sentence, much like 99% of people named John would prefer that we use he instead.  Most people prefer to use *gendered language*.  Sara being a they isn't against the rules - we've followed all of them to the letter - but it will still tend to sound *wrong* for no other reason than the fact that it is an uncommon use case.

The rules of writing are built from *convention*, usually with the aim of improving clarity.  Convention is just the common-case.  As such it is really no surprise to me that people argue that using they in the singular and specific case breaks a rule because it is *uncommon* - that is to say that it is *unconventional*.  It will sound *wrong* despite being perfectly, precisely correct given that Sara is *agender*.  And so here is the actual important bit:  language exists to communicate ideas, and sometimes that means that you have to use it in *unconventional* ways.
""He or she"" has TWO WHOLE SYLLABLES more than a singular ""they."" I will not stand for this.
Wow, that’s so much more convenient!
In support of the English language I’m going to say that language is fluid and personal and if somebody tells me that I’m supposed to say something a certain way because that’s the way the English language works, as a person with two English degrees I would tell them to fuck off
[deleted]
BA in Linguistics here and can confirm singular they is not new or grammatically incorrect. And even if it was incorrect, that doesn’t mean it always will be. Language has and always will evolve with time. “Correct/incorrect” language is completely arbitrary. The function of language is to convey meaning. If you’re doing that, then you’re using it correctly.
i just found someones wallet on the floor they must have dropped it ill go put it in the lost and found

THEY MUST HAVE DROPPED ITTT 

TTHHHHEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
These stories always take me back to an afternoon when I was in university. I was walking across campus with my linguistics professor when we encountered a group of people savagely beating a prescriptivist. Alarmed, I cried, “Oh my god, we have to help!”. My professor calmly observed the scene for a few moments before concluding, “Nah, six should be enough.”
As an English Lit student… I’m here for all you lot grammatically correcting the incorrect grammar 😂
This is blatantly not true and *so incredibly easy* to disproved it’s ridiculous. But here’s a gem for y’all: thon.

Linked below:
https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/third-person-gender-neutral-pronoun-thon

“Thon is thought to be a contracted form of ""that one,"" and was coined in 1858 by Charles Crozat Converse. An attorney and composer, Converse invented more than words; he submitted a claim in 1863 to Scientific American that he had designed a new sort of mangle (“a machine for ironing laundry by passing it between heated rollers”). Converse is remembered more these days for his linguistic contributions than for his laundering ones.

The initial reason that thon caught on was that one or more of the editors at Funk and Wagnalls took a shine to the word, and around the turn of the 19th and 20th century it was included in their dictionary.

thon. Pronoun of the 3rd person, common gender, meaning “that one, he she, or it”: a neoterism proposed by Charles Crozat Converse, and apparently complying with the neoteristic canons, since it supplies an antecedent blank, obeys a simple and obvious analogy, and is euphonious.
—Funk and Wagnalls, Supplement to A Standard Dictionary of the English Language, 1903

The word remained in various Funk and Wagnalls publications for much of the 20th century, and also saw inclusion in another dictionary, Merriam-Webster’s Second New International Dictionary (1934), although it was defined slightly less fulsomely (“A proposed genderless pronoun of the third person”). The genderless pronoun sense of thon did not last as long in Merriam-Webster’s dictionaries as it had in Funk and Wagnalls, and the entry was dropped for the third edition of our Unabridged dictionary, published in 1961.” Etc. Etc. Read on!

The whole article is great though, and thon was only dropped from lacking common use. So use it!

I would also like to purpose the formal “ser’am” for addressing people. Sir+ma’am but with an “e”?! I know, brilliant. If this already exists, great. I love it. If not, let me found this word this day!

Please refer to me as [https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they). Yes, if you're going to be a dick about not refering to me by they/them, you might as well use the web address of the Merriam-Webster (yes the DICTIONARY) article on why it's not grammatically incorrect to have basic respect towards me as my pronoun and if you use neither I will find you and shove your foot into your mouth.
There are many words that are used in both a singular and plural ways, so it’s not a contradiction. Example: “You are here today because you want to change your life.” The speaker here could be talking to one person, or an entire room full of people (This is also the case in many other languages). 

Plus, “they” to refer to one person has existed even before Shakespears time, and has been continuously used by many famous authors in later eras.
My lit 90 prof back in community college pulled the same thing. Sucks
This is like when I put two Prefered names I want to be called occasionally on my sign in sheet at my eye doctor and they just call me one name that I was experimenting with and use Wong pronouns like aways
People will state their pronouns then say they don’t use pronouns and think they’re stupid. They will literally use they in the next sentence to describe someone they don’t know the gender of.
""Wow, what a perfectly natural sentence, definitely how people talk in real life!""
Jokes aside, thy professor is an illiterate fool.
As an english teacher they should know that when you don't know someone's gender you generally use they in context. Like with babies people will generally say ""they are so cute"" not ""he or she is so cute"" as at that point you would have just picked/guessed a gender instead of going through the trouble of saying ""he or she""
This is so petty and I love it.
Prof needs to learn that in English, the rules are made up and the points don't matter.
i thought this may have been r/facepalm lol what a clusterfuck of a paragraph
i wish people would just use they/them. getting tired of this cis nonsense
Exactly, what is it with people saying he or she instead of just they? (When referring to someone where the gender is not specified) like, just say they, more inclusive and easier to say.
HAHAHA amazing.
This would be a great conversation to have with the provost and if they are busy perhaps a lawyer, and maybe phrase it as such.
I had a teacher like that in 7th grade, and I stated my point, and later she realized I was right and apologized a few days later.
*ni femme, ni homme*

literally a centuries-old line of French poetry

we're not a ""new phenomenon""
Hello! Today I met a person who goes by MarsicusOrion. Neither he nor she has a wonderful personality. That smile of neither his nor hers makes me happy. I could talk to neither him or her all day, although neither he nor she doesn’t talk about neither himself nor herself much. I wonder if this day of neither his nor hers has been wonderful. I hope so!
Idk how these people put on **a pair of pants** in the morning without having a grammatical meltdown.
Came here to say this.
I knew I'd heard something about singular they predating plural they, but I couldn't remember what it was.
If Chaucers name was a name of one of the houses in my secondary school then he knows what he's doing, if he in old England used they then a teacher nowadays should bloody well use it!
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Respect singular they
Or fuck you.
English degree here. The above is correct. A lot of teachers like to be snotty about this in particular, but they are factually incorrect.
How people can say stuff like this and not realise how stupid it sounds baffles me endlessly
*won't use they/them to respect enbies*

*uses they/them to describe enby*

I really hope that's at least semi verbatim and you argued back that they literally JUST DID THAT lol
Accidentally still not misgendering you even while actively being transphobic… amazing
wake up babe new neopronoun just dropped
It’s also sad because the refusal to accept a simple give and take of personal and positive progress continues to limit others’ thinking and discourage play, killing artistic thoughts before they’ve even had a chance to emerge, not to mention ruling language usage within the basis of keeping things “correct” attacks anyone who learned language differently and forces those people to bend to the will of a predetermined “correctness” rather than communicating in ways that make more sense to them: furthering language in their own ways.
please say this exactly if you ever meet an english teacher thinking singular they is incorrect 'cause that will shut their mouth for sure.
Also can I use this next time my teacher uses ""he or she ""in a sentence?
I don't think comp one is computers

Maybe composition?
Wow that is quite a story
I think they were joking.
Thank you

YES, it was legitimately one of the more affirming things in my life at the time. They were still terrible people but they missed the bullying mark so hard that they actually ended up being kind of supportive.
You are free to use what I've written however you wish.  However, if you want to *maximize* the cattiness, might I suggest handing out a copy of [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X)?  It is an ancient work - more than a hundred years old - and still considered one of the best books ever written on the subject of writing well.  You can read the full text of it [here](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf)

The principle of using fewer words is important and essential enough that it makes an appearance in the *introduction* to the modern imprint:

""Vigorous writing is concise.  A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.  This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.""

This is the 17th element presented in the work.

(I should note that this suggestion is a *joke* and I'd not recommend it.  This 104 year old book is commonly assigned to people seeking degrees in English.  To present it would be seen (quite rightly, I might add) as an indictment that they've no clue what they're talking about.  It'd likely be taken as an insult, and, as a rule, you should avoid insulting people who have the power to make your life miserable.)
I thought it was Baudelaire but it was Swinburne just randomly writing shit in French for no clear reason XDDDDDD
I have it in Songs for the Senses but that's not a real publication, that was a custom issuance, hold on, it might be a baudelaire quote from a letter that swinburne was referencing, they were friends/rivals/possibly lovers/definitely drinking buddies.

Looking for support after a horrible msg from my mum.		"Wow that is an awful thing to have to hear from your own mother. Who want an unhappy ""daughter"" when they can have a happy child? I hope she can still see you as her child who is still the same person and is deserving of her love. Stay strong I hope she comes around. <3
You handled it very well, your reply is perfect. Her message reads like she's more invested in her idea of you than who you really are as a person. That sucks. The best of luck :(
[Do not stand at my grave and weep.](https://a-trans-comic-by-me.tumblr.com/post/185304145197/do-not-stand-at-my-grave-and-weep-mary)
that's literally emotional blackmailing. your response is brilliant though, you said it very well
Wow... this whole thing is about her. *She* feels stressed, *she* feels hurt, *she* doesn't want your relationship with her to change as she understands it. When she should really be focusing on... you. It's your identity, it's your life.

It's okay for her to find this confusing, or feel her feelings about it. But it's not okay at all for her to do what she's doing. This is disgusting and blatantly manipulative. She doesn't indicate at all that she cares about how *you* feel.

She says the most important thing to her is having a daughter? What about still having a child at all, rather than losing you either to going no-contact, or worse? Seriously?

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. You deserve so much better. Your response was spot-on, and I'm sure your spouse and child will be so proud of who you are and that you are living your true self.

We're all cheering for you!
I hope your mother learns to love you for who you are instead of who she wants you to be. Your reply was well spoken. Wishing you better luck with anyone else who you choose to come out to!
If you're not living with her then I suggest a time out.
Your response was spot on, and I hope with time she can come to see that she can still have you, and that’s the most important thing. I’m sure all the sweet things you said to her as your mother have not changed despite the gendered language you used at the time and she should know that. She may lose her concept of ‘my daughter’ but she can choose not to lose you - & if she’s supportive I bet you could be closer than ever before. I’m sorry she can’t see that, and I really hope that changes.
I’m so sorry that you didn’t get the mother you deserve, it sucks. Good job standing your ground and having boundaries, I know how difficult that can be. Your kiddo will learn a lot from your example, how to be a badass that advocates for themself, unafraid to be who you are, and that “family” doesn’t get a pass to treat you poorly. Those are invaluable lessons.  Good job.
So some major red flags, before she even goes into her whole thing about loosing you. It sounds like she doesn’t want another son which implies you have a brother, and then prayed that you would come out a female so you could become her greatest joy. I don’t know if you have siblings, but if your cool with them then please reach out and tell them their worth as well, because it sounds like you’re mom is all kinds of fucked up.



Just wanted to add an edit here and say way to go for being strong enough to come out. I came out to my dad and It went about like this except with more yelling.
I'm so sorry your mom can't step outside of her own fantasy and love you for who you are. Your reply was perfect, though.

You may find Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents to be a good read. https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703
You’re exactly right in everything you said. The emotional manipulation of her message was next level. Your child will do much better in the future having grown up with a parent who loves and honors themself for who they truly are, not who others want them to be. Honestly that’s one of the most valuable lessons any of us can learn.
i had a similar experience this morning with my brother… sending love. you are valid as a nonbinary person, and fuck what anybody says that doesn’t support that. you fucking rock. ❤️
Is your mom my mom??
She just deadass chose the crying emoji to react to your amazing response. I admire the way you handled it tbh, how you stood up for yourself
this message sounds something like what my mum would say if I came out
Your response is perfect. I'm sorry you have to go through that. I hope your mother educates herself and welcomes your true self soon.
You are brave and strong, you deserve the best and you will get through this.
Sending love ❤️
I love this Dear Therapist letter, where Lori counsels a woman grieving the loss of her son to try and accept that she has a daughter. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/07/i-love-my-trans-daughter-but-im-still-struggling/613786/

I also recommend listening to Big Mood Little Mood from this last week where Danny advises a writer with a transphobic family.

I also read a lot of the Slate advice columns, which embrace strong positive values around gender liberation in relationships. They regularly and routinely publish questions from non-cis people of every kind and their writers have really helped me cultivate a wise, loving inner parent who accepts and understands me. Care & Feeding especially because they publish a lot of letters from parents *and* children, and I’m learning a lot about proper parenting from it. It is helping me to recover from my own childhood of denial, hiding, and isolation. 

I do all this to reparent my inner teen, and to build the voice of an internal protector who loves me fiercely in all my forms that I have had over the last 40 years.

Your mom is dealing with not just gender panic (which is the costume for transphobia), but emotional enmeshment - she is laying her emotional response at your door, rather than processing her big feelings in a healthy way. I’m sorry she is doing that to you. I am proud of your response and that you stuck up for yourself!

Edit: i re-read the letter and decided to add my favorite parts here.

“Remember that your grief belongs to you, not her, and not only does she not share your sadness, but it’s not her job to soothe or be exposed to yours. That’s why you should reach out to the many adults who can talk with you about what you’re experiencing, whether that’s your close friends, a therapist, or a support group of other parents with kids who are transitioning.”


“While you’re losing whatever the experience of having a child you assumed to be a certain gender meant to you, you’re also losing what every parent eventually does—your role in your child’s life, which changes dramatically when kids leave the nest and head to college or begin to live independently.”

“What kids and parents both need are best friends their own age. When a parent takes on the role of best friend, that parent may feel abandoned by the child who is doing what she should be doing as she launches into adulthood, which places a huge burden on the child and leaves the parent with a tremendous sense of loss. It might be helpful to consider that you would experience this kind of loss in your life as a parent at this point in your child’s development, regardless of whether your child came out as transgender.”

“This leads to the third strand of your grief—loss of yourself. I get the sense that you put so much energy into being a mother that you lost other aspects of your life a long time ago—for example, your friendships, your interests outside of parenting, and a strong connection within your marriage. You say that your husband traveled and worked a lot while you were focused on raising your child, and now, while your child is doing the work of young adulthood—creating a life of her own—would be a good time for you to find meaning in those potentially neglected aspects of your own life.”

Anyway. Idk why I just felt like adding those quotes. Sending big energetic hugs your way 💕
Fantastic response to her. Firm but loving. I sincerely hope she comes around but you are strong and you know who you are. I think youve set great boundaries here. Keep your head high!
I never told my mother about my trans identity. She also would have made it all about herself. Like she does with just about everything. She might have supported me (I suppose I won't know) but she would have used my contact with her to push the only thing she really cares about: endless conspiracy theories, snake oil remedies and cultish metaphysical garbage. I didn't speak to her for years after she told me she thought sandy hook didn't happen. I then called her in 2021 to see if she was still alive. That conversation told me all I needed to know.

So I guess my point is: I'm on the far side of a no-contact policy with my mother. I can tell you that the longer you go, the less you think about her and the more chance your emotions have to heal.
Thats a heavy one jesus christ
wow your answer is brilliant!
It's so disheartening when a parent makes something that is about you about them. I have to go extended periods of time of no contact with my own family, when I simply wish they could just accept and support me for who I am.  Not all family is blood. Sometimes, the best family is those that you find along the way who accept, love, and support you for whoever it is that you are. 

Good on you for holding up your boundaries. You're already doing awesome just by maintaining them.
What is up with parents acting like their child is dying? I went through almost this exact scenario and even though I act the same, go by any pronouns, dont want to change my name, doesn't matter.
You've gotten lots of good support, just want to throw another one on the pile here from another enby who's also a parent. Our kids deserve to see our best selves, not who society (or our own parents) think we should be. This lets our kids know it's always okay to be themselves and that they'll always have our support. You sound like a great parent, and your mom can go kick rocks.
This is so difficult to read. I'm so sorry your mom sent this to you.

Your response is so powerful and compassionate though. I am inspired. Even though this must be hard to go through I love the way you responded by standing in your truth. Right on. 

I hope you can find peace in this relationship. (Whatever the ultimate outcome.)

💕💕
10/10 response there. Too many parents only see their children as an extension of themselves and not as individuals smh.
What the fuck. This is so shitty and manipulative. I'm sorry she sent this to you :(
Wow that sucks. A bit off topic but what I find really sad is that I just got two posts like this asking for support because a family member was transphobic on this subreddit back to back. It really shows that society still has a long way to go. 

Hope you are doing ok. Hang in there!
she keeps on saying she doesn't want to ""lose"" you but if she doesn't want to lose you she should stop telling you that you to not be nonbinary, telling people to stop being who they are is pushing them away
I'm so sorry your mom sees it that way and can't accept you for who you are. 

My mom is very much the same. Her first daughter (my older sister) passed away at about a month old, and her next child was my older brother. I am the last and I think she feels the exact same way as your mom does. She's never said it as articulated as that though. 

Honestly I had to guess and let it drag out for ages because she never told me why she shut down after I told her I'm non-binary, and I let our relationship struggle for over a year after because she couldn't say to me what your mom has directly. 

My advice is to cut contact. She doesn't accept you. You're right, she's being selfish. She wanted a girl more than a child so she doesn't deserve the child. You shouldn't have to put up with shit like that.

My last conversation with my mom was a few days before my birthday, I told her I was changing my name (shortening my first name to Cat and making my middle name a mix of hers and my dad's [whom she loathes, but has been my support through all this]) and she told me that was the greatest insult I could ever give her... and my sister. So I told her I was done, don't talk to me anymore. It might be petty but I chose my middle name as just my dad's and I may go by that full time. (I truly love the name and it's quite unisex!)

There's no reasoning with people like this. I'm so sorry your mom can't see how much happier you are and how much more YOU you are. I wish you all the best.
I'm so sorry you had to read that. Your mum sounds like my mum in many ways and I was AMAB even though my mum and my family and the entire community was desperately waiting for a girl to be born because my mum was super pretty and in my othrodox eastern community, I was supposed to be married off and had wedding clothes at my birth that people were disappointed about when it turned out it was a boy. 

My mum had a hard time reconciling that I am non-binary and is still warming up to it even though my family dressed me up and called me by female pronouns as a baby and toddler for a while as they themselves were in denial. 

I am plural, pan and non-binary, and my family literally has more than one kid to love in that regards, but I've heard many of these same messages from her, even how my queerness is slowly killing her and ruining her health (which she herself has been responsible for).

However, I'll say the one thing did help me get her from a stage of complete denial to near acceptance is explaining all of this to her through analogies and by flipping the conversation over its head and putting her in my shoes. 

A lot of our parents are sadly a product of their upbringing and they have no idea how to bypass the existential crises and panic attacks they experience as a result of shocking cognitive dissonance that we queer kids give them when they first experience the complexity of reality beyond the binary in their immediate physical space and their immediate mental and emotional spaces. 

It's absolutely on them to accept us and love us for who we are and not for who they want us to be. I really hope your mum comes around and celebrates your existence for you, and shares in your happiness. 

All the love.
Kudos to you for having a stand up response. Your mother appears to have some emotionally disturbed expectations from her children, maybe doing some sort of compensatory work for her? I dunno, she seems like she’s trying to guilt you into living the life that she needs you to live such that she can cope with her own life. Really really destructive parental behaviors. It’s not your responsibility to live a life that offers her the emotional support she needs—that’s insane.

Unfortunately for her she will likely have to learn this life lesson as a full grown adult with grown up kids. It will be a rough ride for her and you..

Stay strong!!

What a fuckin ass :p
I’m so sorry OP, that’s a really horrible message from your mother. Your message back was really amazing though. Why have a depressed “daughter” when you can have a happy child who’s comfortable with themselves when all it takes is an open heart 

I hope you’re okay OP 💜
The entitlement, the cruelty, the absolute emotional manipulation in that message... How selfish can you get?

She isn't owed a child of any specific gender. Not when you were born and not now. She should be grateful she had the opportunity to experience having a daughter for as long as she did.

She's worried about previous bad parenting when in fact that message itself has stripped her of her rights to be your mother.

I hope she finds it in her heart to accept you one day for who you really are, and apologise for her wrong doings.

I'm so sorry for this outrageous rejection of your identity.
She sounds like my mother who is abusive. I’m sorry you have to deal with that, don’t fall for the niceness “oh I love you so much!” , its fake.
I’m so sorry your mother is treating the loss of a title (daughter) as the loss of her child. Sending love to you. ❤️
As a nonbinary mom, this is such bullshit to read. My mom was also shitty. Ironically, it was my deep friendships with other women that made me feel comfortable embracing my true gender identity. I also have a daughter and while I worry myself about how to handle that, my friends have said to me that I'm showing her the freedom to be who she wants to be in the world and I've been mulling that over in my head since.
Damn, that's very rough, holy.... But damn, my respect and honour, you have handled it with your answer perfect in my opinion. It truly is selfish and I mean, you really don't change by that much like you will be same person (in personality) like before. Either way, you handled it amazingly and our support on the sub is granted to you everytime :)
Wow! You are the same person you have always been. Gender, bio sex, nor sexuality has anything to do with who a person is. Your values im sure remain the same. You are still you no matter how you identify. I hope one day your mom is able to see that and except and respect you as you are. Im very sorry your going though this. Much love and respect to you. You are valid in every way. If you need a friend my dms are open anytime.
Looks to me like she is using you to process her feelings about your gender. Really inappropriate. She might benefit from a group of parents of trans kids to help her get through that grief. She's allowed to have these feelings if she takes the time to work through them. She should never go to you for that purpose.
I hope that your mother does come around, you deserve to be supported and made to feel valid. Major kudos for your response, imo you handled this beautifully. 💕

Seeing that pisses me off, though, because it's so self-centered. She doesn't yet realize how big of a deal it is for you to be open and honest with her, to trust her with this is a privilege. But this is just now, and in the future things will change, and maybe that will include her accepting you for the awesome person you are.
So manipulative and horrible to you and insulting to your brothers :(

Feel I would go no contact with her tbh

Good for you for sticking up for yourself :)
Wow she is SO SELFISH! She speaks as if you’re planning on killing yourself which she IS worried about but just doesn’t get that’s exactly how you feel when this is forced on you. I was raised by a narcissist too. She needs to realize she’s holding the weapon but she’s so caught up in her own emotions to put herself in anybody else’s shoes.
Its awful how some parents absolutely refuse to view their own children as separate individuals from themselves. They hide behind a mask of care and love but will say the most controlling and possessive shit known to man. 

You are your own being. You have your own thoughts, experiences, preferences, feelings, and those things can and will change, whether or not your parents want it to. It is not their place to demand you be something your not. 

You are not their puppet. And if they can't handle that, then its high time they do some reflecting on what it means to be a parent, because putting your child in a position of misery and loathing for their own satisfaction is not what a good parent does. I hope one day she can educate herself, because she's clearly ignorant to the struggles of her own child, blinded by her own selfish desires. Perhaps showing her this comment section could help her open her eyes.
When a parent has an emotionally incestuous relationship with their child, they live vicariously through you and expect you to be everything they couldn’t be. 
So to your mom, you coming out is impossible bc she views you as an extension of herself rather than your own person. 
She doesn’t want you to be non-binary so it isn’t true, right? Wrong.

You handled this beautifully. Laying boundaries is so hard.
I had two daughters, just like my mom and it was a source of great pride for me. To be following in the footsteps of the woman I admire most. I love most things girly I grew up on princesses and pink. I’ve had long hair most of my life and I raised my first the same. Then they chopped their hair it was oddly hard for me but I moved on. Then they changed their clothes, that was hard for my mom but she moved on. Then they told me they are non binary and it felt a little scary to think if they might face any kind of adversity but we all learned to use the right pronouns and buy the right clothes. It was hard for a little while to let go of that I had two daughters idea but you know what I did and I did it without ever sharing it with my kid because that would have been so hurtful and unfair to place that on them. I’m disgusted by your mothers behaviour, it has been beautiful to see my kid be who they are and be authentic. It was harder for my mom because of the generation she’s from but she still not for a second questioned my kid directly or argued with my choice to let them be themselves. I feel very comfortable being a woman and was born one and my youngest seems so far to be the same but I will fight anyone who thinks there is something wrong for my eldest for not feeling that way. I’m so sorry you had to hear those hurtful things .
Ummm...... I'd like tips cause the day is coming when I'll have to send a message like that 😭😭😭😭 you're so strong person. For comfort look in the mirror you are who you are and you love you plus the people here love you too. I'd be happy to help you up and say you are beautiful ✨✨✨be you
The hang up on calling you their daughter and baby girl screams of manipulation and gaslighting to me. You were nicer than she deserved. 

You're identity is valid, your mental health matters, and you're not responsible for her feelings. 

You handled that incredibly well, and I can't express enough how much I want to cuss out your mother.
She is guilt tripping you op. I hope you find happiness.
You are not responsible for your parents' happiness. Only they are responsible for it, and if they think that making you miserable is going to make them happy they need to sit down and think about their life choices.
I wish you all the best and I hope it's gonna get better.
I'm sorry this happened to you, it's so fucked up
Here's a hug, if you want one. 

Or * insert an affirming gesture of your choosing *, if touch isn't your thing.
Good on you for standing up to her. She's being horribly manipulative and guilt-trippy, and you don't deserve that. My father has told me the same thing just in different words, and I know how absolutely horrible that felt. But you do NOT have to change yourself just to make someone happy. You're not tearing the family apart, you're not ""abandoning"" her, you're being yourself and it's your mom's problem if she has a problem with that. Her transphobia is not your problem. Stay strong 💜
You sound like a wonderful, confident, respectful person. Keep being you!
So sorry you are going through this. My mom responded basically exactly the same way. She did eventually come around even if she never stopped saying ignorant and unintentionally offensive things. Definitely be yourself.
Jesus fucking christ. I can be yr Renny for a day if you need a parent who actually loves you for who you are
I might be sick. Anyone else feel like a pound of sugar has just been forced down your throat? I'm sorry buddy, that's all I can say. I have no words of wisdom, I've never been good at that. I am, however, good at hugs if you'd like. 😅
❤️❤️❤️ just sending you some love, friend. The world is a better place with your queer self in it!
Sending love I feel so bad for you 💓
Reading this was very cathartic to me:

https://www.thechatner.com/p/let-me-save-you-some-time-a-field
*hugs*
I'm sorry, no one should to be raised by abusive parents. I don't know what your situation is or what boundaries you need, so I can only speak from my experience here. But this sounds a lot like something my mother would say (just with way more hearts and ""I love you's""). Eventually things got so bad that I had to go no contact with her. She sends me roughly one letter a year (through my dad) and it's still the same manipulative bullshit it always was. I simply don't reply. And my life is much better now for that. I hope your mother will come around for you. If she won't though, things can still be okay.
💗💗💗
That was… a very good response. Like damn, I’m proud of you and I don’t know you.

I would add “I’m the same person, so you’ve not lost your “Daughter” unless you keep telling me I’m a Daughter. Then you will have lost me/or any relationship you wanted.” Just for pettiness points. And - it sounds weird to say ultimatum hear because “respect me or I don’t fuck with you” is like relations 101, but y’know.

Seriously though, if it’s any solace, you handled that 10/10.
This is not ok for her to try to manipulate you, and using your kids too! They have counseling to help you deal with this also, and there are groups for parents too. Maybe if she heard from other parents who accepted and still had their child in their life, in a slightly different role then she would see it can be fine depending on her acceptance. Hopefully in time she will come round. No one should have to hear this kind of manipulation, and especially from someone in a trusted role as their parent. Sorry, my man. If you have to cut her out of your life you will have other means of support (online, if you can’t find any in person).
Sounds like narcissistic parenting r/raisedbynarcissists/
Oh my god. I am so sorry you had to experience anything but unconditional love from your own mother. You are worth so much and you are going to be so much better (mentally, physically, within your other relationships that respect who you ARE, in every way). Mothers are important but you are the only one that you have to live with forever so who that person is is the only thing that matters. Your child will see how incredibly strong you are and also how much happier you are. You are not asking for anything other than respect. Do not let her words cause doubt, you stood up for yourself and you were so brave and I wish could be as strong as you are. Find that thing that brings you joy and do it a little extra today and tomorrow and for however long you need to find your center again.
yo fuck that crying emoji response
I’m sorry you are dealing with this friend. I can tell by your response that you are a strong confident and respectable person. You don’t need to identify as a woman to teach those qualities to your children. Keep your head up and be proud to live your true life.
Ugh, I want to try and be sympathetic to others feelings, but are they really uncapable of reading their own words back to themselves and asking, ""Hey, am I being a selfish monster right now?""

This is so disgusting and cruel of her. Can she really not see how far up her own ass she's being?

I really hope she can see the error of her ways, but either way, you live your own life. This is her problem to deal with, or not, not yours.
Just one long guilt trip. It’s your life not hers.
You handled this remarkably well, far better than I probably would have. I’m really impressed at how calmly and clearly you replied! I’m so sorry you have to deal with this, and hope things get better!
Really relate the the ""angry bitter husk of a person who wants to kill themselves""

I had to say something similar to my mom, and was met with the same ""please stay my daughter"" overall almost the same message from what your mom said. 

Kills me seeing that cry reaction she gave your text, like knowing she would rather you be a miserable ""husk"" just so she can feel okay, when in reality if she would open up and accept you I 100% guarantee you that your colors would shine and you would be a better happier you than ever before. 

Such a shame, I'm really sorry you have to deal with this. 

I truly hope one day your mom sees you as the person you are, never let her guilt you into not being 100% you.
I'm so fucking sorry she said that. That's so rough. She should love you as her CHILD for WHO YOU ARE. Not what some societal role means to HER.

I hope she changes her tune OP. I don't know ur mom but my mom said very similar things when I came out.. took a while but she's warming up. She still loves me and genders me correctly (mostly). Chin up.
I'm very worried about your mother as an individual. I am just speculating but by the way she wrote it seems she has no self worth or self love. She's desperate to keep things frozen in time and no one to leave or change. 

Nothing can justify how awful and childish she's being, but i always think it's important to understand why people make this kind of actions
Wow, that's horrible. I'm glad you recognised she's being selfish and stood up for yourself, good on you!
Im sorry you had to deal with someone more obsessed with the idea of a daughter than the real wellbeing of their children but you did right by you and nobody should have to put up with things like this.
r/narcissisticparents and I am so sorry
I'm so sorry that your mum said this to you, but I am SO fucking proud of your response to her! So proud. Unfortunately we have to parent our own parents sometimes, and we get roped into their (and sometimes blamed) issues whether it's shame or grief, etc. & we absolutely don't deserve that, because we're dealing with our own battles with those.
Like all parents, she will be gone one day, sooner or later. I hope you can communicate with her and see eye to eye with her before she's gone.
She really sounds like she’s grieving a death. I know she’s being manipulative, although she doesn’t see it, but can you reassure her that you’re the same person that you’ve always been. Unless she loved you only for your appearance then the relationship that you have with her remains unchanged. A few words, here and there and you looking different are all she needs to accept.

I’m sorry it sounds like a horrible situation she’s put you in but there is a real raw grief that is coming out from here too.
That sucks that your mum isn't accepting you and I'm sorry to hear that. I never get why parents care so much about what gender their child is. One should love their child regardless of they're gender, male, female or other, it doesn't matter because in the end, that's their kid. I hope your mum comes around, she does seem to love you a lot so I'm sure she is willing to accept you as who you are, she just needs some time to come to terms with it.
Perfect reply, I’m so sorry you had to encounter that message in the first place, what a horrific guilt trip. All of us here at r/NonBinary love you for who you are, stay with us, and stay strong
It ain't easy having narcissist parents
hey i’m always open to chat with. but wow, your mom is horrible. you absolutely showed her, though. that must have took a lot of courage. good job!!
Wow so the best part of her life is not that she has beautiful healthy children, but that one of those children happened to be born with a certain set of genitals? I don’t get boomer parents
I think it is important to acknowledge the grieving process your mom is going through, and I hope she's able to get some help for a support group for parents of trans kids, therapy etc. She is definitely asking you to be someone you're not and in your response you do an excellent job of maintaining boundaries. Impact > intent, ultimately, but I do think assessing intent matters and her intent isn't to harm, bc I don't think she really understands what's going on or what's she asking if you . It's s just a really hurt person acting out her trauma of being abandoned over and over, and I'm guessing she has at least some things in common with my mom who had borderline personality disorder (hopefully it's not to that extent). It's really hard to see the nuance in people, *especially* when we just read about it rather than see it in person, and I think pointing out the nuance of this person struggling with this is important. You don't have to help her accept you and ultimately you need to prioritize you're healing, but I hope if you all want a relationship someone is able to help her understand what's going on and walk her thru it, if she's open to it. If not, then the separation might have to be permanent, which is sad for both of you.
Ugh. I’m so sorry you experienced this. My mom wasn’t quite as aggressive in language, but she said a very similar thing to me. I’m currently no contact with my parents. This shit sucks. Hang in there OP!
I just don't understand this. I'm so sorry you're going through this OP, hopefully this is something you and your mom can learn to navigate.
I’m so sorry you got that message from your mum!  It is an awful thing to say.  I’m so proud of you for sticking to your true self.  I hope that eventually she comes around and accepts you for who you are.  You deserve to be happy.
God, I am rolling my eyes at this message. Her abandonment issues are not your fault, and she is making this into a big thing that it's not. We support you ♥️
Your response is excellent and you're doing good. I hope she comes around and becomes more understanding.
This is inspiring for me to get over the fear and come out to my own mother. Thank you for sharing your struggle
r/raisedbynarcissists have a look. A lot of this seems oddly familiar to me… I’m so sorry this has happened :(
it’s unfortunately quite common for parents to react this way. even my very supportive mother did when i told her i wanted to change my name. and unfortunately you have to comfort her. 
tell her that nothing has changes except the words she needs to use to describe you and the way you see yourself. youre not doing this to damage your relationship with her or to abandon her. you still have that parent-child bond, and the only one willing to break that bond is her, if she refuses to respect your identity
I’m so sorry to hear that you had to read a disgusting message like this.
Joke's on them. They never had a ""daughter."" 💚🌈🫣
You make your own family. ❤️
Hey, when I was 17/18 and came out the first time my mom did this too. All my life my mother put the pain of having my sister stolen from her on me and she cried and guilted me to no end. I detransitioned due to something horribly traumatic at 19 and came back out in 2020 at 22. I'm about to turn 25 and she's a lot better now. It's a lot of work trying to get her to understand but she never speaks to me like this because she knows that I will leave her life again and this time I will not come back. 

It's horrible when parents do this to you and put their emotions on you when they don't understand what's happening. It's the roughest when you first come out. Even though it may be new and they don't understand, it isn't on you to shoulder their feelings. They need to process on their own and if you're able to, you should think about putting your mom on a timeout for a period of time that you find reasonable. Maybe if she has to live without you she'll come around. That woke my mom up. It isn't a guarantee though, my situation was... Unique to say the least. 

I am so sorry you're going through this. You don't deserve this treatment from your mother. You deserve much better than that. My heart goes out to you. I'm sure you know, but none of this is your fault and this is a her thing she has to sort through in whatever capacity she needs to. Maybe you can have her in your life one day, maybe you can never have her in your life again, I don't know. I just hope that whatever you choose, whatever happens that you put yourself first and choose your own happiness over everyone else's expectations.
I am so sorry. This reminds me of my mother and it's just so painful to read. You are non-binary as HELL and no one can take that away from you!
Oh my god... my mom said something along these lines too, I'm so sorry you had to hear this. No one should wver be treated like this by thier own parents, this is literally just emotional manipulation and selfishness. Really a horrible situation. I hope it's all gonna be alright. Remember to stay hydrated and bind safely if you do bind <33
That is some absolutely monstrous guilt tripping going on right there. Grade A manipulation on your moms part. 

I’m so so sorry you have to go through this. I know how hard it is for someone to put the blame on you rather than themselves. Just know that it’ll be ok in the end, whether she’s still a part of your life or not. As I say with everyone in need that I see here. You are loved and my gums are always open to vent or just chat. 😊
What the fuck is wrong with her that she had to emphasize over and over that she doesn't give a shit about anything about you except you being her daughter?
what a manipulative bitch in all seriousness. have some consideration and respect for their child, that still wants you in their life. OP you're very patient person, I don't know what I'd do if i would have gotten a text like this.
r/raisedbynarcissists would be another good place to post this. Very supportive group. This is 100% a narc parent move. I'm so sorry she's doing that to you.
I hope that you’re proud of the intelligence, grace, kindness and strength that you had in replying to a cruel, incredibly selfish, and emotionally manipulative response. I truly hope, for your sake, that your mom seeks out resources to grow up enough to treat you with the respect, kindness, and love you deserve.

In case you need to hear this: any trauma, hang ups, how she was raised, prior beliefs, etc…. Are NOT your fault or responsibility. Educating her is not your responsibility. Teaching her how to be a good parent is not your responsibility. You are taking the best possible course for yourself, which is the most important thing you can do, but this is also going to be good for your child, and any other members of your immediate family unit, who are lucky they get to know and love your most authentic self. 

Learning authenticity, integrity, self-love, pride in one’s own identity, kindness, compassion, and BOUNDARIES are crucial things for kids, and your child is very lucky to have someone to model that for them. Stay proud, and be kind and gentle with yourself 💛🤍💜🖤
i'm very sorry you didn't get the mom you deserve. when i first came out to my mom as non-binary when i was 15, she was very supportive. at first, my pronouns were she/they, but now i use they/she. i came out to my dad the next day after i came out to my mom and he still calls me his daughter. i don't get why he still does that. i like neutral terms for me with some feminine terms. it'll take your mom some time to warm up to you like my family did. you're strong. :)
The worst part is that this comes from a collection of fear and love not so much as hate and resentment. She doesn’t and it’s hard to make her understand. I’m sorry bro. If you ever need to talk my dms are open both on Reddit and discord
Good on you for keeping firm with your boundary, standing your ground, and demanding respect. 👏 She is your parent and she owes you that. Not only are you setting a great example for you kid by being your honest true self but by standing up for yourself. It's not easy and you should be proud of yourself for everything.
Yikes. I’m so sorry she said those things to you. Just remember you are not responsible for how she feels, and you deserve to present yourself however you want and in whatever way makes you happiest.
That’s horrible… i’m so sorry this ever happened to you that’s utterly disgusting to hear from your own mother! No one should ever have to deal with that 😡🤬
It's the same with my family. I'll never understand why my gender is so important to other people, but like you said if they aren't willing to live me as I am, why would I pretend to be something I'm not for their sake?
Ugh, not the crying emoji reaction. She needs to wake up and realize that your well being as her child is more important than whatever she “needs” you to be. Really, it’s toxic parenting that she’s doing this and guilt tripping you.
I'm sorry, you deserve better
I hope your child is proud of who you are and that you are being true to yourself. That’s a much better lesson anyways ♥️
Aside from the obvious me me me of this message, your mother sounds very codependent. Im sorry shes latched onto the labels so hard and cant see that your soul is still your soul. Take care out there.
What the actual fuk 

The implications that your value is based on behaving in certain gender norms, and that you cannot have a close relationship with her as yourself...

You answered really well though.
I'm so sorry. That's so ham-fistedly manipulative. None of it is true, it's only meant to guilt you into compliance, but if it *were* true it would just mean your mother was mentally unhealthy in a different way and still be no reflection on you and how you should live your life. 

I'm glad you were able to learn how to understand and trust yourself even with a mother who I'm sure pulled different versions of this throughout your life. That takes resilience and real strength of character. You're awesome, and I'm sure everyone with any sense sees it.
I am over 30 and have not come out to any of my family because this is the exact thing that would happen to me. I'm so proud of you for doing it and am sorry it turned out this way. I can not 100 percent relate due to my family not knowing but I am here to support you and send love and tell you that you are strong and standing true to yourself and what makes you happy as a human being and what you deserve is the best thing you can do even if you do unfortunately lose your mother in the process. I have myself cut out my mother and many other toxic members of my family for moral reasons and I can tell you it's hard but it's harder being with someone who treats you less than what you deserve. Hang in there dear 🖤🖤
It’s giving narcissist manipulation
It really isn’t that hard folks. Your kids aren’t dolls that you get to play Babie and Ken with. Either love them for being full ass people or admit you’re not capable and save everyone the time.
fuck your mom
The fact that she used a crying emoji sticker at the end is pretty insulting. I'm sorry, I dont knoe much about what it means to be non binary but I'm trying to learn and I support you ♥
That’s an awful, manipulative thing to try to do to someone. I’d love is conditional that you are who they want you to be and not yourself, then they need to do some serious introspection. 
I’m afraid of telling my parents for this reason. I hope they come around, but you sure as shit don’t owe them anything.
I'm sorry you had to receive that and deal with that. I've experienced years of similar stuff and still have a long way to go to heal and not feel like I have to care-take the rents' emotions. Being gentle with myself though.

I also feel grief in general for the intergenerational trauma that is apparent in those text messages. The systems that cause people to put importance in and need to hang onto something like an assigned gender, getting grandkids, and so on... as opposed to who the kid really is and their genuine happiness and euphoria at being exactly who they are.
That really sucks and I’m so sorry for you! If you ever need someone to vent to please don’t hesitate.
Your reply was so well said. I don't think I could have even replied. If she cannot accept you because of her own selfish wants, she does not deserve you. I hope that you can have her in your life like you wish and she comes around. You deserve better.
Thanks for your kindness. She doesn't care how I feel on the inside as long as I comply.
Story of my life. All she wanted was a living doll to dress up, show off and make grandchildren for her. Thanks for the kind words.
That's beautiful ❤️
And saved! Thank you for sharing this, I've never seen it before but it's perfect
This poem made a trans girl with bed head cry.  Thank you for sharing!
OMG I love a-trans-comic-by-me’s blog, I literally just visited it yesterday to see if there were any new posts!! That art he made is so beautiful 😭
These were excatly my thoughts
Seriously, she can still have her “daughter” but at what cost? Like so many abusive parents lkek this, she’ll definitely still age her idea of her child, which is a daughter. She’ll only uphold that version of make believe fantastic herself by posting the same old high school photos as if they died at 17. That’s where their connection to their own child stops. Because they have no interest in knowing their real child. 

The real grown up child is a alive ask well and the parents has literally no relationship to them of their own lack of effort. They cling ti an imaginary person. Which speaks volumes. They never wanted a person to live, they wanted a fantasy. One day as children we stop having imaginary friends because we get real ones and we know how valuable and irreplaceable those people are to us. It asks some people never grown out if that fantasy land, though. They value imaginary people more then the real ones they’re throwing away.
It's so gross to me when parents act like this and make this big production, like, idk, just feels kinda messed up to say ""I'm more attached to the idea of having a daughter than to having an actual relationship with my real child.""
I didn't get a chance to reply when I first read this (stupid crazy life!) but thank you so much for your thoughtful reply. It really helps me know that I'm in the right and she's in the wrong.
Was thinking the same thing. Hopefully their partner is supportive.
Luckily I'm very much out of home and I'm happy to have some silent treatment. Until she stops throwing this tantrum it's low contact
I'm slowly making my way through all the replies but these are exactly the words I need today. Thank you so much
My brother is disabled so I'll keep it to myself, but I hadn't seen it this way so thank you for sharing. I'm sorry your dad was a raging asshole, my dad hasn't been much better
i know the last sentence is like ""you rock, you're amazing"" but i first saw it as ""you are a rock"" lmao
Lol same. Had to double take this post.
Literally what I thought when I read this too. I don't think my mother would be this transphobic, but I also could totally see her saying something like this, like my mom texts similarly to this too.
Thanks for this letter. My mom talked about mourning me too, and I’ve struggled to understand what she thought she was losing, when to me I’m giving her the gift of allowing her to know and be close to parts of myself I’ve spent most of my life hiding and trying to kill. Like, what are you losing when I give you more of me?? This helps.
Feels on all this tho i did come out to my exmom and she accepted it; tho probs wudnt have if id come out earlier, my little bro had come out as gay and her pastor convinced her that the church accepts LGBT ppl nowadays... But still any contact with her was her promotin alt right conspiracy theories and ignorin my arguments entirely even when shown clear evidence she was lied to.

The reason i ended up cuttin contact in the end was cuz i cudnt stand her active support for folks seekin to make life for trans ppl like me harder. She believes the dems are eatin aborted baby fetuses for immortality; so she will vote for the most monstrous of repubs bcuz theyre better than that monster she has had crafted in her head.

She always had a justification and honestly im thankful not to be contact her rn too bcuz i just know she wud justify every single SCOTUS rulin rn and id just feel so much more drained from dealin with her bs on top of other bs.

All she ever wanted to do was complain about how dems are makin her life worse and how muslims and whatever other group she was told to fear are all doin horrible things she was told they did by alt right pundits lyin thru their teeth.
Awesome! Please go teach my Mum a gigantic lesson, may Loki & Fenrir go with you
Yes! I was reminded of my own r/raisedbyborderlines as well.
Also uhhh I kinda wrote a poem about that kind of treatmeant from your fam when you're a young nonbinary afab. enjoy it i guess

About the daughter you never had

&#x200B;

This one's about the person I'll never be

About the unreached expectations,

You unconsciously put on me.

&#x200B;

Because ever since I was born

You looked at me with so much love.

But besides looking at who I was

You already loved the girl you thought that I'd become.

You saw the long blond hair,

You saw the black prom dress.

You saw my future husband,

But now there's nothing left

Of your dreams, of your beloved daughter.

Because I'm just not her.

&#x200B;

And for so long I thought you loved me,

And would do so despite everything.

But now? I'm such a disappointment,

'Cause I'm a they, and not a she.

You look at me and realize,

I'm not the one you wanted to see.

I will not wear your wish prom dresses,

Will not fulfill your unspoked dream.

&#x200B;

I really don't know when it happened,

Nor did I see it until now.

Turns out you never loved me for who I was,

Rather for who you thought I'd become.

&#x200B;

You loved the woman you never were,

One who would lead a truly happy life

One who would have a bigger family,

But that's your dream, not mine.

&#x200B;

You say I'm wrong? Then prove it!

Oh, what a surprise, you can't?

The truth lies here, before your eyes,

You just have to open them.

Now I'm myself, and I'm happy,

finally, after so much time.

Only that you don't like it,

Because that's not who you wanted me to become.

Let me repeat: I'M MYSELF.

And you so clearly don't like that.

Do you know why? That is because

you wanted me to lead your dream life.

&#x200B;

You say that you don't understand?

You ask what in your plan for me was wrong?

Let me get this straight: just one tiniest thing,

It wasn't my plan, but yours.
Soo relatable.... I wanna cry now
This is how my family is as well. Im very sorry you are having to deal with this kind of behavior also. It's not fair
Damn, I feel this. My mom loved doing the same with me and can’t let go of the idea of me “being her daughter”. When I got to my early teens, I realized she loved an idea of me, and not who I really am. Now I can confirm it since coming out as non-binary and changing the name she so dearly wanted to give to her daughter. Well, here’s the thing, KIDS ARENT PROPERTY OWNED BY PARENTS. Modern society makes it look like that but that’s a pretty new thing and clearly doesn’t work.
I don't know how long ago you came out, but I know my mom was kind of like this (*a watered down version, but with* eerily *similar words*) when I first came out. I shut her down immediately, and eventually she realized that I'm not her daughter, I'm not perfect, and I never will be, and I don't have to be, because being myself makes me happy. I hope your mum comes around eventually, but if she doesn't, then just know that you're loved, and that you don't deserve this kind of childish behavior. (*Except really, children have a tendency to be better behaved than adults*.)
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You’re very welcome. I hope you can surround yourself with lovely, supportive people even if those biologically related to you don’t fit the bill.
Damn that’s like a whole another can of worms there. I am having a really tough time right now with both my parents, and both have them have told me that they don’t wanna be around me. I love them both very much and wish that I could have a relationship with them, but I’m not going to pretend everything is okay and I’m someone I’m not just for their comfort. Stay strong lean on the community that does accept you.
fuck the spacing keeps messing up i hate it here
EDIT OH GOD I FINALLY FIXED IT LMAOO
Totally relate to being loved for an idea of who I am, not who I really am. Story of my life, but not anymore! My mantra is now I'd rather be rejected for who I am than accepted for who I'm not."	vpkto9	NonBinary	1347	0.99	2022-07-02 05:52:20

idk if this works lmao
It works! Also I love that the popup message beforehand says ""this maker is genderless, please do not call this maker female only"""	ot9qd9	NonBinary	1328	1.0	2021-07-28 13:18:14
My college assignment is gendered :(		"Yikes... it would be more reasonable to give everyone the option of choosing which thesis they wanted to write on, or maybe assigned by last name? A-H gets thesis 1, I-P thesis 2, etc.
Dude, what is with this making the ""females"" write pro-feminist topics but making the ""males"" write anti-feminist topics? This teacher really wants to reinforce in men that women's oppression is just their perception and isn't real >.>

I would go higher up to fight this assignment, especially if the school has a code about inclusion. There is just so much that is wrong with this assignment
If you have an LGBTQ friendly university, the office of the ombuds may be able to help. Not sure about where you go, but where I went to school they were heavily invested in advocating for students. I can see that the instructor was attempting inclusivity by saying it’s your “gender identity” rather than just saying “sex” or “gender”, but this feels rather hamfisted and I question the necessity of bringing gender into the equation at all—splitting groups based on name + birth month would have worked just as well without making anyone uncomfortable.
Damn sucks to be a man or a woman, they have to do thesis assignments!
It's not only gendered, it's heteronormative. You can either try to discuss your point with the teacher or you can choose a sex that's not the one assigned to you at birth and encourage everyone in your class to do the same. The point of the assignment is being able to argue what love is or what is not with supportive statements and everyone should be able to do that.
I once (2009 or so) had a college interviewer ask me (then female-presenting) what a Disney Princess I would be and I said Mulan and asked if she also asked the boys the same thing. She said she asked them what superhero they would be. I said Nightcrawler and crossed that school right off my list.
""According to your own gender identity"" and then proceeds to be weirdly heteronormative. Lol
I don't for one minute condone it, but I wonder if the creator of the assignment believed there would be better empathy if females wrote about the challenge from a female point of view and likewise for males 

It's incredibly outdated and non-inclusive to do something like this ☹️
Pretty sure this is straight up a Title IX violation even if you ignore the existence of trans people
I could see where the instructor was coming from if and only if they were instructing the men in the class specifically to empathize with and write from the perspective of the narrator, who is a woman. It's incredibly easy and reductive to tell the men in the class to find reasons to argue that the narrator's husband is actually doing what's best, or that there's a literal supernatural explanation. This is just a poorly-designed assignment all around, and forcing a gender divide is the icing on the cake. If you're gojng to enforce a gender binary in the reading of a text (which you shouldn't) it ought to at least be with the goal of teaching people to interrogate the text from a different perspective than what their unconscious bias might direct them towards.
That is the most bizzare assignment i’ve ever seen…
As a college professor, what — and I cannot stress this enough — the fuck
Guess that means you get a freebie for the assignment?

In all seriousness, that's absolutely not cool. At a minimum they should apologize, let you pick which one you're completing, and change the assignment for the future.
What a weird way to assign things out anyways? Just let students pick one of the four! Plus it seems super sexist hoe those prompts are split regardless
This is so stupid. Why not just split the class into 4 groups and give each group a thesis statement? What's the point of dividing people by gender and birthdays????
Low key the way they split it up is kinda sexist too because why do the girls have to write about oppression but the boys don’t
Why TF not split it up into 4 different birth dates instead of gender?
Can you email your professor and ask them if you can do the assignment differently? Like having the option to choose any question you want to work on.
There are better ways to divide the class into four parts.
I’m a college professor (15 years in) and this honestly the dumbest structure I’ve ever seen for an assignment this prof needs to take a fucking workshop on Transparent Instructional Design and Assessment like fucking asap 

Also this probably why I never talk to any of my colleagues lollllll
I love literature. I love analysis and criticism and interpretation. If I got this assignment, I would tell the teacher to shove it up their ass. It being gendered is absolutely horrible, no doubt, but it's also a terrible assignment because it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that may be unsure what to take from it. It's like making someone write a paper about how the mob in Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" were correct to do that they did; it entirely goes against the point of the story.




And yeah, because I was AMAB and don't try to not look masculine, the teacher would expect me to do one of the ""male"" topics, which I wouldn't be able to do because I have a functional brain and know that those interpretations are bullshit. I get trying to teach critical thinking and seeing other perspectives, but would anyone try to get students to argue FOR the men in A Handmaid's Tale?



I'm sure the teacher thinks they're being inclusive by saying ""according to your gender identity,"" but they clearly don't understand that much about different identities. Or the point of the story. Good luck, OP. This class might be tough.
What class is this? Being assigned a thesis statement at all is weird to me, even if the point is to make you look at the writing in a specific way. Your teacher's writing is also... rough. 

The unnecessary gendering is definitely a rotten cherry on top, I'm sorry you're dealing with this and hope you can safely navigate the situation and conversation with the teach! There are many other ways to make four groups, I'd just split into groups of three months each, irrespective of gender(/sex, which the specific wording they used seems to indicate and kinda icks me).

Edit: Just realized they did say 'gender identity,' so B for effort haha! It was the Male/Female wording that triggered my last response.
Oh boy, I feel this. I'm taking a language class and while practicing a conversation as a class, my professor was like ""women read for Mary and men read for Takeshi"" and I was just frozen 😂😭
I guess that means I dont have to do the assignment. There’s no thesis on here for me.
Assign everyone you perceive as boys the role of defending the patriarchy, gaslighting the protagonist, and making up some ghost stories to avoid respecting a woman.  Yeah, great idea, fearless leader 🫡 And should the boys also write a list of punishments they'll use when assaulting their wives some day? Only when the females try to escape, of course!

What a shit professor.  What's the lesson here??

""Symbolism is when everyone's wacky ideas are equal, no matter how sexist, and stories like the Yellow Wallpaper are full of 10-12 clues about why feminists are wrong and Steven King's Rose Red was the real oppressor the whole time!"" 🤡
...even outside nonbinarism I'd be asking professor why the prompts are gender segregated.

Also, in general, assigning theses is bad teachering. Should be grounds for professional repremanding.
Honestly I would look at your university's policy on lgbt issues and consider reporting it if you bring it up with the professor and they don't change it/even acknowledge it. (Or just report them upfront if you're uncomfortable talking directly to them about it, which is what I would probably do. Definitely the option that will make you look like more of the ""bad guy"" possibly but hey.)
If they wanted four thesis choices why didn’t they just split it in groups of three months?
Alright. Alternative selection.. no matter which gender. If you were born in January-June you can choose from either: 

>John is not genuinely interested in helping his wife get well; he truly loves and cares for her, and thinks he is doing what's is best for her, against better judgement.

>The yellow wallpaper represents the oppression the narrator is under from her husband--the space they live in is, in fact, sinister with a bad history, and the narrative is in danger of the male-dominated world in which she lives.

And if you were born in july-december

>John truly loves and cares for her. His intention is to control every aspect of his wife's existence in order to maintain his own position of power under the belief that he is trying his best to help his wife get well.

>The house and the room represents sinister spaces with baf histories, the narrator I'd under oppression from her her husband who had been possesses with the male-dominated world in which he lives. They are both in danger from metaphorical figures outside and behind the wallpaper which possessed the husband psychologically.

Really mess with them and then when they ask, say ""well i don't fit into the ""male"" or ""female"" category specifically so I made the prompts reflect my gender identity by mish-mashing them."" And then send along the other three prompts for their use on future assignments and say ""you're welcome.
Oh lucky you! You don't have a paper to write :)
This screams title 9 violation
Okay wtf “according to your GENDER IDENTITY” and then goes to list FEMALES and MALES. 
Do they even know how language works? 
I have had forms to fill that ask for my sex and it kind of irks me but at least they ask for my SEX.
Yikes. It's not just about the gender options here, it's also which genders have been assigned which viewpoints
Email time!

Hello, professor. Seeing as I don’t fit into any of the given categories, it is evident to me that you must want to give me an automatic A for this assignment. I appreciate this generous offer and accept. Unless the language on the given assignment document changes, you will not be receiving an assignment from me, as I will be accepting the A. Thank you very much. 

That’s what I would do ngl
welp i guess you don’t have an assignment to do 🤷 if they’re assigning based on binary genders they’ve assigned you nothing 😎
You should directly ask the prof (via email) what you should do.

Always via email, always get it in writing
That sucks, friend. I am in school right now and I’ve just started politely emailing the professor and asking what nonbinary students should do when stuff like this comes up. I usually get an overly apologetic response and an updated assignment. I live in a liberal area though, so YMMV.
Ewww this is so cis- and hetero-normative. Wtf
Welp, I'm neither male or female. Guess I get to skip this assignment.
That is dumb, also if they wanted to break it into quarters they could go off of birth seasons, or random lots, or literally anything else
Why the fuck are they referring to, on paper students as males and females anyways??
Ew. Why Tf is this necessary. NGL I would refuse to do it and talk to the dean about it but that’s me.
Legit, my lifelong indignation with bullshit like this should have been a very early sign that I was non-binary.
I don’t like how this is laid out. The females have to pick one side (that homie isn’t at all interested in helping his wife, and being toxic for lack of better words, and the males are to pick the other in which he’s the “good guy” and actively loves and wants to help. I just don’t like that, and it gives me ick vibes. 
Also, if you’re ballsy enough, I’d tell the teacher my gender identity is none, but I’m also very sassy and petty. But honestly, I’d have a conversation with them at least, because that’s not entirely fair for you to be forced to pick one.
i guess that means you don't have to do work then
They could have just done the first letter of first and last names and gotten the same number of options.
That's unfortunate
Be cheeky and write from the perspective of someone (or something) else but follow the required points to the assignment for both the gender options.

Write from the perspective of a house plant or something explaining the issues objectively. Sometimes professors appreciate creativity in their assignments. And you can use that to say “hey my gender wasn’t included so I fixed it for you.”
This seems to be intentional transphobia from my perspective. It instructed students to do the assignment based on their “gender identity” but then immediately referred to terms easily recognizable with biological *sex*. What class is this for??
Not only that, they're telling girls to take the perspective that the man is manipulative and telling the guys to argue that he's good intentioned... breeding attitudes of suspecting others and being self righteous rather than trying to understand how other people may have good intentions or how we might be in the wrong... idk just feels a bit off to me.
Say fucking what... That assignment is COMPLETELY fucked up.
FUCKING BULLSHIT. Also I vote since they gendered it on husband vs wife that nonbinarys are now the strange wallpaper that is driving the wife mad.
So your comments show it’s Comp 2, and for writing for “the humanities”…

Choose a section, (I’d personally choose the “sinister spaces” avoid sex/gendered issues)

Write your chosen thesis statement at the top..

Then explain why you chose this thesis statement (in my mentioned choice it would be because it’s the only non gender based viewpoint)

Then do the assignment.

Also….wait to turn in till last minute, see if you can get a response that actually helps you fulfill the assignment.

And a final bit of fun, here’s a story…comp two…had to write about my “weekend waste”…mainly food and trash based…

So I made a roast chicken for Friday, chicken soup Saturday, and ate leftovers Sunday….a few bits of plastic bagging for the chicken and veggies, and some degradable trash…that was my paper…

I got “talked to” by that teacher because “most people can’t eat that little”…I was on food stamps at the time, and I never eat much because of swallowing issues….I just shrugged and said “I did the assignment”….I got a passing grade on it…

Write a decent paper, that YOU can feel proud of, AND that feels like it fulfills the teacher’s expectations….if you get singled out for it go to the administration and file an issue.
Sounds like you gets to choose whichever argument you prefer 😎 and if the teacher gets angry see who can make a bigger deal out this obviously sexist/transphobic assignment.
You could try reaching out to the EDI department.
They could probably do something about it , or maybe emailing the teacher? Good luck!
This giving me huge “She uses they/them pronouns” vibes. They tried to sound inclusive, but then missed the mark completely.
Not only is this ew but I read the prompts and they specifically gave only ""female"" students the ones that go deeper into the underlying message of gender roles and oppression and they gave the ""male"" students the ""everything the dude does is justified even though he treats her like a child because he *loves* her"" and ""it's not her husband's neglect and oppressive behavior that made her lose herself, it's the evil house even though the house was very clearly a metaphor"" bullshit readings. Not only it it cisnormative and forcibly reinforces binary thinking, but it specifically reinforces sexism by intentionally discouraging young men from thinking about sexism and it's effects and different ways of showing. All round gross.
It also looks sexist AF.  Women have to write about resenting their husbands and men have to write about their experience as Doctors?  What the fuck?
I hate that story so them adding some weird binary and hetero rules to the thesis is some double level bs
lmao, no instructions for enby folks means no work for them

sit back and chillax lmao
Tell the professor that the instructions were unclear, so you burned it
Flex on the professor by writing two papers. (not a serious suggestion because holy crap)
I guess you don't have to do the assignment! 😬
Guess you don't have to do it then :D
This is actually disgusting in general wtf
Boooooo!
I FUCKING FEEL THAT! I know it’s not necessarily the same… but every damn job app I’ve put in only provides male or female.. like it’s 2023… GET WITH IT
The horses name was Friday
🤢
powermove: dont do it
*FEEEEEEMALES*

That's something to report, yes?
yikes. I'm sure they could've just split the birth month into 1/4ths or just assigned them randomly.
Looks like you don't have to do the assignment then
Do the opposite of your agab to spite the professor
You don't need to do the assignment ig
Dude I HATE IT when when things are pointlessly gendered. Like seriously. Something else that pisses me off is boys versus girls. Or anything that differentiates girls from boys. I mean, there’s a small difference but nothing much, and there’s no point in changing things due to gender. Especially when you’re nonbinary or something else. Like what tf am I supposed to do? Split myself between the two groups??
There is also a bad rapresentation of men. All in one basically ahah
Just pick whichever you like best I guess. But I hate shit like that, just let people choose their own thesis instead of ""oh btw you were born a month premature from July? Fuck you, male post-July is your assignment""
How is this legal?
That's a really weird way to assign school work
Noooo :(
this professor sounds sexist or something.
This seems so needless why not split it up based on birthday and split the year into quarters
Non-binary people don’t have to complete this assignment.
YIIIIIKES. I’m a college prof and this would never occur to me. Why doesn’t the prof just split it ALL by birthday? Or by last name? 

If you have the spoons for it, consider giving this to your school’s EO (Equal Opportunity) officer. LMK if I can help you figure out who that is or what to say or anything.
If you have the time, you could do all of them just to prove a point to your teacher/prof and then end the assignment with an explanation that not every person identifies as male or female. I’m such a try hard though, I know that solution might not work for everyone
Well that's obnoxiously unnecessary and intrusive.
Looks to me like you’re excused from the assignment. Automatic pass.
this made me remember why i dropped out of school 😅
OOF. If they weren't gonna add more than male or female, they should have done it by sex assigned at birth. Whatadumbass teacher.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I guess you’ll have to do them all lol
In addition to the shitty gender stuff, assigning someone a specific topic to write about is how you get way more students to hate academic writing. I’ve always found that picking a topic I was genuinely interested in to be the best. Seems to be a bad teacher all the way around.
It would take a while, but do both and turn them in and if the teacher asks why there are two just say a random word or nothing.
Ewww this is such garbage.
Say you can not do the assignment because you're neither.
Guess that means you can get both the male and female option then
Is this like when someone finds an item without a price tag and says “I guess it’s free!” You just get to skip this assignment, I guess.
Looks stupid anyway!!
Every time I have to pick male or female on some form, I just sigh and pick the closest thing to what I’m feeling that day. But being forced into a gender based on someone else’s expectations would really piss me off. Sorry you have to deal with that OP.
This shouldn't be allowed. Is there someone you can report this to?
Yikes
This makes me sick…
🤮🤮
is it only me who understands why its okay to do this and also why its not okay.
Ew
wtf they do this in college too? middle school shit fr
Fight the power
What was the reason? I mean... just WHY?
That is such a bizarre way to assign prompts to someone. Assuming you’re in the US, is this a community college? It looks like something an adjunct would do.
Just ask where is my assignment
If that were my class, at this point honestly I'd just pick a completely different angle / lense through which to analyse it, and go absolutely ham on making it legit and meaningful. Come up with something that fills the assessment criteria that isn't either of the shitty binary options lol. I did this a few times for my creative writing degree, naturally not all of my teachers liked that whatsoever (and admittedly I failed one class because of it lol but that dude was an asshat). But some of them thought it was snarky but well done 😆 and I got great marks

However as someone else mentioned it's awful that the split is such that some of the ""males"" (ugh) are literally arguing pro abuser stance but ok. The person who designed this assessment sounds like they would literally be the last person to give a fuck about this ...

Edit: yikes I just noticed too it says ""According to your gender ***identity*** ..."" and then completely leaves out other identities lmao ok
Yay, I have no thesis 🥳
I would politely point it out to your professor and explain to them how it made you feel. They may just be unaware, which is not an excuse. However, it provides a great opportunity to make them understand.
I'm guessing the plan is to pair up people who were assigned contrasting theses.  But you could also do this randomly or by last name or even by birth month alone.
Or hell just organize it by the four seasons of which you were born, much easier to work with
There are 1000x more sensible ways to divide the class into 4 groups. I’d be disappointed but not surprised to see this in elementary school but college???? Also deeply weird how it’s set up so that the men and women get different assignments- and how the “female” prompts both are about how it’s a feminist text while the “male” prompt is how the doctor/husband are in the right or the house is to blame(?). Idk the vibes are off
You know I thought about this too and almost said ""they should have it swapped"" and then I decided it actually wouldn't be better to make female students defend John's medical abuse and decided that actually. It's a terrible prompt either way.
I immediately thought this too, it seems geared towards reinforcing any biases students are already likely to approach the text with. Just a poor way of assigning topics all around.
I don't think any of the theses are particularly anti-feminist (and I actually think the fourth one takes the narrator the most seriously, accepting her experience at its face value), but I do agree shoving all the analysis of symbolism for oppression onto the women in the class is bizarre and... shitty, for lack of a better word. 

The ""male"" topics are also a lot more superficial, analytically. I hope it's just a case of thoughtlessness or legitimate ignorance, but they kind of get off much easier.
Yup, i'd go higher up!
My thought, too. I got such a weird feeling when the first statement for males was in defence of a man that is supposedly supposed to be dangerous or toxic. My only guess as to why it was divided that way was to make sure all of the statements were used?? It’s still way over complicated. 

OP, do none of them lol. Or flex on them and do one from ‘female’ and one from ‘male’
If there's not an ombudsman office, Student Life should also be able to help mediate issues between students and the academic side of the institution
Reach out to the EDI department of the school. They are usually helpful. I work in higher ed and when going through the university website looking for something, I found very gendered suggestions for students on how to dress for an interview. I sent it over to the EDI department of the university and it was fixed pretty quickly.

ETA: Your university should have an EDI department as most accreditation boards are now requiring the university and the individual colleges and/or schools to have an EDI department. They are pretty much required now no matter what.
More genuinely, I'm finding it hard to believe that the way this assignment is structured is doing a good job of teaching about the book. 

If this book is meant to have multiple interpretations, to me, that can suggest that the subversive material is being obscured, at least in part, intentionally to give plausible doubt to the people who the work can influence, so that they may defend it from the people who would suppress it. To put it bluntly, those people don't exist anymore. It seems.. crude? Ineffective? To separate modern students by gender in an attempt to recreate divisions that were naturally formed in the unique cultural climate that this book was written in, doesn't seem like a good basis to analyze how a contemporary man or woman would have read this book.

Why not explicitly structure the assignment to say ""I want this section of students to find evidence to support X argument. Given that evidence, I want you to research the cultural climate of the section of society that gave way to this interpretation on the book, contemporary men and women, and analyze how their life experiences might have influenced them to take X argument."" Any modern student, regardless of gender, could complete every one of those prompts in this hypothetical structure. I'd take it up with a gender studies professor, in or out your institution, and see what they think.
I giggled. 😆

It's like the thought that non-binary people aren't bound by laws in some countries because the wording is always ""he/she"" ... 🤭
Yeah I emailed my teacher about the possibility of me getting a non gendered option for a thesis so I will see what happens \_o_/
Perfect.
And why would they assume they'd all want to be a superhero?? Are supervillains not cooler?
Brilliant responses from you tbh 👏🏻
Even if it was a matter of empathy it should've been the opposite: let men do the anti-patriarchy and the female POV thesis, and the women the male POV. (I agree with you, I just double disagree with the professor)
Oh it definitely is.
title IX?
Legit. Given that it's significantly less challenging for the average cis man to lean into the whole toxic-masculinity-abuse-bias lense as opposed to literally anything else kinda makes it seem like this assessment was designed to academically favour at least that 25% of the class tbh
I like your thinking. I was like: Time to work twice as much as the other students ^^. I guess it depends how OP sees their gender
I get a feeling this teacher wouldn’t have made this gendered unless they wanted someone to challenge them on it, but maybe they just weren’t thinking.
Putting an additional mental burden on the ""females"" who now have to confront their own experiences with oppression to support the thesis, while the ""males"" aren't required to do any extra work addressing internalized experiences with gender.
For real. Like the year is very nicely divisible by 4 ffs...
I did email my professor about doing a different thesis, but they are out of office for a few weeks right now so I don’t know if I will get a response
By months, for example lmao... JAn-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec.... I mean this is not rocket science.
> it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that __may be unsure what to take from it__

This is *such* an important point.

The students are not doing this assignment for giggles; they're doing it because it's part of the *learning.* What are they *learning* from this assessment?

When a person is actively taking instruction for a skill they do not yet possess, they are very easily *positioned* based on the instructor's actions, expectations, and biases. This is especially true in a high-pressure institution like a school where students have to learn *right* and learn *fast* or else they fail – which can have lifelong financial, social, and/or career consequences for some, on top of the regular emotional & social trauma – so they're more likely to hit the ground running with whatever they can grasp and hope that'll be enough.

It's one thing when you're heavily experienced in critical analysis, as you fundamentally understand that there are multiple different conclusions to reach and all of them have unique merit that is separate to one's own personal opinions and biases. But when you're literally still learning how to analyse and write about a piece critically, a polarising assessment like this is more likely to *position* students to accept a singular interpretation as ""correct"" and learn interpretation bias going forward ... *especially* given how polarising abusive men vs. silenced women is as a political topic and how traumatic the class is going to be after this. I hope there is *zero* in-class comparison of perspective because it's going to end up with the men insisting they're right and the women being (re-)traumatised tbqh

That was a bit of a rant sorry lol

I miss when the point of studying was to actually *learn,* rather than to rush through hoops at breakneck speeds to prove you're slightly less incapable of doing a shitty entry level job than the next schmuck with the hope that one day you'll be able to buy food without doing a job that makes you want to die inside
I saw you already emailed the professor, OP, but if they're willing to take any specific suggestions, I'd recommend allowing students to form their own theses based off a choice of leading question. 

For example: 

Please choose one of the following questions to answer as the thesis of your paper. There is no wrong answer to these questions; feel free to go with whichever fits your own opinion, or the opposite of what you believe for a challenge!

Does John (the narrator's husband) care for the narrator and legitimately try to help her, or does he have no intention of helping and is only exerting and expanding his control over her life? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.

Are the figures that the narrator witnesses outside and within the wallpaper purely symbolic (if so, what are they symbols for?), or are they real entities that she ultimately finds herself possessed by? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.
The class is composition two, we are learning how the write for the humanities.
Depending on genderfluxity I'd either read none or both 😆
Lol if I was braver
Title 9?
I have had to fill out such forms, and as an intersex person, binary forms get old fast.
If I were in school now, I'd absolutely be doing this. I didn't know I was non-binary at the time I went through uni but I had a few of these and it is very clear to me these days why I hated them ... lol egg moments

(also nice username 🥚🐺)
It's completely fucked up.
It’s for comp II
I agree with your point.
Genius lmao
Ya at my job I left it blank lol
Thanks, I need this
May not be, especially considering the gendered nature of the different writing prompts.
I was going to try and get into contact with someone at the school, but my mom (who I live with) got mad at me.  She said I haven’t given the professor enough time to fix it herself. I emailed her yesterday morning, but haven’t gotten a response. Wich I was expecting because she is currently on sick leave, and will be out for another week. We are supposed to finish this wile she is gone.
The instructions specify ""gender identity"" in the instructions, but then lists sexes under the prompts. From what was written, I don't think we can assume that this professor knows how to distinguish between sex and gender. The content of the assignment is about gender and it's repercussions, so I think it would be giving this prof way too much faith to say that splitting a group of people based on sex for a gendered topic wasn't meant to conflate the two.
I'm interested in hearing what might possibly make this okay

I’m sure it’s just a coincidence the men were all asked to identify with the abusive husband and construct arguments in his favor!
Last name, birth month, favorite color, astrology sign, draw a slip of paper, roll a dice, literally so many different ways they could have chosen to do!
Gender is a terrible thing to pick for this considering it's rarely a 50/50 split when it comes to college classes. Most classes lean heavily toward one or the other. Biochemistry and ochem were the only classes I took where the split was about even.
I don't think academics should make you argue only for points you agree with, but instead teach you the different ways one may interpret any piece of media, so I don't think having both sensible and completely insensitive interpretations of a story as an assignment is bad in and of itself. But then going ahead and assigning these interpretations based on gendered viewpoints so that everyone gets the one they are more likely to agree with is just dumb.
But isn’t this about The Yellow Wallpaper story? A story in which a man imprisons his wife within a yellow bland room because of ‘hysteria’ until she actually goes crazy and starts hearing voices? In the end she has a full mental break. 

Having the guys write a thesis about how a man has the right to imprison his mental distressed wife seems very anti-feminist.
I would argue that it's very much anti-feminist to ignore the overt commentary on gender that The Yellow Wallpaper is making and instead read it as a literal haunting. That reading strips away all of the context of the story, which is rooted in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's experience being treated much the same as the narrator was (which did not, to my knowledge, involve ghosts) and finding it utterly soul-crushing. Ignoring the gendered aspects misinterprets and defangs a very pointed feminist piece.

And IMO the other thesis given for men is even worse- the closest you can get to a non-awful interpretation is that John means well even as he's hurting her, but that's still abuse apologia, because it's focusing on the allegedly good intentions of an abuser instead of the harm their actions cause. This is especially offensive considering that it's excusing away the trauma the author actually experienced.

Also tone doesn't always come through well in text, so I just wanna say that I'm not trying to rip you a new one or say you're an antifeminist or anything like that. I'm upset with the shitty assignment and the awful theses it gives, not with you.
There were certainly contemporary women who took the side that the woman was being genuinely cared for. It's hard to notice water when you're a fish. There were certainly contemporary men who took the side that the woman was being oppressed. Men might be collectively motivated to maintain their privileges, but it's always up to the individual whether or not to take it. 

What benefit would the modern student take from taking the book out of it's historical context and substituting an echo of the modern student's position within gendered society, across an artificial line that wasn't held the reception that this book was originally received in?
Please update!
Go the chaotic route: Your thesis is about how the husband and society are trying to force the wife into a heteronormative life in which she feels her role as ""wife"" and gender as ""female"" does not align with who she actually is. Thus showcasing the fact that by the teacher insisting on using binary gendered language to assign the thesis topics they took are forcing a narrative upon you that does not fit, thus becoming the husband in the short story.

Side note, I've always loved The Yellow Wallpaper for exactly the fact that there are so many ways to interpret the story without ever being explicitly right or wrong.

Edit: grammar
This. Men don’t need help sympathizing with John.
I agree I was doublely disappointed that male was assigned sympathy of the male protagonist. If the goal is to challenge preconceptions about the world, this assignment is not doing that.

You probably may, you never know. But it sucks that the assignment is based on birth month. Like it would make more sense if it was first initial or last name initial type of thing that you could decide.
Discrimination based on gender
I’m a professor myself. I would recommend that for the credit, you do the assignment, picking whichever gender you think fits you best on the day you’re doing it, or whichever gender’s prompt you like best at the time, or else flipping a coin since they’re all shitty prompts. As for reporting, you could wait until you talked to the prof after her return.
idk how to say it without getting cussed out or called transphobic. i can see both perspectives, both reasons why the other is wrong or why they are right. 

i dont need people to tell me why its wrong, i know why its wrong, i just understand that people always think its not a big deal. ive already accepted that people arent going to change, ive already accepted that people arent going to empathise with the lgbtq community. or maybe they simply cant empathise, they dont know that its a big deal. they always say ""suck it up"" because they think its fine. now i want to say that the truth is, its not a big deal, but i know i cant, and i know that it isnt for some people.

its a way to make groupings more fun and interesting,  i realise that, and it works considering how boring school work is. 

i realise now i may or may not have phrased my first comment wrong, what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.
Yeah where the fuck was the critical thinking in designing this assignment? does it not make more sense to have the men think about why the husband is being patriarchal and controlling and to have the women look at why the husband might think he’s trying to help even if they appear uncaring?
Not only that, but the author wrote something called ""Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper"" and she confirmed that it was about being treated badly by male mental health professionals. The fucking author herself confirmed that the main character is the victim and John was a POS.
(Not relevant to OP at all but) I am heartened somewhat that it's the sciences that are evenly split 😊
Thesis Defense and Interperetation Lessons Should Not Be Mixed.

There is a difference between ""Here is an assigned thesis defend it no matter how fucked up it is"" and something like ""Here's an interperetation try and dissect how someone would come to think it and then discuss how defensible you find it.""
This assignment actually surprised me most because of its limited interpretations of the story. I always thought of it as more nuanced than all of these - it's about more than power to John. It's about the societal expectation that a man be able to care for his wife in a way that makes her well, especially being a doctor himself. He actually thinks he is protecting her from herself and ruining his reputation by keeping her in there under the guise of love. It's more complicated in the sense that John is acting on society's expectations at the time for the best way to provide care, which turned out to be damaging for mental health - seclusion and ""bedrest"" for depression is the opposite of helping. It not only addresses feminism but also the medical model of Healthcare. Beautiful stuff. Really loved reading it in college and discussing it. This assignment reeks of misogyny and a lack of understanding that we exist.
Just adding here…

https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf

In case anyone was interested.

I also assume it’s THIS story that the assignment is about…

This site is a free version of the story where I am, hopefully also free for all….
That is the story and the plot, yes. I think we're interpreting the prompts fairly differently though, the one about John caring for the narrator and being well-meaning says nothing about having a 'right' to imprison his wife; I interpreted it as having the potential to be an analysis of intent vs impact, and is more of a character assessment than anything.

I don't disagree that having the men of the class write in defense of a man who clearly abused his wife is tasteless and potentially harmful, but John's motives are a valid topic to write on, and the prompt doesn't imply his actions were justified at all-- that's an entirely different thesis.
Yeah, the guy in this shitty thesis assignment must be related to Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre?🫣
I guess I was reading too far past the prompts' face-values, haha. I thought a literal reading could be an interesting twist, and figured the class had likely already gone over the actual intentions of the story and commentary that Gilman was making, so I saw the prompt not so much ignoring what The Yellow Wallpaper says as a fiction, but playing with what it would mean as a real journal, as it was written in-universe by the character of the narrator... if that makes any sense. But that completely ignores that in-universe the narrator is experiencing hallucinations and the implications that come with that.

I agree completely about the prompt about John, I was thinking too much about what **I'd** write if given this assignment, and I would've taken the impact vs intent approach with a focus on impact, but ignored that the prompt does not set a student up for that, and definitely frames the feelings of an abuser as the focal point.

I appreciate your thoughts!! It sucks a little to realize my interpretation was naive, but that's not your fault and I took no offense from reading your perspective. I appreciate the clarification of tone as well and want to echo it haha!
The idea that there wasn't conservative women or progressive men, would be very reductive.
Minor update I still haven’t received a response
Okay but I actually love this angle for analysis.
Noted, thank you.
>what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.

Okay that makes more sense for sure. Yeah it's clear that from their perspective there's nothing harmful about how it's done

But nahhh ... splitting them into groups is all fair and good, but doing it by gender this way – as well as tasking half the males with *defending an abusive husband* – is just not even remotely a good way to do it
this was exactly my thought. if they're going to gender something like this at least use it to broaden people's mindsets a bit
In my moms english class she does a lense assignment where everyone is randomly assigned a lense and she says its really annoying how painfully slow it takes some guys to understand a feminist lense.
If this is about Charlotte Perkins Gilman, i just learned that this author was very very racist even for her own time. I'm bringing this up bc i think it's important not to divorce an author from their work even if their work does have value not tied to their bigotry, especially since their bigotry may even seep into the work. You know, the easiest example is Rowling where you may like the books, and they teach some generalized good values but also have anti-Semitism and racism weaved throughout. If someone recommended Rowling today I'd wonder if they didn't know about the bigotry or didn't care. (I'm not saying this about you or anyone else in the thread I'm just saying all this in case someone wants to read the book, that they're aware!)
Depends on the science but definitely when taken overall! Comp sci, physics and to some degree chemistry are still male dominated. Biology is female dominated (I say this as a trans guy who's a biologist, although I'm a bioinformatician, so I did pick the most male-dominated subfield). So classes like ochem and biochemistry which are taken by chem majors and bio majors (all premeds in general) end up more evenly split. 

It's really the humanities and social sciences that lean the most heavily toward one gender. My little sister is studying speech-language pathology at the same school where I did my undergrad and every. single. student. in her cohort of 60 people is a cis woman -- not one man or trans person. Part of it is ofc going to be a product of the fact that there are more women who get college degrees than men so when a major is female dominated, it can be *really female dominated.* But I also think there's less stigma for women in male-dominated fields than the reverse. ""Breaking down barriers"" vs ""intruding"" or [insert homophobic slur here].
Yes exactly this. ""Support or oppose this interpretation"" it involves more thought to it as well. If I *just* have to support a statement it's easy to do becausei just have to pick out a few supporting points and defend it. But if I'm faced with needing to support or oppose it. I have to think about which option would be most sensible to defend given the informstion on hand, and not just make the argument to support it--but make the argument for why you are supporting it instead of opposing it (or vice versa).
Yeah, I can see where you're coming from about the second prompt. Like, the more I think about it, a literal haunting doesn't necessarily detract from the piece thematically. Like, if you read it that way, John's still ultimately responsible- he brought the narrator out to the house, insisted on putting her in a haunted room, and ignored her (correctly) identifying that there was a ghost. Plus that creates room for interesting parallels between the ghost of a woman who presumably also suffered under misogyny ultimately harming the narrator and the other women who help John control the narrator- I think you could get a solid analysis paper out of that reading.

The prompt's still complete dogshit because the instructions are all about finding evidence for the haunting rather than analyzing what it means, but thinking about the story in the lens of ""this is all real and the narrator imagined nothing"" is interesting food for thought.
Thank you for this heads up! I'd forgotten all about that tbh
Knowing how male-dominated sciences are in general is what make it so warm to me to hear it being relatively even in some sciences 😊

Yeah the humanities you've described matches with my experiences too. Ugh, *intruding.* Can't wait for that to be a relic of the past

I’m new here. I’m a single dad hoping to find resources or suggestions or whatever to best support my kid, thanks for any help! ❤️		"Good on you for being supportive! I’m not a parent so I can’t give advice on that side, but it’s good to do your best to listen to your child, and if you have any questions, don’t be afraid to ask them. I’m sure your kid will be happy to answer them for you!
Nice support reply!

Often people who use they/them pronouns identify as non-binary. Non-binary can be seen as one way of being transgender, because no-one is assigned non-binary at birth (but not all non-binary people would use the term transgender for themselves, so ask your kid first).

You could look at the Trans Ally Guide from PFLAG. Most of the advice is applicable to non-binary people too.

https://pflag.org/sites/default/files/2020-Trans%20Ally%20Guide%20Revised.pdf

https://pflag.org/
No specific advice. Just continue being a great parent. You’re doing a good job.  They may change their mind. It’s a confusing time. But better to figure it out now than repress it.
You're already doing great! Being accepted by your loved ones for who you are is all any of us ever really want. Especially when it comes to going against social 'norms' for us enbys. Just listen to your kid, dont judge and do the research in your own time. You'll get there!
Ask your kid whether they want you to tell any extended family and friends about their pronouns and gender identity. I would have loved if my parents showed me how they could be supportive allies; it can mean a lot not to have to come out repeatedly, so see if your kid wants help with that!
i'm so proud of you for being unconditionally accepting! you're doing great. i'm not sure how well-versed you are in the nuances of gender, so i'll break some key points down for you:

* the first of these points is that gender is a spectrum. not just a linear sliding scale of male to female, but a vast array of different identities and expressions. because of this, it's difficult to quantify how many genders there are. gender is also a social construct, so everyone has different experiences with it.
* gender identity is different but not entirely divorced from gender expression. identity is one's internal feelings. expression is how they choose to present themself.
* people who use they/them pronouns are usually nonbinary (or enby, for short, but some people don't like that). nonbinary can be used to describe an identity, full stop, or as an umbrella term to describe more specific identities. some of these identities that fall under this umbrella term include: 
   * genderfluid (someone whose gender identity fluctuates) 
   * bigender/pangender (someone who encompasses both or all parts on the gender spectrum) 
   * agender (someone without a gender, such as myself) 
   * demigender (someone who feels a partial affinity to a certain gender)
   * androgyne (someone who falls somewhere in the middle of the gender spectrum)
* ask your kid if there are any resources or assistance they might want, such as a legal name change, new clothes, a gender therapist, puberty blockers or hrt (hormone replacement therapy) or a binder, if they're afab (assigned female at birth). 
* don't worry about making mistakes. everyone screws up names and pronouns from time to time. if your heart is in the right place and you correct yourself, that's what matters. in a similar vein, in my experience, most trans people are shy about correcting people on their pronouns, so i'd encourage your kid in this regard.
* try to do some research, to learn about what they may be experiencing. [the gender dysphoria bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi) is an excellent resource. i'm sure your kid would appreciate your reading it, and you'll gain some perspective that'll definitely help you be a good ally. 
* lastly, ask them questions! ask us questions! it's ok not to know all the things. hell, i'm nonbinary myself and i still don't understand a lot of this stuff. if you're willing to learn and to listen, they'll be willing to teach you and talk about it with you. 

your kid is really lucky, and i salute you in your open-mindedness. the world needs more parents like you. <3
Maybe ask if they have another name they want to go by. Though they didn’t say anything about it when you said their name, I’m sure they’d appreciate the gesture. Listening is most important and you texted that immediately, so I think you’ll be just fine.
youre already doing better than most parents by accepting them. i would ask if they have another name they prefer going by, but otherwise theyll let you know what they want. just continue having an open mind.
Please be sure to ask them who they are comfortable with you telling about them. Some people want others to speak on their behalf as they are too anxious to do it themselves, others want it to be a more personal conversation that they want to have at the right time. I still resent my mother for not respecting my privacy and telling everyone she knew before I wanted to be fully out.

Edit: Also just wanted to say that you're a wonderful parent. I wish my parents were that respectful of gender identity and willing to learn
Just supporting them and putting forward the effort you have to accept and understand them is amazing! It’s okay if you mess up every once and a while because it’s clear that they trust you and know you’re going to love them no matter what. Just be sure to be open and ask questions if you need to! Taking an interest in your child’s identity let’s them know you respect it and them :)
The best resource is your child. Listen earnestly and let them tell you what they need.

Also don’t be afraid of making mistakes. Everyone that works in or deals with issues around DE&I of any kind makes mistakes. What’s important is recognising your mistakes and correcting behaviour.
You're already doing amazing!

Like other commenters have said, educating yourself is a big plus, but you seem to be doing fine already. Another thing is that you could ask your kid how else you can support them. For instance, my friends asked me whether I'd still be okay with them calling me ""sweetie"" or ""honey"" since they're gendered nicknames.

Just listen to your kid and they'll probably let you know what they need with time. You seem like a great dad!
Pronoun tip: If you keep slipping up on pronouns, remember to use they/them for your kiddo when they are not there, and when you are thinking about them. 
This post makes me so happy!
Awww, we love a supportive parent! I’m Ray, by the way, and I use they/them pronouns as well. 

Okay, so I can recommend some literature to help start you off. It’s a small but intensely helpful selection, I find.

- “Life’s Not Binary”, Meg-John Barker and Alex Iantaffi
- “A Quick and Easy Guide to They/Them Pronouns”, Archie Bongiovanni and Tristan Jimerson
- “Gender: A Graphic Guide”, Meg-John Barker and Jules Scheele

Also, a short film that I found quite interesting and has some good explanations is “Pronoms” (it’s a French production but YouTube has English captions). Some trans YouTubers I like and find educational are Jamie Raines/Jammidodger (a trans man), Samantha Lux (a trans woman), and Ash Hardell (a non-binary person).

Being non-binary is very hard. The world is currently not a very hospitable place for us. Plus, it is a common thing to feel really conflicted about your identity - internalised transphobia feels terrible and sometimes we need help to stay anchored in ourselves. Your kid may also experience dysphoria about parts of the way they present themselves. They may ask for a binder (a piece of clothing to make your chest flat), a packer (a device to make it look like you have a... do I really need to say it?), or something as simple as a haircut and some new clothes. Whatever they experience is unique to them - I want a binder and a haircut as well as some new clothes because I feel dysphoric about my chest and my appearance being androgynous. This is my experience, your kid’s will probably be different.

Ultimately, your child needs love and a listening ear. Talk to them and make sure you understand how they feel about things. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me! I love helping out fellow enbies and their families!

It is an incredible thing to see a supportive dad. Mine isn’t so much, hence my closeted self. Thank you for understanding your child and loving them no matter what. It seems like that should be the baseline, but it really isn’t.

Godspeed, incredible human being! ❤️❤️❤️

This is so based! Kudos for supporting your child.
The only advice I can give is that you two talk as often as you feel is necessary. This is a subject with a lot of nuance and depending of their age, it might be confusing sometimes, for both you and them. Regardless of any literature on the matter, the most important is that your child feels happy, validated and loved and considering what you’ve showed, you people are on the right track ((:
You want suggestions or whatever?

Suggestion 1: Keep doing what you are doing. This is incredible support and respect for your kid. I think everyone here is proud of you. But not only that, keep on it like this. Keep looking for more ways to help, more resources, more suggestions. Be an *active* ally like you are being right now.

Suggestion 2: Listen. Ask questions that you feel won’t be too uncomfortable for me them and just listen. Learn more about them, understand them. You’ve got a chance to meet your kid again, and that in and of itself is something to take to heart. But not only that, your asking them the questions gently and welcomingly helps coming out about other parts of this *so much* easier. You might be catching them off guard, but if you do it in the right way it’s welcoming, supportive, and it helps people feel less afraid. Not only that, but it’s often *really* hard to feel cared for in your personal, physical life if you’re non-binary. You’re showing them you care if you ask questions.

Suggestion 3: Be very deliberate and very openly affirming when it is safe to do so. Ask who they want to know or if they want you to tell people, but when they’re not around people who they’re not out to, try and use their pronouns actively to affirm. If they have a new name, use it a *lot.* I can’t count the number of times I have started crying tears of *joy* because of that. 

Suggestion 4: Defend their identity no matter the context. If they are out or if they aren’t, knowing that others have our backs and are there to protect us is a massive comfort. Having someone who cares to understand is that can step up to spar for us when we can’t ourselves is especially important. And having others defend our right to exist and our identity when we aren’t out? It helps us feel safe, in the world and when we’re with those who do that with us.

I’ll come back with more later, including some resources. I wish my parents were as supportive as you when I first came out, though. You’re doing things *very* well.
Thank you for supporting your child. You are already waaaay ahead of many parents. Your instinct to let your child lead the way is a very good one :)
Phenomenal answer! The best thing you can do is hold space for them in a nonjudgmental manner to talk to you about these things if/when they feel comfortable! It looks like you're doing a great job of that already!
*pat*
If you want to use free resources you can use this subreddit, and r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns. And other LGBT+ subreddit's. Those should help you and your kid.
I am glad to see people aren’t living my family dynamics.  :) 

My (32) father would mock me and refuse to acknowledge it.
Not to be too stalkery, but I peeped your userpage and saw a bunch about a certain team and kept goin and saw you post to the same local subreddit as i do :3 (well, did; i just left that area like a week ago) 

Theres actualy some good local groups for support there too; tho i dont haf any contact info or anything to point you towards there xD But thats just cuz i cant ever remembr that stuff. One of them does a monthly meetup (tho its been online thru discord recently) called they/them thursdays and i dont doubt at all that the folks there wud love to get to kno you both and wud be a good place to start as folks there wud be able to point to the local resources and groups that may be of interest.
I use they/them pronouns too, and my dad basically said the same thing you did and it felt great! You didn't make a big deal about it, but offered your ear to listen. I think you're doing a good job so far. One thing my family has difficulty with is switching from ""brother/sister"" to ""sibling"" or ""son/daughter"" to ""kid"" so don't forget those!
Honestly just supporting them is good enough I'm not comfortable enough to tell my parents because that are a bit conservative just having a parent backing you up telling you it's okay is enough in and of its self
You're already doing great! Your kid is so lucky to have you. I wish my dad would have been this supportive. He tries to call me by my chosen name which I appreciate, but will not refer to me using my pronouns. When I told him I want to be referred to as they/them, he said ""you know how I feel about that"" and walked away. He doesn't think it's logical. Some people's parents are much less accepting so I'm glad he calls me by my chosen name, but I wish I had a dad as accepting and supportive and open to listening as you are. You are doing amazing!!
WE STAN SUPPORTIVE FATHER AND KID WHO GATHEReD UP THE COURAGE TO TELL SUPORTIVE FATHER
as a nonbinary person who doesn’t talk to their dad, this made me bawl my eyes out. you couldn’t have been more supportive. my only advice is to be open to any additional things this might mean for them( ie name change, hormones or surgeries). I would recommend getting the book Beyond The Gender Binary by Alok V Menon, it is short and sweet and explains nonbinary identities on a very base level. I’m sure it would also make your kid very happy to get them a copy (it’s ages 12+)!
The easiest way to go about it is like how if you were writing an example of a person who doesn’t need to have a gender listed, because the person is hypothetical for an example. 

But ya. There are dozens of sites also explaining it in further depth. It would be like if everyone kept calling you she/her in their descriptions of you (even after correction in many cases), and finally someone listened that you were actually a he/him. That would feel good.
You are doing great! Keep listening and you’ll be fine.
thank god for supportive parents. you sir are a legend
this makes me really happy! i love seeing supportive parents. as someone who is non binary, i think the best thing is just being there for them. another big thing is to just listen to them. don’t be afraid to ask questions about how they’re feeling, just make sure they are comfortable with the questions you are asking. i wish you the best!!!
The fact that you're here asking questions is a great sign! Just listen to your kid. They might still be figuring things out, and they might decide to change their pronouns again or even a few times after this, but just keep in mind that they will always know their own gender better than you or anyone else. As long as you're open-minded, willing to listen, and supportive, you're already doing way better than most. 💕
thank you for existing as a parent
there's lots of great advice here, but i would just add that you should always ask who they're out to! in general, just take your cues from them; sometimes i want my parents to tell someone my new name/pronouns for me, sometimes i don't, so just clarify (: and i'm sure you'll do great regardless; if you're willing to make the effort to be supportive and ask people about it, you're bound to do a pretty good job.
You’re doing amazing, you seem like a wonderful and kind dad and you should keep that up. But the biggest piece of advice I can give is that there is a line between supportive and intrusive. I’m sure your kid would be willing to answer your questions, but if they don’t want to answer or can’t, that’s ok! Making sure they feel comfortable around you and comfortable telling you things is immensely important. I have a fear of opening up to my parents about things because they cross that line and start to drift away from supportive. But all in all, you seem like a great dad.
First, you are slaying this dad thing! 

As you can see you have come to the right place for advice and encouragement in supporting your kid as they embrace their authentic self. Along with the wonderful advice offered by so many, I would like to add that it's important to find support for yourself as well. 

No matter how supportive and accepting you are you will have your own struggles, rather questions, or perhaps even grief - and that is valid. As your kid comes out more, if they so choose, the adults in your lives are either going to accept it, question it, or completely revolt against it which will require you to upgrade your armor as you yourself faces discrimination while protecting your child.

Does your community have a local queer or rather LGBTQ+ community center? Many resources such as support groups, positive group outings and activities, or even after school meet ups can be found there for your kid as well as parental allies such as yourself. PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays - outdated branding) could be a wonderful resource for you to engage with other supportive families. Lastly, take your kid to a Pride festival if you get the chance, there is nothing more validating then being around a bunch of people like you or at least those who embrace all of you. Tis why we celebrate pride. 

Brother, you are one of the good ones; take care of yourself, your kid, and welcome to the community. We are pretty fabulous!
im glad you’re looking to stand with your kid <3 i know my own father had trouble with they/them pronouns, since in his mind they can only be plural, so if you have trouble with that, try imagining them as a swarm of bees (idea from a tumblr user i cant remember the name of. if anyone knows, please lmk!) it seems silly, but it works, weirdly enough
You seem to already be doing an amazing job and it's awesome that you're seeking out ways to be the best parent you can. Just be supportive and open and you're already off to an awesome start 😊
I want that
this is so wholesome! you're both doing great :)
If you find yourself struggling with pronouns, every time you mess up (even in your head), say it right three times out loud in a sentence. It’s what I do, and it only takes a few times to get it down
Good one here: 

https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/10-ways-step-ally-non-binary-people
Just respect there pronouns and love them like your always have simple as that :)
i love to see it! the biggest thing you can do is to just keep an open mind and *listen.* an accepting parent (and yk people in general) is all most ppl hope for when coming out. if you need help using they/them pronouns, this is a great way to practice. https://www.practicewithpronouns.com/#/?\_k=uq4ve2
Mostly it’s as simple as using their correct pronouns and asking how to refer to them. I do  recommend asking if you don’t understand, it may make them feel validated and happy to know that you support them fully.
Good for you for being supportive!
one thing you can do if you want is to check if there’s support groups in your area for young trans and nonbinary people, and even ones for their parents. on the off chance that you’re from the czech republic, there’s an org here called transparent that hosts these, and it’s super helpful to hear other people’s stories. for your child it might help them feel more secure in their identity or more safe to explore it more and make more friends who know what they’re going through, and for you it can help you get to know more parents of kids like yours and learn a bit more! 

honestly though, you’re a wonderful parent and your child is lucky to have you.
It looks like your kid trusts you a lot, I think you’re doing a great job so far. I would advise asking them if there are any people they want to stay in the closet with, just in case. There are some people who I prefer to not know I am non-binary, and so I ask my friends not to use they/them around such people. So it’s good to know!
I-🥺 I’m genuinely about to cry...
My advice is to respect their pronouns and be open to talking with them about their identity
Ya’ll are the best, I can’t properly tell you how much I appreciate and value your stories, words of advice, and kindness. This community is just so beautiful.
I’d recommend some documentaries: Gender Revolution and A most dangerous year. Both inspiring and informative. I found that joining support groups for parents was eye-opening and helpful. Check out  https://transfamilies.org/ 

I’m going through a similar experience recently DM if you’d like to connect and share.
I'm not crying, just sweating through my eyes
Thank you for your response, I'm trying to do my best :)
Thank you for the encouragement. Any insight on what brings confusion with all this? I mean, obviously it's a tumultuous time for my child, but are there any ways I can make things less confusing for them?
Couldn't have said it better myself
> Being accepted by your loved ones for who you are is all any of us ever really want

Right? And how easy is it to affirm someone who is trying to be true to themselves? I don't understand individuals that aren't supportive, it makes me really sad.
And definitely ask about it before you do, these things can be very personal and just going and telling about it to others easily comes off as a breach of trust. My mom just told all my relatives from her side and I don't know what else she has told, I feel like I can't tell her anything without expecting the rest of the world getting to know about it too.
> your kid is really lucky, and i salute you in your open-mindedness. the world needs more parents like you. <3

you don't know how much this means to me, things have been rough since their mom and I split and I feel like I'm fucking up one thing after another. Thank you for sharing those kind words
this is such a sweet and thorough reply 😭💜
> youre already doing better than most parents by accepting them

This straight up made me cry. We all deserve unconditional love, especially from our parents.
Only people I’ve told are all you wonderful people. I was planning on asking them if they’d like me to tell anyone or be with them while they share.

/u/Quinn_Reed - I'm sorry your mom took that from you. I know I'm not your dad, but as a dad I'm so proud of you (and everyone else here fighting for equality) for being mindful of others and their journey, and for being such a positive encouraging person.
Thank you for this <3
Hi Ray, thank for taking the time to share some of your story and these resources, I'll definitely be looking into these things very soon!
Additional on suggestion 3: If your kid is in that not yet out stage and has a name they dont like... You can also use words like sport and kiddo, and even just sayin folks/kids instd of guys, cud go a long way to making them feel less dysphoric  even when they have to be less out for whatever reason that may be. 

No ones gonna bat an eye at a dad callin his kid every nickname imaginable eithr cuz its the dad thing to do to use such words
This makes me really sad. I acknowledge you and who you know you are, full-stop, no strings attached <3 Shine your light
Salem is an enormous small town, I don't socialize with many people but it's almost guaranteed we have some common friends/acquaintances. Another poster suggested I check out Rainbow Youth here, seems like we've got some decent resources here
> just having a parent backing you up telling you it's okay is enough in and of its self

I can't imagine not feeling supported or comfortable enough to share. So if you ever need a listening ear, I'm happy to listen. I've got your back, you're valuable and worthy of love, keep your head up <3
Thank you for sharing that, I'm sad your dad isn't accepting of your pronouns. And I just want to say, logic has nothing to do with any of this and I think it's an unfortunate excuse for being close minded :(
Thank you for sharing your insight! Im a good listener if you ever need a dad to talk to ❤️
You are worthy of love and intentionality, I'd love to listen if you'd like someone to talk to. And that goes for anyone else as well.
I hope they’re happy tears!
Hi going through a similar experience recently dm if you’d like to connect and share, I'm dad.
Just believe them, one of the hardest things kids go through (myself included) is being told their confused when they come out as anything under the trans umbrella. Just be there for them, sometimes gender identities change and that’s completely normal! just try to be supportive and listen to them. i’m sure that’s all they want 💙💙💙
Oh man, I would never ever take that away from my kid. This is their story to tell and I'm just here to support and help.
of course! (nice flair btw)
we do. which is why i appreciate you offering your love and support unconditionally to this child.
Hey buddy, one of my kids came out as they/them non-binary last year. It’s been an interesting year and it’s going very well. They are still in middle school. If you ever want to talk to another parent of an NB you can hit me up.
👍👍
Rainbow Youth is def one of the good ones that i cudnt think of the name of. I kno several frends that were part of that and have nothing but good to say about their experiences
Yeah he bases everything in logic and I have to explicitly ask him to put his logic aside for the sake of my feelings if I hope to get any positive response from him :( I'm a very logical person, but the difference between him and me is that I don't use logic as an excuse to disregard people's feelings.
that is so kind of you, thank you so so much :)
I know mine were. This internet stranger is incredibly proud of you and a teensy bit jealous of your kid now.
Beautiful advice, thank you for sharing ❤️
I'm sad I can only upvote this once.
Absolutely reasonable but I'd also like to add- have the conversation anyways because they may *want* your help in spreading the info. Coming out is hard. It's scary and puts yourself on the platter for everyone to see. 

When I came out to my mom, I actually wanted her help coming out to family members. She sees them every week, multiple times. I live across the country. It's important they know, but it would be taxing for me to have to call everyone and explain it, especially to family I only see once every two years or so. 

Yet later I found out she wouldn't talk to anyone about it because it was ""my business to share"", ignoring that I had made the choice to ask her for help in sharing info. 

Point is- as others have said, ask! It'll help make sure you're both on the same page, and your lovely child doesn't feel you don't care due to a misunderstanding one way or another.
I'd also like to point out that there is nothing illogical about any of this, it's not abnormal or weird, your dad and people like him find it illogical because they can't or won't allow themselves to experience a different perspective.
This is such excellent advice, thank you for sharing your experience :)
That's very true! He has his views of what is logical and what isn't and he doesn't want to change them. He was talking about a memory from my childhood and referred to me as my birthname and when I told him to call me by my new name, he said that it's illogical because in that memory I still went by my birthname. I understand where he's coming from, but that's ridiculous. My birthname not only makes me uncomfortable because of how feminine it is, but it's an actual trigger for other reasons. It took hours to convince him to not use it when talking about the past and during the entire conversation, he kept playing devil's advocate to whatever I said without even telling me it was just for the purpose of devil's advocate. I believed the entire time that he really meant what he was asking when it was just for contradictory purposes.
Of course!! You're already taking tremendous steps to support your kiddo, and I really applaud that. 

Some more generalized advice- practice using they/them to refer to your kid, even outside of talking to them/ round them. You can do this in the mirror, talking to yourself, the cat, etc. I've also found success in retraining the brain by doing silly things like pretending the other person always has a secret mouse friend in their pocket. Gotta refer to them both ;). This method also minimizes slip ups. They will happen, but when you're transitioning (ha) into this, it's about damage control first, perfection later. 

Another thing, and I'm sorry if this has been repeated- when you inevitably goof up, say thank you when you're corrected, and move on. Don't make it a huge show of apologizing. Thisll just make it really uncomfortable for your kiddo and make them feel like correcting you is going to be a burden. Plus it makes them usually reply with ""it's okay"" which feels kind of rubbish when you're still feeling a little stung over it. 

Accept the mistake gracefully, take steps to improve the next time, and let the onus of corrections and learning be on you. Of course kiddo will probably be thrilled to talk about this stuff, but if they're anything like me and my fellow nonbinary crew, kiddo will be even MORE impressed if you are asking informed questions. Mind you this last part about informed questions might be a more ""down the proverbial road"" once you've established some groundwork, but I find step 2 and 3 to be just as important if not more than just the step 1, if you'll excuse my rambling."	nlaj62	NonBinary	1223	1.0	2021-05-26 06:56:14
Me for my sister’s wedding. I was a “BridesPerson” 😆 also I’m releasing a song at midnight and I am STRESSED! (Support Trans Artists 🏳️‍⚧️)		"Half of me wants to say how dapper you look, the other half is seething with envy over that outfit lmao.
Where can your music be found? I'd love to add another trans artist to my listens!
My dude you look AMAZING
If anyone wants to listen to the song (completely optional but I appreciate it) you can find it [HERE](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/lydarlo/therapy)
Wonderful suit. You look great. AND you've got the song tonight!!!
You look fly AF. Where did you get that suit??
Dapper as fuck
Wow you look incredibly elegant! Your suit is everything that is right in this world and I'm lowkey jealous
I was a Groomsperson last weekend!!! Best wishes to you and your sister!
I love every single bit of this look! Best of luck with your release!
Absolutely stunning! Very handsome
Wow! also whats the song? Where can I find it? I NEED TO HEAR IT!
You look amazing! That’s such a dapper and distinguished suit.
Lookin' good, boss!
Nice suit and good song.
you are the absolute cutest hope you had a great time
You look fantastic and you're gonna do great 

Also my roommates/best friends called the us the People Of Honor because there was only one person in the wedding party with a gender 😂
You look amazing 👌 Absolutely nailed the outfit!
Looking mighty sharp! I am going to check out that site where you got your suit. I was in my cousin’s wedding this summer, and just bit my tongue and wore the dress. I just pretended I was in drag but I just didn’t feel like myself. I want to be brave like you and be myself in all my trans masc non-binary butch dyke badass ways. Good luck with the music release!! I’ll take a listen!

Edit: I listened! Great hook! I followed on Spotify, looking forward to hearing more in the future!
Yay, I love this!!! And you look super great!!
You look so dapper.  I like the suit and shoes
 Congratulations on releasing a song.
You look so handsome!!!!! I love that suit - the pattern is hard to pull off for a lot of people but it works so well for you! Congratulations to your sister and I hope your song hits hard (don’t forget to share a link with us)!!!

eta: I found the link in the comments! The song is great!!!!!
Dapper look!! I love the suit fabric!
Damn that's a sharp lookin suit
you almost remind me of aziraphale from with the gender fluidity of crowley? (good omens) an aura i PRAY i could achieve!!!!!
[removed]
Ahh thanks so much, the song is Therapy by Lyd Arlo, it should be out now on Spotify actually!
Ahhh thanks so much!!!
I like it 👌 Followed you on Spotify 😊
This is dope!!! I look forward to hearing more from you! Someday I'll remember this reddit moment fondly when you're dropping albums and playing on the radio and whatever your goals/dreams may hold. That suit is great, you're doing great, and it shows!
Just listened on youtube, loved the tune and your voice!
Jacamo online! Not a lot of options for plus size men’s suits in the uk :/
Thanks so much! You’re too kind :)
Thanks so much!! The song is Therapy by Lyd Arlo
It’s on Spotify now actually!! Let me know if you find it! Also it’s coming to bandcamp in less than 3 hours [Freaks out internally]
Okay that’s fine! You do you :)
On Apple Music also maybe?
Looks great!
I would recommend, this song is wonderful. Very Kimya Dawson and Antsy Pants. Great job!

It's been a rough time for me. Could use some validation or support. (Mattie, they/them)		"You♡are♡loved♡and♡valid!!
ur facial hair n head hair reminds me a lot of mine. A big ty for repping a hugely underrepresented hair style. It can be hard when every single person posting here is flush with thick hair so a real heartfelt ty for helping represent me and others :) U have a kind face n id defo be ur friend, u can get thru this rough time just like u got thru every single tough time so far!  


(I hope i said this all okay, hairs a sensitive topic for me so I'm hoping this doesnt hit a nerve)  


<3   :)
The possibilities remain infinite. Choose your own adventure...
Omg I've never met someone that has the same name as me!! (I spell it Matty) I hope things improve for u :)
Sending warm thoughts to Mattie because they deserve them. ❤
You have such a cute face hehe. 

Also, I love, love, love your eye color. It's such an interesting, velvety shade of brown.
Mattie looks great in that shirt! They deserve only the best, and I hope that things improve for them.
You got beautiful eyes homie, they sparkle.
Hi Mattie! Sorry things have been rough for you lately. Hang in there! You rock and we're all here for you!
I like the way you spell your name! Hope things get better for you! <3 Love your shirt too btw
I've had the recent realization that everything is happening how it's supposed too... Ups & downs... Helps me alot. Big hugs babe x
I hope whatever is troubling you passes quickly! You deserve the best in all things.
aw you’re beautiful! sending love and light 💕💕
Mattie, if anyone tells you you don't look absolutely fabulous, they are dead wrong, and I will make sure it's both. They will be dead as well as being wrong. We, the random strangers on the internet, are here for you. Be strong, my fellow enby. There's someone in the world to hug you!
You look incredible mattie! Your eyes are just absolutely lovely and your beard is quite handsome
Keep going and stay true to yourself. You’ll get through it and grow to be stronger than you know. You don't have to do it alone, you will have lots of love and fun with the right people by your side. On top of that you have nice dark eyelashes, and a cute rosy tint in your cheeks. You’re either great at makeup or have a great complexion. <3
Hey, Mattie. I know things are rough, but you gotta hope they’ll get better. No matter what happens, a positive mindset will help you. You can always recover from what happened. It’ll be okay :3
You’re literally cute like before I even saw the caption I was like omg this cute person I must comment
Keep your head up oh powerful and courageous one! For one day when the light shines brighter than ever it shall pierce whatever darkness plagues you! 

All this to say everything gets better with time y'know :)
I hope things improve for you Mattie.
Ur amazing ^-^
you look like a kind and wonderful person. i love the shirt you’re wearing!
Me too buddy. 
 Also I appreciate the aesthetic quality of your brows!  I would like to give more of a gender affirming comment but unsure how to do so from here. I'm socially challenged and compliments are both difficult for me to give and receive, but I'm doin' my best!
｡ﾟ°(❁ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)⁾…♡ you look so goood i cant
You have such sweet, soulful eyes!!
Keep going! I promise these bad things are only temporary <3
[you're valid. its okie](https://files.catbox.moe/9hggvk.png)
This is a really nice picture, you have lovely eyes :) I hope things ease up for you soon - it is hard as hell to get through general life shit as well as not feeling valid in your own experience. You’re doing awesome just pushing through, and I hope it gets easier <3
you have such sweet eyes! i feel like they reflect a lovely person inside <3 i hope your worries and struggles resolve, and you become even better from it all! (also love ur shirt, such a cute pattern)
You have a super sweet face and a lovely nose. You look like a nice and fun person and I wish you more positive feelings about yourself ❤
You’re amazing Mattie! Stay strong!
👏YOU👏ARE👏VALID👏
Wishing you all the very best, Mattie, you got this!!!! 🏵️🌈🌼💚🌻🥰
you are loved and valid whatever you go you will get through
I am sending love and support. Never forget that there are struggling people and people who love and support you and others in their struggle and success. It will always get better. Believe in that. I used to say during almost every yoga class I taught, patience, compassion, faith to my students as they worked hard class. It became a mantra. A student even tattooed on her body. Be patient with yourself. Be compassionate with yourself. Have faith in yourself. And do so despite the struggle because making it out of the struggle, the ups and downs of daily life is what makes us great. It seems so many here believe in you even if we are offering it as digital support in an age of internet living. Patience. Compassion. Faith. 

And you look great. Believe it. Patience. Compassion. Faith. Eternal. In this life and whatever comes after it.
Hi Mattie, looking good! I love your shirt. Keep your head up! <3
You look so good! That shirt is absolutely your color!
You look amazing!!! You are loved, and completely valid :)
♡
You deserve all validation and support my fellow enby friend! Stay strong
Consider yourself Validated and Supported :P
you are valid! there’s enough valid to go around
Mattie is pretty cool, i love their shirt!
i love your shirt omg! and also you're loved and valid :))
Mattie, your eyes are beautiful so inviting and soft I hope you start feeling better soon much love ❤️
You are cute and I wanna hug you.

What's your preferred way to express yourself? Try to describe it to me in three words (can be adjectives). I wanna know what your vibe is.
As much as my hair--or lack thereof--frequently gives me massive dysphoria, it means a lot for someone to say nice things about it. So thank you so much :)
Well hopefully u opened the floodgates for people to feel a bit more confident to post with similar hair difficulties. I recently did some psychedelics and like 90% got over how i felt about my hair and realised how bad it messed up my mood like 10 times a day. feels so freeing to tie my hair back now and use a colourful scrunchy without being super stressed/depressed (destressed?) about my hairline.  


Hope u figure out some stuff too, to take the edge off the dysphoria at least. One thing thats helped me in the past is remembering all the times ive mentioned my hair problem and the person im talking to says 'what hair problem' or something. Reminds me that other people might be like super self conscious about their nose or something and all theyre looking at on u is ur nose. It's late and my words arent coming out so good XD

&#x200B;

Keep being lovely :)

You look wonderful. I have so many friends in STEM and it's great to hear how it's been growing in inclusivity and so many women and enbys and all sorts of trans and queer folk I know are being accepted and validated. Great to see such a beaming smile too. Was this after the conference?

that's a big difference! if you'll ever visit sweden and you're a snow and mountain person, i can definitely recommend going to Branäs around january. it can be a bit expensive and hard to find a spot since so many people go there on school breaks with their families to go skiing, but it's worth it. me, my family and some relatives were there january this year and we had a big cabin on top of, not really a mountain but almost, like a huge hill. the view was amazing and it was fun to be there. unfortunately i dont know how to skii or snowboard but i want to learn, but we still had fun lol"	wfug7g	NonBinary	989	1.0	2022-08-04 07:04:05
New dress finially arrived and felt cute. Love y'all and thanks for the support. Without it I would have given up on myself ages ago!		"I like the boat neck! 

Worked up the nerve to dress femme in class yet? I’m planning to get a haircut (an undercut on the butch side) before classes start next week.

Singular they through history: a t-shirt (link in comment)		"Gosh, I really don't understand the problem people have with they/them pronouns and how they say they can't understand when even I do and English is not my mother tongue. It makes me so confused. 

My mother tongue is Spanish and I'm taking an English class right know. I can not wrap my head around some of the text we work with going like he/she where I'm like : the fuck man ? Just say they, it's more easy.

Edit: The t-shirt is lovely, I forgot to mention it
I love the Bible passage.  Suck it shitty Christians.
The fact that it's in the Bible (KJV too) is the icing on the cake.
Edit: Oh OP, I didn’t realize you actually made this design. I’m so sorry I got carried away with editing enthusiasm, I thought this was something you’d come across online. Really lovely work overall, seriously. 

- - - 

Wow, I would *almost* buy these for a ton of friends. I love the educational awesomeness, and the way the dates are mixed around kept me reading all the way through. It also makes me happy to see the flag colors representing us proudly while also being useful and making the text more readable. 

But a few design/formatting issues (most notably that 1994 reaching so determinedly across the gutter!) would be hard to ignore in the long run. If I got to be editor for these, I’d ditch all the days of the months, or maybe even only keep the years, in favor of making the columns cleaner; I’d see about replacing the “gripe” definition with something less negative or at least shuffle the order so it isn’t the first word you read; and maybe think harder about how the attributions are formatted overall. (Perhaps “— Author, *Work Title* / Year ”, so the age stands out.)

It seems to be difficult to find enby pride stuff I really feel excited about wearing out of the house. There are fewer options for us than for many other identities, and we’re more likely to get a design that feels like it was included in the set just for completeness — even among otherwise really thoughtful and beautiful handmade artwork. So when I do see something that was made **with us in mind from the start** (like this shirt!) I get excited and end up buying it even if it has a design I wouldn’t otherwise be completely thrilled by.

Fun fact, Terry Pratchett was an ally. Check out Monstrous Regiment to see him writing queer characters with respect.
@u/boffy_b where is a link for this? o.o
Ouh, I love this...I was about to send the link to my partner as a subtle hint😅🎄...just, where can I find it?
I use xe/they pronouns; you can either use singular they/them or use my neopronouns!
THIS MAKES ME HAPPY!!! Unfortunately I cannot buy it at this point, not yet being out to my parents, but I’ll favorite it to hopefully get later. Wonderful shirt.
I Do Quite Like It, However The Fact They're Not In Chronological Order, Or Any Other Order As Far As I Can Tell, Does Bother Me A Bit.
At the risk of being downvoted, I’m going to be slightly pedantic…

All your examples here (with the exception of the *Which Doctor* quote) are of ‘they’/‘them’/‘their’ being used with a nonspecific antecedent; that is, there is not a specific person being referred to, but rather an unspecified, usually hypothetical, person who could be of any gender. 

The *Witch Doctor* quote is a little different. It refers to a specific person (the one at the door) whose identity and characteristics are as yet unknown, and so could be of any gender. 

In all cases, these quotes reference a person whose identity and gender are not known to the speaker or writer. This usage is one which is well-ingrained nowadays, once we got rid of the clunky ‘he or she’ usage and recognized the ambiguity of the generic ‘he’. 

What people are having a challenge in getting used to is ’they’ being used to refer to a *specific* person of (theoretically) specific, known gender. This usage is one with far fewer historical citations available. (I believe they exist, but do not have any currently at hand to suggest.)

Native speakers of a language, and those who learn it organically through immersion, develop a mental concept of “correct” grammar based on how they hear it used. Most people are not consciously aware of this fact, and while they have a feeling of what sounds right or wrong, they cannot put into words what the rule in question actually would be. So they just have the vague feeling of something sounding “wrong”.

I’m not saying we shouldn’t be making the effort to get people to accept singular ’they’. I’m saying that understanding where people’s problem with it comes from will help us help them get used to it. Most people aren’t genuinely trying to be difficult about it; they’re just having trouble making the adjustment to a mental concept of grammar that they themselves have never seriously thought about. 

I think your design would be much better if you can find some citations of ‘they’ referencing a specific, identified person. Again, I believe historical examples of this usage exist, but I don’t have any at hand to suggest.

It has nothing to do with actual English, people just want an excuse for being an asshat
Thanks 😊
Yeah, my dad knows my pronouns and yet he always makes an excuse to call me she/her. Ugh
Some are just wanting an excuse to be mean others are overthinking it because they aren’t used to having to consider it at all so they trip themselves up.
No need to apologise, thanks for the constructive feedback 😀
I love this shirt overall but agree with all of these.
I actually love this t-shirt designe btw.
I Would Definitely Consider Something That Says ""He Or She"" Or Any Variation Of It More Poorly Written Than Something Exactly The Same Except Replacing That With ""They"", I Don't Know If That Makes It More Formal, But I'd Assume Formal Stuff Is Meant To Be Better Written.

Sidenote, The Mentioning Of ""One"" Is Confusing, I Can't Honestly Think Of A Single Situation Where It Would Replace They/Them, Usually The Colloquial Equivalent Is Generic ""You"".
Hi. You just mentioned *Monstrous Regiment* by Terry Pratchett.

I've found an audiobook of that novel on YouTube. You can listen to it here:

Thanks! Whenever you feel right coming out, I hope it goes well.
Fair point, I see where you’re coming from. 

If I put them in chronological order, I’d feel like I’d need to have a more even split of examples from the different centuries. 

I wanted to lean more heavily on the 20th-century ones to drive home the point that as well as being so old, it never fell out of use.
>[**somebody,** ***n.*** A person unknown, indeterminate, or unnamed; someone, some person.](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/184459)

&#x200B;

>[**someone,** ***pron. (and n.)*** Some person, somebody. someone else, used pregnantly to mean ‘a rival for the affections’.](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/184466)

&#x200B;

>[**anyone,** ***pron.*** Frequently in negative, interrogative, and conditional contexts: any person or persons at all; ***even a single individual.***](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/326743) (emphasis mine)

I grant that “anyone” **can** refer to multiple people. The only time I used it on the shirt, however, it unambiguously refers to a single person; it’s immediately followed by “wife” and “husband” in the singular.

Shakespeare did indeed use “thee”. He also used singular “they” and upwards of several other words. I’m not sure what your point is here.
Seems you've missed the entire point of and learned nothing from this very informative and cool tshirt.
Grammatically all three terms are treated as singular. Would you say ""someone are at the door?"" No.
Wrong place silly 😋
Language can change. For example, ""you"" used to only be plural, but over time it became a singular pronoun as well. It also continued to conjugated with ""are"" instead of ""is"", regardless of whether or not the context is singular or plural. So, it follows that ""they"" should be treated no differently. 

Even then, it doesn't matter whether or not you think it's grammatically correct. It's just basic respect to use the pronouns that person wishes used for them. If someone asked you to use he/him for his pronouns, you wouldn't start using she/her in their place, right?

As a non-binary person, I just want to be gendered properly, and singular ""they"" is the only option in the English language that is readily understandable by nearly everyone. But when someone like you tries to spout the rhetoric that it's ""not proper grammar"", all it does is hurt my feelings, because not only is it wrong, it ignores the fact that I'm just asking for something that should be simple to do, and yet, here you are trying to fight having to do it.

TL;DR It doesn't matter whether or not you think it's grammatically correct. It's disrespectful to not use someone's pronouns.
This is the key: don't fall for the distraction argument.

The distraction argument in this case is about english grammar. They don't actually care that much about grammar rules, they just want an excuse to make you feel bad but have some external thing to blame instead of just obviously singling you out.
For real . I mean , I got to know how to use they/them pronouns just by reading and listening other people talk English, it was an osmosis thing.

 They just want to excuse themselves.
This is the correct answer.

In romance languages like mine, taking the gender neutral route affects every declination, so we're making up words in every adjective, etc. It affects whole phrases, and it sounds artificial --because it is--, but people will still respect it or not. Some respect it but won't make the whole effort, because it's honestly asking too much of many, but they still respect it to a certain degree if they care, and they may tell you --and then it depends on how much the person in question is asking of the other. It basically only works among LGTBI circles and people who do with them regularly: you ask of that out of there, and most will paint you as a crazy person.

I laugh every time I see English speakers complaining about *a single word* that is already there. It affects nothing else, it's the easiest thing you can ask of someone, and sounds perfectly fine and aligned with how the language works, so if they have trouble with it, it's because they want to be belligerant.
I don’t think people want an excuse to be an “asshat” it’s just new and will take time for many to get used to it.
I didn't notice you made the T-shirt . I apologize for it ...
For real, the design is so cool my friend. I love black t-shirts and the phrases are perfect
I'm so sorry that happens to you. Is really frustrating :/ . 
It would be awesome people simply respect others' pronouns even if they don't understand. Some people need time to get used to it but it can also be noticed if they are indeed trying or rather they are just ignoring them...
Oof, that’s harsh. We’ve had some tense times with one family member ignoring my spouse’s pronouns too.

Most of them have been chill about it, and even that one seems to have come round now.
Thanks! ☺️

This one needs to get enough upvotes to be the top comment or else it'll hang out down here. I love this shirt!!!
Aww thank you!!
That's Fair, That's Fair. Perhaps It'd Work To Put Them In Alphabetical Order Or Something Then? Idk.
There is someone at the door.

Someone is at the door 

But also 

Can someone open the door 

Can someone pass me my keys 

In the first two it is singular as there is only one person at the door, whereas the second it is plural asking just one person to pass or open something.
>It also continued to conjugated with ""are"" instead of ""is"", regardless of whether or not the context is singular or plural. 

Just a note, I don't believe ""Is"" was ever used outside of the third person, Atleast in common speech (Outside of which I've heard people use, And even used myself, ""Is"" with ""You""), Hence why you say ""I am"" rather than ""I is"", The original Singular equivalent for ""You"" was ""Thou"" which took the form ""Art"". 

Bonus Fun Fact, In some dialects which maintain ""Thou"" or an equivalent, I believe it sometimes takes the third person singular conjugation, I.E. you'd get phrases like ""Tha knows"" or ""Tha wants"", Which'd mean ""You(sing) know"" and ""... want"", Respectively.
This posts point is to show that it’s a common phrase that has been used for a long time. People only mention it when they don’t want to use peoples’ pronouns
I don’t think you have anything to apologise for, and I agree with what your said.

Similar feelings of my own are why I first made the t-shirt for my spouse, before they suggested I should sell it too.
It’s not a problem of not being used to it yet, his argument is that my sex is female even though my genders not and I hate being called female
>The grammar Nazis say otherwise! 😩

~~Well They're Also Referred To By A Term With ""Nazi"" In It, So I'm Not Sure I Want To Listen To Them.~~

Personally To Me ""One"" Just Feels More Formal (Or I Guess Semi-Formal If You Combine It With They, E.G. ""One Must Know Themself"" Instead Of ""One Must Know Oneself""), Although Then Again I Also Use Word Like ""Whence"" And ""Wherefore"" On A Fairly Regular Basis In Normal Speech, So I Don't Think I'm One To Talk Haha.
I think the last two are still singular. The word itself is ""some-one""; you would say ""Can some people open the door"" if the door needed multiple people to open it. It's not referring to one specific person, but it's still referring to one abstract person.
The latter two are still Singular, Compare ""Can I open the door"" or ""Can he pass my keys"", Both pretty unambiguously Singular, But take the same form.

""Can"" is a rather irregular verb, Being followed by the ""Pure"" Infinitive rather than having ""to"" after it, And the same is maintained when it's moved earlier to form a question, I can understand your confusion though as the Infinitive in English is the same conjugation as the primary present tense form, Usually only being differentiated by ""to"" at the start, Which of course is absent here.
Yes it’s a common phrase, but people using it as their only pronouns is new. People, especially older people who knew the person before they changed pronouns, need time to adjust. I don’t think they’re being malicious.
That is awful really :/. It is not fair that you have to be in that situation. Even if it doesn't seem like it , I hope the situation get better someday :c ... if it doesn't it would be time to analyze what you want to do with the relationship because it is in no way an acceptable behavior.
That's true. Not everyone is malicious. When we mention this is more directed towards people that simply do not take the effort to respect other's people pronouns or are blatantly transphobic and want to excuse themselves with the grammar.

When we see people actively trying to get themselves used to they/them pronouns or any pronoun someone have changed to, I think almost everyone is very understanding of it.

Someone told me I wasn’t androgynous enough to be they/them	"Dude kept misgendering me, and when I corrected him he told me he “just doesn’t see me that way” because my presentation “isn’t really androgynous enough”. 

Oh come on! 

My usual presentation is “man bun tech bro”, so it really stung to hear that I’m still not butch enough to have “earned” my pronouns. Short of a teat yeet, there isn’t much further I can go!




Edit: Thank you all so much for the support!  I feel validated and seen, and I appreciate it. Androgyny is its own style thing and embracing or not embracing that style doesn’t change my right to have something as rock bottom basic as pronouns respected. 

For the folks telling me to misgender this cat right back, though, nah. Calling a man “her” as punishment for bad behavior plays into all the sexist, misogynist, and homophobic tropes that men are better, women are lesser, men loving and/or having sex with men is bad, bisexuality doesn’t exist, etc.  I’m not gonna drag entire disadvantaged groups through the mud just to get back at some bumhelm; I’ll probably just let him know the reason why Imma peace out, and then lose his number."	"Yeah that's pretty yikesy.

Remember, it's not your fault you get misgendered. Dude is just an arsehole.
You don’t owe anyone androgyny. You don’t have to embrace any specific presentation to be nonbinary. That guy sucks, and his comments are bigoted nonsense. So sorry you went through that!
Fuck that dude
Good thing androgyny has literally nothing to do with being nb
It's nothing to do with you, mate. You're awesome

That dude's just an ass
""oh shit, I put on the wrong gender this morning, my bad. I see you're wearing butch lesbian today, I should have noticed earlier- sorry, I'll switch to she/her"".
Dump that guy, yuck. I'm sorry. You are valid, your pronouns are valid and you owe nobody androgyny
I hate these people. I had a coworker when I started in my shop who referred to me with my AGAB. I corrected her the first two weeks, until I heard her going on to a customer, not even covering who she was talking about, misgendering me the whole time, while talking about how I wanted to be be referred to as they/them, and how ""such a waste of a girl."" Thankfully the manager moved her to another store, but it took a while of me complaining to them and bringing up the word discrimination a lot 🙄. Tldr: people suck.
Screw that jerk.

Also ""teat yeet"" killed me 🤣🤣🤣
No such thing as looking nonbinary. Androgyny is not a requirement of nonbinary. I can't stand people who think you can look queer. It's one thing to try to signal to other queer people that you're queer(I wear a trans pin, pretty obvious stuff) But when you deny someone's identity on your own preconceived notions of that identity you are a fucking asshole.


I personally choose violence in these situations, however possible. From being casually rude remarks to fully aggressive, whatever you think it will take without getting you in trouble. 


You are valid. Fuck this asshole.
Dude sounds like a right dick. You do you. I can just chill in sweatpants and a Colombian soccer jersey and still be NB. Not like there’s a dress code or whatever, lol.
Well teat yeet is the best thing I've heard on the internet this week if it's any consolation. Also who made that one lord of pronouns? Sounds like someone who hasn't earned your time or consideration.
some people can't handle the idea of people outside of ""man and women"" if they don't ""look the part"" enough. it's very annoying and invalidating. also sad. it all has to do with looks. how people who've been making rules for society all these years want to see things. they respect you based on how you ""pass"" in the eyes cis people.
i feel this.  i have a deep voice, and people are constantly misgendering me as ""he"" even after i share my pronouns (they/them). 

we shouldn't have to ""earn"" our pronouns.   our expression on any given day doesn't define us.  if we want to be masc one day and fem another day and andro another day we can do that, and fuck what anyone else thinks :)
To hell with him, do you, stay you!
I ask people that tell me such things why it matters or why the gatekeeping.
The argument past the insult is like trying to eat soup with a fork.

I have yet to hear a reason why only afab can be truly non-binary or that looking super masc or super fem denies your non-binary...

Humans like that are just not keeping up with society and are most definitely in the minority thankfully.
I would have been so tempted to laugh in their face and be like:

""Well, either I'm not androgynous enough or your understanding of the world isn't big enough, honey.""
Wow fuck this guy. You literally did nothing wrong, he just refuses to see you for who you are. What an asshole. Gonna change his pronouns to was/were.
Why can’t people see that there are male presenting non-binary people, female presenting non-binary people and androgynous non-binary people. We are all unique.
ugh I really dislike people who link gender identity with gender expression.

you are very valid and do not owe this person an explanation. it's not your fault for being misgendered at all. people are just assholes
I'm very feminine, and I'm non-binary. In a way, it helps you root out the shitty people. You are deserving of love and respect no matter your presentation, and you are absolutely valid.
Oh, man. You don't have to look or present a certain way to use certain pronouns, so you don't need to look androgynous for they/them. Unfortunately, some people just love to be assholes. Try not to let it get to you and just keep being you :))
[reminds me of this bigender meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bigender_irl/comments/q3giuc/bigender_irl/)
I hate people like that. Judging by looks is terrible, and always a huge red flag to me.
Can I do a stabbo?  *Please?*
Tell him he “really isn’t open minded enough” to be talking to you ✋🙄
Androgyny is not the only valid non-binary identity/presentation... the idea of there being one valid form of NB is totally backwards. Even if there was a well-established androgynous archetype, all that means is that there would start being non-trinary people.
I've had a similar experience. This guy I was dating said he wouldn't using he/him for someone without a dick. 

They can fuck off or learn to respect people!
absolute dickhead that's not the point of being non binary 

being nonbinary is how you see your ideal self and no one else should decide that for you
My partner is a femme presenting enby and is as valid as I am as a masc presenting enby. They are free to express themselves as they feel. People just don't get that. We are all valid and it shouldn't matter if I want to be referred to as cupcake. My choice.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.
Being non-binary/ using they them prounouns ≠ being androgynous. Tf?
There's not such thing as ""not androgynous enough"", fuck that cishet and the dysphoria they throw around

You're a light in this world, now go eat crackers 🍘
What a jerk! I hope you dumped his ass.
This guy is a complete a—hole. Dump him. You don’t need to look like his idea of androgynous to have your identity and pronouns respected.
It’s almost like he doesn’t understand androgyny isn’t about how others identify and perceive you, but how you identify and perceive yourself.
That person just sounds like an asshole. Your identity is your own, and can not be determined by another person just because they think you don't look that way enough.
I hate when people say dumb shite like this. A good comeback is misgendering anyone that misgenders you.
You don't owe anyone a goddamned thing.

You are valid.
I feel this. Am amab and hear this more frequently than I’d like. Not femme enough or not trans enough. Without going on estrogen and getting tits I’m just never NB enough
Kick em in the shins
Remember yall: Being Nonbinary doesn't equal androgynous!
His shitty opinion on whether you meet his personal standards for specific pronouns doesn't make you any less valid. He is just an asshole. Next time you see him keep referring to him as she and when he gets angry explain that he isn't masculine enough to have he/him pronouns. Bet he changes his tune real fast
Ahn... do you need to look androgynous to be they/them? Wtf? 😶🤦🏻‍♀️
Don't mind these kind of people. The only thing you need to worry about is how fabulous and awesome you can be 👍
You could be the most conventional ""manly man"" the masciest masc that ever existed. You're still Nonbinary. Its internal not external. That guy is a dick
What does this person do when they encounter a very feminine-presenting man or very masculine-presenting woman? I bet they don't misgender them, so it's probably just an excuse to be a bigot.
I envy the imagination of the binary and the cis.  The things they ""see"" seem so real to them.
I suffer from this too. I feel too feminine to be considered non-binary. What really helps is following other people who are non-binary and present the way I do. It’s really affirming.

Just remember, non-binary has NO look. That’s the whole point of it! :-)
Fuck that dbag
Androgyny is very strict. Like, it’s usually femme white people in all black masculine clothing.
Ugh, hate that. Like, it’s one thing for somebody to perhaps not know your identity or even to know it and mistakingly refer to me in a masc way on a day that I am presenting masc - that’s normal human stuff to me - but for someone to look me in the eyes and essentially just say they reject me??? Thats painful and they just don’t even get it because they can’t fathom a world without comfy boxes, or at least don’t respect me enough to share in my world.
That’s just being a jerkass for the sake of it. He ain’t worth your time
Ok no im pissed at that dude. You don’t owe anyone androgyny and its certainly not your fault if someone misgenders you. You don’t have to “earn” the right to use your pronouns, that’s a ridiculous concept. I hope that that dude isn’t bothering you anymore.
My close friend who is a super woke, poc, queer social worker likes to pull the ""Well you PRESENT masc, so..."" Try maybe gently reaffirming how important it is that you are gendered correctly? A little compassionate but stern conversation can go a long way.
That’s bullshit. You’re free to present yourself in any way you feel comfortable. My partner is non-binary and presents very feminine and uses she/they pronouns, but it doesn’t make her any less non-binary than me. (A very androgynous person who uses they/them/any pronouns) non-binary people come in all shapes and sizes.
There is nothing I can do to look Androgynous. I am doomed to always look female. I have huge boobs and very Fem features. Shaved the sides of my head and wear wife beaters. I'll still look female. 😨😨😨

I feel you. I wish just once someone would be like....
 "" I'm sorry, just can't tell what gender you are.""
Bro, I remember I posted a picture of me wearing an outfit on Instagram and captioned it ""Looking hella androgynous I LOVE IT"" and my ex boyfriend texted me saying that it really wasn't because even by wearing a flannel shirt and a fadora, it doesn't make me androgynous. I was like, ""well what do you consider to be a more androgynous outfit? "" and he said, "" what? No, you can't be androgynous based on clothes. You have to have feminine and masculine features to be androgynous."" And I felt like I lost a few brain cells when seeing that.
Dude someone could be the most feminine/masculine motherfucker on the planet, but if they say they are non binary, then that’s what they are.
Oof, thats what scares me the most about coming out publicly. I really like my beard (it could be a little fuller though, thanks body), I've wanted one since i was like 10 and i absolutely hate my face without it... But it's an instant beard=man...
Sounds like he isn't human enough
Thanks. I really needed to hear that it’s not my fault.
This
Thanks. It was a second date, so maybe “don’t fuck that dude,” is more apropos, lol. 

Thanks, though. For reals. Y’all’s reaction has helped me solidify that I don’t actually need to put up with what doesn’t make me happy.
Word.
Truly, because it doesn't matter how he sees you. If you say you go by they/them pronouns, then you go by they/them pronouns. Full stop. Not up for debate, regardless of how he sees you. I'm sorry this happened to you
I was so glad to realize androgyny was optional, because I have no fashion sense to begin with and didn't want to have to think about buying new clothes or maintaining a hairstyle.
Which is funny, because this guy sometimes goes by she/her and uses the femme form of his given name (think Julio/Julia). I pick up on where he’s at that day and pronoun appropriately, which kind of makes his malfunction over my pronouns even worse.
Moved her to another store instead of firing her? YIKES.
I prefer not to sink to their level. Anyone who can force me to be a violent, cruel person has full control over me, and I refuse to give anything or anyone that control. I stay kind and non-violent because it’s the most fundamental aspect of my identity and ethics.
>>Gonna change his pronouns to was/were. 

I love this!  Thank you!
Right?  Friend of a friend is High Femme as all get out, but my friend still manages to call them by their proper pronouns.
You are so right. I think I just added a new Dating Shit Test, there’s no reason for me to put up with this crap. 

This particular guy was pushing my boundaries anyway, I think this is as good a final straw on the “Nah, I’m good” side of the scales as any might be. Thanks for seeing yourself out, Mr. Misgender, don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya!
Right? Dog knows I’m not gonna….
This is true, but I feel like I want to pick my battles. I’m already the Kind and Patient Poster Child for disability (especially hidden disability like mine often is), sometimes I am just tired of putting on that beatific educator smile and I dowanna.
Oh dang!  I guess there’s reasons he’s an ex, then!
First, it is absolutely in no way whatsoever your fault.

Second, of course you can use they/them, it’s literally and actually NEUTRAL, everyone can use it.

The guy’s a jerk!
Far out, this happened on a date??? What an asshole. You absolutely don't need to put up with why doesn't make you happy. I am quite happily single, but I refuse to let anyone into my social circle that doesn't respect my gender identity (or lack thereof) or the gender identity of any of my friends. 

""I just don't see you that way"" sounds like a them problem, friend.
The fact that this happened on a date is wild. Like yeah dude that's how you convince someone to continue seeing you, disrespect the fuck out of them and then make it seem like it's their fault(which btw it absolutely isn't and you owe no one androgyny which is absolutely not a requirement of being nonbinary). That guy should teach ways to show you're a walking red flag 101.
100% do not fuck that dude. Not worth spending another second of your life on.
Right?  I’m absolutely tragic with clothing and makeup, too, and maintaining a hairstyle just seems like so much work…. I have the tech bro man bun because I’m too lazy to get my hair cut regularly and that’s the easiest way to keep it out of my face.
What the fuck 😭 so it's not even a cis man, they're gatekeeping smh
While I admire that practice, it isn't for me. I am very comfortable asserting myself in any situation. To me, being told to be quiet and kind is giving people power over me. I've been told to behave since I was a child. I refuse. I will defend myself and my friends. You cannot make me accept mistreatment. 


You do not deserve and will not receive my kindness if you are a bigot. 


But I fully understand and respect pacifists. My husband is a pacifist. I love him dearly. But if a bigot was screaming in my face I would not ask for his help to gently talk to them. I would (redacted) 😌
Oh, dude is a straight asshole. The audacity.
YESS, don't put up with ittt! My very much ex boyfriend used to do that all time 🙄 So not worth it. Best of luck in the dating scene!! <3
You should.
I want to start a company for the little ones in the LGBTQ+ community where I tell people to go fuck themselves when they misgender. 

I'm the last of seven children. 
I took shit from no one.

Next time just walk away. They don't want to respect your boundaries, just pretend to be a NPC.
Hey, that's totally fair.
Haha! Yeah! I'm actually really glad we broke up. I started realizing that we weren't that good for each other after out break up. So good thing that's over!
Like wtf is he doing going on a date with someone whos gender he isnt cool with. What a freak
God damn, right? 

No way am I jumping hoops just to get someone else to demonstrate basic human respect. Fuck that.
Wait till that guy learns he's not straight because he's attracted to them
Be yourself. There’s wisdom in asserting your own power and defending yourself / your family / your community as well. All the best.
To clarify, “Friend” is not “Dude who Misgendered Me”. My friend has been super solid with my pronouns all along.
This was in the last two minutes of a date so we parted company pretty much right after this anyway. It’s been really bothering me since then, though. He was so casual, telling me he referred to me as “she” to his friend because I’m not androgynous, and basically blowing off the correction.  Like, non-binary people can have hips and asses and curves, too. It’s just that my curves are non-binary curves, this glorious cleavage is non-binary cleavage, and these “lady parts” aren’t attached to any kind of lady.
To be fair, this guy wasn’t straight before he met me, either. He might need to expand his definition of “bisexual” beyond just “attracted to both men and women”, but he knows he’s 100% not straight.
Same to you!
I meant the person in the original post.
Fair enough. Friendo is pretty rad and I don’t want him mixed up with Mr Misgender. :)"	qntq9p	NonBinary	943	1.0	2021-11-06 05:33:56
A warning about Pride month and trolls - reddit has plastered us on billboards without consent.	"Hi, r/nonbinary. 

A concerned user made us aware that reddit's marketing division put the name of our sub on billboards in the US and Canada to promote *themselves* for Pride month. 

Here are two billboards. One is in [San Francisco,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BayAreaLGBT/comments/o0tc13/reddit_ad_in_sf_i_think_this_is_my_favorite/) the other [somewhere in Canada.](https://mediaincanada.com/2021/06/15/reddit-kicks-off-first-campaign-in-a-canadian-media-strategy/)

That is, reddit the company decided to promote *themselves* as being supportive of non-binary people by exploiting our sub--which is already a troll magnet and was the site of a serious brigade that resulted in several subs being banned from the site--by exposing us in a huge way, not bothering to ask permission, and not bothering to give us a heads up.

There is so much wrong with this it makes my head hurt to think about drafting the complaint letter. 

We have already had an uptick in both text trolls (the ones who post harassing comments and the oh-so-clever Pokemon screenshot) and in porn trolls. Please, if these get past the spam filters and automod--report them so we can keep the sub as cleaned up as possible for our real members. 

Feel free to use this post an as an open thread to rant about the hollowness of corporate Pride and ""ally"" fails."	"Not trying to detract from OPs discussion, but those ads are how I found out about this community and I’m really happy I did. Kind of repeating other comments here but I do wish Reddit would provide meaningful support to communities like this one.
If they gave a shit about the LGBT+ community they'd actually *do* something about all the rampant bigotry. But they don't, so they don't.
Ah this sucks, I love this community. 

I hope this doesn't negatively impact the security people feel here. It's such a kind and supportive place right now...
Not surprising but holy shit.
On the one hand this is incredibly stupid on Reddit’s part bc they don’t actually moderate hate like they claim to and they’re very far from allies of nearly any kind but on the other hand I’m kinda glad in the way that newer enby people may see it and find the community that way

Just trying to find something good from it ://
All I can think of is to scream in frustration. At the very least they should have heads upped, and really should have dedicated a paid staff mod for each sub they decided to plaster on this ill-thought ad that basically invites brigading.
Reddit seriously took something that WE MADE (we meaning queer people in general) independently of them, but on their site, and was like “look how progressive we are!!” They’re basically just saying “look! We’re super great allies because we allow queer people to create their own spaces on our platform and don’t stop them!” Like come on, really??
While it was a bad move all around, I'm actually less annoyed about this sub being included than some of the others. Here, r/lgbt, r/gay, etc., are all pretty straightforward names that trolls really don't need a billboard to find, or anything beyond the most basic knowledge of how Reddit works. If someone wanted to come troll nonbinary people, this was always the logical URL. 

The ones that can't be intuited, though...Ones you generally have to be at least somewhat familiar with LGBT Reddit to find...Reddit really did just go and paint a target on them, didn't they?
That ""somewhere in Canada"" billboard is in Toronto. Dundas square is basically Toronto's Time Square.
🙄 reddit, always classy /s
Yeah, if Reddit actually gave a shit about queer folks, the lesbian subreddit wouldn't be full of nothing but porn.
Definitely Toronto :)
Whoa!
I’m a huge nerd, been on Reddit for a long time, and found this sub after first hearing the words “non-binary” last year which caused me to come out finally. But as a Redditor, I know how to find things here.I didn’t need an ad.

But for folks who don’t know of Reddit and are questioning, confused, and figuring themselves out, seeing something like this public and spreading awareness is so great. 

I know posting on this sub and reading everyone’s posts questioning or figuring themselves out finally here has been literally one of the most affirming and positive things for me since coming out. 

Sure, Reddit probably thought they were doing a helpful thing and apparently didn’t ask, and yeah, it comes off in bad taste to other comrades here, and of course their obvious self-promotion (it is an ad on a billboard), but I would rather this exist and be out there than not. We will get some trolls, but we will get people discovering themselves and their fellow enbys, so they can thrive and live happier and fuller.
thats kinda fucked

im not super familiar with automod but can you configure it to filter comments and posts from ""new"" (recently created, or recently subscribed) users? there'd be false positives but might help yall stem the flood if it gets too much
What’s crazy is Reddit doesn’t give a shit about homophobia and transphobia, and just let’s these things slide
> the oh-so-clever Pokemon screenshot

I should probably be glad that I don't think I know about this one.

Most ([though not all](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_with_gender_differences)) Pokemon species appear identical regardless of assigned gender, anyway (leaving out whether they'd be aware enough to identify otherwise), and the differences are minor when they don't. Oh, the horror.
I learned from a philosophy course that one can do deeds that are, 'good' yet do so for their own gain.
Do you think it's wrong to put the other subreddits on the billboard?
I find it ironic that so many transphobic people use Pokemon as a transphobic meme. Do they not know there's genderless pokemon? And a lot of them are pretty popular to use in competitive play? I mean there's Magnezone, Metagross, Shedinja, Rotom, Mewtwo, Mew, Melmetal, etc. There's more than a 100 genderless pokemon out there.
That's not representation, that's rainbow capitalism..
Anyone seen the they/them and other pronoun shirts at target? Anyone notice how ridiculously overpriced they are? I was really upset by that because it’s like ‘yay, pride! Ok, now give us money!’
Ugh, this is disgusting. I'm so glad I haven't seen anything bigoted but I'm sorry to the people who have.
Can confirm there's at least one more in socal.
OP. Please do look into drafting a letter of complaint. And reach out to the other subs mentions on the billboard, ask if they wish to collaborate and make it a group complaint.
Reddit has already proven they don’t believe in free speech when they banned r/chapo trap house and a bunch of other left leaning subs when they banned r/ the Donald, as if they were at all equal in their hate, and just know everyone: this platform, the people who run it, don’t care at all about you or me, they just point to us when it’s convenient. It’s the same thing as td bank putting a pride flag on their logo one month out of the year, and bankrolling companies that discriminate against gbtqia+ community every day of the year, even in June. It’s called “rainbow capitalism”.
without our consent, i hope youre joking and have read the users agreement...
i'm glad you found this sub, friend. that's definitely the silver lining of reddit's exploitative behavior and i hope other nonbinary folks find this sub, too
I don't think anyone is saying that them promoting the sub is in of itself bad but they should have absolutely gotten permission and a heads up so moderators could understand be prepared for what was to come, and hopefully get support from admins if they needed it.

I'm glad you found the sub though, welcome! This place has really helped me with my gender identity 😊
Welcome friend!
There is definitely positives to Reddit featuring the sub, but:

* Firstly, they *should've* given moderators a heads up.

* Secondly, they *should've* extended an offer to provide additional moderation support through this month.

* Thirdly, they *should* be continuing to actually act on the banning of the exceptionally toxic hate subs, including homophobic and transphobic ones.

With regards to the last, I recently discovered that they most definitely are not, I encountered a *400k+* hate sub, which has apparently been known about for some time and which is still persisting.

One other thing as well, is when a user is banned/suspended, that's it, the Reddit admins i don't believe look at the subreddits said user moderates. Often hate subs have a moderation team that at least partially actively engages in hate. The result is that these hate subs continue unaffected, and become free from any moderator control.
Because bigotry leads to profit. That's all reddit wants in the end.
Add to this the fact that AskGayBros is on there..... literally promoting one of the most bigoted ""inclusive"" subs out there
""Some people want no bigotry. Some want all the bigotry. We compromised at some bigotry.""- Reddit
This. I can’t even begin to count all the “Please Jill yourself messages” I’ve received the past 3 days & u/Reddit does NOTHING to them.
I hope we see an uptick in legitimate new users we can welcome. I hope we as a community will see this as an opportunity to support ourselves by being vigilant about reporting problematic behavior. I hope we as a community will renew our efforts to be welcoming and inclusive of folks who are questioning but phrase things poorly. I hope we'll see a decrease in gatekeeping who is and is not allowed to be non-binary or seen as legitimate. I hope reddit gets a ton of backlash for showing off their GSM subreddits during pride while actively undermining the safety of GSM individuals and communities and donating to anti-LGBT+ politicians etc. I hope we can brainstorm good language for a complaint letter to reddit, and that it gets picked up by the media, since that's the only way it will result in change.
Yeah...
It's already set to do this, and is a PITA we wish we could stop, b/c even with careful tweaking it nabs a lot of legitimate comments that need manually approved.
Some of the pokemon games open with the professor asking ""are you a boy or a girl?"" to select your character sprite/model.
I think they meant that the mods should have been given warning or asked for consent at least cause yes it can introduce new enbys to the sub but it also exposes it to hate from horrible people.
They don't think that much. It's surface-level trolling, lol.
Most definitely!
That’s a fair point. Even if they wanna get all “it’s on our website; it's proprietary,” it’s still bad form to not even give a heads up
Thank you- this is such a wonderful and supportive community, I'm really happy to be here!

gotta love spreading support and love 😵‍💫		"When I first came out as non-binary, I was all like, ""No, the goatee is staying!"" And it did, until I got a sudden rush of dysphoria looking in the mirror one day and shaved before I even thought it through. But that's me, and I love it when enbies show off their makeup and dresses with their full beards. What works for them does not work for me, but nobody should be able to force that on them because \*I\* got dysphoria over it. I'm now getting to the point where I don't have to shave every time I leave the house, and I can accept that even now, as a trans femme enby, I will have stubble for half the week.

(My skin hates shaving, but I'm 52, grey, and laser and IPL do not work on grey hair, and ain't nobody got money for electrolysis!)
He also completely disregards that there are non-binary people and that they  may have a different experience than binary trans people.

I personally don't want to pass as anything. I want to go on hormones and have top surgery and look like a 'typical man', looking like a woman gives me a lot of dysphoria. But I'm still non-binary. I just want to pass as myself and that is how I feel I should look like. I don't want to be seen as a binary man though. 

Everyone is different :)
I hate my body and you don’t hate yours and I’ve decided that’s a you problem!!
Sure, having a beard will generally make people assume someone is a man. That doesn't mean that person cannot be trans tho, wtf?
Someone took all the yikes pills this morning.

And they seem to be confusing societal associations with certain human anatomy with gender presentation. The two do influence each other but - buddy get this - some cis women grow facial hair and choose not to shave it. 

Let’s also not overlook intersex people here.

As a general rule, don’t push your opinions, beliefs or expectations on what someone does with their body or feels about their body onto anyone.

In any situation.

Ever.
How can one be trans and gatekeep being able trans? They ain’t even good at it ffs
Ciswomen develop beards. PCOS and genetics are a huge factor in hair growth, like wtf. This needless policing of gender dysphoria.
Truscum are so sad. They really hate themselves and refuse to let go of internalized transphobia. They’re like maybe if I flog myself hard enough the cishet normativity boot will step on me less. Newsflash, the bills trying to keep us out of bathrooms and sporting don’t have a note in parentheses that says (except truscum). 

I feel bad for them honestly. Trans joy is everything, they should try it sometime.
Oh cool. I love it when idiots act like they know what they’re taking about (sarcasm). Sorry you had to deal with that. :\
I love it how people without medical degrees think they can define and diagnose a complex condition like gender dysphoria and then describe --completely-- how it impacts someone with it.And then, as they lose their shit when they get called out, tell everyone *else* lhow stupid they are. Um...? Good times.
I don't get how you can feel more comfortable in your skin 😡 (basically)
I'm sick of hearing that trans people have to hate themselves to be trans. It's an act of self-love and authenticity to transition, not a symptom of how much we hate ourselves. Many trans ppl experience dysphoria but our identities aren't defined by that
The fuck? Oh, I I've looked at the cost benifit analysis of surgery and hormones and decided even the best case scenario results don't justify that ordeal *in my personal case*, and there's some comfort to be found in working with/claiming the body I'm stuck with. Guess my identity is fake.
Some days I don't have chest dysphoria. Some days I do. I stopped HRT cause well money and I just am comfortable with the permanent changes. I Sometime wear dresses, skirts and makeup.
Does this make me not trans now? 
Idk why this person is sitting there saying you must hate you body the same way I do to be trans. Like tf?
Some people experience things differently. No need to gatekeep like that. I think they need to do some self reflection.
average r\truscum user
Ah, truscum! 

Yeah, I don’t have voice dysphoria, I’m still trans. 

I mean, I’ve got dysphoria in plenty of ways. It just hits different for all of us. Doesn’t matter though as far as being trans. We’re still trans! 

Nothing that person can do about it. I suppose they could get mad. They can grasp as hard as they can to patriarchal ideas of gender. They can say some folks don’t belong if they don’t fit their idea of “trans-ness.” 

Seems a bit exclusionary to me. Weird, I think there is an acronym we use for a group of anti-trans folk with that word in it, “exclusion.” Huh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s “radical” of me to compare them to a group who is supposed to be inclusive of trans folk by definition of their own ideology, but then feel threatened because trans-ness is too “different.”

Either way, folks who don’t have dysphoria who are trans are still gonna be trans! Nothing they can do about it. That at least brings me comfort. I suppose the point is, you’re valid. And so is every lovely trans person who deals with dysphoria in a nuanced way, or not at all!
As a fellow trans with a beard I appreciate you <3
For me, I mainly have dysphoria from my voice being masculine and me just have hair around almost everywhere making me feeling like a gorilla (other big dysphoria areas for me where my feet and the thing between my legs) but I’m fine with having nipples so I’m just in a weird position.
I think the word for people who believe that you can only be trans if you have dysphoria is transmeds or something and they're dumb af.
Don't bother arguing with transmeds. They're idiots.
*you gotta love the truscums...*
Well, they are just being ididotic, because, that is how you want to look and you look fab all the time so never listen to them and keep being the amazing you you are!
I’ll be the first to say that I used to believe that too, I thought that others identities somehow invalidated my own. But actually through Brennen Beckwith’s videos where they spoke out about Kalvin Garrah and his gatekeeping of what it means to be trans, I realised this mindset was the reason it took me so long to come out as nonbinary. Because I thought not wanting hrt (at the time) meant that my dysphoria couldn’t possibly be real. But I was struggling severely. This person is unfortunately still stuck with this thought process. Hurt people hurt people. All we can do is love and support each other and hope that light we create can help guide those through their pain. May be cringy to say it like that, but that’s how I feel. 💜
OP just wanted to say I’m sorry you went through this. No one should ever invalidate your identity or experience, ESPECIALLY within our own community.
I recently realized I’m non-binary. First thing I did was shave my beard off. Instantly knew it was the wrong move and it’s coming back. Everyone’s different.
Crazy when people think the point of being trans is to “pass.” Some of us will never pass, some of us don’t care to, it shouldn’t be a requirement to hate our bodies and be scared to present however we feel comfortable
I truly empathize with people who have extreme dysphoria but how can you not understand everything is on a spectrum and some people will not have the same level of dysphoria as other people. Also I'm sure these same people have no issue with cis women not shaving if they can grow facial hair.
Man if facial hair automatically makes you male I wonder what this person thinks of all the folks with PCOS who have sensitive skin and cant shave. 🤔 But in all seriousness, I do hope this person eventually understands that the trans experience is very personal and therefore very different for each individual.

Heck, I'm a femme presenting enby with PCOS who's currently pregnant. That didn't stop my euphoria from being told by my partner an outfit I was wearing was very masculine the other day. Some days I'm okay with my facial hair, others I hate it. 

People like that are sad and bitter and I always hope they get the growth and maturity to learn and grow to be better people.
I honestly will never understand why they think wanting to pass is a requirement to be trans

Their logic doesn't hold up the moment you try to apply them to cis people. a cis woman can look like a man, have muscle, never shave and have masculine hobbies, and even produces more testosterone than average and no one will question her if she's actually a woman

A cis man who likes to wear make up? That's just a regular guy. A trans man that likes make up? A trans trender how dare he engages in anything remotely feminine
nbs must wear gray jumpers, clear nail polish (no colors! no bare nails!) Medium length hair, a SMALL tasteful brass pride flag pin, exactly ONE tennis weight gold necklace, an analog watch with brown leather strap and sensible shoes.   


such a great idea to just end up inventing another wretched set of random gender standards as if two were not enough.
Hot take: concepts of ""passing"" as a trans person are rooted in western patriarchal beauty standards and should be rejected as a necessary step for transition. (That is to say, if it's something you want - go for it. But it is not going to be a part of everyones journey.) There are cis people that ""look"" like the opposite gender naturally and don't identify as such. Are they less cis? Objectively, no. They ARE likely to be ridiculed for their appearance and made fun of regardless for being too masculine or too feminine or incongruous with their AGAB. ""(*""But wait!! I thought gender is what's in your pants!? Why do transphobes ridicule non-passing cis people?""* Because it was never actually about sex and gender, it is about power and marginalization and ""othering"".)

Nobody owes anyone a specific appearance, and if someone is happy with who they are, despite whether or not their appearance lines up with the beauty standard picture of that specific identity, then they are doing a lot better than most people on earth in terms of self esteem - cis, trans, or otherwise.

This is more or less how I've come to make peace with being a non-passing trans person who is likely to never ""pass"".
I really don’t get it why some people are so idiotic. They have no idea what other people go through in their lives and want to tell them how to live, what to do and what not.

If someone thinks they are trans, so, let them **be** that. I mean who better to know than the person in question? Why not just let them discover their lives, and at most, help them when help is asked for.

Come on, we are all trying to muddle through this thing called “live”. It didn’t come with a manual, you know, we all have to figure this “thing” out ourselves…

I wish people would just leave others in peace. So, what if that said person discovers, after some time, that they are, indeed, **not** trans? So, f***ing what? Did they take something away from me? No! Did they hurt me? No! So, WTF???

Sorry for the rant. This just drives me really, really crazy from time to time.

Love you all.
🥰😘
Isn’t it weird how cis people just get to be cis, but we have to go through all these different tests?
Your perception of someone is within your own control. So, when someone asks to be perceived a certain way, it is up to you to have the personal integrity to respect their best wishes. Misgendering, both unintentional and intentional, is always the fault of the perceiver. It just matters whether or not you can take accountability for your faults. Remember that trans people owe the world nothing. Men don't owe masculinity, women don't owe femininity, and enbies don't owe androgyny.
I BELIEVE THIS “…” THEREFORE EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE!!! OTHERWISE UR A FRAUD IF U DONT AGREE WITH MUHHH - *them* (mwuahaha)
""To be a part of our club, you have to hate every waking moment of your life while also encouraging others like us to do the same. If you fall outside of these very narrow parameters, at best you're a faker, at worst you're just trying to fuck us.""
Ah trans meds. I can't imagine how shit they must feel about themselves with that shitty world view.

I'm guessing this is a mainstream LGBT subreddit?
People get dysporic over diffrent things too.
If someone is totally okay with a beard but get disporic about certain clothes thats the same experience but from difrent thing.

Also gender roles are not the same as gender.

And trans and nb people dont owe you shit. They dont need to look a certain way to be valid.

Feeling comfortable is a just as valid goal as passing as a certain gender.
Them: ''YOU CAN'T BE A FEMALE IF YOU DON'T FEEL DYSPHORIC ABOUT YOUR BEARD!!!!!1!!!1''

Cis women with beards who don't mind having facial hair: hhmmm
Lmao it's like ""sorry my idea of being nonbinary doesn't include looking youthful and completely androgynous."" Some of us have no intentions with gender presentation at all. Idgaf if you say I'm a woman, man, alien, or whatever. I just want to exist outside of the stupid gender binary that society likes to push. Gendering myself feels like gendering a coffee table or a toaster, you could, it just feels out of place. I feel human and I do have dysphoria, but that hardly has anything to do with giving a fellow human the respect of not shitting on them or telling them how they feel is objectively wrong. All feelings are objectively true and it's stupid we have had to spend generations justifying them. It's created a culture that makes it so we have to justify already true statements, it's redundant and doesn't make any sense to me. 

That's not even including the conversation in privlage. I couldn't even afford gender affirming care if I wanted it right now. I have $0 to spend on surgery, laser hair removal, and hormones. I live in a state that doesn't even cover a breast reduction on medicaid so that's not a viable route either. 

It's so weird how much people can't just let other people be happy and live their life without some sort of criticism or bitter words.
Found out my cousin was like them. They started to deadname my best friend because ‘he wasn’t transitioning fast enough so he must be pretending.’ I already didn’t talk to her much but when my bff told me that I have blocked her and told my family that I won’t attend anything she is at.
I hate my facial hair so I'm always happy for an enby who likes there's lol
Literally got bullied back into the closet by a terrible trans person like this one when I was 14 bc I didn't have dysphoria (ofc I didn't, I was a child with no secondary sex characteristics yet, I dorky really have anything to be dysphoric about) she was the worst person I'd ever met and I'm so angry she basically forced me back into the closet for over 4 years, the most painful 4 years of my life I think

(Obviously I hold no resentment towards other trans women, she was just a terrible person, her transness had nothing to do with it)
I don't understand the passion that transmed people have for squashing the joy of other trans people and policing their experiences. Dumb af, unproductive, and full of internalized transphobia. Bit sad innit? 

Keep your facial hair and whatever else feels good to you. You're right that there's no right or wrong way to be trans and being trans is about gender euphoria and queer joy, not medical procedures and dysphoria!!
I personally love the beard and think it's beautiful and I still see you as feminine idk what they're problem is
Only the truly ignorant consider themselves experts.

(Not you the other person.)
I hate the cookie cutter trans people that attempt to put other ppl in a box. Dysphoria can be handled whichever way the person experiencing it feels like handling it, there is no one path to euphoria and I wish they’d get that through their thick ass skulls.
i used to be similar to this person when i was 14/15, fell into the truscum trap. although i still believe you'd need some level of dysphoria to be trans, i really dgaf about neopronouns/xenogenders and what level of dysphoria that needs to be. i dont care about other peoples labels because it doesnt bother me. being truscum is honestly horrendous lol, they'll claim they dont need cisgender approval yet bash ""transtrenders"" (can we please just let this term die already) because they ""make the trans community look like a joke!! they wont take us seriously and we'll get our rights stripped away"" soo you're appealing to who? the non-trans community? thats literally cis people. 

also ""we dont hate nb people we dont know why tucutes spread so much misinfo"" if you check they have a ""is nb real"" post every few days, its why i got sick of their shit and left. straight up had people bash nb people for transitioning using t because ""why would you want to look like a man??"" yet if an afab nb person doesnt want to transition they're a ""trender"". you cant win with these people and honestly most of them will grow out of it, they're like 14-18 (you can see the poll where they ask peoples age) and once they have less free time they wont have time to worry about this shit. just basing how i was at that age, i genuinely hated myself and had low self-esteem. i cared way too much what other people thought about me. now idc. 14 y/o truscum he/him jason version of me would hate me but hey thats character development.
I love having a beard realistically, it's a fun piece of me to stylize and play with, not to mention the fact that I really suit it.

Sometimes I get really off about having facial hair, or I'd keep undercut rather than growing everything out, however I've come to realise that whilst I do suit the clean shaven undercut look (which I do sometimes like dgmw), the only reason I lean more towards it, is the fact that it makes me look more noticeably queer... 

Only reason I avoided certain looks was because I didn't want to be clocked as ""a man"" by every single person that sees me. And I'm mostly over that now, growing everything out to be a bearded, long haired badass, and even trying to bulk out a bit even though it's a pain in the ass seeing as I'm 6'3 and have a metabolism worthy of being a flash villain :')
Omg spotted the truscum

Also, fun fact, [some cis women have beards](https://www.allure.com/story/women-with-pcos-facial-hair-beard-interviews)
I had dysphoria over having periods and having to shave. Wanted to cry when I shaved my legs and I was suicidally depressed during my periods. Now that that’s taken care of I’m happy and only thing is now I might wanna get rid of my chest. Yeah I haven’t had as severe dysphoria as other trans people but it exists and it’s different.
It's annoying to me that we fight among ourselves and that we deem that there is a wrong way and a right way to be trans, everyone is different and everyones experience in life is different. Everyone goes through things differently and also the factors in they're life play a big part too. Plenty of people see colors differently, I can look at the same flower as my sister and we could both see it as a different color but we will never exactly know how how the other sees it no matter how hard we try. There is no one exact way to be trans. When you have a cold you may not have all the symptoms of a cold. Just because you don't have all they symptoms doesn't mean you don't have a cold.
I believe dysphoria (like most phenomena in life tbh) is a spectrum, and can fluctuate for some. Just as some binary trans people have very strong dysphoria and are extremely uncomfortable with anything related to their birth sex, other people may have less, or be uncomfortable with some things and not others, and it’s up to them how they interpret that for themselves. Gender dysphoria isn’t an all or nothing scenario, hence the existence of non binary people. Just because you may not be suffering in the most extreme way possible doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be able to do anything to minimise the suffering you do experience, and maximise your own comfort and happiness.
The ONLY requirement I need to see for you to be trans is you say you are trans. I don't care what you look like, how you dress, your voice, your pronouns, etc. If you tell me what you want to be called I promise I will try my best to honour you.

Look at me. I experienced dysphoria, and now that I identify as non-binary, even though virtually nothing about my body has changed, just presenting myself that way has helped me. Who knows, maybe I'll get gender (unaffirming? deaffirming?) surgery if I think I need it. I definitely want to get the body hair I despise with my heart and soul lasered off eventually.

Not even your motive, if you want to call it that, or reasoning to become trans, enby, etc. matters to me. The reason I'm non-binary is because gender roles make me horrible uncomfortable. That is not to say I don't like gender roles; feel free to fill them, but don't you dare enforce them on anyone but you.
Really who cares if you have dysphoria or not. Just be you and be comfortable with yourself! Look the way you want to, dress the way you want to, don't let Society tell you what to look like.
I know ever since I've been more open of myself and looked at myself as a Nb person I've started to love myself and not see myself as birth sex. Tho I still get big dysphoria. But hopefully in the next few years I'll be getting rid of that or just toning it down to a level I can handle.
Now if only my mum could see me for who I am. 😔
I’ve always had a very deep masculine voice and have never had a problem growing a full beard even as a 20yo but because of how I’ve been raised I’m forced to feel bad for being me and I’ve considered getting laser hair removal and vocal reconstruction just to make people stop judging me for dressing feminine and wearing makeup when I sound and look like a man. I hate it
Truscum moment 🤮
bless you ❤
yikesssssss
Omg
Everyone's so obsessed with all these stipulations about gender identity. I typically stay away from many communities online for reasons such as this. Gender is a construct, albeit a personal one. How you identify shouldn't need any requirements.
[removed]
I'm AFAB. My tits rarely (not never!) give me dysphoria. I am still nonbinary because 'no gender markers' is not the only way to be NB, it's just one way of presenting. I'm sure there are cis women who don't reduce their identity to their tits as well. I just don't get why people can't... just let that be?
Sounds like those people who also feel like there is no possible way for same-sex couples to be happy. Like if you think passing is the standard for what gender you are, then 5$ says that the one who wrote it doesn't conform to their gender's ""media ideal beauty standards"" and is just super salty and insecure about their own body.
I get dysphoria from my deep voice sometimes and other times I get dysphoria from my badly still developing titties.

Sometimes I have euphoria from my deep voice and other times from my chest. 

I'm less dysphoric about my genitals than I was in the past though, and less dysphoric about my face and hair. 
But quite honestly though, I've always felt weird about my chest, even before HRT.
""it would be like if I had my tits out at all times and insisted on being called a man""

which is exactly what I do, in fact, because the last time I wore a binder I ended up having a massive asthma attack in the middle of a parking lot. 

ignore idiots OP, I'm sure you look fly and dyaphoria's a hell of a beast for anyone 💓
EWWWWWWWWWWWWW TRUSCUM TRASH! 

I've had the same argument thrown at me as a fem leaning genderdoe person... They can kindly fuck off. You're valid <3
And the whole idea that it's a nonbinary person's fault that something they like about themselves is gendered by society, so that means they can't have it and should feel dysphoria. That's whack af. It's different if you do end up feeling dysphoria because it's gendered, but if OP doesn't feel that way then that's awesome! I love it when another trans or nonbinary person doesn't have to feel dysphoria about themselves. Plus people gender everything, so who cares. I'm getting new glasses because strangers code me as my agab even though I don't think they look that gendered, and I'm actually really mad that I feel like I have to give something up that I like in order to be comfortable in public. So for everyone that doesn't have to experience that I'm glad.
I was similar until I also got that rush of dysphoria. But tbf I was thinking of getting rid of my facial hair anyway because I always shave and am probe to ingrowns.

I just started laser while my hair is still dark. I have a few grays though, I have to get get electrolysis for those.
Omg this reminds me, when I came out everyone kept asking when I was going to cut my hair short???? And I was like what do you mean tf like everyone has this fucked up little view of non binary people as these androgynous cis women I don’t get it
When I came out as NB, I started picking out more neutral clothing, I grew out and dyed my hair, but the beard was not going anywhere. The beard is part of my style whether I'm [REDACTED] or Axyl. A clean shave just doesn't work on my face.
I feel this. I don’t want to look like a man. I don’t want to look like a woman. I just want to look like an adult with no particular sexual features. The very idea of having more secondary sex characteristics makes me wanna cry.
THIS
But that's the crazy part is I do hate my body 🙃 and for some reason my choice to not shave makes everyone think I have 0 dysphoria and there for am not trans. But some trans people live without dysphoria and it's fucked up to be like ( no dysphoria no gender affirming)
Way to downplay dysphoria
Yeah and I totally understand the mistaking me for a man. It doesn't upset me and I let it be. What I don't stand for is invalidating an entire group of people like every person is exactly the same and has to be the same. That shit does not fly.
Saved this comment in my special time vault 🥰
It's always been like this for me 🥲 I was scared of coming out as trans because of people like this 😪 I'm not scared of them anymore though 😅 they are just babies
r/transmedical is full of people with similar beliefs. “GNC/non binary people/trans people with no dysphoria make the community look bad” bruh
Based on my experience those types tend to be in two camps: 

To be trans is to suffer, if you dont suffer you are ""valor stealing"" (this can be seen in ADHD, autism, etc. As well. You can get high support requirement folk in those communities try to push out the low because they are just ""trenders"") this probably stems from envy of trans folk who get just the euphoria and little dysphoria. 

Quality control the trans: the deluded idea that bigots will change their mind and accept trans people if they oust all the ""low quality"" (ie: trans folk bigots rail against the most) seen in the ""neopronouns hurt trans people"" and ""you have to be binary trans and hyper fem/masc to be valid trans."" (This is because that type of trans person is the ""least confusing"" to bigots. A trans woman tomboy breaks their brains for example) LGB drop the T operates on the same mindset.
Yeah 😅 alot of the reason I have it is to support all the groups of people that have facial hair and don't like it. 

I used to do a LOT of postmates orders and there were more then a few bearded ladies and bearded trans mascs and bearded trans female that all seem too scared to go out in public so they order food. So I go out in public as I am to show that there are groups of people like me, they are just scared of society 😔 and I mean I am too. But I think what I'm doing serves a good purpose
This person definitely adheres to the binary.
Definitely 😍 they should try being happy some time 😂
🥰 it's okay I feel like I handled it fine
Essentially 🥲 I feel sorry for them but also they can fuck off
Yup yup yup 🥲
I feel a little dumb for asking but what does truscum mean. I kinda know what truscum is all about but my mind reads it as True Scum and I can't image they named themselfs that.
One of their users said “it’s transphobic to not date trans people because they’re trans” then straight up said “I don’t want to date other trans people because they’re trans”. Baffling.
[removed]
Ty so much brain slug 🥰
Fuck yeah friend 🥰 take my follow
My main dysphoria is my voice too. 🤮 but I also think I have a pretty good voice just not the one I want. So i try to record myself singing because it reminds me that I do sound good to some people 😌 just not the voice I want

I also hate having to tuck golf equipment everyday 3 times a day 😑 I'd really like to not have to do that anymore. Or at least simplify it some 😉
I agree it's real ridiculous
Ya spelt “loath” wrong
I love this 🥰 thank you for sharing it with me
It's been happening since I was 11 😅 I'm used to it.but your right it shouldn't happen, I hope my posts create a safe space to discuss that stuff 😀
Yeah I'm terrified of that. I don't like my beard. And it gives me dysphoria. But I'm afraid that I've gotten used to it and if I shave because other people told me too then I'll regret it because it wasn't MY decision, I just got tired of the hate 😪 

So ima wait till I know I'm ready myself.
I’ve been spending so much time trying to figure out ways I could pass, to the point where I was almost convinced that I really wanted to get top surgery and begin hormone therapy. I just now realise how the whole “goal” of passing made me miserable and brought me into hating my body even more because I knew I would never look like the average skinny androgynous looking nonbinary individual described by media :’)  I also hate the idea some people have that in order to be trans you MUST go through a physical transition too, there are so many reasons why I do not wish to change my body through medical procedures and it goes way beyond not wanting to or having the financial stability for it.
😂🤣😂🤣 omg I love this
I've never worried about passing exept in 1 instance. Public restrooms. I REFUSE to go into the men's bathroom. Infact the last time I tried was 3 weeks ago and I cried.

 I had to go to the bathroom really really bad and me my partner and feys whole family were there to watch here younger sister do a cheer squad think for a football game. So you know, there were lots of kids and parents there. Now I had my titties not at all hidden because I refuse to do that and there were several parents that would stare and 1 basically followed me to the bathroom even when I wasn't going I just happened to be nearby. 

So I was NOT going to get assaulted that day and decided even if my partner took me into the bathroom 🙃 girls bathroom was off limits right now. So I was going to attempt going into a men's bathroom for the first time In like 6 months. THAT SHIT WAS DISGUSTING. there was urine allll over the urinal area, the handle, the wall, the floor had like a 3 foot puddle. I looked in stall 1 of 3 and it had a mountain of doo doo that went higher then the seat so sitting down was literally impossible. Stall 2 had what looked like 5 different left shoes 🤔 and I was like what kind of weird pact is taking off your left shoes and flushing them together. And in stall 3 it was actively overflowing because it was cloged. There was a nice slow stream out of the toilet down the side across the floor and into the drain that wasn't clearing any of the urinal urine. I cried a little cuz I had to go real bad and I just stared at the mess for like 60 seconds with some tears streaming down my face because I was too scared to go in the girls. I actually was even looking at the sinks thinking 🤔 well maybe possibly could use it as a urinal which I've never had to do before, but even that was covered in pee. Someone already had done that and left it a mess, and I realized I would never do that anyway 🙃 I was just desperately thinking about it. 

So after about 2 minutes of a mental break down I had to myself in the bathroom I decided I'd hold it 3 more hours till I got home and if I went in my pants by accident it would be damn worth it to not get the police called on me for ""being in the wrong bathroom"" 

 The best part about this whole thing though was when I came up the bathroom crying a little bit. I overheard 3 of the girls that were hanging out in front of the bathrooms talking about me. One of them was saying that I went into the wrong bathroom probably because I was uncomfortable going into the girl's bathroom here. And one of the other ones was saying that I was a guy. They pointed out the flowers that I had on my clothes close and my boobs and said they think I'm trans and that I just went into the wrong bathroom right now. 😭 that made me cry a lot, I didn't say anything to these girls and they were defending me and explaining things I am too scared to bring up. I fucking love kids 😭 God damn 

(Ps. Made myself cry again 😅)
Thank you for the rant 🥰 I completely agree, that's why I'm glad I consistently make posts and give people like you a place to rant about this stuff 🥰
Yup 😅  sure is fuckin weird
Lol 😂 are you pretending to be my mom? Cuz it's spot on
Yeah they were literally commenting on a post about gender expression not equaling gender identity 🙄
Lol but I do feel dysphoria from the beard. I keep it for bigger reasons then my dysphoria though
Jesus 🥲 that's so fucked up 

""They didn't decide fast enough so they don't get to decide"" like who the fuck do you think you are to decide for someone else like that 🤔
Haha jokes on you I don't like mine either😂
Lol I love these moments 😅 ""I hate that person, but not because they're trans""
Also this happened to me a few times over 😅 but I realized that pride was about being prideful in yourself and that changed my perspective on everything.
Ty Kirby 🥰 I kinda do too even though I don't like having it 🤣😅
Yup I have mine in support of them. But also trans males with no top surgery who are on testosterone and trans females who are too scared to shave are very large groups too 🥰
And that's the way it should be
It gets better Maria 🥰 when you no longer HAVE to talk to them they will start to worry more because they are going to lose you. It's the best feeling ever to finally not care about your moms opinion or having to contact her
They are an asshole but outing them isn't super nice 😅
Yup… I’m on the fence about changing my voice. I kinda like my voice.
I used to compare the way that I felt to that of being a lego or a Barbie😅 you know how they are just perfectly flat
I want people to look at my gender like you would a pretty rock.
Do people not understand that people have dysphoria about different things? 

I've had people say similar thing about my appearance ""well if you cut your hair then I'll believe your trans!"" cis men have long hair too, I don't really have dysphoria around my hair. My boobs though? Yeah hate those. Voice? Would like to change. Of course I get gendered as a woman because of my hair, but I got gendered as a woman with my hair cut short. I'll probably always get gendered as a woman because I'm 5 feet tall.
Love when people just project their assumptions on what others deal with internally based on seeing a very very small snippet of someone's life 🥴
It's not down playing it. But to be honest somebody else's dysphoria is not my problem. Some people get dysphoria, and I feel bad for them. I get dysphoria,  Sometimes people feel bad for me. But nobody gets to make that someone else's problem. 

Your dysphoria is your own to deal with and if you're having a hard time with it then you need a therapist.
They didn't tho?
Way to downplay this ratio 😼
No absolutely, I totally agree with that. Just because people are in the same group of people doesn't mean they have the same experiences.
Seriously, I understand mistaking me for a woman too, because it takes much more effort for me to fully come across to strangers as a man when I am one, than to just wear less fitted clothes and forgive people who assume I’m just butch or something. Plus I love my rockstar hair and don’t currently want to give it up even with the damage. I often get shy around people, especially androgynous people because I admire them but also have no way of guessing without asking for pronouns, which is really frowned on by people who aren’t LGBT in my area.
Fr. Anybody who spends their time trying to invalidate the happiness of others shouldn’t be taken seriously
What?
Just gotta send em love, loving and healing energy, and leave em be 💗🙏
to my understanding, they were originally called that by non-transphobic trans ppl as a shorthand for “true transsexual scum”, but truscum seem to have reappropriated the label in their proudness of being exclusionary “scum”. kind of that self-virtuous “i’ll stand by my beliefs even if i’m hated, cause they’re right and i don’t cave to wokeness!” attitude
Make it make sense 😐
Not cool outing them. This is harassment.
yeesh, i hate the abusive way the OG commenter treated OP as much as anyone else, but really? literally all you’ve ever commented is all related to the person you linked, idk if you’re a sock puppet of the OG or just obsessive, but either way that really don’t seem healthy
You called? Oh got sick of dming me telling me to kill myself?
My ex helped me so much with this. He stated that ""being trans isn't about dysphoria as much as it's about euphoria."" To clarify this isn't to wipe away the idea that dysphoria isn't prevalent in the trans community, but that it's isn't a 'gatekeeper' to being trans.
😂🤣😂🤣
Thank you for reading!! 😋
and that’s so lame that you’ve had to just get used to it 🙃 but you definitely are creating that welcoming space so thank you 🥹
Damn, and even after reading a post about it they missed the point.
Oh... well

Them: ''YOU CAN'T BE A FEMALE IF YOU DON'T SHAVE YOUR BEARD!!!1!!1!''

Cis women with beards who don't shave theirs: hhmmm

there, fixed
Honestly? A bitch. She kinda ruined our relationship after she, and my aunt, believed a known liar that I talked shit about her behind her back. So this was more than enough of a good reason for me to drop her.
Lmao I mean like I'm a trans guy and I'm dating a trans woman. I hate her and she was the worst person I've ever met for a fuckload of other reasons but as I said, she's a bad person AND she's trans, she's not a bad person BECAUSE she's trans
Awh I totally get that, potentially you feel like how I feel with my curvy chest I just see it as a part of my body like my elbow but because I know the rest of the world has a very cut out perception of curvy chest = woman even tho I don't see it like that I know for a fact other people will and therefore I have a hard time when I'm not wearing my binder 😅 idk I think your awesome and I send positive Energy ✨
Yeah! And some of them absolutely despise it while others don’t care. Because if it doesn’t make you feel dysphoric then you most likely just accept it as part of your body/part of yourself. Which is awesome 🤷🏻‍♀️
Same. I always thought mine was on the more neutral side until everyone started clocking me when I answered the work phones 🙃
I was for a while too, but I'm menopausal so I can get it done with a pretty lose dose of T. Figured why not give it a go and I can always stop when I'm ready to. Just met with my hormone doc yesterday. In two weeks we meet up again and begin treatment
I've recently only wanted to slightly change my voice. I love its register and warmth but wish it was a bit more feminine.
Same. Like I like my voice for the most part, it's on the moderate to lower side of feminine and can sound neutral at times but I wish it could be deeper sometimes.

Yeah they will always find a reason to invalidate you. Just remember they don't mean shit to you.
Like seriously, my dysphoria over my chest is highly variable in both directions, while my voice dysphoria is only ever more or less “bad.” Otherwise this is an okay body and I’m just struggling with accepting I have massive scars now.
The hair thing is so annoying. I know tons of cis men with long hair and cis women with short hair. It’s arbitrary af
Having long hair makes me feel MORE masc and that's why I'm growing it out.

Definitely true. I've spent a LONG time meeting a lot of colorful people and there are a lot of different mindsets out there for things I never once thought of. I think it's the coolest thing but other people call me dumb for not understanding thought processes that most normal people get 🤔
Yup 😅  I don't
From the post: ""having facial hair makes you a man only."" That you can't be any kind of trans if you still exibit characteristics of your assigned sex, even if those characteristics aren't *exclusive* to your assign sex. That humans can only be 1 of 2 things.
Yep 😅 sometimes I can do that
Nice 😂  thank you for the lesson 🥰
Thank you for explaining

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Lol yup 😂🤣
Aweee I'm sorry 😞
I mean I think it's a little different 😅 just because I do actually not like my beard 😅 there are a long list of reasons I keep it. But being comfortable with keeping it is not me right now 🤪  But it doesn't hurt me physically and and it's not the worst dysphoria I've ever felt
Lol that's the thing that's weird about my situation though 😅 I do get dysphoria from my beard and I hate it. But I think I want to not get dysphoria from it before I shave, or maybe I'm making a point, or maybe I'll like the beard one day. 

I just feel like I hate the beard and I can't tell if it's because I actually don't like it or everyone tells me I'm fucked up for keeping it. So until I'm sure I'm shaving for me then ima keep it to support people 🥰
I want my voice to be a bit more deeper so people won't mistake me as female. Because I just don't want to be seen as a female. I want to be seen more as a msc Nb.
No but it really is quite cool. It's not like we're all just one big hivemind haha. Everyone has their own views and experiences, it's what makes a person who they are...
Hehehe of course just reminding you to rethink ya reactions! 💗💗💗 much love
I agree they don’t deserve our kindness. This doesn’t mean they deserve *unkindness* though. And if you can’t see how telling someone to kill themselves and sharing their details online is wrong then you need to take a serious look at yourself.
Be better then them mate 😅
learn to control that bud. not gonna get far by telling ppl to kill themselves when you're mad
I mean I don't like my chest either I just look at in a natural kinda way
Hmmm ok but a beard grows back so you could try to shave it off to see how you feel, don’t force yourself into discomfort just because of others. You need to consider how you feel first :) 

I mean. I’d suggest trying it out, it doesn’t cost anything and it’s a personal choice. Choosing to yourself not have a beard doesn’t mean you don’t support trans women who keep theirs :)
But that’s just my opinion haha you do you!!
Oh lol 😆 I try to be positive and helpful 🥰

This person was aspecially stupid though 🙄 and caught me on 4th day of no sleep. Not an excuse because I don't care about what that person thinks but I was way to tired to be polite about his idiocy.
I agree 😬 harrasing them was not the purpose of my post
Yeah I'm attempting that with my face 🙃 it's going... well? Kinda. Except for the death threats.
Well the thing is since I have been on estrogen my beard hair has been changing and I'm kind of worried that if I shave it it'll never grow in this full again so I feel like it might be my last opportunity to try having a beard
Understandable!
Hmmm. Yeah I getcha. Maybe ask around other people on E to see how it changed their facial hair? Maybe it’s just gonna be a bit thinner and paler but you could still grow a beard? Just to assess all of your options properly
I do 🥰 there's a couple other people I know of that have similar situations 😅"	ws5vhn	NonBinary	808	0.97	2022-08-19 05:43:53

As a balding non-binary thank you so much you make me feel so valid. I really can't accept going bald and being non binary, it's devastating, but you look AMAZING with no hair
dreamy is definitely correct~
goalsssss
Your look is absolute fire my friend 🔥 💯
Nice tats :)
Thank you so much! 💕
Thank you! It may be a bootleg but at least it's a cool bootleg.
I'm flattered!
Agreed. Dreamy is right!! 😳
Thank you! 💕
I was also devastated when I started losing my hair. I spent a couple years trying to hide it, but I soon realized that I should just embrace it. Bald is beautiful.

One of my friends shared this, and I thought some people here could use the support.		"33 and non-binary!! I have not been in this identity long but I am grateful to have found it.  It was like solving a puzzle inside my existence! We are everywhere!
Is it normal that this made me very emotional? 

I feel like a life as an openly enby person is still so out of reach for me. 

i still tell myself I could live in stealth and just ignore it/hide it from most people. Because I don't want to have to explain, because I'm scared that science one day will prove me wrong, because I'm constantly in denial, because I believe my parents won't ever understand, because I'm scared of people's judgement... 

I'm 21, I've known that I wasn't cis for around 8 years and I still don't know if I'll ever accept it. I'm already living life in a higher difficulty mode because I'm AFAB and both sexism and gynecologic reasons make my life a bit difficult, I just don't want to add more challenges to it. 

So sorry I'm ranting. I must be tired :/
Late 40s
23, 24 in 2 days. Came out as genderfluid (any pronouns) at 17, then dropped that and just used ""nonbinary"" (they/them or ze/zir) at 19, then dropped the ze/zir and used they/them exclusively at 20, then just this past spring came out *again*, this time as a demiguy, using they/he pronouns. 

I've been enby for more than 6 years now. You'll be okay.
Don’t mind me, I’m almost crying but it’s fine.

Nearly 30, by the way...
Your story gives me courage even if I'm not from the US and my parents are never going to be accepting. Thanks a lot.
I hope I can get to a point like that someday, being confident enough to introduce myself as I am.
I constantly feel like I'm collecting too many identities


I'm non-binary, I'm plural, I'm gay, I'm pagan-
It feels like maybe  I'm making everything up to be cool or something
Where do you live and how soon can I too?
I'm 28, and I taught highschool for a year as part of a student teaching program and used they/them pronouns with all of my students and coworkers and there were two other kids in my classes that also used they/them. Now I'm a software developer and my workplace is really accepting and awesome about it. 

Our COO actually advocated for me in a way I never expected from anyone. We were getting this new online platform for managing our benefits like time off and stuff and she called me to let me know that they only give 2 gender options, but that she'd been on the phone with the people who run it and they hadn't given her a good answer so she was basically running it up the chain trying to get answers about when they would change it because it didn't align with their (the company I work for) values as a company. And I was totally shocked because I never expected anyone to do something like that, it was really amazing.
31, non-binary high school teacher in suburban Kentucky. My kids and community have been wonderful. I recently began using they/them pronouns, shared that with my whole staff last week over a zoom call, and will be sharing with all of my students on our first day of class next week!
48 here.
If only it was that easy. Idk if I can be myself without ending up estranged and homeless.
needed thisssss
This post was so beautiful 😭 I especially love the idea that “exploring your identity should be an adventure”!
I’m 26 years old and it wasn’t until this year that I opened up to my friends and family about it. There’s a part of me that now feels unlocked and A big chunk of worries disappeared and my confidence transformed.
This made me emotional, I have never met an adult that identifies as non-binary that I know of, I am out to everyone in my nuclear family except for my Dad, and my Mom just brushed it off and no one but my sister uses my preferred name. I have felt very alone and just knowing that there are successful adult enbys out there gives me hope that I can thrive in the future and be out and proud to everyone. Thank you for this post, have an amazing day!
I'm 39 and have always been non-binary, just didn't have the words for it. I know many non-binary people and everyone approaches it differently. The ""explosion"" of enby teens to me is mostly a product of growing up with the language to describe your feelings, and exposure to others who feel similarly. When I didn't have the words, I just said ""I don't feel like a boy or a girl, I'm just me."" 

There's lots of us ""elders"" (I'm not old, I swear lol) who are quietly enby too. Not out of shame per se, just because that's how we've been for years and no sense kicking up a fuss now. But seeing this...perhaps we (i) should work on being more visible for our enby kids.
Thank you so much that made me feel so much better
It's comforting to see that it can get better. 
✌
Okay I wasn’t ready to cryyyy
Thank you for this!
Seeing the part about the non-binary lesbian person helps a lot. Thank you for sharing ❤️
Thank you, yaoismasher6969 😂
41, and formerly identified as a bi male since teen years, but mostly dated opposite sex and felt like a fraud (turns out I like gnc types and amab enbys are notoriously hidden). I also carried around a genderqueer identity that no one took seriously. People started asking for pronouns at work and I was like: well, if you're asking it's they/them. Only then it did it click. I love that enby is now an option that people can understand. I'm one of many at work. this thread is great!
32 and came to grips with it 2.5 years ago and it felt like a world off my shoulders. Grats to you too!
I can relate to this feeling. I never felt like I was a part of a group because I never fit into any boxes. So I decided I was simply different beyond the possiblity to fit anywhere. It is a very lonely feeling. Non-binary helps me feel connected in a way I've never felt before. 

I think it's more difficult to keep up a facade than be true to yourself.

I had a breakthrough lately about who I am. I am an overly caring person, so much so that it was starting to make me resentful. I struggle with it still. I want to help as many people as possible. Especially my friends and family. Recently a few (older right wing) family members called me magical. I know that might not sound like much but being from a strictly Christan family and having the older part tell me that lit me up inside. And I have friends that tell me I make them brave, help them cry without shame and that they would call me if they needed help because they know I would be there. All this happens when I'm being the most true to myself. My realization was all my dreams will come true if I just live my truest truth. All my world is waiting for me to be myself so they can love the real me. I only show them part of the magic. Because I feel like I'm too much. And for some people I am :) but there's something magnetic about someone living and loving as intensely as they can. 

If I can tell you anything to try please start loving yourself. I have only recently understood what that means. For me it's NOT being so mean to myself in my head and letting myself make mistakes without severely beating myself up. 

I am not out to my family yet and I'm terrified about how it will go but I am also super excited to put it out there. 

Good luck on your journey. You are a beautiful experience. You are valid and you are not alone.
Happy almost birthday!!!
You're not making it up. People who make things up are intentionally and consciously doing that. You are just figuring yourself out, and you've realized that you're a complex person!! That's wonderful!!
Oh man. I feel this in my soul lmao
Cities are generally good. Up here in Burlington, Vermont I had classes at college with more enbies than men. (4-5 enbies, 1-3 men) almost ever semester. I also got a writing degree, so it's not like I was in stem, but still. Profs literally thanked me for correcting them on my pronouns. The school I went to had other issues, but wow were they shockingly good re: gender.
Yay us!! I think it's been a little over a year for me but yes it was like I read the definition of non-binary and there was a click in my chest like ""that's me!! I knew there was something more than A or B! YASSSSSS"" and then my world/life experiences/and so many other things made more sense. It is truly magical!

Holy shit your hair is GORGEOUS
noo you have 444 upvotes and i don't wanna ruin it by making it 445..

guess ill just have to give an award.. sad.. :\]
Peak androgyny achieved
Can I ask how you settled on those pronouns? As in Irish person fae and fairies are very ingrained in our culture ans folklore so it's my first time seeing someone use pronouns like this.
You look so good 😍, dyed hair is the best!
Green is my favorite color, it’s just so pretty!
Thank you! It just springs up to the side after I have it in a pony tail all day!
One time, a random guy did and just said “mmm that’s fine,” as long as you don’t do that it’ll be amazing :P
Let’s see, fae is equal to they, Faer is them, faers is their, and faerself is themself! I think that covers most right?
Thanks! They’re fresh off the grill
Fae is just like “Lay” or “may,” but with an F at the start, Faer is fay-er with the er being like any on the end of a word!
I told one of my friends that I would use any pronouns but usually they/them, and they just started using these without hesitation, and they stuck! Apparently they’re mildly common neopronouns, but he was also into the fae and fairies, so it may have been a bit biased
So don't make cat noises.
Thank you 😀
God it's just the culture in me but my instinct is like ""be careful, they'll take you away!"". We were told that if we were naughty kids, especially in rural Ireland. If we misbehaved our parents or especially grandparents said they'd leave us out for the fairies to take.
Maybe a light purring

I (25) came out as non-binary with she/they pronounce to my boyfriend, and he broke up with me because of it	Hi everyone. So my now ex boyfriend and I had been together for about a year and a half. For the remaining half year we started having troubles in our relationship, but it was mostly him who contemplated breaking it off. He tried once, but we ended up going back together shortly after. Doing that half year I also started to realize that I don't feel completely like a woman, and I decided to come out as non-binary to him. He reacted by telling me that we could no longer be a couple, because he thought the whole non-binary thing was stupid, and he didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who identify as such. It absolutely broke me, because he was the first one I came out to, and I thought we were starting to make our relationship work. It also made me so terrified of coming out to my parents and siblings, but I did anyways and I received nothing but support. I still can't help but feel absolutely devastated about my ex boyfriend's reaction, even tho he apologized afterwards.	"This might sound harsh, but good riddance. Especially since he was looking for reasons to break up with you anyway.
Sorry you had to go through that, though. Hope you're doing better.
It's hard to see now, but you're better off for it. You'll get through this and someone will come along who loves you for all of you.
Just remember that his reaction says more about him than it does about you. If being open and honest with him about who you are drove him away, he wasn't right for you to begin with. While it can be difficult for cis partners to understand a non binary identity in the context of their relationship, especially if they viewed themselves and their relationship as heteronormative, it's no excuse. A good partner is going to take the time to learn and be supportive. As harsh as it sounds you're better off without him.
The first person you came out to was YOU. And that went well. 

His reaction, though disappointing, is unimportant and insignificant. Even before you came out he was acting a whole a$$. He was not worth your time even before this. Let him find his way out of your life. 

Many people are not going to understand non-binary. That’s fine. As long as they get out of your life and don’t harm you then they are not your concern. Clear your mind and be a best friend to yourself always.
I am so very sorry. Not everyone can go on this journey with you. Other people have agency and decisions to make, even if those decisions are shallow and uneducated. You can’t make people be better than they are if they choose not to be.

But, his actions do not speak to you. Your being brave and being your true authentic self opens the door to finding some one who is a better partner to you. I wish you luck…

Best to you…
I wouldn't think too much about it in this instance, like you said he had tried to break it off earlier. I think he just latched onto the easiest reason that someone who had already checked out could have. I'm sorry that someone so close to you has hurt you when you tried to open. I would take some time to digest and get something you like to drink for comfort, like a hot chocolate. It's gonna be rough but as long as you take it slow for a bit. But that's just my reaction for something like this. I hope everything gets better ♡
I’m sorry he did that to you. At the very least, he told you what type of person he is through his actions, and even though it hurts now, you will be better off without him in the future.
Exact same thing happened to me in July.  I know it's hard, but it'll feel better soon.  Feel free to DM me if you wanna talk about it or vent.  Sending love <3
Onwards and upwards !!!!!!
I'm really sorry that you experienced such a harsh reaction to coming out to him. It might make it feel more scary to tell other people, but it isn't an indicator of how other people in your life will react.
Good riddance! You’re better off without him.
You dodged a bullet, there is no reason for you to stay with someone who has no respect for who you are! Being broken up with sucks, but you are better off with someone who can respect and accept every part of you. Someone who was worth your time would’ve tried to understand, not dismissed you as stupid.
Damn. I know you miss him right now, but you’re absolutely better off without him if he feels this way. You deserve someone who loves you for who you truly are and not a fake idea he’s conjured up in his head
Just a word of advice. Don’t take him back. Feeling forced to be someone your not by someone who is supposed to love you for who you are is aweful. I’m so sorry he reacted the way he did.
I feel you. I'm sorry it happened to you but I assure you it gets better because you get to live as your true self. Sure somme people reacts badly but in my experience most will be supportive even if they might have a hard time trying to understand.

My partner of 20 years broke up with me the minute I came out as non-binary. It's really hard because it's someone you trust and it sort of comes out of nowhere. I'm proud of you for coming out to your parents right away after that and I'm glad it went well. It took me a year and a half to come out to a second person after that.
Without even reading the content just the title I can tell you right now you’re better off
A relationship with him is not worth decades of depression (which is what I had when I didn't realise till I was 40), you are better off without that bigot (even if you weren't nonbinary) it won't take long to feel this and someone much better will be along :)

Congratulations - knowing yourself is powerful
It sounds like you were having other problems and he was looking for an excuse to leave. Better now than if you had invested even more time in him. Take time to heal and find someone who appreciates you for you.
What an asshole, you deserve SOOO much better!
You are better off without an asshole that doesn't respect you.

He did you a favor. As hard as it is to get such a negative reaction to coming out, it 100% reflects on him, not you. It sounds like he was just looking for an excuse to end things anyway.  

It's amazing you were brave enough to then come out to your family! Wow, that shows a lot of strength. And I'm glad they reacted so positively, because it reinforces the standard of people who deserve your time and energy. Your ex = unworthy.  

Take your time to recover from the breakup, and when you're ready, remember how shitty he was when you were at your most vulnerable, and wash your hands of him. There are tons of kind, cool people out there who will love and accept you just as you are. 💜
It's always a beautiful thing when the trash takes itself out.
Others have said what I was going to with better words so I'll turn to my second reaction: 

The trash took itself out!
I am so sorry that that happened to you! As others have said, you're definitely better off without him. There are plenty of people (including your typical 'dude') who will be supportive and into you regardless of what gender you identify as or the pronouns you use. 💜
ur ex sucks x
I’m so sorry 🥺 but yes, better off without him
Just remember: When the Age of Man falls and the Dark Emprex takes command of the mortal realm, he will burn. Ye who have embraced the void shall remain, so rejoice in his agonizing death.
Ya know what, screw him. You're really better off for it. I know it sucks now, but your pronouns are your business and if he really loved you he would respect them. And don't worry about support because you have us for that. Either way I'm sorry you're going through this but hang in there.
Lots of red flags here ... You definitely are better without him.

You know, it's okay to not be attracted to non-binary people, but as soon as they say ANYTHING close to ""because that's stupid"", they're trash.

I do find it odd if someone finds you attractive, is fine with your version of genitalia, then finds out you're non-binary and suddenly loses interest or changes how they treat you?? That's like, maybe it's not just a gender thing, and it's transphobia.

If they were with you and you come out as enby, and it's the same person, the same body, the same gender expression or slightly different, just different pronouns or something, what the fuck? I can't see that being anything but transphobia.
your siblings will be much more likely to love you regardless. you can expect much better from family even though it may be scarier! they will still love you and care about you unlike this temporary, transphobic man. i’m sorry you’re going through this though, i know how heartbreaking that would be. you’ll get through it and feel much better after. you got this!
Oh, no! You deserve better!

&#x200B;

{hugs}
It may be hard now but trust me, it gets better. My (now ex) bf of a year and a half (my longest relationship ever) constantly invalidated me. I came out as non-binary to him and a couple of friends and everyone supported me. He said it didn’t change his feelings for me and that it wouldn’t change our relationship. The issue came when he said I was still his girlfriend and that he was still going to refer to me as female with she/her pronouns even though I didn’t identify with any of it and even told him I didn’t like it. I just lived with him not listening to me and we eventually broke up. He ended up being abusive, both mentally and physically, and I’m thankful I escaped that relationship when I did. Life gets easier❤️
He sounds like a dodged bullet. Do you think you could be happy with someone who thinks part of your core as a person is ‘stupid’ (which means he doesnt understand and doesn’t want to?)
this really makes me realize how lucky i am to be with the person i am with. we had been dating for a while and i told him i was nonbinary, and i wanted to go by “they/them” pronouns. he was super confused by it and did not understand, but the main thing is that he loves me a lot, and he was going to support regardless. he is nowhere near the same person he was when i told him that. he is more supportive, more loving, and even more left leaning than he was a year ago. i recently told him i am gonna try out “he/him” pronouns online with some close friends, and he was like “okay!” and i was so worried he’d run away. he said “nope, i love you.” apparently he was wondering when i’d come out with that, and he wasn’t surprised. 😳

so, moral of my little story… find you a person who loves you no matter what. because that person exists, and they don’t care about how you identify or how you dress. they care about **you**.
This sounds harsh but he saved you from a lot of heartache and wasted energy. This is a blessing, now, you don't have him dragging you down during exploration
Changing your gender is a big deal, and he has every right to choose whether he wants to date someone with a different gender.  It seems if you have the right to change your gender, he has the right to change his mind.
It is a loss.  However, you did the right thing being honest, with him.
When people tell you who they are, believe them. You're ex broke up with you because he's a bigot. You deserve better than to be with a bigot.
Your ex is a closed minded jerk. I know it hurts right now, but you'll be better off without him in the long run. I highly reccomend going and doing a bunch of things you love to do, especially if any of them were things he wouldnt let you do.
This happened to me. Turns out bf is a transphobic arsehole. Good riddance. It’s sad but you will find someone who accepts you for you. That’s more important. You’ll realise he’s been holding you back in ways you didn’t know until afterwards. You’re stronger than you know and you’ll be okay without him. Even better in fact <3
It sounds like he wanted an excuse to leave. He was just too much of a coward to do it nicely.
Don’t worry about this guy. You have support from your parents and siblings, which is one of the most wonderful things possible. I’m thinking your ex had a very “not in my backyard” type of attitude toward transgender people. Basically he’s fine with their visibility, but not fine being with someone who is non-binary. Not to be harsh, but he sounds like a jerk and you’re going to be better off without him. Don’t let someone weigh you down or change who are you.
This might sting, but congratulations. Now you get to find someone who digs you for who you are. His reaction wasn’t about you, it was about his insecurities. A lot of people can’t handle being in a queer relationship… but the best people can. Also, I didn’t come out as nonbinary until age 37. When I spoke to my then-wife about it she told me if that’s how I felt that that was disgusting. I met my now partner (a cis “het” male) just before I turned 39. I’m so glad my ex-wife left me so I could live in my truth and find someone who appreciates the true me. I got lucky. You will too!
The trash has taken itself out. Now go find the cute woke lefty scruffy boi we all need in our lives.
I’m sorry that happened. I know It hurts a lot but having to lie or deny your true self so someone “loves” or simply approves of you is truly the deepest cut. Be true to yourself and who you are. You’ll find someone who loves you for *you*, non-binary and all
my wife came really close to leaving me too.
  was scary but she got used to it.
good! he should run as far away possible and you should get yourself a better bf that likes that sort of stuff
yea fr, if he doesn’t accept who you are then he’s not the one for you. you don’t deserve to have someone treat you poorly like that
This. My (now ex) bf of 5 years told me “he wasn’t attracted to THAT” and at the time I had no plans on transitioning. We had been having problems and I had been depressed for 5 years, my longest depression. Even though he wasn’t attracted to that and didn’t understand any of it, I dunno, he still wanted to be together? 

I broke it off, my depression lifted, my dysphoria got worse. I’m now in an amazing place. Far better than I could have dreamed. March will be 1 year depression free. 

Be with someone who you don’t have to hide yourself from. OP You’re worth it.
Came here to say this.  A partner who would react in that way to you coming out is someone who is going to tear you down, even if they apologize. It’s an action that reveals a much deeper problem with how he perceives and values you.  I broke up with my ex and it was like every light turned green as far as me becoming more and more my authentic self, which I would’ve never even had the opportunity to question if I was in a relationship with someone who immediately invalidated me. It’s going to give you the freedom to figure out and become who you want to be.
It came as a huge shock, because he knew from the very beginning of the relationship that I am bisexual, and he had no problem with it whatsoever. He even told me that he didn't care if people were gay or trans, as long as they act like good people. But somehow me being non-binary drew the line.
[removed]
Me and my sister had the same problem but with our dad. Luckily he left our lives 12 years ago and we don't know him anymore.
My mom was the one I was the most scared to come out to. She doesn't understand why some people need labels to feel complete. And even tho she said she'll be nothing but supportive, she doesn't want to use they. My brother, on the other hand, said that if I prefer they he'll practice saying it.
[removed]
Lol
I think he was fearing that I'll start presenting myself as masculine, because he prefer fems. But I switch between feminine and genderless, and I don't intend to change my style and personality. I'll still be the same person he's known for the last year and a half.

But I've noticed that heterosexuals and cis people in general are having a hard time accepting the need to use a specific set of pronouns.
You can't always expect that from family unfortunately. It depends on who your family is.
He absolutely does. It's okay to prefer dating a specific kind of gender. But he could've told me that in a nicer way instead of calling it stupid and break up in a panic.
Hopefully they'll come to realize that it actually isn't a loss because he's an asshole.
My husband raked the yard for three days after I came out. In July when we had no leaves. But then he was over the shock. Turns out I had just forced him to confront his own bisexual feelings.
I'm sorry but if you come out as trans and your monosexual partner says they're not attracted to that gender, that seems completely fair and even affirming.
I'm so sorry that he misrepresented himself as a safe person to you. Some people really can't handle any threat to how they view themselves or the world. My husband was supportive when I came out (tbf he is very intuitive and knows me well, and had dreams I came out as trans for like weeks leading up to me telling him, so not surprised) but he also told me he struggled to come to terms with what that meant for his identity. Your ex wasn't a strong enough person to sit down and do the necessary reflections to expand his worldview. You by virtue of exploring your identity and asking these hard questions about yourself learned and grew. Don't view this a rejection of yourself, you simply outgrew your ex.
Some people feel that dating someone who is nonbinary doesn’t work with their sexuality, and others don’t, I really don’t think either scenario is uncommon. And in this instance, their boyfriend said that being nonbinary was stupid, not just that he didn’t want to personally be in a queer relationship, so it sounds like he was actually being an asshole, especially to someone who is just coming out and sharing something vulnerable.
I didn't know it was that big of a deal breaker, sorry. I'm more of love the person and I wouldn't care what pronouns. I was just saying that in this case it could of been an easy thing to latch onto to break off the relationship for the last time.
My mom was seemingly accepting at first. Then I found out she outed me to the extended family by telling them my therapist was ""forcing"" me to take hormones. Fortunately most of the family is either accepting or doesn't care much.
no one said he had to, weirdo
He didn't have to treat them the way he did though. Saying the whole non binary thing is stupid is mean and unnecessary.
it’s true. sorry if I was over positive
The fact is that we cannot control how others react.  He could've been more graceful about it, but he wasn't.  That is the risk we take everyday in every relationship.

The practice here, and it is a practice, is for you to affirm your own identity.  It's not his job.  It's not anyone's job but yours.  If you understand that, you can be free.
Still has to be disappointing though.
I agree it’s fair, but how he said it was not the best. He also discovered it from my old Reddit account and sat on the information for a while and told my sister, before coming to me. We had communication issues to say the least.
He did change it from being stupid to just not being his preferred type. He knows that the way he handled it in the moment was unacceptable, but it's not the first time he described something I said or did as being stupid.
I didn't get to see who the person was and what their comment said before it was deleted. It could've been the same person who messaged me saying that my bf breaking up with a non-binary freak like me shouldn't have come as such a shock. It could've been a whole other person entirely, but that single message was the reason why I almost deleted the entire post.
Thats ok
That’s good but yeah, his initial reaction did suck and it sounds like things have been pretty turbulent, plus nobody should be calling you stupid for anything. I’m sure you’re better off without him in the long run, even though it hurts.

The comment I was replying to seems to be deleted, idk if you saw it, but that person saying that “most people” wouldn’t date someone nonbinary (not remotely true in my experience) and that your ex did nothing wrong, so that’s where my reply is coming from."	reqja7	NonBinary	725	0.99	2021-12-12 14:52:22
B, They/Them. Some days I feel super impatient about top surgery but I’m thankful for my queer community/family for the love and support.		"you give off such androgynous vibes i love it
You look stunning, honestly. I love your hair.
yr killin it.... so dreamy
😍
[deleted]
Holy moly your andro energy is powerful! You are an incredibly attractive person!
Me too!!

We’ll get it eventually dude! Here’s to top surgery, hopefully soon!
You are a beautiful human being. I'm non op for various reasons and top dysphoria is a bitch.  Remember you're always valid and you're already you.
😍
I know, I love dreads. I'm white AF and could never wear them, unfortunately.
Awe thanks ! Patience has been the real challenge.
Truly truly. You’re so right ! Can’t wait to share the growth with the community here !
Right! Cheers and happy new year !
I love that and appreciate you!"	e34u2l	NonBinary	703	1.0	2019-11-28 21:46:07
Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/
If you are in the US you can report her to the state board, and if you utilize insurance you can also report her to your insurance."	11196wq	NonBinary	701	0.99	2023-02-13 14:13:29
Binary trans to non binary?	"Did anyone else go from a binary trans identity to a non binary identity?

I have been out a FTM for the past like 4 years but I’m beginning to feel, I guess almost a reverse dysphoria about being so so so masculine. I was comfortable for a while but I’m starting to think I don’t enjoy being seen as a man much and I may be more feminine/in the middle.

It is extremely difficult because my transition thus far has been testosterone and top surgery and I am worried I made some mistakes now that I’m not sure if I am a binary man. I get very panicky because it’s not like I want to detransition and be a woman or anything, but i am not as comfortable with he/him and being perceived as a man all the time.

This is very scary because I have put so much effort into passing and being a man and for a while I was very comfortable but now I feel differently.

Did anyone else face this or something similar? I really need support"	"You're not de-transitioning. Your transition goals have just changed. You learned more about yourself. That's a good thing.
Yup. Transfem enbi here, and i get dysphoria whenever I’m too feminine or too masculine like you do. The balance is quite difficult, i have days i can’t even wear makeup at all, then i get dysphoria from feeling too masc 😩
First off, this sounds really tough! I feel for you. For a long time I thought I couldn't be trans at all because when I tested out trans man it felt as wrong as being a cis woman did. I think a lot of people got stuck with feeling a need to be one or the other. Society is still very stuck on the binary, and it can be so hard to realize the binary isn't the truth.

I don't think you made the wrong choices for you at the time. Lots of afab nonbinary people also use T and get top surgery! I'm planning bottom surgery too. And even though I haven't even gotten a date for my first top surgery consult, I'm already researching prosthetic breast forms, so I can have both shapes.

 But also...

Trans men are allowed to be feminine! We praise cis men for exploring their feminine sides. As a trans man, you deserve the same. You can absolutely live your life ""less masculine"" and still be 100% a man. You can wear skirts and makeup and do ""girly things"" and still be a man. 

And I don't mean drag — you can mess with gender norms in your daily life whatever your gender is.

Maybe being a man feels wrong right now because you're putting pressure on yourself to conform to a certain type of manhood that isn't *your* manhood. Do you think letting yourself be a feminine man for a whole might ease up some of the pressure?

We are always discovering more about ourselves and whether you're a man or nonbinary, you are valid. Taking the long road to finding yourself is OK. The amount of time it takes to be your true self is morally neutral — it's not bad or good to take a detour on the way; it just is what it is.
I think for me it was a big step when I realized that gender can be very fluid. You can feel completely comfortable as a man for a few years and then feel more comfortable as nb for a few years. It's okay for your identity to change and your current identity doesn't invalidate any of your past identities and vise versa. I was a he/him trans man for five years and I was fully a man and was on T and had top surgery. Now I'm a she/they genderqueer and I don't think that makes my physical transition any less worth it.
I actually had a similar experience, as have many other people I know. A lot of us actually *do* identify as detrans in some way, but it doesn't necessarily mean we're desisted from trans identity. Just that we had to course-correct for a transition that was too binary. A lot of people are really misinformed by TERFs on what detrans people can be like, so it can be scary to have an experience that could be ""counted."" But rather than tell you ""that's not detransition"" I'd present to you instead the knowledge that lots of detrans NB people in this exact situation exist, and it's up to you if you consider yourself one of us or not. You don't have to give up being trans to reverse or change your transition, regardless. 

I went on HRT for long enough that I started getting dysphoric about some of the changes. I stopped for a few years, but my intersex variation caught up to me and I had to go back on, so I'm sort of working with the same situation that no-E transfem people are, in the end? Having to work with what I got even if it feels like it's kinda working against me. It's fine. 

Medical transition doesn't have to be gender-affirming. It can be something you regret or had a mixed or rough experience with. That's ok. You can always course correct and move forward.
I felt that but at a hyper compressed timeline. I wanted to be a full blown woman, then I stepped back to non-binary. Honestly, I think my resting point is going to be genderqueer (GNC) trans woman.

Edit: thought I might explain. I feel like my _identity_ is a binary woman but my _expression_ is fluid/non-binary (whatever i feel, whenever i feel). So the social element of my gender is why I picked the label genderqueer.
When I came out, I came out as non-binary transmasc. I thought about identifying as a male and that just never felt right to me. I never wanted to be placed back into the box of gender and have tons of societal expectations on my shoulders about how I should and shouldn’t behave, dress, etc. I’ve got a beard, most everyone identifies me as a man, but I know that I’m not.

I don’t want the weight of having to perform masculinity to society’s standards. And you shouldn’t have to either.
i had a very similar experience, just in reverse. i came out as a trans woman when i was 15, and for so long passing was the most important thing to me. i even used to have nightmares about my hair being cut because i thought it would make me look like a man. well at 19 i had pretty much accomplished my goal. i was never misgendered, never given a side eye in the women’s restroom, and. it sucked. it felt like i was just as trapped in that binary as when i was presenting as a man. 

now i’m 20, i’ve shaved off all my hair, i wear masculine clothes when i want to, i use they/them pronouns, and i’ve never felt more free. it was terrifying at first, because i thought people would think i was detransitioning and i occasionally get called “sir”, but now even being called “sir” doesn’t bother me. 

so let me just say, it will be scary, and i know it’ll be weird inching away from masculinity, but you’ll be okay.
People are saying all kinds of great stuff here that I totally agree with. Just want to add though that we aren't static as people and our gender identities and/or presentations can change over time.
Yep, me! I was a binary trans man for 5 years and am now non-binary. I am “retransitioning” (term I prefer to detransitioning) by going off HRT. I regret some choices and the societal urge to present fully masc. I am now accepting being non-binary for me looks different than my body does now. I got terrible dysphoria from being clocked as a cis man. I’ve found a lot of support in r/actual_detrans which has quite a few folks who go from binary to non-binary trans identities, TERFs aren’t allowed, and it’s a safe place for me to talk about questioning my level of transition (but not being trans), and what I can do to change my presentation in another direction. You’re not alone.
I identify as both FTM and nonbinary, I think it’s just a journey of learning more about yourself. Personally I have some days where being hyper masc sets of dysphoria and some days where it’s euphoric. Some nonbinary folks want testosterone and top surgery too! It could be a case that now that physical dysphoria has gone you’re still discovering what makes you comfortable in other ways.
Even if you were to entirely detrans, as long as you understand that it was a view in your self that has been altered and isn't a fault within the trans community it is okay. 

It's okay to learn more about yourself and realize the information you had previously may not have been enough or you may have taken them in the wrong direction. That's okay! We all do it at times.
I did the exact same thing. After I had been in T and legally changed my name and gender, had too surgery etc. I realized I still enjoyed being feminine when dating straight men. There was a nostalgia about makeup and hair that I missed. 

So I stopped T and stopped cutting my hair. Bought some feminine clothes and wore them, painted my nails, put on makeup, raised my voice a little. Turns out a lot of what I did was to totally reversible. I swung really hard back to fem for about a year and now I’m back to an in-between: short hair, on T, mostly masc clothes but I do still present as very fem sometimes. 

I don’t love being non-binary yet, I have some internalized non-binary-phobia. But I have accepted that I don’t fit in a female box or a male box. I present how I feel and that’s pretty fuckin rad. Looking back I have always done what I felt was right for me at any given point in my transition(s) and that helped me to stop regretting things I did. Now I’m back to appreciating my top surgery and short hair :)
I've been having these same worries. I am a transfem enby and there are days where I just look at myself like ""did I make a mistake?""
Yup, not me, but I’ve seen it plenty. It’s ok for your identity to evolve. I can see the social pressure to be a binary man once you’ve made it that far as to be seen as one in the world. Also remember that man/woman don’t mean the same as masc/fem. You can still be a man if that how you feel but you don’t have to be masculine in ever way, at all times. That’s true for cis guys too, they just often reject it. 

Whatever you do, just be you! Categorization is overrated.
I identified as a binary trans woman for about the first year of my transition. 

Somewhere in there I got the feeling I was trying to ""kill off"" some intrinsic parts of myself and measure up to standards of dress/beauty that, while not in/of themselves are wrong, were harmful for my mental health. 

I now foe the last year have identified as a nonbinary transfeminine person and am very comfortable with my gender identity in a way I wasn't before. 

It's a totally valid experience as gender, for some of us, proves to be a moving target
This is how I discovered I was non-binary. I think it’s pretty normal
Even if you were detransitioning it would be perfectly okay, but it sounds like that's not what you're looking for. Often we're pushed to call ourselves binary trans in order to get access to the medical transition we need and it's completely understandable if you didn't realize you were nonbinary at first. I feel like this would've happened to me if I hadn't already known I'm nonbinary when I first started testosterone.

Just take it one step at a time and don't worry about how other people see your transition. And good luck.
I just wanted to say, this is such a brave and vulnerable share!

When there's potential criticisms towards our experience, it can be much easier to keep quiet. You being so brave is a gift for a huge group of people who relate and now feel less alone💜

Love to you, beautiful soul!
One of my friends, who's always been non binary but transitioned into looking more masculine, has decided to somewhat detransition to look more androgynous. I'm not completely aware of their journey but I could look into it and ask them questions to help you if you want?
Yeah. Genderfluid to agender to ftm to nonbinary. Been an interesting ride.
I identified as ftm for about 7 years! I now identify as nonbinary,  and seeing someone going through something similar to me is quite comforting. I ended up feeling like testosterone wasn't making me better, shaved my beard, and slowly got more adventurous. Be it my nails, doing my hair differently,  and buying more feminine clothing. 
There's nothing to panic about,  especially since gender is such a difficult thing to figure out.
Nonbinary IS trans
I thought I was simply a trans woman, and have been on hrt for the last six months. As I continue to unpack things, however, I realize that I'm actually fluidflux, with a gender that orbits femininity without ever settling down there.

There are days when I feel more masc and the feminisation of my body feels weird, but overall it still feels like the right thing to do, so I'm focusing on presentation changes to help with the dysphoria when that happens.
So I can talk to you about the experience of my friend, a transmasc enby (or ""polygender"" but this is getting more complicated). They identified more or less as enby since the beginning of their transition but that didn't stop them from taking testosterone. They even used mainly he/him at some point. But now they're more comfortable as ever in their non-binarity, and they state testosterone as one of the reasons.
Isn't that an interesting part of how this works. 
I'm M2F but had similar feelings about my birth gender, and have at times since transitioning definitely felt dysphoria the other way.
My personal solution is to just roll with it and generally speaking I just follow my euphoria wherever it leads..

Sometimes I also feel quite neutral,  which is also fine.

I think part of it is to separate mental from physical. 

Physically I can be doing something masculine or feminine, mentally I'm enjoying getting my nails done if I'm her, or I don't have time for this crap if I'm him.

There will always be times where I feel some level of dysphoria, that's OK, also for me my masculine half is big a powerful, and sometimes I need my protector back, so I reserve the right to bring him back anytime I need him without guilt or shame.

I don't know how it works from the other side, but if there are times you want to be soft and pretty or whatever fem means to you, then just be you and that's more than enough.

You still Da'Man, or maybe Da'Nonbianry. 

There's 50 shades of trans, so just find the balance that works for you.
I've definitely drifted from more feminine to more non-binary over time, although still leaning towards feminine. But then I always thought of myself as a tomboy, so I guess that tracks haha
Same here! Thought I was a binary trans man for years and had been on T a year. You’re definitely not alone :)
One of my siblings is currently going through this, so you're definitely not alone 💕
Literally same thing happened to me, I swung too far masculine and had to readjust my transition goals to something that felt more “me”. Now I’m FtN or FtX and use they/them pronouns instead of he/him.
Yeah, I know lots of people who've followed that path! There's no shame in it!
You might be more genderfluid as well. I was happy to identify as NB when I first came out, but am on T now and wondering if I'm a repressed trans man instead.  Sometimea though I feel like I miss my feminine side and feel weird for ""feminine"" gestures for example (until I remember all the fabulous gay men in the world) and realize that I am me and sometimes that presents one way or is interpreted another way by others. I actually think I'm a genderfluid Wizard who shape shifts depending on circumstances and mood. Definitely a delicate balance, but my new transition goal is to stay present with myself and do what feels most like me, knowing that it is all me. Hang in there. It isn't easy, but it can be really fun at times.
No worries. Gender identities can shift over time. I'm gender queer and somewhere smack dab in the middle between the binaries. All I ever knew growing up was that I didn't identify as being female or feminine but I didn't identify as male either, so I was always stuck as female till I realized there was another option other than just ""tomboy"". Learning about yourself is a process.
I'm still finding my comfortable spot when it comes to gender expression. I feel pretty solidly non-binary, but my expression is quite fluid. I don't feel like I have any useful advice to offer, but I do want to thank you for making this post. There's a wealth of wisdom and great advice here and I feel a lot more comfortable after reading through the discussion. I hope it's done the same for you 😊.
I (35) thought at first I may be a trans man (summer '20). I liked binding and all but the thought of being a trans man felt off.    

Then last spring I found out about nonbinary and later it being an umbrella term. Then later than all that, I found out about trans-fem & trans-masc.   

Later I felt I identified with Agender trans-masc. Because, although I don't want cis people assuming my gender. If they decide to pick one, I'd prefer they'd assume I'm a man. Plus there is
/r/FTMfemininity and some TikTokers who are trans men that wear dresses & skirts. Which seeing them gives me gender euphoria.     

To note I do want top surgery (no nips) and on a low dose of T. Then I plan to re-evaluate where I'm at and how I'm feeling. Because we're human and constantly changing. It's the spice of life.
Maybe check out the YouTube channel heycolanda? They’re a nb couple who were on testosterone for a while and eventually quit. I know one of them wants top surgery.
Don’t worry too much about it, you’re not making “mistakes”. You’re learning
more about yourself as you go. Everyone’s journey is different:)
I also see enbies who realise after some time that they are binary trans, so why shouldn't it be the other way around? Figuring stuff out takes time, and I don't see transitioning as a fixed way anymore. Every transition is different and it's totally ok if you're taking longer, taking less time, take turns, even go backwards. Gender is fluid :)
While I can’t relate to what you are going through exactly, I can hard related to the feelings of panic and identity confusion on the topic- I’ll share my experience in the hopes that maybe you’ll feel a little less alone/more validated. 

My agab is female- But I never fit into that box. I was aware of my love and attraction for women reaching back to my earliest memories and, before we really had words like nonbinary and before I had the framework to think about it the only option available to me for a long time was gender non-conforming butch lesbian. I never really thought about my gender tho- just my sexual orientation which was 100% women. And i learned how to be a good butch and what made women happy/what was expected of me. 

In the early 2000’s the informed consent model for HRT made transitioning and getting HRT suddenly exponentially more accessible (thank god) to transgender individuals. But it was actually a little jarring for me because it really felt like overnight all of the butch lesbians I knew were now trans men (I know they were always men, but this was how it felt at the time). Everyone expected that I was going to transition, which i never had any interest in doing, and I remember have feelings about “butch erasure” and i remember feeling really acutely that there was no place for me anymore. 

We were still all thinking in terms of binary gender tho- I knew I wasn’t a man, so by default I figured this must mean i am a woman. It wasn’t until maybe 5 years later when I started working at a clinic that specialized in transgender medicine and listening to people talk about feeling so strongly male or female that I realized I didn’t “feel” any sense of gender- I could not understand what people meant by this. I was fine in the space of “genderless butch lesbian” for another 10 years. 

I’ve always had varying degrees of mild dysphoria at various times in my life, but more around wishing I had something (a man’s chest or a penis) but never wanting to be rid of what I had. And i would have a sense of certain things - like I didn’t want to be a mom I wanted to be a dad. Again, I was still thinking in binary. But I never had any desire to live in and present as male in the world day to day. 

Anyways, 5 years ago I meet this pansexual woman who in one sentence turned my world upside down. I can’t even remember the context but I made some reference to my “butchness” as a reason for something and she said “I don’t care if you’re butch or not, I’m pan”. Well, who knew, all those years I had just been performing butch because it was what was expected of me, all of a sudden this ginormous weight was lifted and I was freed of this huge burden I had no idea I was carrying. 

She took it even further and started to really encourage and support me in my masculinity and this made me feel safe to explore my femininity as well. Through this process I discovered that I am agender most of the time but sometimes very genderfluid, especially when it comes to sex. 

Cue identity crises at the age of 35- my labels that i was so secure in didn’t fit right any more, and what i wanted and needed from a partner changed too. I’m still working it all out, and when I feel threatened or insecure I still sometimes retreat back behind the armor or butch lesbian because even though it doesn’t fit right anymore I’ve worn it so long when i put it on it’s impenetrable (if that makes any sense). I’m trying to figure out where and with whom I fit now, and i sometimes feel guilt and shame about that, and i sometimes feel terrified that I will never find a partner that will love all parts of me and my gender and that I will settle out of fear. 

Coming from a place of someone who had what they thought was a rock solid identity for 20 years this shit is hard, and it’s confusing, and apparently it can change throughout your life or as you get a new framework or point of reference. I have no answers, but at least you’re not alone and at the end of the day figuring out what feels good and right for you is more important than what anyone thinks or wants or expects about you.

Edit- some spelling and punctuation for easier reading/clarification
Kinda opposite? I'm starting think I'm trans instead of nb after thinking I was nb first
Lots of people re-transition. There's still a lot of pressure in the community for binary transition. There's a long his story of denying trans health to third gender people as well, so lots went with the program in order to get needed care. There's now more space to be nonbinary, so it's easier to identify properly.
Hey, I am in the very same boat as you I think.

I came out with 14, almost 10 years ago, started T with 18 and I stopped taking it last February after panicking about my identity throughout the pandemic. 
4 years on T and I realized it wasn't right for me anymore. 

I know I am 100% trans, not detransitioning, I really don't feel like a women but heck I don't feel like a man either. 

And I guess you are going through simlair things rn.

Feeling super confused and lost after going through all those hurdles and stressors, possibly fighting with parents, just to realize you might missed something is really scary.

But I think it is quite common, normal, human. In all points of live, not just transition. We are after all very clumsily trying to figure out who we are as people. 

Things will be okay I am positive of that. Give yourself time and try to navigate what you want for yourself now.



If you wanna Chat or something, feel free to DM me ☺️
I had the same thing. I felt like being non-binary was bad for a long time so clearly my only option was to transition to female. That didn’t last obviously
ha this happened to me very recently. identified as ftm for about four years, now i'm agender. i'm even happier with my new identity than my old one. stuff changes i guess. hope you find something you're comfortable with soon for your sake
I transitioned from feminine > masculine > androgynous personaly. Was FTM but now I’m definitely non-binary. I was on T but now I consider myself a non-binary lesbian.
Honestly this happened to me the more I learn about gender, and how its a social construct like. I feel like a boy, but not a Man. I dont fit into societies expectations kf a man so im not the same gendee as peopl usually mean when they say man, even if u desire a traditionally male body and like he/him pronouns. Idk if i explained well
even though I'm transfem i feel this a lot. I never started medically transitioning because i live in an eastern european hellhole but when after suppressing myself for 4 years i managed to accept I'm trans. And i concluded that I must be mtf and all this enby stuff was just a coping mechanism (spoiler it wasn't) but the idea of being a woman also caused me dysphoria as much as being a man. I later accepted that I'm non binary and it was that simple all along. This is just my personal experience though. and as someone else said in the comments, men can be feminine too if they want to be, what's important is to feel comfortable in your skin and clothes. you can present however you want and it will never invalidate your identity <3 I wish you luck on your journey of self discovery.
for me it was just that i didn’t like being labeled as a gender because neither for me well enough. i transitioned from cis male to genderfluid to non binary.
I think our idea of gender is always changing and what we’re comfy with is always adapting. Give yourself some grace and love as you go through this journey
You aren’t alone! So thankful for transition and I identify as non-binary trans masc but I feel you! I want to express my non-binary-ness more and not present as a cis-guy (heaven forbid Lolol!)
This is totally normal! I honestly think about this all the time as someone who's been out as a trans man for over a year now. Gender is such a strange thing and I genuinely think it can be helpful to just say fuck all labels for a while and do whatever you want. My biggest fear regarding changing my label is that people will stop referring to me using male language - ae man, guy, boyfriend, etc. But at the end of the day it really only matters what the people you love refer to you as :)
You're not alone, friend.  


I did my best impression of the binary trans girl thing for my first five or so years of transition, but in hindsight, I feel like I was afraid of being seen as too queer. Transitioning at all was a step in the right direction, but I'm more comfortable focusing on what I need to do to alleviate dysphoria rather than picking a box or side to fit into.  


Change can be scary, but I'm proud of you for talking about these feelings and hope you're able to move towards greater comfort.
I flip flopped between trans woman, and cis man for years before transitioning, and realizing I am non-binary. Still not 100% sure on my gender. Try not to stress about fitting into some mold, and do what makes you feel best. I felt like I needed to change my name, and ditch he/him pronouns at the start but realized I didn’t have to just to be trans enough.
I was in a similar boat, thought I was a trans man but trying to be masculine felt just as forced as living as a girl. There’s no need to feel guilty about it, you just needed to explore your identity a little bit more.
For sure this is a thing. I can't say I got dysphoria from transitioning to binary female, but I've gotten a lot of euphoria from going back towards appearing more androgynous.

I think a lot it is that when I first started transitioning like 12 years ago, being nonbinary wasn't well known or understood. I didn't have the language to know and express that I'm nonbinary. I have that language now though, and I've adjusted my presentation to meet those needs.
Check out r/ftmfemininity they're a great sub for trans guys to accept themselves still liking some feminine aspects of their identity.
I’m a non-binary person who is on T and had top surgery, if those things make you happy then you don’t have to stop/revert because you no longer ID as a man. If T doesn’t make you happy anymore then feel free to go off it. There is no one way to be trans and non-binary, so whatever makes you happy and comfortable in your body is the right thing ❤️
Identity is a complex thing that can change. Maybe yours has changed. There's nothing wrong with that.
Do trans guys have to be cis or binary in nature? That seems a bit disingenuous to me. Someone aptly put it in an NB/TransMasc interview I watched, if we are to support cis AMAB males’ rights to use makeup or to wear pink, then we ought not judge trans under such harsh and militant terms as a means of proving their validity as males. 

I cannot speak for you and I am sure that your experiences and feelings are not inherently based on superficial factors like those used in the example above. Those were on the point of making it clear that you dont have to be what is considered masculine (gender expression) in order to be trans (gender identity), so as to debunk any of those common “toxic masculinity” footholes anyone is capable of falling into.

My ID is NB/TransMasc so, if you would like to talk on those points then feel free to DM me. Gender isnt always so straightforward, same as sexuality, and I dont feel anyone should have to be sworn in for life just because they have discovered a true part of themselves in one, and then later on discover another truth of themselves elsewhere. Easier said than done but it is all a part of the journey of self-acceptance.
I think k a lot of people who aren't cis experience this pendulum swing, where in the beginning it's kind of thrilling to see yourself successfully pull off a feminine/masculine/androgynous etc presentation, but as time goes on that can start to feel like another performance. As you become more comfortable with who you are, there's less pressure to prove to others (or yourself) you're that. You get to just be.
It's more common than you think. Me and my boyfriend when from trans girls to he/theys over quarantine
yep!! i used to identify as a binary trans man, but now i’m identifying as a genderqueer transmasc :)
i know a bunch of trans masc people who feel like you, OP! i can relate as well (altho i’ve never passed as a dude).
Masculinity is as much a spectrum as any gender. David Bowie, Prince, Boy George...to name a few men who blur(ed) the line.


Either way, being nonbinary doesn't undo the progress you've made.
Hi I’m non-binary but usually ftm groups feel more my vibe. It’s hard trying to navigate a very binary mainstream and finding oneself, and it’s valid for us to feel different ways at different points in our lives. 💓 I’ve just (3 months ago) got top surgery! And am on low dose T.
gender is fluid! have you thought of trying he/they?
I think I can relate, OP. I’m two years on T Identifying as a trans guy using he pronouns and I’ve been experiencing an increasing amount of anxiety trying to make it all fit but it feels complicated. I started out using he/they but they made me feel dysphoric like I wasn’t being taken ‘seriously’ as on the guy side of things and I really wanted to feel that male homosociality so I just started using he/him only. I love everything T has done for me but I still get my period and it’s been making for some major mood swings/dysphoria/insecurity in a weird way I wonder if it’s affecting my mental health…I have a big anxiety that somehow T is wrong for me even tho I love it’s effects and that’s why I’ve been so anxious and depressed…what I really feel is fragmented: like transitioning has made me push the more female or feminine parts of me inside and then they come bubbling up when I’m alone sometimes and I’ll suddenly feel SO female it freaks me out…then on good days or out among people I just feel like my guy-ish self again…which has never been a strong identity for me, more of a desire to occupy that gendered place. so the compartmentalization freaks me out, and makes me wonder if I’m confused or repressed or just didn’t integrate my past identity right and it’s coming back to bite me. When others talk about how easy and happy and confident they feel since transitioning I doubt myself. I love my name and masculine presentation but I still feel like I’m faking some days, tho the idea of going back to female or feminine makes me sick and panicky, it’s not what I want in any form. I just want to understand these parts of myself I understand as non-male, and integrate them in a way that lets me feel confident dating queer men as a man-ish person. As it is I’m so terrified of feeling like I’m ‘faking’ a male identity around gay men it won’t let me go out and date any of them and it’s been a huge problem as I’m really lonely and feel undateable. I feel like I should be dating like, bi-curious straight men in this weird way so I can be my full self. Most of this is in my head I think and if I could just meet some guys who I felt could see my sort of ambigenderedness and be attracted to it I’d feel a lot better and not worry if I’m making a mistake.
Thank you I needed to read that
This answer though 🥰🥰🥰🥰 yasssss ❤❤❤

Thank you so much OP for sharing 🖤
This, I've changed in the same way
I know it’s such a struggle, I try and do one thing and the next day I don’t like it lmaoo
It's affirming to read someone's experience is similar to my own
Dude you don’t even understand how much this reply means to me. You’ve given me a lot to think about and I’m feeling a bit less like a total weirdo, especially because I was looking for prosthetic breasts as well but I was so worried no one who ever would get top surgery would ever look for that and I thought I was A total freak for it, so thank you so much just for responding here. I really really appreciate this and I’ve got a lot to contemplate and I’m feeling a lot more comfortable now
Thank you, that means a lot. I really need to work to achieving that mindset. Seriously, thanks <3
Yes that’s really how I’m feeling, I hate all the gender expectations I want to get away from them
Thank you. I’ll check out that sub, I appreciate your reply
happy cake day
You are already whole, my friend 🖤
[deleted]
We’re thousands feeling the same and not being very talkative about it, phobia is a thing even in the trans community
Transmasc nonbinary here, on T, looking for top. Honestly that's my ideal chest situation, having the option for boob or no boob. Top surgery takes the limiter off of your chest customization options imo.
It's a long process! I'm so glad the comment helped.

I started openly identifying as nonbinary and seeking physical changes at 35, and before that I spent like a solid 5 years researching and considering first. Honestly, I wish I'd moved faster and risked more ""mistakes"". But I can't change the past so I'm making the best of now. I'm enjoying my girly librarian hair buns with my new facial hair, and my flowy poofy skirts with man-hair legs. It might take me the rest of my life to truly become myself but as long as I'm working towards it, I'm OK with that.
💚
Thanks!
I haven’t but I’m definitely going to check that out now, and that sucks there isn’t one for transfems, someone should make that, thank you for showing me this
I've started to move more towards trans spaces where there is no rigid division between trans and nonbinary identities and where it's absolutely accepted that you can move from a more binary way of transitioning to a more nonbinary one and vice versa. I might have been too long in this bubble cause to me, this would be absolutely no big deal if someone who identified as binary trans previously came out as nonbinary. The same amount of respect and love. 

It saddens me deeply that there are still parts of the queer community where this is not accepted. But you are right, we are thousands and taking time to find your gender identity or long term transition goals is not a flaw at all.

This would make sense if IDs said gender, but it says ‘sex.’ 🤷🏼‍♂️ your gender is whatever, but unless you have a chromosomal abnormality then your sex is set right?
it’s one of my favorites 🥺🥰
+ to this!!
i was about to say otgw based
lmao i guess I’m less of a rebel now 🤣
the most important meal of the day
if we do I promise we won’t be lighting any hillsides on fire 😂

i fully support being illegally non-binary (I was for 29 years)
why are you commenting this? 

you could either be supportive or say nothing 💜
Good on you for leaving behind your criminal past mate. 

Now, excuse me, Ive got crimes of my own to commit, farewell
Idk, you have a really nice hand tattoo though. Also, I think your clothing style is super tasteful but also really nice and pretty. The floral themes overall are nice!
thank you! ☺️"	xqtik3	NonBinary	686	1.0	2022-09-29 00:43:25
Went to a pumpkin farm and my friends took some candid shots of me. It felt really supportive of them 😊		"do you know where you got your jacket? it looks so cool! also are the rainbow pyramid and the other things patches or came with the jacket? you look stunning btw!! 💕

Very cool fashion sense!
Absolutely choice fashion, you look fantastic

Thanks!! I got the jacket and most of the patches off of amazon, including the pyramid. The jacket is a slim fit men’s jean jacket- the tag doesn’t say what brand. You can’t see my fav patch here, but it says “don’t mistake kindness for weakness”
Thank you!

Aw thanks! 😊
Thank you!!!

Came out to my parents tonight. Mom is supportive, but a little confused about pronouns		"The little sheep are adorable! Go mom!
my nana (mom’s mom) has started referring to me as “you all” and “everyone” 

i’ve never corrected her, i think it’s adorable and i’m lowkey waiting for the day when she calls me her “grandchildren”
My mom did the same thing when I came out to her and used ""they"" in place of ""you"".
This is so fucking cute I can’t 😭❤️ Wish my mom would react this way
I just love how she ends the messege with 'mom'
Holy wholesome batman
your mom seems so sweet.. the ""proud of them"" made me laugh a little. happy for you op!!
Lol this is so cute tho
this is wonderful and your mom is adorable!
oh my god WHO’S CUTTING ONIONS

Yeah, that’s her little thing she does: “Love ewe.” Although today she put both the ram and ewe to celebrate.
Everytime my mom texts me, she sends ""😘🚜🌶️""
I don't know why she does that but I know that it means ""I love you"" :)
this is the cutest thing
Aww that is pretty adorable. I haven't told my grandma yet, I might have another post to make soon lol
That's adorable, I think I'd imagine her speaking to me as a temporal collection of trillions of cells, neat.
Lol glad she was supportive too
I’m so thankful that my parents have always been super supportive of me. Sorry to hear about your mom, you can share some of the love from my mom though ❤️
Thank you! She’s pretty awesome 😊

Hi I’m a parent whose daughter has come to me and said she is thinking about being addressed as they/them.	I love my child no matter what because that’s what being parent means. Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means. I want to be supportive but I’m quite confused. My mother likes to tell me that I’m letting her be exposed and interact too much with social media thus making her confused since she is already young… and trying to figure out her identity. Then I have this other family member telling me if she truly knew God she wouldn’t have this emptiness inside her and feel like this. I just want my daughter to be happy. I need positive opinions and good solid information please. I’m getting enough negativity from my family and the worries I have in my own head.	"Allowing your child the space and support to explore who they are is the opposite of confusing and the opposite of emptiness. Studies have shown repeatedly that offering gender-expansive kids the room and support to be themselves drastically improves outcomes across the board. You are 100% on the right track in providing that for your kiddo.

I'll say up front that they/them pronouns are just words. They are part of a wide variety of presentation choices that are available to all people, regardless of their gender identity. Cis folks can use they/them pronouns if that's what they feel comfortable with, or binary trans folks. And non-binary people can use she, or he, or any other pronouns they wish. Pronouns, and other forms of expression, are open to everyone. They're choices you make, something you *do.*

A gender identity, in contrast, is an internal experience, something you *are*, regardless of whether or how you choose to express that. I'm non-binary because that's how I feel inside, not because of how I choose to dress or which pronouns I use. My experience of gender is what it is, it's not a choice I make, and it is what is is regardless of how I choose to express it.

So, why do some people feel more comfortable using they/them pronouns? Often it's because they/them is disconnected from a specific gender role stereotype. Sometimes that can just be a fun form of self expression. Other times, it can be an outward reflection of an internal experience of gender that doesn't align solely and completely with either of Western society's gender boxes. We can't see into your kid's soul, so we can't say which is the case in this specific instance. And your kid may not know yet either, and that's okay.

They are likely to get some pushback from folks claiming that they/them is plural only and it's wrong to use them for a single individual. That's actually not true though, for several reasons. Grammar rules for things like whether ""they"" is singular or plural are *descriptive*, meaning they describe how the words are used in common usage. They are not *prescriptive*, meaning they don't define how someone can use a word and if they don't follow the rule then they're ""englishing wrong."" Language is a collaborative experiment in passing information from one person to another, and every individual speaks their own unique dialect of their language. There is no single authority that can declare what is or is not ""proper grammar."" If you're interested in appeals to authority, here are a few that are widely considered the most prominent authorities on how to use English:

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.

Interestingly, these citations show that singular they *predates* singular you.

Does that help a bit?
First piece of advice, **do not let these family members around your child unsupervised if at all**, and if you do allow them around your child, shut down any of that kind of ""you're just confused""/""if you knew god, you wouldn't be this way"" type rhetoric immediately. Don't wait for your kid to do it, don't assume these family members will magically change, make it clear both before and if it comes up that your child is trying to figure out who they are and you are supporting them, that there will not be any bigoted rhetoric tolerated, and lay out clear boundaries with those family members. This, by the way, is coming from someone who came out old enough to handle my family on my own, I wish my mom had been willing to step in for me anyway because the main family member who rejected me is on her side of my family and it stung even knowing it was coming.

Second, try to get used to gender-neutral language, it may take time and that's ok. Your kid might be angry and upset and emotional and might not always be able to communicate in productive ways, that's normal. You didn't mention how old your kid is, I was 15 or 16, and I was scared, angry, and felt very much alone. I felt like no one was willing to work with me, and I lashed out. Now as someone who's turning 24 later this month, I realize I didn't handle it well, I also recognize why I didn't handle it well.

Finally, have conversations about it with your kid when they're ready, make it clear you're willing to talk and to listen when they want to have that conversation. You might be their only ally depending on how things go with others, and it's important to be open and honest that you're trying to support them. If you mess up, apologize and correct yourself, don't harp on it or turn it into ""I'm sorry, it's just"" (something my own mom has done a lot, though she's not the worst and is genuinely trying).
Firstly I wanted to say thank you for coming to a non-binary space to ask us how to help with something like this, it’s too easy to find no welcoming spaces that will try to have you smother your child’s individuality.

Try not to let those family members bully your kid or make snide remarks about them. Kids are being far more open these days about identity stuff and that is great you child is asking for a safe space to start figuring themselves out. They are no different today than they were yesterday they just want to see how being addressed differently makes them feel inside. People will give them crap for it and that will be hard, for both of you. It’s incredibly comforting to have a family member willing to support you as you go to bat for yourself even if they can’t go to bat for you. 

The best way to stop being confused is to explore, that’s what your kid wants to do. None of it needs to have anything to do with religion at all, it’s just a kid figuring out an aspect of their personhood.

I like to be called They/Them because being referred to in the feminine makes me feel disingenuous but being referred to in the masculine doesn’t always feel accurate either, we don’t have options that I find adequately describe who I am so They/Them pronouns are the next best thing and it feels better for me because most people find it easier to pick one pronoun and use it for a person forever though I would not mind so much if more people could use a wife variety of pronouns for me. 

Each individual has their own reasons for wanting to use the pronouns of their choice but that is part of mine, when your child is ready they may discuss their reasons with you.

It’s not being “empty inside” it’s an act of self love and respect to be one’s self as fully as possible, being stifled or mocked and shamed into silence is what causes people to become empty inside.

[here’s a good read](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85) to be clear not every one of us has dysphoria I just know this article helped me a lot in figuring myself out.
Nonbinary is different for everyone. Your child might feel they are both masculine and feminine, they might feel they are neither... I would say the best you could do for your child is to *let them show you who they are*. Provide them with the safety and comfort they need to express themselves, make sure you clearly communicate that you are a safe person to talk to about anything. 

No one can tell you who they are better than them! 

If you try your very best and still don't get it: *understand that you don't understand*. But understand that from your child's point of view, they might feel that for the first time, they finally understand themselves. Nobody else needs to understand them for that joy they are experiencing to count, but they will appreciate it so much if you make an effort.
It seems like you're coming from a caring position wanting to do the right thing so please don't take this the wrong way but: Stop calling your child your ""daughter"" and ""she"" unless they have told you they're still okay with it. Respect their pronouns and practise using them no matter when and where you speak about them and whether they're present. This will go a long way even if you don't get it right 100% of the time and even if you make mistakes in other aspects of this.

It is important to remember that you don't have to fully understand it in order to just respect their decision. If they tell you something about their identity, believe them.

That being said: Thank you for trying to learn and do right by your kid!
Your kid is asking you to address them as they/ them.  Respect that
https://youtu.be/fYtKXc2VdDw I recommend watching this video, it’s a series on unpacking / debunking a book written by a reactionary who is transphobic against trans men and non binary people. This will help you sharpen yourself against unsupportive family. The “social media is confusing your child” bit is in the book, & addressed by Cass Eris.

Basically, Cass Eris explains that while some platforms are definitely nefarious (meta) children seeking support online is not a bad thing, because they will need that validation from somewhere.

I’m so glad you chose to come here. Because of media like this book, its totally possible for parents looking for support to end up stumbling down a rabbit hole of transphobia.
Most of the time, people who use they/them pronouns are non-binary, meaning their gender identity isn't strictly male or female. It could be both, neither, or something else entirely. Pronouns aren't the same thing as gender identity, though. The pronouns someone uses are the pronouns that feel the most comfortable for them, mostly because they align with their gender identity, but not always.

That being said, I'm surprised no one here has mentioned the possibility of dysphoria. One reason that it's important to use the correct pronouns is that many trans and non-binary people have a mental health condition called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is when someone experiences distress when either their body or the way they are perceived doesn't match their gender identity. Not all trans and non-binary people have it, but a lot of us do. It's also not a black-and-white thing; people can have dysphoria around some things but not others. Some might only get dysphoria about the name/pronouns used, or only about certain body parts, or some combination. Or they might not experience dysphoria at all.

It's worth it to consider taking your child to see a gender therapist so they can have a safe space to figure things out and receive mental help if they need it.

Given your child's age, it might be helpful to talk to them about if they'd like to use puberty blockers. This isn't the same thing as medically transitioning. It just delays the puberty process so your child would have more time to decide which kind of puberty they'd want to go through. For many trans people, going through the puberty that doesn't match their gender identity can be traumatizing and cause dysphoria due to permanent body changes that aren't gender affirming. Not saying your child is definitely trans or non-binary though. Puberty blockers just help buy extra time so your child can figure out what their identity is and what they want to do. Even if it turns out your child is cisgender, the puberty blockers can be stopped and they'll go through puberty normally without issue.
Hi, I use they/them pronouns and I'm in my thirties. Your child came out to you because they trust you and they want you to see who they are and treat them in ways that feel right for them. Gender variance is a form of creativity and should be celebrated. Being nonbinary or trans is good. 

People use they/them pronouns for lots of reasons. I'm genderqueer and trans, which means I don't see myself or want to be seen as a man or woman, either in the social sense (how people dress or act) or in terms of my body. The trans part for me means that I take hormones which change how I feel and look. Not all trans people take hormones or get surgery.

If you want your child to be happy, use their pronouns and ask them open questions about who they are. You might also ask yourself questions. What do you like about your gender? W

There are some trans people who believe in God, but religion has been used to harm a lot of LGBTQ people. If you are religious, look for LGBTQ accepting religious communities. They do exist.
Hi! First, I just want to thank you for your humility and desire for understanding in doing what's best for your child. It's really nice to hear this, always, because many of us had rough childhoods or bad relationships with our parents. People like yourself make a major difference, and you are important. Please don't listen to any family members or others who are trying to criticize your approach to parenting, or your child's feelings. You're doing the best you can, with your child's best wishes in mind, and that's what counts.

Now, forgive me, but I personally am not very comfortable speaking as an authority on things. I have a thing about not wanting to boss people around, and I'm not sure if I'm a natural teacher. 

At the very basic, though, it sounds like your child is experiencing the feeling of belonging to both genders, male and female. Perhaps they feel they have internal characteristics of both? They might see themselves as both a girl and a boy simultaneously, or somewhere in between. They might see themselves as neither. In my personal experience, as well as that of people I love and trust, all of those criteria could apply to nonbinary folks who use they/them pronouns.

My best advice would be to check out r/askLGBT. It's a really helpful question forum for straight and cisgender people to better understand and support the LGBTQ community, especially people in their families or friend circles. It's populated by a lot of parents and older LGBTQ people who honestly I feel could relate more to you on multiple levels. It's a diverse crowd, too, so you will get a variety of perspectives that will probably make points you had not considered previously. As a nonbinary person myself, I found a lot of useful and helpful information there, as well as just a lot of really kind and intelligent, interesting people.

For what it's worth, I believe that God already supports your child, because if they're a God worth worshipping, they already know you're a good and loving parent. ❤️
I was fairly certain that I wasn't cis at 5 but everytime I tried to talk to my parents about it they told me that I was ""confused, going through a phase, or I'd grow out of it"". I'm 31 now, changed my name, go by they/them pronouns and am looking into surgery.

My mother still thinks I'm confused and will grow out of it
Stop calling them your daughter. You've been getting replies for multiple hours telling you to use gender neutral and you are misgendering your kid in all of your replies. You didn't know when you made the post, you know now. If you want to support non-binary people, including your child, take that advice now. Its really uncomfortable when ""allies"" post here getting so much praise for being supportive while only selectively taking feedback and misgendering the person they talk about. This should be a safe space, so change the language or stop talking here until you can
I use they/them pronouns. For me, a departure of gendered terms makes me feel good. I am afab and don't identify as female nor male, so it make me very uncomfortable to be referred to as she/her or ma'am or miss, etc. When people use gender neutral terms for me, it make me very happy and validates who I am. 

Exposure does not 'confuses' people. It educates. I didn't know what non-binary was most of my life, but I knew I wasn't really okay with being feminine or being female. I just didn't know how to classify myself or express myself until I learned about gender identities and such. Now I'm proud and comfortable with who I am.

Any child has to figure out who they are. Your child is no different. They are just expressing themselves in a way your mom doesn't get because this knowledge most likely wasn't something openly shared when she was a child. That's fine, as long as she doesn't try to suppress who your child wants to be. 

My dad gave me great life advice when I was growing up and it's something I strive to live by: it doesn't matter what you do or who you are, as long as you're happy and not hurting anyone.
You sound absolutely lovely and I want to upvote every comment in this thread. You're already on the right track by proceeding with love, an open mind, and a willingness to learn. 

The only thing I have to add is that gender and sexuality are a spectrum and your child may have many identity shifts in their life. I've identified as bisexual, a lesbian, straight, pan, considered whether or not I'm trans, decided on genderqueer then non-binary when that became a term people used, and now I also identify as asexual but biromantic. 

I'm 38 so even I get confused by all the terms that are available to people these days! When I was your child's age there were like 3. 

The best thing you can do is to listen to them and be a safe space for them to explore and change without pressure or judgement, and to chime in with the others, yes, keep them away from the family members who think of their gender identity as an ""emptiness"". Even though I consider my current gender to be kind of a nothing, what that means to me is that I can be anything. 

Again, you sound great. Good luck!
From my own experience (I was assigned female at birth like your child, and I identify as nonbinary and use they/them pronouns) it isn't a choice. It never was an emptiness that made me feel like I was neither male nor female, it was just how it was.

I hate to break it to you, but those family members are being pretty bigoted and toxic, and those sorts of views/opinions most likely will be damaging for your child. If they're feeling this way about their identity, they need support and they need to be listened to.
Do not let those family members get to you! Don't let them do that shit to your child if they're going to be queerphobic like this!
It's not a choice, first off. And second, for why, because they're nonbinary.
Well i use they/them because i felt sad being thought of as a girl. Being a girl just wasnt me. I still am the same person and so is your child. Im not a girl but im not a boy either. I simply like to exist outside of the expectations of gender.
I would say what others have said, talk with them about it, research it, try to use gender neutral terms, and be patient. It can be difficult (I still misgender myself sometimes because I’m so used to my old pronouns lol) but it’ll get easier over time. 

As far as the whole “if you truly knew God” conversation, I like to remind people that God is referred to in both masculine and feminine roles in scripture, usually being referred to as a mother and a father. To constrict God to the binary of gender to me seems rather insulting and limits God/puts God in a box. I’ve come to terms that God loves me for me and I’m made to be exactly who I am. 

Hope that helps and thanks for being honest about your questions and concerns. You sound like a good mom

Listen. Your relatives pushing religion into the situation need to get a hobby. I was raised x-tian and always, ALWAYS, felt like I was different. It took me til I was in my mid 30's to figure out why because of the conservative xtianity of my very sheltering parents. I was suicidal during most of that time. The pain of knowing you are different without having the means to express that difference or worse, being denied your identity, is not something I'd wish on anyone. 

Let me tell you how I've explained it to people:

You know how you KNOW your gender? You know beyond the shadow of a doubt that how you think of your Self and your biologic sex line up in the way society tells you they should. This is just intrinsic and it's a part of you like breathing. It's the same thing. Your child knows that they are not exactly what society says they should be according to their assigned sex. They know this with every fiber of their being. It's natural and intrinsic and it's a part of them.

It also might change, and it might not. Gender really is a spectrum and even the girliest of girls has a masc day or two, and the manliest of men has a femme day or two. It's natural.

 I personally did a lot of soul searching before coming out as non-binary. My 13yo has said that he's a boy, a non-binary boy, and non-binary using he/they pronouns just this week at different times. He's discovering who he is and how he wants to present himself to the world and that's okay. It's a part of childhood and growing up.

Like you said, your child is still your child and you love them. I'm glad you're taking the time to try to understand where they are coming from. You might do well to ask them if they want to change their clothes or anything about their personal space/bedroom. Just something to help make them more comfortable in the day to day. As long as you are accepting of them and supportive they can probably take on the world. :)
First off, it sounds like you want the best for your kid, and want to do *your* best for them as well. Kudos on being a good person!

Whatever your kid’s gender identity may actually be, that they’re thinking about pronouns other than the ones they’ve used up until now is a pretty solid sign that they’re probably not cisgender. Of course it doesn’t mean it’s absolutely guaranteed that they are; they could be just trying to work out a bunch of things about themselves, working out what fits. Whatever the result of this process winds up being, let them guide you. Let them know that they can talk to you about this stuff. 

If they’re saying that they’re *thinking* about using they/them pronouns rather than saying they *do* want to use they/them, however confident, decisive and sure of themselves they are usually, could be a sign of their nervousness about being accepted rather than uncertainty about themselves. That’s not a judgement on your parenting style either. Coming out, even to someone you’re sure will be supportive and accepting can be scary, and phrasing it this way could be a way of testing the waters. Talk with them about when to use those pronouns. Do they want you to use those pronouns for them all the time, or just in certain situations amongst certain people. They should be the ones to decide if and when they’re ready to announce to people who they are, and how that happens.

It’s okay if you’re confused or uncertain about some or all of this. I’m reliably told that parents don’t actually know everything there is to know, and are sometimes even surprised by things. ;) Seeking out information is always a good thing. Assuming that it turns out your kid is in fact nonbinary, keep in mind that there is no one way to be nonbinary. The pronouns they’re comfortable with may or may not be they/them, and may or may not include other pronouns as well. They may or may not want to change they’re name, at least partially dependant on how gendered their name already is. They may or may not want to change their presentation: clothing, grooming, etc. whatever decisions they make about these elements of themselves now, may or may not stand the test of time. A good way of showing you’re supportive might be to talk with them about the use of other gendered words in relation to them. If they want to use they/them pronouns, they may want to avoid the use of gendered words like “daughter” in reference to themselves. (They may also be okay with it; see above re my “no one way to be nonbinary” comment.)

The absolute best you can do, is listen to what they say about themselves, support and accept those assertions - especially in the face of family members who aren’t as open-minded - and give them every opportunity you can for them to be comfortable and happy with themselves. Good luck to the both of you, and hopefully you’ll be able to come back to us down the track with some positive follow up!
Growing up as a male, I felt a lot of responsibility to present as male however I never felt comfortable with it and I felt confused and lost while I felt this way, and since changing my pronouns a few years back to they/them the responsibility felt like it was lifted, I much preferred to be referred to as a person than what gender I am because at I just don't feel like I belong to either binary genders. I hope this has helped, if you have any other questions then feel free to dm me if be glad to help :)

That site has some good descriptions. 

In regards to your mom, a lot of people have no qualms saying babies are cishet, but freak out of a teen/preteen isn't. Your mom needs to overcome her own bias. 

The Bible explicitly says to love your neighbor emphatically and multiple times,  people that use religion to denigrate others are ignoring an important aspect of the religion. I agree with the other person about not having your child around that relative. Hateful comments will poison any relationship they would have. 

Exploring identity is something to be encouraged, as critical thinking is quite a valuable skill. It may shift some as she ages, but don't think it necessarily will. 

> Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means.

This is often because there is an incongruence between someone's sense of self and how it is perceived.
First of all, you should ask *them* what it means. We can’t read their mind so we won’t know what gender they specifically are (or even if they’re nonbinary. It’s a fair assumption but I know some binary girls may go by they/them)

If your kid knew God, well that probably wouldn’t change much, seeing as this isn’t some “emptiness” inside them. (Also this rhetoric is disgusting in general. Being devout does not a cure for depression, sadness, or emptiness make and claiming so blames the sufferer for a problem they did not cause. God may help heal but the person does not lose God for lack of devotion. Just an FYI if you are raising your kid religious, I can’t quite tell from this post).

Basically, your kid probably doesn’t think they’re a binary girl. What they are specifically is up to you to ask them. Being a good parent means trying to understand, and you’ve got that down just by asking. Thank you! 

The decision to change pronouns is to align how you are seen with who you are. Often because the pronouns used before are causing pain. But that’s the only choice, to tell people about it. Their being nonbinary/trans is not a choice. 

I recommend checking out PFLAG for more about parenting on this subject. But in general, offer an ear and also do as they asked. You’ve used she/her and “daughter” to talk about them in this post and the comments. Stop the “she,” and ask what terms they like, because daughter is likely not one.

Y’all have added some great resources in the comments!! I also think using their pronouns and trying to be mindful of gendered language, things like calling them your kid instead of your daughter, can go a long way! You’re gonna make mistakes like we all do but try to hold grace for yourself when you do and keep on learning how to do better! This post honestly made my day, thank you for your humility to try to understand, or at least to learn how to be most supportive of your kid. We’re here if you have any more questions along the way!
1.  My family's god/christ-obsessed culture actually caused me to feel empty, flawed, unacceptable, and freakish.  And all this before I even had my own realizations that I was bisexual and non-binary.  I'm born male and have had no surgery or hormone treatment, and the gender roles, stereotypes, and expectations of straight men that they forced onto me when they began to see signs of effeminacy has fucked me up to this day.  I wish I could have come from a science celebrating family that understands that genderqueerness and homosexuality are part of nature.  

2.  Queer people have ALWAYS been here.  They were part of every single human nomadic group existing thousands of years before any Abrahamic death cult or their hateful books.  I knew that I was different when I was a kid.  I knew that I was different still even from other gay and lesbian kids.  I wish I had the language that we do now so that I could have figured myself out in the late 90s.  Social media and the internet are just exposing more of the variety of humans that are out there.  So your family cannot keep people in ignorance
Go along! Don’t let the family members around them without supervision, and do NOT stand by and say nothing if they try to tell your kid “you’re confused”. Respect their pronoun and name preferences, think of it how some people like to be addressed as a nickname and others HATE being called anything besides their full first name, it’s up to them what makes them comfortable, and it’s up to you to help them feel comfortable. Don’t be afraid to have conversations about this stuff, be genuine in wanting to learn when you ask them questions, and take in as much info as you can. 

If you’d like some recommendations for books that would help understand the situation better, feel free to DM! 

This was likely hard for ur kid, and you should be proud of them for being brave and telling you. Be there for them, and be proud of yourself for wanting to learn and help.
I don't know if it helps, but I'm probably older than you are. It took me a long time to understand a lot of things about myself, including that I'm nonbinary. What I can tell you is that my life is not better because I spent so long identifying as a woman. I detested everything about what people say it means to be a woman, and I was really angry and frustrated. Having an angry, stressed, confused kid wasn't fun for my parents, and being that way wasn't fun for me. Your child will undoubted appreciate your support while figuring things out. Pushing God or taking away social media won't solve the problem, but it will probably push your child away.
Those who posted before me have said a lot of great things and I hope I won't repeat too much. I'm 47 and didn't figure out I was nonbinary until I was around 30. My life would have been SO much richer if I had the understanding of myself and the world that your kid is demonstrating! As to what leads people to request different pronouns, there isn't a universal answer. For many of us, it's that the binary options (he/him and she/her) don't match who we are. For me, it's just how I am on a fundamental level. It doesn't come from an 'emptiness' inside or other lack. If anything, it comes from truly understanding that I don't follow the default. Someone in my support group pointed out that the work that gender diverse people do to learn who we are is an invaluable strength!

One thing I don't think I've seen in the other replies is a way to handle the argument that your kid is too young to know that this change is right. It may be that your child will evolve in terms of their understanding of their gender, and that's 100% fine! I don't know anyone who had their whole identity as a person figured out at 12 other than those who never matured past that point. 

Trusting and respecting your kid enough to use their requested language does no harm to anyone who matters and will build am even stronger relationship with your child. If they eventually decide that another set of pronouns works better or that some another form of expression will make them happy, then great! This is a journey for all of us. If you look around this sub, you'll find some older enbys out there living their best lives, and some didn't find their place until later in life.

Just like any other aspect of learning who they are, supporting your kid around their gender will pay off in the long run. I hope you can take the responses you've seen here as support in standing up to those family members who don't/won't understand. Hopefully, they'll come around, but that's not your responsibility. They're grown, so it's on them to decide if they actually care for the kid you have or if they only care about who they expected this young person to be.

You got this! Good luck!
Thank you for supporting your kid in this way, my own parents cut off contact after I told them the same thing.  They sound like a really smart kid and I'm sure they appreciate your support and validation immensely! Just practice pronouns and maybe get them a nonbinary flag as a gift!
Try having someone misgender you, and it just feels wrong. That's how we feel when we hear the wrong pronouns. Speaking from a 32y trans NB, I wish I would have been able to go deeper into those feelings when I was younger
I came out as bi at 17 to my mom. She told me I was confused. She told me I didn't know what I was talking about. It broke me. I don't think I was ever the same after that. I spent a couple of decades in deep, deep shame and am only now digging myself out. 

Take the advice here. Do the opposite of what she did. I believe in you, from one parent to another. Give your child the gift of believing them. <3 I believe in you.
You’ve gotten so many great responses so I just wanted to touch on one thing that I wish my mom was better about. She still struggles a lot with my name and pronouns and I know exactly why. It’s because, despite a lot of soul-searching and attempting to let go on her part, she still sees me as a girl.

I know this is a hard thing to change in your brain when you’ve known someone their whole life, and especially when the idea of being non-binary is something really new. But I think being conscious of it is the best first step. It’s something I had to figure out when I first had a friend come out as trans. I managed not to mess up his pronouns out loud, but in my head, I still slipped up. But then I realized it was because I didn’t see him as a guy yet. As soon as I realized that, I thought, “that’s dumb, he is a guy” and that was that. It seems really obvious, but just consciously reminding your brain “hey! They’re non-binary, not a [insert agab here]!” is, in my opinion, the best way to get better about names, pronouns, and gendered language in general.

I hope this is helpful! And thank you for being an awesome parent and reaching out to your kid’s community for help. You’re doing an amazing job already and your kid is lucky to have you as their parent!✌🏻
70's liberated heterosexuals from the expectation of raising a family
Lockdown gave individuals the privacy, and time to collectively share another revolution, that liberates all from performing one of two genders
It was a matter of time, what an unnecessary burden, to be told you are not woman enough, not man enough; what an obvious solution, hidden behind taboo, that we should represent ourselves exactly how we feel on the inside, and support others, so that we may all be supported
Why are you still interacting with these toxic family members is the question... I would ask your child what using they/them pronouns means to them. Are they trans/non-binary? Just gender non-conforming? Do they need help accessing things like a binder or other things to express their gender? Would counseling be helpful, are they interested in physically transitioning?
First of all, it’s not a choice. Our gender and sexuality is how we feel as a person, and we can’t choice who we like or how we feel from the inside.

Also, social media doesn’t impact how we feel as a person. It’s how we act and how we feel, just like I said.

And we can’t stop feeling this. It’s who we are as a person, and it’s not some excuse to feel happy or something. It can make us feel happy, but it’s not by choice.

I’m non-binary, but I don’t choose to feel neutral. It’s how I act and feel as a person.
Absolutely!!
So my mom still doesn’t understand me and my gender, I’ve actually never told her I’m non-binary, and I’m 28. So first off congrats on being there for your child. Try your best to be open and free from judgment.

Some things my mom did that were not positive while growing up were not letting me dress how I wanted, because she was so worried about what people would think of her. Make sure you’re encouraging your child to be authentic and true to whatever they are feeling. They can always tell when you’re worried about what grandma will think, or if you’re asking them to change how they dress because gramma or aunty is coming over to visit. 

I obviously don’t know if your child feels the same way, but when my mom would want family photos and she would buy me dresses, I was always so uncomfortable. I never enjoyed being dressed as a girl, even as an adult I have weeks or months where I cannot wear dresses. Let you child explore, try not to put up boundaries, in the end gender roles are social constructs and they change when people stop following them. 

This is not a disease, your child is not empty, they are simply exploring a part of themselves that most adults don’t even tap into. I wish you both the best!
As a non-binary person whose parents struggled with this exact thing, I’d suggest reading up on gender and the trans experience- I’ll link a really good webpage with lots of different resources here: https://www.lgbtmap.org/policy-and-issue-analysis/advancing-acceptance-for-parents 
Thank you for being a parent who wants to support your child 🖤
It isn’t a choice. They chose to confide in you. My best advice is to listen to your child. Their are a lot of good resources and videos of non binary people talking about their experience with gender. Non binary people have existed before social media. It’s just that this is a new term. A large amount of civilizations had more than two gender classification. Ancient Egypt had three iirc. Gender is social performance if you think about it. Even being a cis man or cos woman, everyone is following societal rules of the game. That’s why the standard for beauty and attractiveness chance throughout history. It’s all made up as we go. All of it. Some people don’t fit in the narrow binary idea of gender. Your child  is one of those people. Give them time to get to know themselves and just be there for them.  It’s not a race for either of you.
&#x200B;

You're amazing for wanting to support your kid. And your kid is amazing for having the courage to speak out for their truth.

This is a journey...for you both.

Coming out is just one step, you'll take a lot more together and it'll be probably the most rewarding thing you do as a family. Don't be afraid to reach out for support from others. There are many queer friendly therapy groups and therapists now. It's helpful to go, even just to develop a comfortableness around discussing the topic, your emotions, and the external judgments that will come your way.

I'd say the best thing for a parent is to be vocal about how much you love your kid, and create boundaries around supporting them so others cannot cause damage. There will be some struggle, life is an ongoing struggle for many things, but what makes a family is your ability to  love and listen in the face of confusion. Like I said, this is a journey and nothing is written in stone. A non-binary person may fluctuate in the way they act or dress or express their gender. We just need space and time to explore what that means to us.

You mentioned in some comments you struggle with self-esteem. I did too. Speaking your mind and standing up for something/someone you believe in is one way to develop that. When the voices of others nag at you in the back of your mind, tell those thoughts to fuck right hell off because your kid is amazing and beautiful.

Then go out and do stuff together. Have fun. Live you lives to the fullest. You're both worth it.

As a lot of other comments have mentioned, being non-binary is different for everyone. Here's *my* reasoning for being non-binary just to give another perspective:

1. The words ""man"" and ""male"" have a lot of weight and meaning to them in our society
2. Many of those meanings don't align with how I live my life and see myself
3. The words ""woman"" and ""female"" have a lot of weight and meaning to them in our society
4. Many of those meanings don't align with how I live my life and see myself

When you put all that together, non-binary is a great fit. It allows me to be *me* without having to worry about not being ""right"" by some rules that society gave about what was ""manly"" or ""feminine"".

Personally, I also think those four points are a good starting point for understanding the idea of non-binary more objectively. Just about everyone has *some* trait about themselves that doesn't match cleanly with their gender identity. I know men that do most of the cooking and cleaning in the house, and I know women that can fix cars better than my own father. Just because those traits are traditionally not related to their given gender doesn't make that gender less right for *them*.

Another thing to keep in mind that this isn't a ""new thing"". People have existed who would have been better described by non-cis gender identities forever, we're just putting new words to it. Taking the emotions out of it and remembering that these are just more specific words people use to describe and express themselves can help with understanding better sometimes.

From the sounds of it, be prepared to enforce boundaries with other family members. Even if you don't fully understand what your child is going through at the moment, they need to know you'll be there for them. I'd suggest talking with your child about what boundaries they'd like to set so you're prepared to enforce them and don't have to worry about family members crossing a line that they can't *un*cross.

All in all, I think you should focus on the fact that your child felt comfortable coming to you with this. It means they trust you, and that is a *wonderful* place to start from.
There are many great comments but I would like to put in my input as a teenager who does not have the support of their mother. 

(At the bottom I will have a simple guide to “transness”)

First of all, coming directly to this community for support and questions was the best thing you can do. Do not listen to anybody that is not trans or doesn’t regularly work with trans people. You wouldn’t go to a dermatologist if you had a kidney problem. All those comments you mention (and ones you’ll get in the future) come from ignorance and lack of education regarding the trans community. Most things people hear about the trans community is propaganda to incite fear (ex. trans people are predators and pedophiles). 

First and foremost, the biggest way to support your child is to be educated, listen to their needs, and be supportive. One of the biggest ways you can do that is using their preferred pronouns (and preferred name if they decide to change it). It feels awful to be misgendered intentionally. And know now you will mess up. You will accidentally call them the wrong thing. You will not be perfect immediately, and that is absolutely okay. It takes a minute to retrain yourself to use different pronouns. Even as a trans person myself I mess up with peoples pronouns as they are coming out. All you do is correct yourself and move on. Don’t stop what you’re saying, don’t make a big deal out of it. Just switch the pronoun and keep going. I’ll give an example of what to do and what not to do. Using myself as the example.

Ex: “Leo said she- he wants to get food.” (Correct way) You may want to apologize but don’t do it in the middle of conversation, it draws attention to it, and nobody wants that. If you really want to apologize just pull the person the side later and acknowledge that you slipped up but you promise that you’re trying.

Ex: “Leo said she- oh my god I’m so sorry, idk why I did that. I feel so bad oh my god I didn’t mean it.” (Wrong way) do not ever do this. One, you’re drawing attention to the slip up and making it awkward for everyone. Two, you reinforce in your brain that this is bad. And you’ll psych yourself out of learning to use these pronouns. People do this to me all the time and it’s very frustrating. A lot of people just use my name instead of using my pronouns because it is “too hard”. It is never too hard to have basic decency to someone. 

(One easy way to get used to using pronouns is over text. You can easily go back and fix mistakes. Plus you’ll get used to regularly using those pronouns for your child)

Just remember it is not about you. It’s about your child and their happiness. It’s not too hard for you or too much for you. You have the privilege of being a cisgender (someone who identifies as their assigned gender at birth) person. You don’t have to deal with dysphoria, transphobia, violence, and if you’re in the U.S., watching your rights being stripped away from you. It’s not hard for you to switch pronouns. It is hard for your child navigating the world as a trans person. 

As for your child being “too young” to know, just ignore that. Even if they are just questioning, why make them miserable for the time being? So many people are worried about hrt (hormone replacement therapy) or gender affirming surgery. But depending on your child’s level of dysphoria (and the laws regarding trans people where you live) it may not be necessary. And there are many steps to take before you can even access that type of care. And there are steps to take before you even consider that. First, if they are comfortable with it, assess your child’s level of dysphoria. For context dysphoria is like a feeling of unease or wrongness because your body doesn’t match your gender identity. It can be a very weak feeling. My weak dysphoria would be “oh this shirt makes me look feminine so I won’t wear it”. Medium “I’m anxious about going out because I’m afraid I’ll be misgendered”. High “My body is wrong and I want to hurt myself”. If your child has no dysphoria that’s wonderful continue their social transition of using different pronouns and/or name. If they have mild dysphoria try using different clothing, makeup, new hair, etc. to make them feel more comfortable. You could possibly try binding, but it can be very unsafe and damaging if not done properly. If your child considers doing that then please properly research good binders. Wear it correctly and don’t wear it longer than needed. Some people bind for days and days, sometimes weeks, and that point is when something like top surgery is needed. You shouldn’t physically hurt yourself to feel better mentally. I’m aware that treatment is a luxury a lot of people don’t have, but that is never an excuse to harm yourself. So if your child ever binds please monitor them. If your child’s dysphoria is so high that they desperately need hrt or surgery find them a trans friendly therapist. Someone who knows what they are doing, and you can work out together how to proceed from there. Honestly I’d suggest getting a therapist regardless of who you are, but that’s a luxury that some people don’t have. 

Anyway to wrap this portion up. You did a great job by reaching out to this community and admitting that you’re worried and don’t know how to handle this. A lot of people have too much pride to do that and end up hurting their child. The best way to handle this is to listen to your child. They know what’s best for them. If they want extreme things, like maybe bottom surgery, that’s when you as a parent step in. (I would not suggest bottom surgery to a minor who is possibly still going through puberty. If that is ever an issue things like packers or stps are an option). Communicate fully with your child. You’ve got this.

Also, please ask us for anything you need. I’m always willing to help and I’m sure many other people here are too.
Hi OP. I'm a transitioning nonbinary adult who does a lot of volunteer work with trans and gender creative youth as well as their parents. If you would like to DM me with any questions you have, I can also see if I know of any resources in your area. Local support groups exist and are fantastic places to start. You will feel a million times better meeting other parents with kids like yours (and they will make some friends too!)

You've gotten some great advice in this thread already but again if you want to talk about anything in private please feel free to DM me. This stuff is my lifes work so to speak and I am an open book for questions <3
I would recommend looking up a group for parents of LGBTQ+ children. It’s important to learn the statistics, language and culture in order to make your child feel free to be themselves

Edit: thank you for wanting to learn and grow and understand
I really found this zine so helpful and comforting as I was coming out to MYSELF as nonbinary, but it’s actually written for caring parents and family such as yourself! https://www.craftordiy.art/nonbinaryzine

Your kid sounds like a great kid, and you and your husband sound like great parents that your kid feels comfortable to come to both of you about these things! Some people “know” they are trans/nonbinary/queer in some way from when they’re little, some discover it later, some people change throughout their lives. That’s true since before social media, and regardless of religious affiliation.

The best way to help your child be happy: listen to them, and support them in the ways they ask, or in some cases “wonder about” if they are too afraid to be firm (something I do too, as an adult!) 

And consider… even if this is a “phase” (which gets a bad rap, but we ALL have different phases in our lives!) what’s the worst that could come of using they/them for your kid, getting comfortable with gender neutral language, and standing up for your kid if anyone has a problem? Your kid will know you have their back and take them seriously, and that’s not too bad, is it? :)
Take a deep breath, and remind yourself you're doing a good job at parenting. I know all this information can be very overwhelming and you're worried about making a mistake, but the fact that your child feels comfortable at all to share this part of themself with you, means they feel safe enough to do so. That's something which, sadly, is in very short supply for many queer kids. So you already have put the right foot forward before even starting this journey with your child. 

Being non-binary can be extremely confusing for someone who's never experienced their gender feeling ""wrong."" Heck, it's still confusing even for people who are non-binary! It's completely okay of you don't really understand everything right now. Loving and respecting your child, while being open and listening to them, is the most important thing.

As a way to explain it though, this is a very simple metaphor I've used to talk about my experience: 

>I was given size 6 shoes to wear. They never fit right. I tried and tried to walk around wearing them, but they always hurt my feet. Yet every shoe store I went to only had size 6 or size 10. Everybody else I knew could fit into those sizes. Some were even given the wrong size, like me, but switched to other and then they were finally comfortable in their shoes. Not me though. I tried the size 6's and the size 10's; they either were too tight or slipped right off. I struggled for years walking in the wrong shoes. Until finally, one day, I found a different shoe store. And for the very first time, I got a pair of shoes that fit me perfectly. It turns out I was a size 8 all along. 

>I know I am non-binary in the very same way I know when the wrong shoes do not fit me.

And I did know. Many trans folks (non-binary falls under the transgender umbrella) have these feelings for years before they find the language to express their identity. I remember being in kindergarten and a) having crushes on girls and b) not wanting to be a girl myself. 

But it wasn't until being in my 20's that I understood what non-binary genders were. Learning about non-binary folks made a lightswitch flip in my brain. I can't forget the day it happened. I was watching a youtube video of non-binary people talking about their gender (cause I wanted to be supportive to my queer friends) and I had to pause like two minutes in and just sit back going ""oh fuck, that's me."" Like a revelation. Suddenly everything in my entire life of feeling like being a girl didn't ""fit"" made sense. Suddenly *I* made sense to me. 

Not to ramble on about my own life story, but I mention this cause it sounds like there's relatives who are saying some very harmful things about your child. There's no such thing as having one's gender (or sexuality) influenced by friends or school or social media or tv or whatever it is that people pick to blame. Yes, I came out as non-binary after watching youtube videos about non-binary folks. This is true. But it didn't *make me* trans. It didn't *influence me* into slapping a ""trendy"" new label on myself. All it did was give me the words to actually talk about who I am. I've always been non-binary. It's certainly not a choice. The only confusion about my gender which I've ever had was always being told I was a girl, despite never feeling like one. I did feel empty then. Only after living as my actual gender for the past few years, have I learned just how deeply unhappy I was before. I *like* me now. I'm not disgusted by my body anymore. The feeling of being ""wrong"" is gone.

This is just my experience, of course. Not everybody is gonna have that ""Ah ha!"" moment and it can take years and years to figure out one's gender identity. Your child may tell you they have different pronouns and such as they keep figuring themself out. That's perfectly normal. And, if that does happen, use the new pronouns and just keep on going forward. No one knows your child better than themself. From how you've talked about them, they seem to be a pretty good advocate for themself too, and it's wonderful that you've raised them with such confidence.

Another important conversation to have is to ask them how *you* can be the best possible advocate for them. Unfortunately, as you've already experienced, people will be queerphobic, intolerant, closed-minded, and otherwise just disrespectful to your child. It is the shitty world we live in. But, they got you! And that's fantastic.

Ask them what boundaries they need. That one God preaching family member of yours should be kept away from your child entirely. I don't know the situation with your mother, however, don't let her talk to your kid without you there. A young queer person being told they're faking it and just confused is very damaging to their sense of self and their own agency as a person

Ask them if there's others who make them uncomfortable. Family members might not say things to you directly, but they'll say things to you child. Ask them about school. The students and the teachers. School can either be sometimes pretty supportive or absolute hell. Probably more toward the forner, hopefully, since you said they have queer friends. Do they need accommodations at school? Bathrooms are a whole issue, plus if there's anything gender segregated, like uniforms. Changing name, pronouns, the whole shebang will be something you have to make happen for them. And ask them about being in public in general. If someone misgenders them, do they want you to step in and correct it every time? With friends and family, definitely, but strangers? Your impulse might be to of course fix that for them (and that's a good impulse!), but they might also simply not want to deal with it. Sometimes it's easier to hide than risk a potentially hateful reaction. 

Something that my wife and have is a code word for when we need to the other person to step in, or get out of a situation. Obviously, it's a bit different for a parent and child, though having a word your kid can say whenever something's happening which is making them feel uncomfortable (without needing to go into a whole explanation) could be really beneficial. Things like dysphoria and experiencing queerphobia can be very hard to talk about, even to ourselves. Much less while they're still in the stressful situation. 

Ah, sorry this got so long. Again, no rush. You'll get there, and you're doing great already. Coming to talk to non-binary folks in the first place is just, like, wow. 

It's obvious you respect your kid and are focused on what's best for them. From me, a non-binary person who had to go no contact with my mother years ago, thank you for supporting your child. You have no idea how much it means to a kid for their parent to accept who they are is real. I hope for the absolute best for you and your kiddo. Best of luck to you both! 💜
Okay, so you mentioned in comments they're 12 and I wanted to offer a few suggestions 

#1 - realize they're young! It's possible as they explore their identity they'll end up with different pronouns later, possibly going back to she/her, maybe he/him, possibly adding or taking away some along the way. It's a journey of exploration and finding themselves and this could take time. Other people are sure of it right away, regardless, don't let others tell them it was ""just a phase"" - their a kid, phases are how they find what sticks. It's completely normal to go through phases and I think it's important to recognize that. But recognize it by treating it like it's not a phase, not by brushing it aside. (I also don't think it's a phase, to clarify, but I also don't want to suggest it's not also a journey of growth exploring gender) ""Getting confused"" while exploring identity is sort of a red flag phase, if you're exploring your identity, you're likely to get confused. But the only way to know if  things are going to work is to try them.

#2 ask them if there's any other changes they'd like to make. A shortened name? A nickname? Would they like a haircut or anything similar? Are they okay being daughter or would they like to be child? Are they comfortable using gendered restrooms at school or would they like you you reach out to the school?  Different people have different preferences. 

#3 If you can afford it, I'd consider therapy. Not with a therapist to talk them out of their identity, but with one who they can talk too that can help support them in their gender/queer discovery journey. Talk with the therapist first and make it clear you want to support them as much as possible. 

#4 Get yourself a therapist (again, if affordable/feel like it's needed) just to check in and see how you're doing. Transitioning can be hard to wrap your head around, and dealing with unsupportive family/friends can be difficult. If you're not solid on boundary setting, it can help to get some professional support. 

#5 They made the choice because to them its who they are. They're young, but the fact they've trusted you with both their identities at such a young age speaks volumes (good ones)  about you as a parent. They trust you, hold onto that trust and believe them when they tell you who they are. Taking the step to reach out here is also amazing, having to explain your identity to people when you may be still figuring it out can be difficult. So the fact you're doing the research yourself is really good. That being said, I would in the future when asking about stuff (or talking in general about them)  use their pronouns! It's a good way to practice and make sure you're getting them right. It can also help to practice in front of a mirror, saying stuff like:

Mabel is my child, they're on the swim team! I'm really proud of tjem because they got second place in a meet last week. 
John is my child, they do art and they just showed me a really cool painting of theirs. 
Forest is my child, despite being named Forest they're really good at computer science. 

Stuff like that on your own can be helpful in learning and practicing.

#6 Ask them if they're comfortable with you sharing stuff publicly. I know younger friends transitioning who want their parents to document it on social media so they can look back on it. But others would rather avoid mention of it and just treat it as if nothing happened. Again, talk  with them about their preferences for how they want to move through the world. That kinda gets to the point of your original question - what does it mean? Only they know. 

#7 In terms of if you're worried about reactions from people, people are going to be hateful but people are always going to find something to hate. You can be successful and nonbinary. (I have a coworker at a nonprofit who's a department head in the Bible belt but openly uses neo-pronouns!)  You can be married or have kids (if that's your vibe) and be non-binary. Heck, we have non-binary politicians and therapists. (I imagine also lawyers and surgeons I just haven't heard of any) While it can often feel like being trans or nonbinary is a scary existence, it's also a loving one with an amazing community. I'm writing this cuddled up with my girlfriend right now and our cat is knocking over my water bottle. I met all my friends in college through queer affirming groups (including campus ministry!) 

#8 Just in regards to the campus ministry thing, if you are religious, take a critical look at how your religion handles queer people. Are they affirmed? Not just welcomed/accepted, most religions welcome/accept anyone. (At least the ones I've interacted with) But affirming means queer people are allowed to lead, they're allowed to educate, they can hold opinions and those opinions are valued. Those places exist, look for them if they're important to you or your child.


Eta: I have no idea why certain paragraphs are bigger in text size. I'm on mobile
Heya:) I can see that this post is genuone and coming from a good place so I'm really glad that you've been doing that. 
Each non-binary person's experience is very different so although it's good that you're reaching out to other people in the community, the key to understand where your child is coming from is to have a conversation with them about it.
Also, you briefly mentioned a family member bringing in God into the matter and I just wanted to say that there is nothing contradictory about the faith and atypical gender expressions. So if you are a Christian/religious household, please dont feel the need to choose a side. If the crux of God is love then that is all the support should be focused on:))
I wish for the best for your child and hope that everything goes well
non binary people are just people, i can see from every point there, those people are trying to demonize the idea of being non binary but if you really sit and think about it, what is the harm? at the very worst, they could be wrong, but if that's true all you have to do is make sure your clear about loving them no matter how they identify so if one day they decide they were wrong they can feel comfortable telling you, outside of that, there's really no harm in calling them ""they/them"" is there, also i would say, with an extended family like that, they probably need your love and support more than most.
Mom to a nb teenager & a not legally adoptive mom to a genderqueer teen over here. Just wanted to say thank you for not just shutting it down and instead coming to the internet to do some research. I have watched my “adopted” kiddo be told that they don’t know what they want, that my kiddo is just badly influencing them, that it’s not appropriate, it’s “against god”, be told that they are supported but won’t be called by their name or pronouns, limited on what kind of clothing they can buy, how they can cut their hair, etc., and I have watched these actions absolutely crush this beautiful human’s soul. Just… thank you for trying. 
You already have a lot of solid answers here so I’m not going to double up much but I would like to emphasize the advice to be wary of allowing those kinds of family members access to your child. It can be incredibly damaging to hear that kind of stuff from the people who are supposed to love you. My mom and I have had to cut a family member out of our existence because he couldn’t keep his opinions to himself, caused a full blown panic attack for my kid. I legit packed everyone up and left in the middle of a visit multiple states away and my mom ended up moving out, It’s made it harder to see the family we love but, I told my baby I couldn’t control how everyone reacts/supports them, but I could control if it was my family/friends and I’d go scorched earth for them no matter who was the culprit and I got to back those words up a lot sooner than I thought I would lol. 
IDK if it’s already too late, seems like it might be since you’re catching flak from family, but it might be helpful to talk to other people about this and not your family unless your child has expressly okay’d you outing them. We have family members that my child is uncomfortable being out to, and ones they’re okay with and we keep things very separate until they change their mind. At the end of the day this can greatly change the makeup of your kid’s circle and they deserve control over when that happens. 
Lastly, all “my” queer kiddos came out to me around 9-12 years of age. And yeah, maybe it is the internet’s fault, not for *influencing* them, but supplying them with the appropriate vocabulary to better define themselves. I’m thirty something and when I was a kid, the words were gay, bi, or trans, and that was about it, right? But none of those things were exactly… me? Now there is this abundance of people sharing their experiences and understanding and it can make things a lot easier to process on a different timeline than other generations. That’s my take on it anyway.
They are still who they are they are just more. It’s important that they know how much you support them. Keep the other family members away if they’re unable to treat your child with the care and love that they should. 
Like everything, enby is like a spectrum. For me personally I feel like gender norms shouldn’t define me as a person and I go by any pronouns because I just don’t really care that much. For your child it could be completely different as well. 

My best advice to you is to just listen to them and believe them when they say they feel a certain way about their self. 

I hope I didn’t come off prissy or anything, I apologize if I have. 
Have a great weekend!
hi, I'm also a mum of a nb young person. they've chosen they/them pronouns for now, although they are happiest when they're feminine. one of our favourite things was going shopping and allowing them to choose their own clothes/jewellery ect and develop there own style/persona. 

the main thing I've learnt is to follow their lead. also been surprised by who has been supportive and who was dismissive. 

sorry I haven't had a chance to read all the  comments yet (I will as there looks to be some great resources in there)

ps. they're 10m
Since everyone else has the big stuff covered: do little things to celebrate your child's identity. Maybe buy them a pronoun pin or hang a non binary flag in the house. Today at work a kid came running up to me as soon as they were dropped off to show me the necklace their mom got them, which had the non binary colors in beads. Little things like that mean so much because it shows that you don't just accept them, you are proud of them and want to celebrate them.
Hi! First of all, you are already doing a great job, and it's so amazing that you seek out information and help from the community! You are willing to listen and learn, and I can't stress enough how important that is.
I wanna touch on ""they're just confused"" rethoric a little. So, its transphobia, plain and simple. But i think its important to recognize where it's coming from. Many ppl are afraid that kids are pressured into and/or will go through all the trouble of being trans just to recognize it's not for them later, when they think is ""already too late"". But here's the thing. If one's experiences change over time, that does not make them invalid. If you feel anger in one moment, and happiness I the next, that doesn't mean your anger was invalid. If you liked dogs as s child, but then grew up and started liking cats more, that doesn't mean your love for dogs was somehow inadequate. We are all just a bunch of experiences in the specific moment in time. And yes, those experiences can change. But that doesn't mean anyone should regret them. My sister explored her gender for a bit and then came to a conclusion she isn't trans, and there's nothing wrong with that. And I'm pretty sure I'm nonbinary trans, because that's a consistent experience for me throughout the years, and there's nothing wrong with that either. So, yeah. It's just something important for you and your child to recognize, so that those comments won't get under the skin of both of you.
And the one about the God is just bullshit. God didn't helped or thousands of other trans ppl. If I continued to follow religion, I would still hate myself and be miserable. That, ofc, depends on how you view religion, but where I'm from the rules are too rigid to allow me to be myself and be a believer at the same time. On the other hand, there are a lot of trans people who do believe in God, and it's not like they believe in him less than others. Belief doesn't magically make you conform to your assigned gender at birth or make you strsight, that simply doesn't work the way some ppl seem to think it does.

Anyways,  that's all I wanted I say, hopefully that helps you deal with those relatives. You're doing great, I think your child is very lucky to have you!

P.s. if you wanna hear abt my ecoeriences of being nonbinary and/or how I came to this realization, lemme know! I'm just not sure if I should write it due to the abundance of comments x)
""I love my child no matter what because that's what being a parent means.""

""I just want my daughter to be happy.""

Solid parenting right there. 👍  As long as you keep thinking like that, pretty sure your kid will turn out alright.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It reminds me of a newspaper clipping I saw awhile ago. Some parents had taken out a notice in the ""birth"" section in the newspaper, making a correction to their original notice, saying that they didn't have a daughter anymore. Thinking the worst, I read on...

Turns out their daughter had come out as trans to them, and wanted ""he/him"" to be used.

So the parents were writing in, saying the original birth notice was mistaken, and that they now have a son. ❤

It ended with a note to their new son: ""Loving you is the easiest thing in the world. Now tidy your room."" 😋
So I haven’t noticed this said yet: please don’t ever refer to being nonbinary as a choice.

The only choice involved with a person’s sexuality and gender identity is wether they tell you what it is. Its less about harm directly to your child, and more about reinforcing negative thought processes of other people. Thinking people choose their non-cis gender identity leads to the connotation that it is abnormal and divergent from the “regular” genders, and that eventually slides into what conversion therapy people believe.

I highly recommend looking for some historical references of gender throughout history (the book titles escape me right now but they are certainly out there). Non-cis genders have existed as long as humanity has and learning a little about it will also help your child learn of the normality of gender spectrum and be better informed.

Best of luck in the parenting adventure!
You clearly have an amazing relationship with your child if they felt they could come to you with this! I love this so much. I recommend following people online who have non binary children and support them and watch them and practice using their new pronouns when and where you can!
There is no emptiness. It isn't a choice. It has nothing to do with god.  Those 'connections' like comparing an apple to a blackhole, they have nothing in common. Your child is really just showing they are comfortable with you and trying to figure out how to be comfortable with themselves.  When I asked my mom ""how come you accepted me being non-binary so easily."" she said ""Why would I not? That is just another part of who you are and I am not much of a mother if I don't accept my children for being humans themselves.""
Well on the subject of what causes someone to identify as non-binary, it's that we don't feel like, or want to play the part, of either ""traditional"" gender. 

Nature doesn't do things in a binary mode, bimodal sure, but a binary ""either/or"" view of gender is just the categorization that most people layer over the reality of it. (If you're unfamiliar with distribution curves, bimodal distribution is two bell curves stuck together.) So most people don't experience a lot of dissonance living within the traditional binary, that's where the most people are in relation to gender. But those peaks have tails, or areas that are a measure outside what you'd call gender conforming, and that's where non-binary people experience and express gender.

I know very few people come here for statistics presentations, but I hope this gives you a different way to think about things. 

Arguing the extended family into accepting and embracing is going to be quite difficult. This is more of a feelings disagreement than a facts argument. It might be a better tac to find out why they feel like letting kiddo be themselves, or hell just explore, is dangerous? It might come from fear that they'll be treated lesser than a binary gender conforming person, if so you could impress on them that it's even more important that you encourage and support them.
That is very, very helpful advice! Especially from a parent perspective! Thank you for your insight and wisdom. I welcome it with open arms❤️🤗  I wish you luck on your journey in parenthood and healing from your past
I don't have a kid, but I do have a mother and I think I can give some insight and advice. 

First, its not a ""choice"". It's simply who your child is. Not a boy, not a girl, your child. They were born this way and it just took time for them to realize it. I'm 24 and realized when I was 23, your child is ahead of me in that regard. 

Your mother and this other family member are wrong. Your child does not have any ""emptiness"" inside them. In fact, suppressing their identity would cause an emptiness because they wouldn't ever feel like who they really are. 

Finally, begin using the same words I have been this whole time. For example, ""this is my child, they're fantastic and I love them."" They may be fine with being called ""daughter"" but I'd recommend making sure. Using the pronouns they request is SUPER important, don't exclusively use them around your child, use them everywhere and with everyone when referring to your child. My own mother doesn't do this well and it makes me feel unloved. If you truly do love your child, use their pronouns as requested. 

I hope this was helpful.
>Then I have this other family member telling me if she truly knew God she wouldn’t have this emptiness inside her and feel like this.

Start putting up some boundaries between this person and your child - that sentiment will absolutely harm someone who is in the process of exploring their identity and inner self.

I was raised Christian and did everything ""right"" (not claiming perfection) I followed the formula prescribed to me to a T. When I ""fell short"" I ""repented"" and my heart wanted nothing more than to please God and be his kingdom's representative here on earth...

...problem is, I was *repressing* myself the whole time because who I am didn't fit their mold. I was left with terrible anxiety and no self esteem at all (in spite of knowing God and not doubting his love for me).

I only started deconstructing away from the faith a couple years ago and finally felt free enough to be myself as I approach 40yrs. So much of my life wasted, pretending and surviving rather than living and thriving.

.

>Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means.

It's less of 'making a choice' and more of 'realizing that society's assumptions of gender are out of sync with your internal experience' and then owning it and living that truth honestly.

As I previously mentioned, I only **just** started exploring this stuff and living truthfully within the last year and I've never been happier with life and with who I am.

Unfortunately even being almost 40, I'm terrified to bring this up to my parents because I don't trust them to see me. You seem like good people and you're taking the right first steps ✨
Thank you for asking about this. I was afraid to for fear of offending someone. My teen is dating someone who is non binary and they have a ton of friends that identify the same. He tried to explain it but did so poorly. So I lurk and learn. Eventually I threw them a big party and 30-40 kids showed up and it was wonderful. My generation wants to put everything in a labeled box, and I am deconstructing that notion and just accepting what others choose for themselves. Everyone deserves the right to be happy and safe.
Uhh, what makes you want to use the pronouns you prefer? It just feels right, it fits. Your child may be feeling that being a girl isn't the right fit for them. It's important to be supportive of your child right now so they can develop into who they want to be, and not be suppressed by overbearing family members who want to force them into conformity. That just makes everyone involved miserable. By the way, they/them pronouns work for anyone of any gender. When you watch a car run a red light, what do you say about the driver? 'they were probably on their phone' or something like that. It works for everyone regardless of gender. However many people like to use more specific pronouns to reflect their gender identity, such as she/her, fae/faer, he/him, etc. I don't see how using or not using specific ones is any more or less valid, nor do I see how only certain specific ones are valid. That's just rigid traditions refusing to include everyone.

It all depends on how you look at things. If you try to look at this from your child's point of view, it will make sense, they're expressing how they feel inside, and that feeling may not be feeling like a girl, as you may have previously expected of them. Just work with them and make sure you two are able to communicate openly. If you try to impose the judgement of the particular society you grew up in on the situation, where there may be restrictive, rigid gender roles and expectations, a lot of people just don't fit into that structure and are treated like freaks and feel perpetually misunderstood.
I didn't see anyone link any professional sources. Here are some, a drop in the bucket to what is out there. Don't have kids myself, just the experience of being one. My parents overall were really great, the things that made being a kid difficult was when they didn't see me for me. Looking at what they thought I was and could be instead of who I was in the moment

From my understanding.. They are non binary. Being their selves has nothing to do with God. 

Non binary means that they're not a boy or girl.. Now they might want to look masc or fem or both but it doesn't change their identity. 

I'm 17 and I found out at 16..

My advice is talking with them, google, talk to people.. Learn about them and their identity. This doesn't change who they are.. 

Just try your best to use they/them and gender neutral refers.. Like instead of daughter, use kid, child, baby ect
Let me tell you, I appreciate that you are trying. I would have loved to have parents like you. Instead, I got my head slammed in a dryer door. I am so, so glad that you are choosing to support your child. Keep your toxic family away from them, and I'm sure you will.

I do, however, agree with the wariness of social media lol. Nothing to do with gender or sexuality exploring, just with the fact that kids are *so* impressionable and *so* easy to get hurt on social media, either by their peers or by adults. I'm glad I was kept off social media until I was in high school, tbh. But if they've already grown accustomed to being on social media, well, I'm not sure how you'd handle that battle if it were one you were to choose.
Lots of things have been said, but I didn’t see this. Explore your own gender and share with your child when you’re asking them about theirs. What makes you feel like the gender you present? What makes you feel euphoric in your gender? What makes you feel a little icky? Nothing related to your body, what you do for others, etc. Just things that you feel internally and why. It’s a really good way to get to understand why someone else needs to live in line with those feelings in themself, no matter how young they are. Think back to when you were a kid and what complex things you understood about yourself and the people around you, how intense your emotions were. Kids get it. They need space to explore their identities, and if you explore with them it won’t be one sided vulnerability.
Hello! as a nonbinary person without kids i can't give much advice on the handling family side but I just want to tell you that acceptance and an attempt means the absolute world. It doesn't matter if you mess up, just the willingness to try, to have that much respect for you to try and love for the kid you have over the one you thought you did means a lot. And while being nonbinary is different for almost everyone who is, and it's a lot to put into one comment, I want to open my DMs to you for any questions you might have! Finding information is hard and there's the worry of imposing on others, so I'd like you to know that I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about your child's identity, their experience, and how they'd probably like to be treated while navigating their self-discovery : D
I'm the (nonbinary) parent of a trans teen too. Its HARD to defend to other adults that yes your kid does in fact know who they are. It's hard to come out, or tell people your kid isn't cis, in a world where that's not always safe. You're at the start of a hard journey, but you love your kid, and you want the best for them. Be there for them, defend and protect them, just as you would with any other trait about your child. 

God makes us all EXACTLY how we are. If God made you trans, you're trans. If God made you a nonbinary person, you're a nonbinary person. Far be it from me or any of your family members to question God's plan for your child. 

Your kid can be happy. They're not empty, they're not any more confused than any other 12 year old. They're figuring out who they are and you being there to support them is the best thing you can do.
Your child is the source you need to listen to for what they're going through and why they feel this way. What I encourage you to do is to take a positive but inquisitive tone with them. Ask them to help you understand, because you'll both (hopefully) learn a lot from them and understanding their reasoning and feelings. What I found helpful (and do take this with a grain of salt, everyone is different) was people reacting with honest curiosity. The more I explained myself and my feelings, the more confident I became. If they are questioning, then this is good practice with a loving and supportive person. If they already know (and I do believe that people have to experiment to know sometimes, whether it turns out to be something else or not), this helps them build resilience and learn to articulate themselves.
As someone who is non-binary at a young age rn I can tell you that the most important thing is be open. This means different things like to conversations and to changes with their gender. As well as preferences, in your post you said other members of your family were saying things. Don’t be surprised if your child doesn’t want to communicate with them and if they ( the family members) are saying something mean and homophobicly rude.  Lastly let them tell you stuff when you are ready
You're child came out as non-binary right? You kept mentioning them as daughter here (it can hurt)
But don't let them around your child. I had a grandma who said these things, I'm no longer a Christian because she made me feel broken.
Ask them what terms they want you to use. They might want to be called your daughter but they might prefer child or son. Open conversations are something i wish i had with my parents. You might see a doctor about puberty blockers if they're interested. Take time and do your research about queer things. Use their pronouns and name as best you can and correct others. Let them experiment with clothes and hair and expression. Affirming their gender is suicide prevention. Overall just let them know how loved they are.
Just wanted to hop on here and offer encouragement! I’m really happy for your child figuring out who they are! And I’m ecstatic for you, reaching out to the community your child is beginning to enter into and get to know is so wonderful! It shows how much you love them and are willing to learn and communicate in healthy ways! Please keep it up! 

And as for your family members giving pushback, always support and respect your child’s feelings around any family member. And as much as you want to, you can’t always change everyone’s minds. And it’s okay. Your kid just needs to know you’ve got their back and that they’re safe with you. 

Please keep up the good work. We need more supportive moms willing to get educated and grow. 💕
If they want to use they them pronouns then maybe dial back on using she her. Even when not talking to them. It is good practice and I know I would be deeply hurt is I found out someone was only respecting my pronouns to my face . It takes time and being consistent with it helps you remember. Also definitely have a talk with them about what they are comfortable with being called and be aware that labels can change especially since they are so young.
everyone else has already said all the important things, so i'm just here to chime in as a happy, fullfilled 34 year old enby.

when i was a child there were no words for ppl like me. i was still nonbinary, but i was alone and afraid. i bound my chest in unsafe ways, i was incapable of forming meaningful relationships with others (because i was unable to be myself), and i was ultimately traumatized by trying to be a cisgender binary person. i felt like an impossible thing.

then the internet happened and i found my words.

i came out at 21 and i've been out in all areas of my life ever since. i've been medically transitioning in nonlinear ways that work for me, i'm wealthy in the chosen queer family department, i know who i am, and i get to be my authentic self. i feel extremely, extremely grateful to be alive and nonbinary.

i'm sure you know this, but your nonbinary child is a treasure. you're lucky to have them and they're lucky to have a parent like you. just know that your child's future is bright and that trans joy is real, regardless of what's happening in some parts of the world. this is a fantastic community and you seem like a great parent.
Hello! To second what a lot of people said, good on you for being supportive; many queer and trans kids don’t have that luxury. Your willingness to learn is a good start. 

Be on the lookout for dysphoria, anxiety, people’s comments around them (looking at your family and strangers), and be their biggest advocate! It’s hard to stand up for yourself, especially that young. Correct others for them - IF they say that’s okay and what they want. Keeping an open line of communication is key!

To add a couple of points that I haven’t seen yet:

Another possibility as to why they would choose they/them is because they’re a type of non-binary called “genderfluid.” This means that sometimes they may feel feminine, sometimes masculine, sometimes a mix of both, sometimes neither, sometimes like a girl, sometimes like a boy, or any combination of those - I’m genderfluid and use they/them because it’s easier thank asking people to switch pronouns based on how I’m feeling. Only they can truly tell you their experience with gender identity. 

Another thing to ask them about would be gender expression. Do they want to change their haircut or style? Do they want new clothes? New shoes? It can be expensive but it can help them feel so much more comfortable with their body and valid in their identity!

It might be a phase, it might not be. Hell, even at 19 I’m still figuring myself out, and that includes my gender identity and preferred pronouns. Do NOT discount or write off their experiences no matter what comes next. They’re figure themselves out, and it’s a beautiful journey. I’m glad they trust you to take with them❤️
The only thing you can do here is trust your child to know their identity, and provide them with all the love and security you would have given them had they not come out to you. It sounds as though these family members are the ones who are putting your child in danger of being confused.
Well, the way they feel about pronouns isn’t about choice, it’s just a feeling, it’s hard to explain, but it’s there and your kid is feeling it too. Please don’t let them around those family members alone as it could put your kid in danger. I’m glad you are open to it and are willing to help them explore their gender openly. At first adjusting to the new pronouns may be difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it will be easy. Using these pronouns for your kid will really help their mental health. Definitly ask about different labels such as whether they’d rather be called “daughter”, “child”, “kid”, “niece”, you know, those sorts of terms. Find out what they are comfortable with and they kind of language and compliments they prefer too: “pretty” “handsome” “cute” etc.

Please feel free to stop by r/transgenderhelp and ask us questions and we will guide you!!
You've got a lot of amazing comments to reference already, that have a lot of great advice and resources. I just wanted to let you know that I'm a non-binary person in my 20s, and have been openly non-binary for a decade (came out in my teen years). If you ever feel like talking to a non-binary person who went through teenagehood as a non-binary person could help you with any more specific questions that come up while you're learning, I'm open to DMs! (I'm not always great with responding quickly, so time-sensitive things would be better taken elsewhere when possible)

I know there were so many things about my experiences I couldn't articulate as a teenager that I now have the language for, and while I obviously can't speak for your kid or know what's going on in their head, I can let you know my own perspectives, both how I feel about certain things now, and how I felt about them as a teenager. My parents didn't have a lot of resources when I first came out, and it was hard for all of us because they couldn't understand things and I couldn't explain those things. I'm very happy to try and provide parents help so that things can be a little easier for families than it was for mine.
Hi, OP, everyone is already giving incredible advice, so I just wanted to say thank you in conjunction with everyone here who has already said so. Thank you for reaching out to this space, and thank you for doing your best to support your child. It means so much to me, and many other people here, to see a parent like you doing your best to learn and be supportive. I wish you and your child nothing but the best. 💖💖💖
I wish you were my mum :”) your kiddo is very lucky
Ok so... I'm nonbinary. I've been nonbinary since I can remember, but I grew up in the 90's, before social media was a thing. I remember being 6-10 years old and wanting less gender affirming clothing, short hair, and a gender neutral name. This was long before the use of pronouns was a thing. I remember at one point *wanting* something like a they/them identifier but it was 1999 so it wasn't a thing yet. 

I'm 30 years old now, and I'm still nonbinary. I'm just glad there's a name for it now, there wasn't when I was growing up. 

A couple of years ago, I realized something. I don't know if this counts for everyone, but in my case, I realized that a lot of my gender identity preferences had less to do with how I felt about my own body, and more about the way others perceived it. All the gender roles, social expectations, and ""rules"" for each gender seemed a bit arbitrary to me. It used to revolve more around how I played, but now it's evolved a bit. I still get a bit of judgement for being the one that cuts the grass and takes out the trash, and being the breadwinner while my AMAB spouse is the homemaker. 

I wish I had a better way to explain it, other than my own experience. But to me, being nonbinary isn't so much about how I feel about my own body, it just feels like the world is trying to cram me into a box. There's a male box and a female box, and each box has its own limitations. But I don't want limitations. I just want to be me.
Nonbinary isn't a hard label. It leaves room for all kinds of expression and changes later in life. Your kid may feel restricted or limited with the clothing choices and the enforced role of femininity. 
 
Your kid may be saying ""I need space to figure out my own gender expression. I don't feel like a girl but I'm not sure if I feel like a boy. I would like time to think about my identity and explore different methods of expressing myself""
You're lucky your kid trusts you enough to tell you who they are. No one else can tell you more than they know about themselves. Try to honor that. There's nothing negative about this. This isn't a choice and more than being gay is. Changing pronouns just means you realized , hey, it feels wrong when people call me this, I am more comfortable being referred to in this is way instead. There isn't much more to it. Just like some people like or maybe just don't mind being called he or she, it can be upsetting for others. Media did help me because I never saw anyone living as I wish I could. It gave me courage because I realized If they can live as themselves then so can I. When everyone around you is denying who you are, then yeah, there are plenty of people like us who your kid can come to. And we will support them because we know what it's like and we know we are real and we don't want your kid to go through what we did (years of stuffing it down til you can't keep living that way). The world can make room for us. It's not too hard to understand. But I think most people have simply never considered gender. And we now know that it is largely arbitrary to uphold the idea that men and women are the only option and that it is determined by what's in your pants. What do we lose if we admit that we have to power of self determination? Mostly bigots from our lives.
Hey They/them here.


I have always struggled with my gender. For a long time I thought about transition -ftm- but their are days I feel feminine and days I feel more like a man and days I feel like well both!!! It’s not really a choice it was the way god made me. It took a while for my family to get used to but as long as you try they will appreciate it, hell even when my dad makes crappy dad math Jokes about it I still know he truly trying to understand that I was just made a little different then everyone else.


Yes their are family members that still call me she/her but I still love them and try to understand that they are trying
Anyone who is being judgmental can go fornicate with themselves. This is about you supporting your child (also kid, spawn, and baby). 

It is absolutely ok for you to be confused and to struggle with shifting pronouns to they/them. One of my friend is a mom to a non-binary kid, and she put an autocorrect in her phone to change ""she"" to ""they"" so she wouldn't inadvertently misgender her child. 

I knew I was different by the time I was 4, but I didn't know about being non-binary until I was in my 30s. When I was in school, the girls in my class seemed like a different species from me. I knew I wasn't a boy, but I wasn't one of them either. 

Let your kid take the lead and support whatever they want to do as long as it's safe to explore their gender - clothes, hair, name, pronouns, etc.
the fact that they are comfortable enough to share this with you is a bigger thing than you might think, so don't worry too much, you're doing good! :) the thing is, they might end up with different labels in the future but it doesn't hurt anyone to try something out. this is just the way we grow.

I was also born female and now I identify as non binary & use any pronouns. I came out (with my gender) not that long ago but honestly, if I had the words to express myself I would've came out much, much sooner.

I always enjoyed both masculine and feminine things growing up and I'm so grateful my parents let me be myself. looking back I could've known a long time ago; I always tried to mimic the men I have in my life, was afraid to present ""too"" feminine cuz I thought others would just see me as a girl and was upset by some changes in my body when I started puberty. later in life I considered if I'm a trans man but I wasn't uncomfortable with being a girl either. being non binary & using different pronouns for me means that I don't have to throw away a part of myself so I can be like a ""typical"" girl/boy. I don't have to choose between what norms  to follow so I am seen as a binary gender. it's just freedom to express myself and good vibes. :)

also, I'm christian. it's hard to keep your faith when your different. personally, I moved myself away from the church (it was toxic in other ways too) and I've been really happy. I believe that you don't have to ""show off"" with going to church and any events to believe. it can be just between you and a God and that's perfectly okay. whenever someone tries to tell me otherwise I just ask; if God hates me, why do I keep winning? :D (like truly, I have an amazing life)
First off, you kept calling your kid ""daughter"" and ""she/her"". The first step to showing support is calling them their proper pronouns and using terms they are comfortable with. Unless they specified ""daughter"" is okay, don't use that. If you're talking to them and a gendered term slips, apologize, correct yourself and move on. Talking about the issue more (Things like ""oh no I'm so sorry, I promise I'm trying. I didn't grow up with this, i have to get used to it."") can often cause dysphoria in people, not everyone but it can happen. 

It's great you came here to seek advice from other nonbinary people. The greatest piece of advice I have is to cut off or educate the family on how to be supportive. Your kid is going through changes and finding themselves. Even if they later decide that ""nonbinary"" doesn't feel right, at least they felt that support and were free to explore their identity in a safe space. Then in the future they feel safe coming to you for advice or support. 

You should prioritize your relationship with your kid above the mean comments from your family members. 

I wish them the best of luck on their journey!
People who have gender identity dissonance are always helped by gender affirming care. For some people all they need is to use different pronouns and be encouraged to dress how they want. Some people need more some less. You are their parent and they need your unconditional love and support. That means trying your best to use their pronouns and new name if that’s what they want.

Check out the book Whipping Girl by Julia Serrano.
As a parent it is your job to teach and protect your child, but also to learn and change with them.
Will addressing your child as they/them hurt them? No.
Is it something you can talk to them more on?
Yes.
Why do they feel this way? For how long?

I myself go by they/them/zir.
For me changing my pronouns was about being more comfortable with myself, I hate being call girl or lady or miss because it didn't fit with me and even felt demeaning. I was about 14 when I found a  proper term 'non-binary' and 'enby' that fit me better.

My mother has told me from her side of things, that there is a bit of a grieving involved in your child changing from what you knew, to someone who is freeing themselves to be their truest most authentic self.

It's completely valid to experience those feelings of grief, concern and doubt. But you also get to relearn who this amazing person you brought into this world is.

Best advice is talk and communicate calmly, share your concerns alow your child to do the same, because the alternative could push them away. Would you rather be there for them no matter what or potentially push them away because you didn't try.

not going to offer any advice here, just here to say that you're doing amazing. any parent this open and honest and willing to learn the steps to support their kid out of love, no matter the pushback from family or friends or social norms, is an incredible parent. my own weren't the most supportive when i came out, and im sure your child is very lucky and thankful to have you in their life. no matter how overwhelming or stressful things get, remind yourself the steps you're taking, the communication you're showing and the support you're offering are all the right things to do and your kiddo is lucky to have you. i wish you the best of luck ❤
Why they make this choice:
- they have found the words to communicate how they feel
- they (finally) feel safe enough to express themselves
- they want to feel more comfortable in their life and live as their authentic self

Are they too young to know who they are?
- no
- would you ask a someone who identifies as their agab (assigned gender at birth) that question?
- did you know when you were a kid that you were indeed a [insert agab] and not trans/non-binary?
- did you know as a kid you were cis straight?
- why would someone question their gender if they were ‘the norm’. Wouldn’t it be way easier then as everything is already spelled out for them? 

The answer is: they are finally who they are, and yes they are old enough to know who they are. This might change in the future if they find other words that better describe them, but even if they were to change their mind later, at least they are respected and well cared for by being who they are and being appreciated for who they are. Don’t fight them on their identity. They know who they are!
I think when you aren't nonbinary it's very hard to understand that experience and how it feels, which is okay, as it's not an experience you've had. If you want to understand what your kid is going through I would advise that, rather than trying to imagine being nonbinary, imagine that everyone around you insisted you were. I don't know if you are a man or a woman based on your post, but you can probably imagine that it would be alienating and strange if everybody in your life referred to you using they/them pronouns and didn't talk or think about you as a man or woman, whichever is your identity.

If you can imagine that situation, you can begin to understand the disconnect and discomfort that your child may feel when they are perceived and treated as feminine. It can feel like you're invisible.

None of this is particularly specific advice, though i do think it generally holds water. You're already doing a great job by acknowledging you need advice and seeking it out. Just talk things through as you go with your child and anyone else who can help and you'll do great. :)

Thank you soooo very much❤️ All of this has really helped immensely. Especially since my child has trouble putting it into words themself. Sharing some of these things with them could help their confidence. Right now I am worried about them because they seem to be dealing with bad anxiety (especially social related) and maybe depression. Unfortunately a lot of this wonderful stuff runs in our family. Is there a local support group usually for youth in the LGBQT+ community? I feel like a lot of it might be because they feel alone in all this.
Something Else Interesting To Bring Up Is The First Known Complaint About Singular They Was In The 18th Century, If Memory Serves, Over 300 Years After It Started Being Used. Interestingly Enough, I Found Many Of The Oldest Sources Saying Singular ""They"" Is Bad Also Disliked ""He Or She"" And Variants, Instead Desiring The Masculine ""He"" Be Used Generically.
They just turned 12 but I swear they are going on 30. They told me they were Pansexual when they were 10. They are actually more emotionally and mentally mature than most adults I know. Their dad and I have been very supportive. Your advice is very helpful. Thank you so much for the insight. I am more than willing to stand up for my amazing child but unfortunately I have a very low self esteem and doubt myself and my parenting. My relatives are all too happy to tell me I’m wrong and over step.
Thank you I really appreciated your sincere words and they really made sense. Reading your explanation and the ones above have really opened my eyes and helped me understand the whole idea/community better. It is also making me feel more secure in standing up against those I know are going to not understand. I want to always be in my child’s corner.
Well that’s the thing my daughter is only 12 and feels like she needs to decide now what she needs to go by. She’s putting a lot of pressure on herself. I will support her no matter what and begin using the pronouns she chooses when or if she chooses them but right now she is just feeling very confused. She came out as Pansexual several years ago and her father and I have been very supportive. When I asked her about why she might want to go by they/ them or could she describe to me why she felt she needed to be called that just so I could understand… she said that she had not quite decided it and couldn’t quite put it in words of her own exactly. She just felt safe enough to share with me that she was contemplating it very seriously.
Wow, I am just blown away by the support and all the information you are giving me. I am actually feeling so excited and hopeful. I can’t wait to share a lot of this with my child and tell them about my new understanding then explain how we have backup ammunition to support us in the fight against the negativity from those who don’t understand.
I’m really glad you brought this up! I’ve heard about this before from a trans friend at work. I believe she mentioned she dealt with it. Someone else did mention for a moment in the comments before about this but didn’t quite explain. I was going to look it up. Thank you for explaining a bit. The way your bringing it up it does sound a lot like what they might be experiencing.  I don’t know if I should just bring it up to their regular counselor or get a referral to the counselor who specializes in these things.
I totally believe in that. My mother and some other family members are unfortunately on the other spectrum of that. In my mind God loves everyone no matter what and I’m ashamed of how most Christians act now a days. I will definitely be looking into a church where my child can feel welcome and we can cross out that negative influence that my mom and other relatives have been lathering on. Thank you❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much!! You sound like one the the most beautiful souls I have ever met! I feel so awful for all those who were not unconditionally supported by their parents. Doesn’t matter if you got pregnant really early or came out as gay. Your parents should have your back and support you no matter what. Even before my daughter came to me about who she was I have had an open heart because I too believe God loves everyone. I believe that a person is born this way and God does not make mistakes. He wants us to truly be who we are. To express the beautiful gifts inside us. I am honestly appalled by how most Christians act nowadays. “Judge not lest ye be judged” and “You who is without sin, throw the first stone”…. My fellow Christians must have forgotten those. So busy bothering people who are doing nothing but being true to themselves and expressing love in a form that might be different than what they know but it’s love just the same.
I’m so sorry your family does not support you. That breaks my heart. Sending you mental hugs across the miles. 🤗❤️
u/AdultingMakesMeCrazy I saw your reply about re-reading your comments but I can't see it anymore. I typed this reply but it didn't post, so here it is

&#x200B;

Thank you for being receptive and re-reading your replies. It's understandable to be overwhelmed, especially if this is the first time you have a non-binary person in your life. You (and everyone) are gonna make mistakes and sometimes it'll upset people but as long as you're willing to learn from it and keep trying, that's all anyone can ask!

  
I don't know if your child has dysphoria or not, and honestly they might not know either. When I first came out I didn't think I had dysphoria, but soon I realized that I did and it was quite bad. If they do have dysphoria, it might hurt to be misgendered even if you recognize someone as trying. If they get upset when misgendered, it is probably not from thinking that you're not trying, but because it can hurt.

  
It's not uncommon for non-binary and/or trans people to overcompensate as their agab before realizing. For example, some trans and/or nonbinary people who were afab were heavily into makeup and other traditionally feminine interests, and looking back feel it was a mask. Some people might've avoided things associated with their agab, but now feel comfortable with those things in a non-gendered way. That was something that confused my parents about how much changed after I initially came out. It might take some time to figure themself out, their style out, they may initially want to keep their name but also might decide to try others. I think you will do great, as long as you stay open minded and receptive
^^^^^
OP said that her daughter was considering it, not that she had officially come out as it
Your post is very wise. Especially the advice your dad gave you. I agree so very much with his saying or advice.
If anyone sounds lovely it’s you 🤗❤️
Wow, that was one amazing comment and made me think of my Aunt Kathy that I looked up to. She had a way with words and wisdom and looking at the world. She was a very beautiful, old soul. I loved every word. Thank you ❤️🤗
Thank you so much I really appreciate this❤️
Thank you for your comments and insight. My child still seems to be deciding but when that decision is made I will be respectful of it❤️🤗
The support in your comment really meant the world to me. Thank you so much for the uplifting words and insight❤️
Thank you so much❤️ that’s some good advice. And I’m glad I made your day🤗 Everyone here is making mine by being so supportive and helpful.
I’m so sorry that your family was like this. My mom is the one who is a Christian like that. I promised myself I would never become someone with such a closed heart. I have always believed that God loves and accepts everyone. There are so many Christians out there that offend me and give Christianity a bad name. They mold the Bible into what they want it to say. Jesus was about love and forgiveness . One of his most prominent stories in the Bible has him saying “you without sin, cast the first stone”… when they were about to stone a woman for her sin. We are all equals. None of us the right to act like we are better than another.
Oh wow, you have such a beautiful soul❤️ your mother is really missing out! Don’t let her confusion and negativity pull you away from your peace. I believe in you
I keep hoping that the family in question will get their crap together and listen to me when I say that this is who they are and this is what they need to be happy. These people know not to say things in front of them. If a person did they would no longer be going around them. I have them in counseling but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Maybe I have the wrong counselor. They have already said almost two years ago that they decided they were Pansexual but is just now feeling like non-binary pronouns might be part of who they are. They are not sure. They are only 12 and feel like they need  to figure out everything out now.  I just want to support them and give them the best advice
I am so sorry your mom made you feel like that. At first I would let my mom bully me into trying to get them to be more feminine or dress nicer… because among my many issues I am codependent. But thankfully I realized before I ruined my relationship with my child that my mom needs a lot more help than I do. So now my child never has to wear a dress unless they choose to (it would probably be more of a pantsuit and rainbow colored). Even at a family get together or whatever. I say be yourself just wear something clean. They even have shirts that are obviously supporting gay rights or hats and pins like that … they ask me if it’s ok to wear to a  gathering and I tell them if someone can’t except you for the way you are.. they aren’t worth your time or mine….. so wear whatever you want.
Leo’s Guide to “Transness”

Terms you may not be familiar with or have the wrong definition to:

Cisgender: someone who does identify as their assigned gender at birth

Transgender: someone who doesn’t identify with their assigned gender at birth

Non-binary: someone who doesn’t identify with a binary gender, male or female. (Non-binary is not a third gender that exclusively uses they/them pronouns. It’s an umbrella term that applies to many genders that are not male or female, but you can identify as just non-binary)

Gender non-conforming: someone who doesn’t not fit into societal gender roles. Not all gnc people are trans, but they may face similar discrimination with trans people. You can be cis or trans and be gnc.

Genderfluid: someone whose gender fluctuates or changes. One day they might feel masculine. The next they could feel like nothing in particular. Then maybe they’ll feel feminine.

Agender: someone who doesn’t have/feel/ a gender, or doesn’t have a strong enough feeling of their gender to label it

Genderqueer: what a lot of people think gnc is. Pretty similar to the non-binary label. Kind of up to the person. Usually someone who doesn’t identify on the gender binary. Other reason could be: not have a clear label of their gender, having multiple genders, having no gender, etc.

Trans man: someone who’s not biologically male that identifies as a man.

Trans masc: someone who’s trans but feels more masculine or presents masculine (not necessarily feels like a man)

Trans woman: someone who is not biologically female that identifies as a woman

Trans fem: someone who is trans and identifies femininely/presents femininely (not necessarily feels like a woman)

Deadname/given name/birthname: someones given name at birth

Deadnaming: calling someone by their birth name (big no no)

Agab: assigned gender at birth

Afab/amab: assigned female/male at birth

Taboos, No No’s, and other Tips and Tricks

Deadnaming is a very big no. Some people are okay with it but never ever do so without asking. It’s very hurtful and usually causes dysphoria or reminds you and other people that we are trans. 

Outing people is never okay. Some people aren’t ready to be out yet. And outing them without their consent can sometimes put them in danger.

Calling someone “a transgender”. It’s objectifying. I am transgender not a transgender. (Very similar to queer. Calling someone a queer vs queer has two very different meanings)

Transsexual is a very outdated term. Before people were really aware of non binary people they only assumed trans people were ftm or mtf (female to male and vice versa). Being transgender was just going through surgery to “change your sex”. That is no longer the case. Some people still identify as that term but that is only up to them. So never use it unless someone specifically asks you to.

Tr*nsvestite (not sure if slurs are banned) usually describes a cross dresser or someone that dresses in the “opposite” clothing for sexual pleasure. It’s commonly used as a derogatory term towards trans people, usually trans women.

Tr*nny is another derogatory term. Some people may still identify as it. Unfortunately the meaning was taken away and turned into a slur. 

Pronouns don’t equal gender. I use they/he pronouns but I don’t identify as a man because I use he/him pronouns. Someone could be cisgender and use she/they pronouns. Someone could use all pronouns and not identify as every gender. I’m sure you get my point. 

(Feel free to add anything I missed)
That is a lot of really amazing, helpful input❤️ Thank you for taking the time to do that and open your heart🤗🌻 I am so very sorry your mother does not support you. That breaks my heart. Sending you ‘mental’ hugs across the miles. My child did ask about binding, especially since they are uncomfortable with their chest. But yes binding sounds so scary to me. I’m afraid of them hurting themselves. Especially since they are still growing. Are restrictive/high impact sports bras a good compromise till they get older? I just want to do the best thing to make them feel themselves but be safe.
I know it took you some time and care to put this all down for me ❤️ And let me tell you I appreciate it more than I can put into words. I want to be aware of everything that’s going to connect with my child’s world and make sure I’m  learning to become a better, more rounded human being at the same time. I’ve always supported the LGBTQ+ community even when I was younger. I had some really good friends from some of the communities back in the day (cause I’m old, at least that’s what my kid says lol). But now it’s been more difficult to make any kind of friendships being a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on things. Become an advocate if I could. It just makes me so said that so many parents don’t support their kids out there. My kid and I are going to the local Pride parade and I got a shirt that says “Free Mom Hugs”. My kid picked it out for me❤️
This is amazing! Thank you so much! I will take you up on your offer
I really appreciate the info you offered for me to check out❤️ I need all the info I can get🤗 and thank you so much for you positivity and support
I'm not sure where you're located, but there are a *lot* of support groups around the world for folks like us. PFLAG would be a good place to start, or their school's GSA. I'll add that it's okay for *you* to need support, too. While I recommend a supportive gender therapist for anyone going through this process, it's also a good idea for parents to have their own support structure. While your focus should be on providing support for your kid, you also need support for the work that *you* are going to do during this process, and that's okay.
I just want to say that I can tell you love your child very much and it’s great that you came here for advice. It’s also very nice to see that you switched to they/them pronouns, I know (as someone with parents lol) that even the smallest things like that can be very validating even if they don’t see it happening. I hope that you are both able to continue exploring this together and get the resources that you need to help them ❤️
Gender Spectrum https://genderspectrum.org/ is another great resource for trans and non-binary youth and their families! They have a glossary you might find helpful, and facilitated online groups for kids and teens.
depending on how populated where you live is there is almost always LGBTQ+ youth support groups, usually with age restrictions and adult coordinators to foster a genuine safe space. i'd just research around your area to see if any resources are around like that for you and your kid :)
Also, please don't talk about them as ""she."" They asked you to refer to them as they/them, and it's best to do it even if they're not around to hear/read it. It's always good to practice their correct pronouns and getting used to it, plus, it rubs us all the wrong way if you use the pronouns that they told you not to use. You will sometimes slip up and that's fine as long as you try to refer to them correctly. Soon enough, it will be natural for you to talk about them as they/them.

Anyway, props and all the glory to you for being an amazing parent and making an active effort to support your child, you're doing great by reaching out to us ♥️
I was also considered very emotionally and mentally mature, and I hope you can find a good balance between respecting your kid's maturity and still protecting them, I know it's hard for a lot of parents to do that. I think it's good that you came to a nonbinary space for advice on this, honestly, not a whole lot of parents do.
Dude I would have given anything to have parents like y'all, it sounds like you're doing amazing. Especially if you kid feels so comfortable expressing themselves and who they are to you.
Hey this might make you feel a little better- I realized I was nonbinary/trans at 13 :) for me things started to get funky when I was 10 and started puberty, so from my experience that age is completely normal to start questioning/figuring themself out. My partner realized he was bi at 10, and the only reason I didn’t realize I was nonbinary sooner was because I grew up in a very sheltered household. As soon as I became aware of what nonbinary meant, it was like all these big complicated feelings I’d experienced my whole life suddenly made sense- so I wouldn’t call it a choice 😅 this is just who I am! My biggest advice would be to listen to your kid and give them the love and support they need to be themself first and foremost. I didn’t have supportive parents (my mom actually bullied me into not coming out till I finally got the courage at 21), and I think just knowing my parents had my back and loved me regardless would’ve helped me a lot. Even now I still wish my parents were supportive lmfao. 
Also, as far as your religious relatives go, please keep your child safe from them. I was in religious education from ages 12-18 and it completely destroyed my sense of self. I’m still dealing with the trauma from that time in my life 4+ years later. 
You have a very good heart, and it makes me so happy to see a parent who wants to be there for and help their child in whatever way they can. :)
you don’t have to be perfect, but you’re learning and trying and growing. you’re going to save your kid so much pain and they’ll never forget it.
Messing up pronouns is okay (for the first little while), but immediately (or try to) correct yourself. You won't catch it every time, but making an effort is 100% much better than just ""she goes by they/them.""

Pro tip: talk with them about which relatives it's safe to come out to/use gender neutral language in front of, and which they'd rather wait on. And be sure to respect that. Accidentally slipping a ""they"" to a relative said relative likely won't notice, but this is where you learn selective gendering - pronouns one way one minute and flipping the script for another set the next. As a closeted person, I had to do that a lot.
I came out as pan when I was ten and non-binary at 12. The journey of self discovery can be at any age
Gender affirming therapist here!  I agree with the above!  I work with kids too and imo the trifecta of teen trans support is this:  supportive home and family (this is non negotiable) trans affirmative medical support (like yesterday) and finally but still as important queer social support (friends, camps, therapy support groups, and other queer community).  Hope this helps!  Feel free to DM with questions.
The fact that you are already using they/them pronouns for them shows how much you care. You’re going to do great, and as a non-binary person I would love to have you as a mom.
You’re not wrong to support your child. My 10 year old is very much more mature than I was. You’re doing great! There is a great book called Genderqueer by Mia Kobabe, it’ll help you understand and see it in a way that breaks down the old archaic walls society has put up <3 your kiddo will probably like it too, it’s a graphic novel.
I started having feelings of not being cis when I was 7, it intensified when I was around their age as I hit puberty and took me until now (17) to accept that I'm trans. If I had a parent like you, who were willing to hear me out and educate themselves, maybe it wouldn't have taken me 10 years of denial to finally accept it. You're doing great, keep supporting your kid, it's a journey of self-discovery for both of you.
I hope someone has said this, but in addition to all the care and work you're already doing in this thread by showing this wonderful change in behavior and effort towards supporting your kid - but one of the best things you can do, for your kid's safety with the family and for your own happiness, is giving yourself more credit and believing in yourself and your parenting. You raised an amazing kid who trusts you with these aspects of themselves, these relatives that overstep can get lost! You're doing great.
Well, if what you've said here is any indication, I think you're doing a great job. Your child is lucky to have you.
The fact that you are here is honestly the sweetest parenting move. You are choosing to let your child express themselves and learn about themselves how they know best. 

I took time to figure it all out but access to the internet means more visibility for people and youngsters who are questioning. Please look for good role models for your kiddo in the LGBT world. You may find some you will look up to also :)
Oh ya, that's just cause you raised them well. Stable caring environments lead to rapid emotional growth. They are still young so they still depend on that stability to express more complex and nuanced understanding. When they grow up they can continue that practice of developing and providing a strong stable environment for themselves and others around them.
Definitely work on your own self esteem. Your relatives likely contributed to that problem. You deserve to feel good in your own skin and choices. You are doing a great job.
I think the fact that you have doubts about your parenting shows you ARE a good parent tbh. because you actually care and want the best for your child. you're doing fine mama keep it up 💖💖
I am sorry you deal with low self-esteem and overbearing relatives at the same time.

But let me just say, the trust of a trans child is so precious, they must really love and believe in you to have told you their truth. Many of us don't trust another soul until well into adulthood, and sadly some never do. The fact that they've showed you this part of themself really speaks to how they view your relationship. If you're ever feeling down on yourself, try to remember this, because they'll need you to maintain that love and trust more than ever. 💜

I’m really glad you found us over here, it says a lot that you were even willing to ask and even more that you are actually willing to learn! I’m really glad that I was able to help.
I think it’s important to remember that your kid can only figure out if using they/them pronouns feels right if someone uses them. When I came out as non-binary I said I was thinking about using they/them pronouns because I thought this language would soften the blow to others but it just created an out for them to never use those pronouns. 

I can’t speak for your child but I’d try using gender neutral language from now on. If your kid decides they don’t actually wanna use those pronouns they’ll let you know. But they won’t know if their comfortable if the person they’ve trusted to help them figure things out isn’t using them. 

Maybe start by asking “is it okay to say you’re my daughter or would you prefer if I call you my child?” Or maybe try using “they/them” in front of your kid for a day. At the end check in and see how the day of different pronouns made them feel.
In my experience when someone says “I’ve been thinking about using they/them pronouns” it means that they are sincerely asking you to use those pronouns for them but don’t feel confident asserting that as a direct demand. It’s not that they are unsure about wanting to use neutral pronouns, it’s that they are unsure if you are a safe person to make that request of. If you start using they/them for your kid you will show them you are a safe person to keep sharing with. But If you keep saying “her” waiting for a confident declaration they may just decide that you aren’t safe to talk to. It sounds like you may be the only family member who wants to support them so you really have to step up and make an effort here or your kid will feel like they don’t have anyone on their side. Using the pronouns someone has asked (or hinted about) is the essential to showing you respect them. Use they/them and call them your kid/child until they tell you otherwise.

If your child is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns now, that is something you should respect to show them you're listening. They might be saying they want to always be nonbinary or they might not and it's okay for people to change. They might come out as transmasc with he/him pronouns later, or say they're fluid between multiple genders, or stay the way they say they are now. (Don't be surprised if their name changes too.) You'll make them feel much more comfortable talking to you about their identify in the future if you believe what they say about themself, refer to them the way they believe they should be referred to now, and defend their right to self identify as any gender or sexuality. Ultimately, they're the same child, with a new set of words describing them. You'll probably want to do a lot of research about trans people. Learn what trans people say about themselves, rather than what non-trans people feel about trans people, because you'll learn more about how your kid feels about themself that way (and non-trans people on the internet who go out of their way to talk about trans people tend to be judgemental and hateful- not a good place to get information from if you want a good relationship with your kid).
okay it’s good that your kid feels comfortable enough to come to you with these things, but you literally just responded to “respect your child’s pronouns” by continuing to call them she/her and your daughter. i know its likely a hard transition for you, but typing is the absolute easiest way to make sure you’re referring to them correctly. because you can backspace and fix it. get better about it with strangers on the internet or you’ll never get better about it in front of your kid.
I'm glad my explanation was helpful! In regards to what therapist to see, I really would recommend seeing a gender therapist. A normal therapist is not required to learn how to handle gender identity issues. 

I think another important thing to mention is that your child might not feel comfortable talking to you about it if they do experience dysphoria, and it's possible they might not even know the word for it. Also, I am not sure if I explained it well, but non-binary people can indeed feel dysphoria around their bodies. I know in my case, as a non-binary person, I experienced a lot of dysphoria around that age and I never told anyone nor gave anyone reason to suspect anything was wrong. I felt a lot of shame around it and was scared what everyone would think. I started feeling dysphoria around my name as early as kindergarten. I didn't experience any dysphoria around my body until puberty started, but when it started, I didn't feel safe talking about my dysphoria and ended up self-harming to cope, and hiding that too. I'm not saying that this is the case with your child, but it's important to understand that it's a very real possibility that your child does already have dysphoria or might develop it in the coming years.

Edit: Wanted to add that dysphoria can show up as symptoms like anxiety, depression, dissociation, and/or symptoms similar to cPTSD.
I had a religious upbringing and was deeply uncomfortable with queer people before realising I was one of them. If it helps, you could tell your mother that there is nothing about trans or nonbinary people in the Bible. Jesus preached acceptance and compassion, and was happy to be associated with people such as sex workers, who were considered social outcasts. In my experience, the objection that many Christian people have to trans and NB people is that 'we were created in God's image, and disliking or wanting to change something about yourself goes against God's will.' If your mother says something like that, ask her how she feels about people dying their hair, getting breast implants, wearing makeup, etc. Why are some changes okay but not others?
Aw, girl. You just made me tear up. Again, I just have to say that people like you affirm my faith in humanity, not just spiritual things. You're a true Christian and a warrior for peace, how could God not love and protect you and your kid? May they bless and keep you both, always.

Thank you, truly.
Thank you I really, really appreciate your sincere 🥰words❤️ especially all the info you gave me about Dysphoria and other things to be aware of. I really want to be the best mom I can for them. Hugs
Thank you! What a lovely message to wake up to after retrieving a lost Pikachu at 5:45 am. XD Hashtag parenting is never quite what you expected but you gotta roll with it.
I mean the best advice you can give them is you love and support them, that they don't have to figure any of this stuff out right now! Yeah, I would look at getting her another counselor who deals specifically with LGBT youth if possible. Some LGBT centers also have support groups for parents of LGBT youth, that might be helpful for you also in understanding them and how best to support them.
As someone with top dysphoria I wouldn’t suggest binding so young. Just because of how risky it can be. That could maybe be an option in the future, but you really have to be safe about it. Sports bras are a really good option. Just make sure they’re getting the right size and not one that’s too small. Another thing that helps top dysphoria is the type of clothing you wear. Stay clear from stretchy, thin, or clingy material. Any shirts that highlight boobs or waistline. So basically no shirts that are “womens’ cut”. I’ve noticed thicker, shorter, and wider shirts seem to eliminate the shape of my boobs. I’m not sure what style of clothing your kid likes to wear but there’s shirts I get from a store called Zumiez that I pass a lot more in because it doesn’t highlight my chest. [This shirt](https://www.zumiez.com/welcome-baja-stripe-ivory-t-shirt.html) specifically and others in that shape. Depending on chest size and style of the shirt stripes are usually a no go but I’ve noticed that they’re just fine on these types of shirts for me personally. Mens or unisex hoodies are a good option. As long as it’s not too hot. Button up shirts are one of my favorites. You can layer them and keep them open and they’ll hide any side boob. Or you can wear them as just a shirt and they really don’t highlight boobs. As long as it’s not a tight one. More loose. If you absolutely have to wear something tight like a tank top because it’s summer, then darker colors are your best friend. They don’t show your chest as much. I can wear tighter black shirts because there’s not really a shadow or any depth highlighting my chest. Avoid v shaped neck lines on shirts or sweaters they’re usually meant to highlight cleavage. Any thick sweater, or crewnecks. Tucking your shirt in and pulling it out [like this](https://pin.it/1gGeiIx) creates a pocket where your chest has room to breathe and it doesn’t get highlighted. Also if anything has a tight waist it will highlight the chest. Which you can use a sports bra to try and fix or avoid those types of clothing. If you have high waisted pants and tuck a shirt in that’s too short or too thin it will show your chest. If you want to still highlight your waist but cover your chest you can either do the lil tuck and pull with the shirt or hopefully be covered enough with a sports bra, and possibly a button up shirt layered over. 

If you need any help figuring out how to put that into an outfit just ask me, and I can totally show you my personal outfits. I can explain what I’m doing with the clothes, so you can hopefully help out your child.
Thank you soooo very much❤️❤️❤️ I really mean it! I can’t believe how much support I’m getting. I’m literally sitting here in tears feeling so much better about the future. You have no idea how much this has really helped.
Thank you❤️ I am definitely going to look into that for them. They need a safe space besides home to express their true selves without worry.
Sorry for not realize what I was doing and really focus on my pronouns. I went back and tried to fix a lot of my comments. I am a bit overwhelmed with everything and other things going on in our lives so I’m not being 100%. I didn’t mean to offend anyone and I am really so thankful for all the support and information I have been given. Thank you for opening my eyes
Christians love to mystify children. Sooo intelligent mature etc. But they are just children. Christianity has a problem with infantilizing adult women and molesting minors. Id steer clear of seeing your child as anything but a child, developmentally. My parents did that to me and i wish they had not. It causes a lot of stress on the child to grow up too fast. It also isolates your child from their peers to think “they are not like other children.”

As far as exposure to the internet and such, many Christians are groomers (like your parents and my grandparents) that only talk about bad influence and exposure when a child is exposed to something they disagree with or that threatens their work in grooming certain values into the child. For instance, all the “bad influence” friends just so happen to be poorer, POC, LGBTQ+, Indigenous, etc. All the “bad influence” media just so happens to be non-Christian. All “bad influence teachers” just so happen to not be nuns, preachers, or ppl passing on their values. There’s no end. Essentially, they just want full control of your child’s mind. It is how they maintain their christian legacy. No matter what they say, it is of historic, divine, and political necessity that they influence your child. What the top reply says is SO RIGHT. Do not let them near your child, especially alone. My grandparents got ahold of me only a few times in my childhood and each of those times were… scarring. 

As far as your child being enby and pansexual, its not a big deal. They dont identify with either side of the gender binary (man or woman) and can love any kind of person. That is all it means. What i assume is hardest to wrap your head around is how someone could so easily NOT adopt the gender and sexuality orthodoxy and what it means for who they will become and if they will want you in their life. What you need to do is keep the philosophical work of understanding the gender binary on yourself. The more you know about feminism and the gender binary and how patriarchy and society create and maintain social categories, the easier it will be to understand someone who does not identify with those categories. Simultaneously, read some books by enbys and pansexuals. Fiction or nonfiction. It is important that you try and find as diverse set of authors you can and that they be enby or pan. (Children’s books written by them too for your kid, after reviewing them to make sure they are appropriate in content according to your values, of course). It is a different way of thinking and the one of the next best things apart from talking to ppl (like you did reaching out to us on this sub) is listening to pan and enby voices through their literature. 

Hope that helps! Good luck to you and your child :)
Sending big mental hugs your way for saying such a sweet thing and going through what you have. 🤗🤗❤️
Real, i felt that too and i prolly woulda realized if i knew those words existed
I’m so sorry your dealing with this trauma😢 Sending mental hugs across the miles🤗❤️ Thank you for the wonderfully kind words and advice. It does help to know that you knew so early. I guess to me it feels like such a big thing like something I might not figure out till I was at least a little bit older than my child is now. But I guess that’s the mom in me talking. I just don’t want them to grow up and have to deal with this world the way it can be with anyone who doesn’t conform or is different. I mean I was just a brainy, nerdy poor kid and that got me all kinds of picked on. I just want to keep the world from hurting my child but I know I can’t. It makes me feel so powerless.
That means a lot thank you

🤗❤️hugs , your words mean more than you know
🥰🤗 you have no idea how much that means to me because most days I don’t feel like it
Adding on to this great advice, just run it by your child to see who they would like you to use their pronouns around. Referring to them as they/them when talking to other people might out them, so it's a good idea to see who your kid would be comfortable with knowing about the situation. :)
That is a VERY good point! Thank you for bringing that up. I will start doing that.
I will definitely take that seriously. It makes perfect sense. They have a low sense of self esteem so maybe they are worried about how people will react? They came to me and their father two years ago and got a lot of support when they told us they were Pansexual. So I would hope that they would think we are are a safe person to confide in and tell how they want to do important things like this in their lives.
I will definitely tell them this too. I’m worried about them feeling like they have to label themselves. I just want to know what makes them feel like themselves.
You make a lot of sense. Thank you. I will work on it 🤗🌻
Oh my gosh that is super helpful! Because right now I have been super worried about them because they have been really acting depressed and having big problems with anxiety. It runs in our family to have depression, anxiety, bipolar and other fun stuff so I have an apt with a better therapist than the one they are seeing who works with a psychiatrist. So I could be looking in the wrong direction all together maybe? It could be what your talking about?
I wish more parents reacted the way you are, and I wish I'd had support growing up. Now I'm older and maybe a bit wiser, so I feel like helping folks out that are starting their journey (or supporting those who are) is a little way of being the change I want to see. I'm glad you've found it useful, and I wish you and your kiddo all the best. We're always here for help if you need us.
After reading your post and comments like this I'm positive that your child will get the support they both need and deserve. Thank you for not listening to the rest of your family, you clearly have your head on better than them.
The LGBTIQ+ community tends to be very welcoming and supportive, and there's a special place in our hearts for parents who support their children in exploring, understanding,and living their identities whatever those might be.

Welcome to the fam, fam!
as an nb person, this is a fantastic mindset to see in a parent. i can't speak for everyone, but making an honest effort to get it right and to improve is a lot more than many people do. (i still get my **own** pronouns wrong sometimes after four years using them, so i can hardly expect anyone else to do better!)
as another user pointed out, you're absolutely not offending anyone. You're in the middle of understanding this, no one's expecting you do everything perfectly right without being told how first, so really, you are doing a great job, keep it up!
Don’t feel guilty either because it takes TTIIMMEE for our mouths to follow our brains. My son is trans and it took about 6 months because I called him other pronouns for years. All the support groups and doctors , therapists and queer community folx said the same thing- as long as you keep trying and apologize it will eventually not be an issue anymore. You’ll get there :)
You are a wonderful perant, trying to understand your kid and they're pronouns. That is a marvelous thing. Hope for the best to you and your kid. And try to help them with this  adventure
I'm sharing this tip I got for getting used to a person using a new name or new pronouns, maybe it can help you too.

Have little training conversations with your child or another person if your child doesn't want to. Let them tell you something about them like their hobbies, how they look, what makes them themselves. Repeat those things using your child's pronouns. You can also do this alone by writing down things you know about your child while using they/them or simply repeat it in your mind.
Just here to say you're doing absolutely amazingly! This is a huge thing to process as a parent, and a huge learning curve too. Be gentle with yourself and compassionate to yourself too about how this may take you time to adjust to emotionally.  

The fact that you came here, and everything you're saying just shows how loving you are as a parent, and at the end of the day, no matter what anyone else says, that is by far the most important thing!! You're amazing, keep up the good work, your child will be so grateful to you, and you will be their safe space!

-Sincerely a 24-year-old non-binary psychology and counselling student who wishes that they felt safe at a younger age to talk to their parents about it!!
~~Not me finding out at 16 and I've told 2 ppl...~~
Oh! Thanks 😊
Another very important thing I just thought about:

Do not take your kid slipping up and referring to themself as ""she/her"" or with female terms as ""oh, they've changed their mind again"" because yes, we may accidentally misgender even ourselves, especially when it's still a fresh change.

Instead, if you really get the feeling they may be using those words/pronouns intentionally, check back in with them. They may have changed their mind again, they may still be figuring out which set of pronouns and which reference terms feel best, it may have been accidental slip-ups... It's always safest to keep an open communication instead of assuming.

And yes, with strangers is an excellent place to start practising so that it'll be easier and with fewer slip-ups with people who really count (like your kid, your family, ...)! :D
I wouldn't say it's looking in the wrong direction at all. It's very possible for trans and non-binary people to have those mental disorders, and family history is important to keep in mind. It just would also be helpful to talk to your kid about gender dysphoria, and ask them if they're experiencing any at all, whether it's around their name, pronouns, or body. If you can get a gender therapist in the picture, it would be easier to have that kind of conversation, and also figure out if/how to go about treating it. 

The one thing I'd recommend though is that you don't share it with your relatives if they do say they experience dysphoria. Odds are, your family won't treat them well, which could make things worse. Definitely tell your child that they can talk to you about this and you won't say anything to family or anyone else unless they say they are okay with it. Having that kind of safe space and support can be critical.

Also, I just want to say that it's really awesome that you're putting in the effort to understand them and how to support them better. I can tell you're a great parent.
Thank you I really appreciate you saying that 🤗🤗❤️
Please don't use folx, folks is already gender neutral. It feels preformative and frankly a bit dehumanizing to shove x's in everything to make it sound inclusive. It feels like you're saying we aren't automatically a person included in the language. Ex: humxns could be seen as implying nbs aren't human
I sooo appreciate that because I’m very bad at putting guilt trips on myself.
I absolutely type the x because it’s inclusive of neo pronouns, not to exclude anyone at all. I am non binary too, not just a performative person. Y’all been here a year. You can go they my post history. I’ve spent years as an activist and advocate. I am not performative for trying to as intersectional as possible with a single word. There are trans humanists too, so, sorry…but the x and the word folx is the biggest umbrella term and I am not going to change it because one person is speculating about what others *may* think. There are assholes actually saying we aren’t human now. No need for infighting.
I have a friend whose a mom to trans youth. I’m trying to get used to the terms but she transitioned to he pronouns and changed their name to Finn. I have absolutely no problem with something like this because like my friend I believe it is who you truly are inside “coming out” and it’s very toxic and deadly for you to suppress your true self. It can lead to something as horrible as suicide. So I’m more than ready to support anything my child throws my way I just wanted to understand things better. And have better information to give to my child in her decision and to bring up when people around us are being negative Nellys.
Wow❤️❤️❤️ You have no idea how much this words mean!!! The comfort this community has shared with me is priceless. I feel so capable now! Thank you for lifting me up with your words! I hope to be the best mom possible to my amazing child and hopefully help some lost ones along the way.
Well I Was Just A Couple Months Short Of 16 (Or Maybe A Couple Weeks... Can't Remember The Exact Time.) When I Finally Accepted That There's No Feasible Way I Could Be Cis, If That Counts. And Then Didn't ""Come Out"" Until Almost A Year Later. (I Did Kinda Like Half–Come Out To Some Internet Friends Earlier, But Ehh I Don't Really Feel Like Counting That.)
You're welcome!
Your words of support really do mean more than you know❤️ and I am taking all this advice, not just yours, very seriously. It’s good to have all this information and peoples opinions and insights. Obviously I do not have all the wisdom I need yet but I’m will to “bend” and learn.
Ahh, so happy that I could help!! 🥰♥️♥️♥️

My aunt sent me this. I didn't think she supported me but she does!		"I love that nibling is a relatively new word that is just slang and made up from crossing Niece/Nephew with ""sibling"" but is legit a perfect word and catching on with common vernacular. English is kind of amazing.
So incredibly cute, I love it! 😘
That's so sweet! It's so cool when support comes from a person you didn't expect it from.
I verbally awed. Wholesome 10/10
This is sooooo sweet and validating ! You have a lovely aunt.
Omg “nibling”!!!! That is the cutest thing ever.
~~Why Use Nibling, When You Can Just Only Speak In Italian, Where There's Only One Word For A Niece Or Nephew, Or A Grandchild?~~
So sweet, made my heart leap
Your ant seams nice
Not to be *that* person, but I don't really like ""nibling"" that much... I think I like the idea of just using both interchangeably, like how some people have multiple pronouns. One day call me your niece, next day call me your nephew. See the ensuing confusion and laugh evilly amid the chaos.

My 10 year old is nonbinary	"They told me their pronouns are they/her. I am doing my best to support them and have always considered myself a strong ally. I am trying hard to not make this about me, but I am struggling to understand and I think their dad is struggling even worse. We need help! So if you have the time to read my long post I would love your take on my situation and any advice. Even if you must drag me through the mud in the comments, I probably have it coming...

My poor kid started their period at age 9 and already  has b cup sized breasts. So before she even thought about gender or sex, her body breached the topic for us. We live in a very conservative state and since we don't match the status quo religion around here, I moved my kid to a very progressive school the same year she turned 10. The school is absolutely amazing, it is a safe place that she has thrived at. It has a unique culture- there are more LGBTQ students than cis-gendered, which is so awesome but I also worry the school may glamorize being LGBTQ just because it is such an awesome place where queer people happen to flock to. 

During back to school shopping they told me they want binders. I am so happy that they are feeling comfortable enough to tell me these things. She doesn't tell her dad or any other adult and hasn't come out to anyone but us yet. BUT I am pretty much against the binders. I told them we can get just sports bras but changing your body is a big step and I think we need to do some more research first. I told her that among this research, I think she should talk to her pediatrician about it (who I mostly trust to be accepting).

My other big problem right now is that their dad insists this is ""just a phase"". He would never say that to their face and is as cautious about pronouns as I am. But how do I get him to realise and accept that this may not be a phase? That our baby girl is a baby them and that is totally ok and changes nothing with our relationship? Of course, it could just be a phase, they are only 10 YEARS OLD! 🙃

My therapist told me that non binary is the most difficult for people to accept because humans like to categorize and place others in nice little boxes where they think they should go, non binary is two or more boxes or sometimes no boxes and the human brain struggles with that. I find myself struggling and I need to get out of the struggle to help my kid and do the right things for them. How can I do better?

Edit: I am blown away with the responses and in tears. Thank you all for your kindness and wisdom."	"> BUT I am pretty much against the binders.

I told her that among this research, I think she should talk to her pediatrician about it (who I mostly trust to be accepting).

Binders are safe and non-permanent. It is not a ""big step."" It's literally the smallest step one can take to see if having a flatter chest feels better. It's not medication or surgery. It's a piece of cloth. You take it off when you're done with it.

> My other big problem right now is that their dad insists this is ""just a phase"".

The problem here isn't that it's a phase. Everything in life is phases. You had a phase when you were single, a phase when you were childless, a phase when you were a child yourself. Those phases have ended, and new ones begun. You being a child in the past is what allowed you to be an adult today. Phases are a normal natural part of all life on Earth.

The issue is that this is used as an excuse to dismiss someone's needs. It's just a phase *so I'm not going to practice your pronouns.* It's just a phase *so I'm not buying you affirming clothes.* It's just a phase *so I'm going to ignore what you're telling me when doing so is convenient for me.*

It doesn't matter if it's a phase or not. Your kid is having this experience *now*. Regardless of how long it lasts, til death or til tomorrow, is irrelevant. Let's say your kid decides next year that they're cis. What will they have learned from their parents? From you, they'll have learned that you stand by them no matter what, that it's okay to experiment and explore the variety and complexity that life consists of, that it's okay to be themself and that being their authentic self isn't a burden or curse. From their dad, it sounds like they'll learn that they're an inconvenience, a nuisance, someone that can be dismissed because they're ""too young"" or whatever. One of these is good for your kid, and one of them isn't.

I appreciate you standing up for your kid and trying to learn how to be a good parent to them. I wish more parents approached this with the same zeal for their kid's well-being that you clearly do. Thank you for that.

We do get asked parenting questions here pretty often, so our search function may be able to give you some insights. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/nq7d9n/im_writing_a_sort_of_guide_to_parents_of_trans/) is a thread we had a while back that I bookmarked as a good general primer for parents, including my comment there.

And [here](https://queerwoodworker.com/2022/04/just-a-phase/) is a blog post about the phrase ""just a phase"" that's a little more in depth than what I wrote above.

We're always happy to answer questions. :)
hi! first just want to say you seem like a great parent :)

a lot of folks think the big numbers of queer youngsters are because it’s “cool” to be lgbtq+ but it’s really just environments allow more people to explore their queerness from an earlier age, I say this as a femme non-binary 90s kid, who from a young age knew I was queer, tried coming out at 12, again at 15, and closeted myself until my late 20s when I was more secure, had less to lose

also being queer is amazing when you *are* queer because it feels amazing to be loved and accepted for yourself

being straight/het is great when that’s who you are, it sucks when it’s forced on you! gender and sexuality is a spectrum. gender is a social construct. gender is also a lived experience. let your kid explore

your kiddo knows something about themself, and that will change over time like all kids. a binder is not a permanent choice but they can be uncomfortable and you should check about the right fit. get some sports bras as well, let your kid decide what feels right on a day to day basis

ask your husband to do some research to broaden his understanding of gender. ask him to trust that he is out of his depth at this point, and that’s okay! like anything, when you are a beginner, start some research. listen to podcasts (anything featuring Alok), check out the videos of non-binary Jeffrey Marsh, maybe watch tv with non-binary characters living life (Feel Good on netflix is maybe a start)
Binders are like push up bras. They don’t change their bodies. 

Also, there’s no such thing as “glamorizing” LGBTQ. Our world celebrates and assumes cis/heterosexuality. A space where LGBTQIA kids can be themselves authentically and be proud of it doesn’t mean it’s “glamorizing”. Stop with this homophobic idea that queer kids must be embarrassed about who they are or uncomfortable or not talk about it.
I do want to comment that binders, when sized properly and used as directed, are safe. The issue would be if your child started binding with ace bandages or wearing so many sports bras that they constrict their breathing. Binding has honestly changed my relationship to my body. I still wish I didn’t have breasts, but I can free myself from a lot of that dysphoria for a bit if I bind. You’re doing a great job already by advocating for them, and using their pronouns. Just help them explore themselves and figure out what brings them joy.
hi, OP! my name is cosmo. i'm fifteen years old, assigned female at birth, and have been identifying as non-binary for about three years. first, i want to thank you for trying your best to respect your child and their identity, and for reaching out to our community to help support them better. i understand that you may not know everything about gender or what it means to be non-binary, but it's important that you take the time to research and educate yourself before you form opinions or make decisions for your child. this is a great place to start! there are a few misconceptions that i noticed in your post, so i wanted to address them.

1. you say that you worry your child's school may be glamorizing the LGBTQ+ community. so many people believe that the reason more and more people are coming out as LGBTQ+ is because the ""lifestyle"" has been ""glamorized"" or made to be seen as ""cool"" and ""different."" in reality, it's because being queer has become much more accepted over the years, and has gained a lot of REPRESENTATION through television, social media, the internet, etc etc. your child has been operating in a space where being queer is okay, or is even considered normal. they have probably LEARNED about different identities and labels that you have not, made friends her own age who are LGBTQ+, and found a way to acknowledge how and what they are feeling about their gender identity, which i think is GREAT! she is not being PUSHED to be non-binary, she is simply being taught what it means and that it is okay if she is.

2. binders are great, especially if they have a larger chest. chest binders do nothing to physically alter one's body; they are simply a piece of clothing that compresses against the chest area, which makes it appear flatter. they are incredibly safe as long as you are wearing them properly, and there are TONS of resources to help your child w/ wearing them. i have been wearing a binder from a company called gc2b for about a year, and it has helped tremendously w affirming my gender identity and making me feel more comfortable in my body. the only issues i've ever really had w binding were shortness of breath and a little bit of acne on my back. before i had a binder, i used to layer about three sports bras to try and compress my chest, and not only was it not nearly as effective, but it also hurt a lot more and was much harder to breathe in.

3. her dad thinks that it is ""just a phase."" i hear this one a lot from people, but honestly, who cares if it's a phase? if in a few years, your child comes to you and says, ""i think i was wrong about my gender identity. i am actually ____."" what does it really matter? they aren't legally changing their name, undergoing hormone replacement therapy, or making any irreversible changes to herself or her body, so there really is no consequence to letting them explore their gender. there really isn't! it's good that people have the liberty to question and learn more about themselves, their gender identity, and their gender EXPRESSION without feeling pressured to conform to their gender assigned at birth. 

OVERALL, i think you're doing a tremendous job parenting your child. i'm so glad they felt comfortable enough to talk to you about how she is feeling, because that can be very hard to open up about, especially to a parental figure. i want you to keep educating yourself and learning about gender identity and being non-binary. i also implore you to look into gender affirming care for your child and continue having conversations about what they would like to do (w/in reason) to make themselves more comfortable.

i'll leave a few links for you to look at, and you can also DM me for more information :)

i want to add here, that binders are safe and nonpermanent and i recommend one for sure if they want one, but PLEASE make sure they fit correctly! do your research with them and get the one you think is best, but for such a young child, one from amazon or ebay can be dangerous and potentially harmful. only get ones from companies that deal specifically in binders, customized ones like shapeshifters inc or For Them are even better! it's better for them to get a real and safe binder from their parent than a dangerous one through other means if they feel desperate.
They’re likely not done developing physically. Would you consider puberty blocking medication for them? Even if this does turn out to be “just a phase”, puberty blockers would give them time to figure that out for sure before completing puberty. 

Binding done periodically is safe. Maybe not every day, maybe not 24/7, but sometimes. And puberty blockers would help prevent their breasts from growing more.
The top comment pretty much says it all but I just wanted to offer a little of my own experience on the trendy thing. When I was in high school I knew of ONE gay kid at my school of over 1500 students. At one point I really thought I was bisexual, and my (usually supportive) mom dismissed it as a phase. And at some point (after experimenting with kissing several boys) I realized that indeed I wasn't bi. I just wasn't into other boys. Huh. Go figure.

Around 32 years old, I realized I'm not a man. My mom is supportive of that thankfully, and transitioning, while difficult, has greatly improved my life and sense of self.

The thing is, when I was 14, no one *talked* about trans people. I can't help but think, maybe if I'd been given a little more room to explore my ""bi phase,"" I would have been able to figure out a little more about what my brain and body were trying to tell me but I didn't have the words for.

So, what was ""trendy"" in my case was being cis and straight, and that really affected my life in a negative way for a long time.

Sorry this was long, but I think what I'm trying to say is, whether they still id as nonbinary or not in 15 years, how the people around them react to this is going to shape a lot of their thoughts about how free they can be to express themself and explore their own identity. No matter your gender or sexuality, that's a really important thing when it comes to living your fullest life.
I just wanted to add that cisgender kids go on puberty blockers for many reasons, starting puberty too early is one reason. I think even going to the doctors out of concern that a 10 year old already has B-cup might be an easier way to get puberty blockers than requesting them because they are nonbinary.
Whether this is a phase or not, your child is going to remember. Whether this is a phase or not, your child is going to use this series of events to determine whether they come to you with things in the future. 

I told my parents I was non-binary at the age of 13, and they brushed me off. Told me it was a phase and refused to even consider helping me. 

I’m 24 now and still non-binary. I’ve been in the closet for 11 years because of my parents. And I’m going no-contact soon because of the way they treated me when I was younger. Because they made it clear they won’t accept me. 

Whatever you do, just remember that your child is a person. A person who will remember how this felt and will use it later in their life to determine how they want to go about their relationship with you.
If you deny your child a binder, you are forcing them to live with mentally damaging, prolonged states of dysphoria. Ask your therapist about what kind of damage that does. As an enby adult who had no support from my parents whatsoever in adolescence, nothing hurts more than knowing you need a thing and then knowing that you can't trust your parents enough to ask for and get it. Also, not getting your kid a binder may lead to them doing patently dangerous things like using duct tape or ace bandages (the most common harmful substitutes used).

Sometimes, it doesn't take a child long after they start school, even in a more conservative setting wherein self-expression and self-exploration are discouraged, to figure out just by being surrounded by their peers that they aren't quite the same. The locker room was a nightmare for me being forced to be around guys to whom I was attracted, my body giving me away about that, being insecure about my nakedness, having it made fun of because my body wasn't developing muscle like theirs in spite of me working just as hard... My parents thought just me being attracted to guys was a phase, so I never told them about my dysphoria. It took me until 5 years ago to make sense of and get support for my gender identity.

I saw that your husband thinks it's a phase. This phase hasn't ended for me yet. Even when our parents mean well, we can feel when we don't actually have their support. Anything that boils down to, ""It's a phase,"" is doubt, and even if your baby never says anything about it, they know. We hear our parents' whisperings beyond our closed bedroom doors regardless of how quiet they think they are. Hubby needs to get on board at least for your kid's sake.

*eta:* I said nothing about the fact that you get huge credit for being where you are and at least *listening* to your kid and *taking them seriously*. It's more than I ever hoped from my own parents in 1996.
This is going to be a long comment, I hope you don’t mind

Binders are completely safe if used and sized correctly and if you purchase from a specialized store, like gc2b (there are others but this is the one I use personally). They’re just a piece of clothing that flattens your chest, that’s all, you shouldn’t use them for more than 8 hours at a time and they must be sized correctly, if you do those things, nothing can happen and there’s no need to ask doctors (who are probably ignorant on this matter, at least most of them) unless your child has any specific conditions that would put them at risk. If your child is healthy, they’re good and they’ll be fine.

Don’t use the phase thing as an excuse to not give your child the affirming care that they need, even if it is, let it be, there’s nothing wrong with exploring your gender and your identity, if anything, it is one of the healthiest thing a person can do. Just listen to their needs, respect them and do what they ask you to do.

Aside from their chest, you haven’t mentioned about any other forms of body dysphoria, I guess it’s too late for puberty blockers because puberty has already happened but I might be wrong, maybe someone more qualified than me can give you a better explanation. Puberty blockers are basically used to delay trans children’s puberty until they have a better idea of what they’re going to do with their body. You can either start HRT after that, or you can just let your body go through puberty as it would’ve on its own, they’re completely reversible and do not cause any permanent changes to one’s body.

In conclusion, the most important thing you can do is to be 100% a safe space for your child, somebody they can blindly trust and feel good around. In order to do that you have to listen, always, aknowledge, respect their struggles and their needs and do everything that is in your power to fullfill them.  Don’t force anything that is uncomfortable for them, communicate kindly, patiently, politely and respectfully. If you don’t handle this correctly, you’ll lose your child’s trust and potentially cause them severe trauma.

Contact a gender therapist if you need (emphasis on YOU, if you’re the one struggling, or your child as well IF they’re struggling, but don’t force it if there’s no need as gender variance is not a mental illness) I say gender therapist because they’re the only ones who truly know what they’re doing when it comes to trans mental health, the others aren’t properly trained and have a higher chance of doing more damage than good.

Edit: when I said that it’s very important that binders are sized correctly, it also means that you have to regularly make sure you change the size and get bigger ones, just like for all the other clothes as your child grows, since they’re really young and their body is still developing, so remember to double chack their measurements every now and then
I'm sure it's probably in the comments somewhere, but you can get compression tops that are not as tight as a binder but will help with their dysphoria. 

 My sister is trans and in her thirties, and knew since she was single digits old. My niece is trans and knew since they were 4 or 5. My kid and I are both enby and feel like we've always known, even if we didn't have the word when we were younger, or for me as a kid in the 80's, any support. They can definitely know at their age.
My dad said it was just a phase when I was painting my nails and playing with barbies when I was in preschool. So naturally when I started dreaming about, and feeling weird when I was around certain people of the same sex, I didnt recognize it for what it was. 

If their school is giving them the tools that they need in order to recognize who they are, then I don't think it's all glam'd up as you say. As well, binders are a clothing item. They arent going to change their body for more than a few hours. You've already recognized a similarity in sports bras(not the same thing, but you're trying).

I think you're doing okay, and you're asking all the right questions... but I do think you need to be a little more open to the needs of your child. Even if it is just a phase, they're not asking for something that is going to cause changes, let alone irreversible ones.
>but I also worry the school may glamorize being LGBTQ just because it is such an awesome place where queer people happen to flock to

Even if that is what's happening here...

I grew up in a conservative bubble where being straight, Christian, and affluent were glamorized. But trying to live up to those ideals made me miserable.

*But* it took time, and trial & error to figure that out.

Teach your kid to be thoughtful, to value insight and reflection - how to empathize with others and they'll figure it all out when they need to.

.

All that said, I theorize that a *lot* more people are queer than are aware of it. It's only when we have the freedom and acceptance to explore do many of us discover it.
You sound like a very caring parent and your child is super lucky to have you on there side. But over thinking the hole non-binary thing is not going to help anyone because at the end of the day they are still your kid who you have loved for all these years and using a different pronoun isn't going to change anything. Just treat them the same way you always have.
So, um, here’s the best way that I can explain my personal experience of gender, and I cannot speak for any other nonbinary person, but it has been helpful for the people in my life.
For as long as I can remember, my life has been very structured around gender. I was raised in Texas in a Southern Baptist church to be a Souther Baptist minister. I’m 37 years old now and AMAB. When I am expected to perform a role based around my perceived gender, or listen to things that are labeled as gendered, I have always felt like I was a small child watching a play in an auditorium full of adults. All of the adults are laughing and clapping and crying alternately at the play but the play is in a language that I don’t speak. I ask the adults to interpret for me and they laugh because everyone should understand the story. But I never did.
For me, being nonbinary is about not having to speak that language any longer. Certainly, it’s made life difficult in many ways because I speak my “own” language, it that makes sense? There were many times when I was sure that it was a phase, but over the years the certainty that it wasn’t just became stronger. 
The worst that you can do by allowing your child to use a binder and using their preferred pronouns is show them that you are a parent that they can trust and who loves them enough to not only accept them but respect them. 
Even a ten year old knows their body well enough to know if it doesn’t “feel” quite right. Maybe they will change their mind and maybe they won’t, but if you are by their side, regardless, then they won’t be so scared.
Binders are safe as long as they fit properly and you avoid things like ace bandages. gc2b is a great brand to check out! There's also transtape.

It's great that you're being supportive! And to the dad, everything is in phases. Even if their identity changes, it's still best to support it. Gender and sexuality is fluid and can change, but that doesn't mean we invalidate people for it. Just support her.

This subreddit will always be available to answer questions too! I'm glad you're being supportive and trying to learn.
Even if it is a phase, so what? I’m a queer person in my twenties and I still question my gender and have tried using hey/him instead of they/them pronouns. It might be a phase but so is life. Your child might or might not change how they want to be addressed and feel but isn’t it worth displaying unconditional love regardless of their gender?
As a fellow parent who went through this with my child a few thoughts.  Your husband may be going through phases of grief because he’s losing his daughter. It took me a few months to realize that this happened to me.  He’s may be going through denial right now.  Grief, anger and acceptance might be coming too. 

When our kids are born we have all these fantasies about major events in their lives and our roles in them.  Finding out my child was non-binary trans demiboy meant a lot of those things were no longer in the horizon for me. Helping to buy a prom dress,  supporting them through a pregnancy etc…. But the reality is they are who they are.  Those things were never in the cards for my kid. My kid came out at 16. I really wish we would have known when they were younger.  

Many others have put it so well. Even if it is a phase they need your unconditional love.  One of the hard things about some people who are non binary is that what they feel can change.  Some times daily.  It’s so easy the think oh they’re changing their mind, it’s not real.  But it is real.  Cis gendered people don’t question their gender.  Even if it is a phase and they decide they are a female later, knowing that you believed them and supported them will be way more important than anything else. 

You’ve got this!  And buy the binder. It’s really no big deal.  And when you see someone one call them sir in public and they just light up, you’ll know it was worth it.
I hit puberty at the same age and my chest developed when I was 10. I remember throwing absolute FITS when I had to wear “normal bras” like “all girls do”. And the gendered clothes and short shorts and low cut tops all made it worse to the point where I just covered up my body to hide. I was told it was just a phase I would grow out of and once I was through puberty I would love my chest. Surprise, I’m now 25 years old and JUST figured out that I’m non-binary. The years of being told that I was in a “tomboy” phase halted my exploration of identity. Thankfully now I have freedom to chose what is right for my body and self expression.

My two parents can’t get their heads wrapped around this though. After 15 years they still think it’s a phase. Mine ended up being a core part of me, but even if it is a phase (because sometimes people try labels and they don’t work, which is fine) your child deserves respect and space to figure things out. No matter how much or how little they choose to explore this idea. I don’t know what you should tell their dad, but he’ll either need to get with it or deal with the fact that your kid will know not to turn to him when they are going through something.
You’re already doing a great job by being so open and listening to your kiddo, their expressions and needs. Researching binders is always a good idea, I don’t use one personally but there are many great companies out there. If I could, I would also recommend finding a good gender therapist in your area. They could help your entire family understand better what is happening, help your kiddo feel safe, and help your husband understand that this is more than likely not a phase. Children understand gender and gender expression, and know even at a young age when their gender does not match their biological sex. Just know that while it may be overwhelming now, it will get easier.
I will ad this here, as I’m not sure if it’s been said: 

Binders are generally safe, but when used incorrectly (IE too often, too long periods of time, too small, etc) it could end up bruising  your ribs and preventing top surgery in the future, if your kid so chooses to get it.

I recommend trans tape. The kind I get is on Amazon, but you can find them all over the internet. The most “injured” you can get from it is a couple scratches, but it’s more safe then a traditional binder.

You are a GREAT parent for trying to support your kid. The child may not realize it now, but having a supportive parent like yourself will benefit them so much and help their mental health. Even if they turn out to be cis, they will be thankful for the love and support they received. Not many people have that. 

If I was in your position though, I’d let them experiment. Do your own research on different ways to bind, and help them do the safest way possible for them. 

PS also tell the kiddo that a lot of NB people use two sports bras as a substitute as a binder as it’s safer generally
Everyone has already said most of what I would say as well. But I also just want to say how much I appreciate parents like yourself who want to do the best for their child and try to be supportive even if it’s personally difficult for them. It may be difficult for you but I can say without a doubt that the love and support of family makes a world of difference in the life of a queer person. I speak from personal experience as someone who did not have a supportive family growing up. So thank you for doing your best for your kid!
I know you're coming from a place of love and that you want the safety of your kid. Know that if they ask for a binder it is that they're feeling bad. If you don't provide a binder and help them research how to bind safely, they could use inappropriate stuff and risk damaging their health, and cause injuries.
I would say the safest bet is to research with them, find a good binder and just enforce rules you all agree on so that they are not wearing it to bed, to do sport or for too long.

Honestly, if it is a phase, they got a chance to explore and figure it out and that is great and super healthy for them. They are lucky to have so much support to explore themselves this young. And if it is not a phase, showing your full support is showing them they can always come to you with their concerns, that they can trust you. 
So, basically, supporting them and helping them is making you win as a parent whatever the situation is.
As others said, a binder is a temporary relief, it's not dangerous and it's not permanent so go for it using ground rules.
In regards to doctors, definitely look for doctors who have experience with trans patients, because most doctors outside of therapists, surgeons, and endocrinologists who work with trans people don’t know much about our healthcare needs. In regards to binders: they aren’t permanent, and if they fit correctly and aren’t worn for too long, they are a very safe option for an adult/older teenager. That being said, I’m not sure how safe they are for a 10 y/o whose bones are likely still changing. At the very least, I would make sure to check that the binder still fits properly on a regular basis. I definitely wouldn’t recommend wearing too-small sports bras instead of a binder, since sports bras aren’t designed to minimize the chest. I’ve definitely found that trying to bind with sports bras is more painful and unpredictable than using a binder. I’d probably recommend that they use trans tape - it doesn’t go all the way around the ribs, and its good option for someone who has a smaller chest. Also some people on here mentioned looking into puberty blockers - I’d agree with them. Puberty blockers won’t reverse or even stop your kiddo’s development, they will just slow things down and give them some time to think what kind of puberty will make them feel the most comfortable in their body. They may very well go off puberty blockers at 16 and just complete their natural estrogen puberty, but at least this will be a deliberate decision rather than something that nature forces them into. Puberty blockers are safe (as much as we can say any drug is safe), going off them is enough for puberty to pick up where it left off. They’ve been used for kids who start going through puberty way too early for quite a while, and as far as I’m aware, the only longterm side effect that we know of is that they might cause someone to end up being a bit shorter than they would have had they not taken puberty blockers.
>My therapist told me that non binary is the most difficult for people to accept because humans like to categorize and place others in nice little boxes where they think they should go, non binary is two or more boxes or sometimes no boxes and the human brain struggles with that.

Your therapist put it into words very well and I’m glad you have that support. Most of what I came here to say has already been said better, but I’ll just add that you’ve already taken some great steps and I’m sure your kiddo appreciates the love you’ve shown them already.
Y'all binders are safe for adults and older teens, but OP's child is 10. They have a TON of growing left to do, both soft tissue and skeletal. I remember rapidly changing clothing sizes when I was that age; so did my brother, so did my step kid, so does pretty much everybody. I think it would be incredibly difficult and cost-prohibitive to keep this kid in binders that are safely and correctly sized for their changing body, and I would be concerned about the effects that constant compression would have on a developing skeleton. I think talking to their pediatrician before binding is a good call, especially if they're in a trans-affirming area. It also wouldn't be a bad thing to talk about puberty blockers, since it seems like even without the gender issues, OP's child might be experiencing precocious puberty. A flat sports bra would be an excellent compromise while they're growing, though.
Looks like some great comments on here but just wanted to pop and and say my child she was assigned female at birth is 10 and non binary so if you ever need an ear feel free to
Message me :) . 

We found a trans youth group that was amazing it functioned over zoom and then in person as well and it allowed me to learn a lot. Like hormone blockers aren’t as scary has some have made them out to be and that gender can be fluid for some.
I don’t have experience with the specific body issues that your kid has to deal with, nor do I have experience with parenting, so please take that into account when assessing my advice. That your looking for ways to help and support them is awesome; at the end of the day having people around us that support and accept us is important (with us being “people” just as much as “LGBTQ+ people”).  


As far as binders are concerned, some caution is reasonable from my understanding. If used inappropriately, with wearing them for prolonged periods of time without breaks and during exercise being the times I’m most aware of, there is the potential for injury. That being said, when used following the guidelines that are out there and by listening to your body for the signs of problems before they become severe, they can be of great benefit and value. Think about it like medication: as long as you follow the dosages and timing for it - eg the medication might be “no more than *x* pills *y* times a day, don’t eat for an hour after taking it”, whereas the binder might be “wear it for no more than *x* hours at a time, don’t wear it while sleeping or any time heavy breathing is likely” - then any problems are unlikely to pop up, and will be manageable if they do.  


I want to talk about the glamorise/phase issue, because it’s the kind of thing that pops up in a lot of places and has the potential to be magnified and distorted by both pro- and anti-LGBTQ+ people. As a few people I’ve seen here have already said, it’s possible that despite your kid saying that they’re nonbinary now they may come to realise something different somewhere down the track. Maybe they’ll work out a more specific category of nonbinary-ness that applies to them (agender, demigender, genderfluid/flux, the list goes on….), maybe they’ll realise they’re trans, or maybe they’re cis and whatever feelings they had that led them to nonbinary were actually signs of some other element of their life. That they’re physically developing earlier than the other kids around them may be a factor that makes them feel like an outsider, wishing they weren’t the way they are physically that has morphed into a desire to not be as feminine presenting. Maybe this otherness feeling goes away as other kids start to go through the same sort of changes, but maybe it doesn’t. (I was the opposite, desperate to start shaving to show I was an adult, which I think at least somewhat got connected with the latent wish to not be a boy, resulting in wanting to be a man, until 20 or so years later realising that wanting to be an adult and not wanting to be a boy didn’t in my case mean being a man but being a nonbinary adult.) It’s also possible that they’re right on the money with what they’ve already told you: that they’re nonbinary and will identify exactly that way for the rest of their life. Regardless of any of that whether this is a temporary phase of their life or not, it’s real for them here and now. If there was a movie coming out that they wanted to see because it has their favourite actor, or it’s of a genre they enjoy, or based on some other property that they love… regardless of the reason they like it now, you wouldn’t deny them seeing it because they *might* like something else in the future.  


I’m not going to deny that kids can be influenced, and certainly will want to emulate people that they like and think are cool. Having said that though, they also often understand a lot more than we tend to give them credit for. Whether or not that understanding is as nuanced as it might be in an adult, and whether or not they can articulate that understanding as fully as an adult that tries to drop in words like “articulate” into a reddit post, they still get stuff. Is it possible that there’s a person or a group at the school that your kid thinks is just completely awesome, who happens to be nonbinary that they’ve latched onto and want to be like, and so they’ve decided to be nonbinary too? Yes it is. But if it’s just a form of hero worship, why did they latch onto that aspect of this person and not something else? It’s likely that there’s some aspect of themselves that connects with that idea.  


It’s easy to look around and see that there are more people identifying with more terms under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. More people are openly gay, more people openly transition from their gender assigned at birth to their actual gender, more people are changing their names and announcing their pronouns… more people are being open about who they actually are rather than who their “supposed” or expected to be. At face value, it wouldn’t be crazy to think that there was a fad element to all of this, and it wouldn’t surprise me if there were a handful of people out there who claim to be something they’re not for ingenuine reasons. But a big factor in this apparent explosion in the numbers of LGBTQ+ people is that more people are seeing that it’s okay to be who you are in more places, that there is less stigma and more support (though neither of those are where they should be yet), and that people are seeing more possibilities. There are so many aspects and moments of my life that I look back on now and can see that we’re signposts to me being nonbinary, but I had no idea about it as a concept for the vast majority of my life. I first came across someone in media several years ago, and when they introduced themselves as being nonbinary and using they/them pronouns I had no idea what that meant. I was in my 30s when I first encountered the concept. A few years later I’d come to realise that that’s who I was, and so many of those past moments made a whole lot more sense.  


You can see the same sort of trend (a term I’m using in the mathematic/analytical sense rather than the style/fashion sense) with left-handedness: there was a period of time where the number of left-handed people was sharply increasing, but then it plateaued and has been fairly steady since. It wasn’t that it became popular or a fad, it was that it stopped having the association with being bad and wrong and evil, so people stopped being forced to be right-handed, which allowed people to just be themselves. (In this aspect at least.) The experts that actually study these things say the same thing about queerness today: as fewer people are actively against us, with more people being of not actively supporting and accepting then at least no worse than being indifferent to us, more people are able to feel comfortable to be out as themselves. The more people who are out, the safer it feels for others to come out. The more openly things are discussed, the more possibilities are understood, the more opportunities there are for people to have a better understanding about themselves.  


Let your kid lead you in this, while telling but more importantly showing them that you love and support them. If they’re comfortable with it, talk with them about how they came to their realisation. If they’re name is particularly associated with a gender, ask them about whether there’s a shortened form/nickname that they might prefer to be used (eg “Sam” instead of “Samantha”/“Samuel”), and whether they want you to use a particular name/pronouns in certain circumstances. This is particularly important given you’d said they’d not come out to anyone else yet, as outing them before they’re ready is a huge no-no. Are there other gendered words that they are comfortable/uncomfortable with? At the end of the day, you know your kid better than we will. You’ll be better placed to know if they want it shouted from the rooftops or treated like it’s nothing.  


Good luck to them and to you in all of this!
Everyone here has already mentioned that binders are safe when purchased in the correct size, I just want to add that by telling your kid that they can’t wear a binder for now you are leaving them to wonder if a binder might make her feel better with her body as opposed to just giving the binder a try so they can know how it feels. It’s possible they might try on a binder and realize it’s actually not for them, or they might love it. They can’t know how they’ll feel unless you give them a chance to try, and some day hopefully they will appreciate your willingness to accommodate them when they were trying to figure themselves out.
I wouldn’t suggest a binder for a kid that young. Rib growth is incredibly necessary and you don’t want to get in the way of that. Binders are 99% safe but having an option that’s 100% safe, go with the 100%. I would buy your kid a compressive but safe sports bra, considering that they’re a small cup size and should be able to get results they’ll like. If they don’t like the results they get, spectrum binders are designed to be safe for the ribs, but that should be your plan B. 

It very well could be a phase. They could realize that their dysphoria was simply discomfort with a changing body, and that they prefer to present in a gender-nonconforming way. You know what’s the worst thing that happens if you support their identity? They realize about themself that they aren’t trans, and they know they have your support no matter who they are. If they come out as gay, or have scary news, or don’t want to go to college, they’ll think back to when they were 10 and their parents supported who they may have been. They’ll trust you more than they would if you’re unsupportive. 

The best thing that happens if you support their identity is they realize young who they are. Personally, as a trans person who hit puberty young, (eight or nine, like your kid!) I felt dysphoria when I started puberty that has only gotten stronger as I got older. Having the support of my parents meant the world to me. They didn’t always understand, but knowing they cared meant I had a place I knew I was safe. 

Talk with your kid about their feelings. Ask how long they’ve been feeling how they feel. Talk about ways you want to fix their hard feelings. Do they want a haircut? Do they want some new, more neutral clothing? I’d suggest trying the use of they/them pronouns more. I’m aware they use they/she, but you mostly used she in the original post. That’s okay! It takes time to get used to a change. But it will really mean a lot to your kid if you put the effort in, and take the time it needs. 

I recommend the books “How to They/Them” by Stuart Getty and “Life Isn’t Binary” by Meg John-Barker and Alex Iantaffi if you’d like to understand non-binary identity better. Even if your kid turns out to be cis later in life, you understand the world around you a little better! 

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. I really appreciate when folks ask questions to be better ally’s.
Edit for formatting, sorry for the long reply!
Binders aren’t a permanent thing. Think of them as a sports bra that flattens out the chest even better! Just make sure they don’t wear it longer than 8 hours. As for it being a phase, it’s possible your child may realize that they are cis, or maybe they turn out to be trans. Or agender. Whatever the case, you need to stand by them, and support them! I wish my parents were as accepting as you! You’re doing a good job so far!
As someone who had almost this exact experience growing up in the Bible Belt, but kept quiet about it to be safe, I’d have absolutely felt so much better with a binder back then. By the time I was in 4th grade I had a huge chests, and one of my teachers even told me I needed to wear a bra, when at the time I couldn’t find anything that didn’t hurt or that fit properly. 

A binder would be a fantastic help for your kiddo, and it’s not permanent or harmful, so long as you choose the correct size and make sure they’re not wearing it 24/7, as in taking breaks, not wearing it to sleep, etc.
Hey, I'm a non-binary LGBTQ+ activist also from an uber-conservative state. I'm going to just answer some of your questions/concerns in list form here. It's a long reply, but I want to answer each concern as thoroughly and correctly as possible.

1) When working on education or asking questions, don't get too caught up in guilt about not doing better or getting dragged through the mud. Nobody's born knowing everything, and in terms of education on gender and identity, good resources to learn are few and far between. Don't take not knowing things personally, all it'll do is stress you out and make things harder than they are.

2) Getting your kid to a socially progressive school environment is a very good thing. It'll likely have problems like all schools do, but any way to minimize the amount of transphobia your kid might experience is good at their age. As for the school ""glamorizing"" being LGBTQ+, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Kids always fixate and get super-invested in things at that age, whether it's dinosaurs and astronauts or cartoons and Pokemon. Fixating on being LGBTQ+ has some difficulties that other fixations don't, due to how prevalent transphobia is right now, but so long as your kid has a community to support them they'll be as fine as they can. I'd recommend seeing if there's a PFLAG chapter in your area; it's a support group for parents of LGBTQ+ people.

3) Binders are an item of clothing used to make a person's chest look flat while the binder is on. They're only dangerous if worn too tightly for too long at a time, but in the same way that regularly wearing shoes that are too small can mess up your feet. It might take some trial and error to find the right size, but once you do they're no more dangerous than wearing a tie to work everyday.

4) I can't give specific advice on what to say to your kid's dad, since I'm an internet stranger and don't know him or his personality. That said, in my experience, I think the question of whether it is or isn't a phase is kind of irrelevant. Gender, like every part of a person's identity, isn't a static thing that's the same at all times in all parts of the world. Arguably, every point in life is a phase; a person will likely be wildly different at ages 10, 20, and 40. **The thing to focus on is that your child is still the same kid; the word to describe them just changed.** Maybe it is a phase, maybe it isn't; at the end of the day it's still the same kid you both seem to love and care deeply about.

Let me know if this helps!
Okay so binders aren’t permanent but I totally agree with discussing things with a doctor first. Non-binary might be a stepping stone for your kid or it might be their home either way that is for them to figure out in their own time. It sucks that your husband is skeptical but I suggest reading some books on the subject, even if he doesn’t say it to the kid’s face the kid will most likely be able to pick up on his attitude.
first of all, your curiosity and eagerness to learn and understand is very heartwarming to me. don’t let your fear of getting things wrong get in the way - i’m nonbinary and i got it wrong when i was first starting out. it’s part of being a human and it’s obvious you want to support your child…that’s what matters the most. they’re incredibly lucky. i knew i was nonbinary at 7 but didn’t know there was a term for it at the time, which caused a lot of pain and confusion. your kid is lucky they have access to the knowledge that’s more mainstream now.

it all boils down to assessing and restructuring the way you’ve viewed gender all your life. it’s hard to understand this if you haven’t completely reframed your view of gender. it’s a construct. it’s something we’ve made and something that’s enforced. gender isn’t sex; it has nothing to do with genitals. ask yourself what makes a woman a woman and a man a man. intersex people exist, a lot more people are intersex than you think! it requires you to disassemble society’s view of gender in your mind, that’s what makes people so uncomfy. it also takes time.
there’s a podcast called Gender Reveal that talks about gender and how much of a social construct gender is. they have an episode called Gender 101 and highly suggest.
I was given this advice when I was in college and one of the members of our GSA asked what to do when their parent is struggling.

Your child struggled to figure out who they are. And you knew them for 10 years as one way. Don't beat yourself up. You're doing great by supporting them and respecting them. And if it takes time, that's totally fine. The important part is you're actively trying. You've even on here asking for help and to see if what you're doing it right. You're a great parent. I'm sure your kid knows it.
Binders aren’t a “big step” or “something that will change their body”. A binder is the smallest step you can possibly take with starting a transition. They aren’t permanent and do not cause any problems, unless worn while exercising or while worn in bed.
my thoughts while reading:a binder isn't going to change their body any more than spanx changes yours. my spouse was kinda cautious with a binder at first with our trans son, but we asked our kid's doctor and he said it was physically fine (when worn carefully- not during exercise, no more than 8 hours a day, take good breaks from it, take it off if it doesnt feel right etc) and we got him the [https://www.gc2b.co/](https://www.gc2b.co/) binder and he only wears it sometimes, but it works very well.

impermanence doesn't imply insignificance, even if it is just a phase. Your kiddo is ALWAYS going to remember how you treat them with this, they came to you and told you something very important to them, and this is going to define how much they trust you for the rest of their life. If you call them by the right name and pronouns, let them dress how they want and present how they want, and they DO change their mind... in ten years, it will not matter at all. There will be no long term harm that comes from respecting your child, and they will see that you are on their side, and supporting them.

&#x200B;

Edit: you might also find some resources and people going through similar things on r/cisparenttranskid , I'm nonbinary myself, so not entirely a ""cis parent"", but I still find a lot of good on there!
Apologies if this has already been said. But I think the invalidation of ""it's just a phase"" is actually something that prevents young people from genuinely and holistically exploring their gender identities. Like, if someone says ""it's just a phase"" you're going to do everything you can to prove to them it isn't. So if you have some doubts about your identity, instead of exploring them you will shut them out because if you do change as a result of those doubts you will be confirming this premise.  
One of the things I learned about gender in my experience of coming out to myself and others as an adult was that the best way to figure out what I really wanted was to try things and see how they felt. I had the respect and understanding of the people around me, and that made it easier to try things like wearing new types of clothes, exploring makeup, using they/them pronouns etc. What I found in that experience was that I knew pretty clearly when something was or wasn't right for me. But if I felt like not being sure about everything was going to suggest to others that I ""wasn't serious"" about being nonbinary, it would've been harder for me to be honest with myself about various things. 

I think when you're exploring these things as a kid it's gotta be fundamentally difficult. Your parents may want the best for you, but they also want to ""protect"" you from the danger of not conforming to a particular gendered ideal. There is a grain of truth in that parental impulse, which is that it is safer to be cis than to be trans in this world for a whole number of reasons (obviously the big one is transphobia); however, you cannot ""make"" someone cis or trans. This form of ""protection"" really only holds people back from exploring their identities open-heartedly. 

I may be over stepping here because I have never been a parent. But what I would wish for myself is to have had a space within my family to explore who I really was (even the things that sat outside the bounds of my assigned gender). The idea of queerness as an either/or is a construct that I think makes this incredibly difficult, so it is really important to make sure your kid knows that there's no threshold they need to pass to identify a certain way. Your own identity as a queer person can take the shape of who you are, and it doesn't have to match up to a specific term or label; a label is a tool that can streamline the way you describe yourself to other people, but it is not a container that you need to fit neatly into. 

As is always the case, I have gotten ramble-y here. There are certainly more coherent and focused replies. But I hope you (or anyone else reading) can take some morsels out of this.
I wish I had the vocabulary for non-binary and other queer terms when I was OP’s kid’s age. 

You can see the non-binary screaming through my childhood pictures as I flip flopped from acceptable conservative WASP nest looks and what was actually comfortable and made me happy. 

Don’t be surprised when you’re asked about top surgery. I developed fast and the world is cruel to large breasted people.
The best thing you can do is support them, whether or not you personally feel comfortable with it. Because here's the thing: your kiddo may only be 10 years old, but ultimately they are the one who knows themself the best.

Up until this point and whether or not you knew it, you've played a large role in determining your kid's identity. You saw them as the gender assigned to them at birth and that was that. Now, your kid doesn't need you to do that for them anymore. They're maturing. They're moving into the next stage of life where they are becoming more intellectually and bodily autonomous. They're weighing what they've previously been told about themself with what they actually feel, and they've found out that it doesn't fit them. That comes with a real sense of loss for you, both from having to deal with the actual change your kid is going through, but also because you're confronting that they're not quite so much of a child anymore. But at the end of the day, this situation isn't about you and your needs. This is about your kid and what they need. They're telling you what they need. So listen to them. Let them have the things they need. 

Even if you don't like the idea of them wearing a binder, binders don't actually hurt the human body in any way. And if it is a ""phase,"" (which I don't think it is either) your kiddo will stop wearing them on their own. You have nothing to lose from getting them one, and the support that you show by loving them unconditionally will do so much more for your relationship than if you try to lay down a line that forces them to be something that's not who they truly are.
People have added a lot of great comments to this, so I won't reiterate what they've said. But I have to stress: your child will likely bind whether or not you get them binders. Think of it like sex education (obviously, there is nothing sexual about being transgender, but this is my closest example). People will have sex whether or not you give them sex education and/or access to contraceptives. The difference is that one way is **safer and controlled,** while the other can be **very, very dangerous.** Buying your child a binder will virtually eliminate the possibility that they break a rib binding with ace bandages because you wouldn't buy them a safe, fitted one.
I'm just surprised that they are having their period now, so idk if binders might be big or not. But even I'm waiting for one and I'm a teen. I just suggest do your best to help that growing kid best you can
even if it is a phase, you should still respect your child’s wishes. people go through phases all the time, what’s the harm in using different pronouns or a new name for a while. being unsupportive of them coming out will only make them want to rebel

Hi, non-binary person here. I first expressed that I was gender non conforming when I was in the 4th grade. Was not in a safe environment to fully express myself until adulthood. I am going to offer a bit of perspective. It is probably going to come across as a bit harsh, in all honesty. 

You call yourself an ally then spend the rest of your post trying to justify not adapting to the changes your child has asked you to make (pronouns, comfort in physical appearance). Have you even taken the time to research this at all before coming to reddit? Yes, it may take some time for you to mentally process your kids new pronouns, but it is important that you at least try, which you haven't done on here. Binders are not permanent, and there are a lot of companies that make a safe product or that can be used. Since they are so young I would probably suggest more of a compression top type binder (for them and tomboyx make some good ones), but for a full  binder as long as they are measured correctly, bought from a good company, and not over used (no binding for more than 8 hours, don't wear it overnight) they are completely safe and non permanent. Some good brands are gc2b, Underworks, and spectrum. Don't buy anything with clasps on it for a binder and don't buy off Amazon. 

As for the rest- yeah it may not be the identity they will stick with all their lives, but the way you and your husband act now will impact them the rest of their lives. The suicide risks for LGBT kids who have parents that are unsupportive are through the roof, and as much as you can say with your words that you are an ally, you need to show that with your actions as well. Just using a kids chosen pronouns and correct names significantly decreases the amount of suicidal ideation and attempts they will experience in their lifetime. It could be a phase. It probably isn't, as most people I know who have experienced gender dysphoria and are trans knew when they were their age. But it isn't your call to determine if it is a phase or not. If you react negatively when you think it is 'just a phase' you may find yourself with a kid who has broken off contact with you as an adult because you are no longer trusted with information with their life. 

I would challenge you, if you are an ally to unpack that mentality. It is incredibly dismissive and kind of homophobic to hold on to 'its just a phase' and keep that in your vernacular.
I think nonbinary is hard for people to wrap their heads around because gender is not a feeling, it's a knowing. In psychology, they teach you that there are 5-6 feelings. Joy, disgust, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise. You don't feel male or female or nonbinary, you \*know\* you are. While focusing solely on their internal sense of gender, it is VERY hard for cisgender people to describe that internal sense. If you ask yourself ""how do you know you are a man/woman? what does it feel to be a man/woman?"" you'll find it hard to answer. However, when asked ""when did you know you were male/female?"" you likely knew very very young. 

The best way I can describe it is this: ""I was raised a girl but I always knew that neither boy nor girl was the right way to describe me.""

The main thing I want all young non-binary people to have is acceptance from parents that let them explore and make gender presentation choices at their own pace. If they want to change their clothes, hair, name, wear a binder...etc. whatever. Cis people can do all that too there's no reason why it should only be allowed if the child is ""truly"" trans.

It's okay if they ""glamorize"" LGBTQ positivity at the school. I \*like\* who I am. Liking me means liking and embracing all of me, the nonbinary part included. It is not at all something to be ashamed of or hide. Being nonbinary allows me a great sensation of gender freedom and a unique perspective and open-mindedness that allows me to be more understanding and kind to others. This is something I like about myself. And there is nothing wrong with thinking you are nonbinary and then changing your mind. Gender exploration is allowed and provides people with valuable insights. 

The biggest fuck up my family made when I ""came out"" was that because I can hide who I am, they encouraged me to and never spoke of it again. I don't think we've talked about it for years. They wanted me to keep my name, my clothes, and my pronouns. Never to talk about it. And to live in stealth mode my whole life, never having a moment of gender euphoria anywhere but in private all by myself. The better move would have been to say to their child ""this is your life. what do YOU want?""

If it's a phase then so what? I bet you my parents still think being pansexual and nonbinary was a phase I went through in my teenage years because I present female and have boyfriends now. It's not. I've known that neither boy or girl describe me best since I was 5 years old. And of course, while my parents see that I have had a boyfriend, they don't see the gay things I get up to lol.

I was asking people how I could be made into a boy when I was 10. If I had known back then what non-binary was, if I had known there were opportunities to explore, I would have been over the moon excited! I present female because I like looking professional and put together and can't do that well with a masculine look because of my body type, even if I get top surgery. I'm never going to pass as androgynous or male and that doesn't matter. On the inside, my gender identity hasn't changed. I changed my name when I was 14 and I LOVE my new name. Every time someone has said it for the past 10 years you can just see me glow with gender euphoria. I gained confidence I never had.

The best thing is to just let your kid explore, and support the exploration. If you want to help yourself understand mentally the best thing to do is to read books and watch some docuseries on Youtube about parents raising gender-expansive children. There are actually a lot on there. That really really helped me when I was going through this when I was a teen. 

Also, it's best to order chest binders that are made for this type of thing. You can learn about safety with chest binders so that they aren't motivated to DIY it with tape or ace bandages or whatever else is lying around your house because that will cause problems.
I was 8 when I went through puberty and it was horrific and I'm left with lasting trauma due to how it related to my non-binary gender. I understand this is difficult, but your child NEEDS support and access to treatment such as binders and puberty blockers (if they desire; they might just benefit from them due to their precocious puberty regardless of gender identity. I'm abnormally short due to my precocious puberty) to prevent further damage to their body. Being forced to be a woman (especially when you're not one) that young is really, really difficult. My DMs are open if you're curious to hear more specifics about my experience with precocious puberty and being nonbinary. 

I highly recommend reaching out to PFLAG as a family to help understand what's going on in order to provide your child with the care that they need. Their dad especially. Be prepared to defend your child as ferociously as needed, listen to them, and provide them emotional and physical support. Even if this is a phase (recent data shows that in trans kids with a median age of 8, 92% of them remain their real gender identity into adulthood) wouldn't you want your child to know that they can come to you for anything and remain loved and supported? PFLAG had resources for families like you and can likely help you and their dad with the final hangups you may have. It saved my partner her relationship with her mom (the dad wasn't able to be open minded and she had to cut him off after he stopped participating unfortunately,) I highly recommend it.
I recommend getting them a safe binder that’s properly sized otherwise they might bind with improper materials that WILL damage the ribs and lungs. Either way your kid will probably end up binding, it’s better to give them the safer resources. Idk if it is a phase or not, but it probably doesn’t matter because being there and supportive in the moment is all that does matter. My mom bought me my first binder, and I still wear them (I’m 23), they’ve never damaged my body. I can even workout in them. Just leave it to 8~10 hours of wearing, so maybe only at school. Glad your kid feels safe with you btw.
Good luck

So many of these comments say everything better than I ever could but on the topic of binders I do want to chime in. Peruse around the nonbinary subreddits  a little more for binder recs (r/ftm and r/trans have some too). I've seen a lot of posts about gc2b not being good quality anymore and I know for a fact that they run small. I've heard good things about forthem (which looks more like a sports bra) but I haven't tried them. I personally swear by underworks.

As long as the binder isn't used during activity like sports or exercise it's as safe  (and less uncomfortable than) a bra. I wear one all day, every day and have done for a few years. Because of the all around compression, getting used to it a little at a time is important so taking breaks is key
I'd say it is smart to stick to sports bras for now, and maybe if they still feel the need for a binder then get it. As for your husband saying it's just a phase, I'm not really sure how to help there but maybe explain that even if it is a phase, it's still who they are now and time will tell
Binders.. don't change your body. That's pretty much the whole point. They're for trans, nonbinary, and gender non conforming youth and teens to feel more comfortable in their own skin without making irreversible changes in case they decide they wish to present more feminine when they're older. Let your kid get a binder. If you're worried about it causing damage, buy one that's adjustable.
Binders are perfectly safe and will not change your child's body permanently any more or less than a sports bra (a lot of us wish...) The only thing that causes permanent changes are hormones, and even not *all* those changes are permanent; obviously, ten may be a bit young to be taking T. If your child is having some body issues, I'd talk to your pediatrition about potentially hormone blockers; as far as I know, this just hits the ""pause"" button on puberty. With the fact they've already gotten their period and developed a chest, I'm not positive what benefits it has - I'm not a doctor and I didn't figure out I was NB until I was wellllll past puberty. 

As for your husband, it's perfectly fine for him to currently be under the impression that it's ""just a phase"" as long as he's still using proper pronouns and respecting your child. Could it just be a phase? Sure. But I also urge you both to come to terms with the fact that it's most likely not. 

As far as I can tell, your child isn't asking for anything life-changing. Get them a binder and support them in any way you can. And if you're not sure how, feel free to ask them. It's okay.
binders are completely safe and non-permanent. it's the same concept as getting her a push up bra, except they're going for the opposite look. it doesnt change anything, it's just a garment of clothing
You’re amazing for this, binders as safe for their body as long as they are worn correctly so make sure you teach her about how to safely wear one. :)

First I’m so glad that you are so supportive but I do have some suggestions to make both of y’all more comfortable😁
1.you can talk to them yourself and just ask them questions, like “I suppose you and id like to know more about how you feel so me and your father can better support you” or something like that
2. I am glad you didn’t dismiss the idea of binders completely because if can very much help their gender dysphoria which comes with a lot of non binary or trans people. Sports bras are a great start. And when y’all are both comfortable u can do some more research on binders since they’re relatively safe if you know how to wear them, I would suggest not putting binders off the table.
3. I think it would make your kid super happy if you could talk to their father to made sure he won’t say anything he’ll regret. I myself am non binary minor and I know what little things a parent can say that will stick with their child for a lot time. So try to educate their dad to try to be more supportive.

I honestly think you are doing an amazing job though, because you are trying. And that is the best you can do sometimes , and using their pronouns, going to therapy, and asking how you can improve yourself, you are being such a great parent !! 😁❤️

Good luck to you both !!!
If they want binders, you can get them some! They want to experiment with their looks, and a binder is really just a piece of clothing for those who want to have a try at a flat chest.

The LGBTQIA+ thing is not a phase, it wasn't a phase, and it will never be a phase! As a no-box nonbinary person, I say let them experiment with looks so that they can find out what look fits them best!

Me, I haven't gone to find a binder yet, but I want to try it sometime!
Much of what I’d like to say has already been commented on below but I do wanna say that I run a project that gives binders to people for free! Unfortunately it’s limited to the state and city we serve BUT i also give educations on the safeties of binders, wear and care, tips, do’s and dont’s as well as answering any questions and most importantly as well: how to FIND the right binder in terms of style, ability, and measurements. You are more than welcome to message me and I’d be happy to give the run down. Much info is on reddit and online as well and redundant but also varies some and I’ve condensed all that when giving educations. My DM’s are open or you can always email projectbinderfinder@gmail.com and I can provide a list of resources as well.
Even if it's just a phase, we go through many of them and all of them should be respected.
I was deep in the closet as a teenager because it was ""too early"" to express myself. Right now my mom also dismisses my identity because ""it's too late"" to change.

There is no ""right time"" to understand yourself, your child may choose a lot of ways to explore their identity. Maybe even they are seeing themselves as nonbinary because early puberty pushes us into a gendered role we are often aren't ready to embrace. It's awkward, it's uncomfortable, and they might feel they should be ""just a kid"" for a while longer.

You probably remember how scary is to ""become a woman"". If you grew up in a more conservative household you might have seen your parents becoming suddenly serious, having ""well so you're not a child anymore"" talks. It's a huge pressure that comes from changes you cannot control.

Just let your child be whoever they want to be. Respect the way they want to approach and embrace their own body and image. Help them feel comfortable and confident. If it's just a phase, that's okay.
Can I ask why you’re against binders? The only thing I can think of is a concern for safety which I understand, but all you have to do is talk to them about how to use it properly. 

Make sure they don’t wear it more than 8 hours a day, take a couple (or more) days off from wearing it each week, and don’t exercise in it. Tell them the dangers of not following those rules so they understand. Properly measure them to assure you’re getting them the right size binder. I can’t think of any reason to be against it as long as you use it properly?
First, since I saw you mention binders being something you're against, as long as it's used sensibly and you buy the right kind of binders, they're completely safe (personally I use GC2B ones, they're amazing to me and I like to use them as shirts sometimes too!). Usually, when binding, it shouldn't be used for more than 8 hours, and there should be some breaks between uses (e.g. 3 days on, 2 days off, but it's whatever works best for your child).

In terms of explaining non-binary, try seeing gender like a Venn diagram. One circle for male, one circle for female, and an overlap for some non-binary folks, and others can exist outside of all the circles.

So far, you're doing a great job with helping your kid. You're actually using her pronouns and they're comfortable enough around you to open up about what they feel like they need to have to feel comfortable. Try researching binder companies that are safe to wear while also being affordable, and feel free to ask any more questions here. I'm sure there's plenty of us to help!
Be supportive. I’m learning too as a parent and have a long way to go.  Whether this is their authentic identity or a ‘phase’, being supportive is the best approach.  I see a lot of girls my daughter’s age identifying as they/them/she/her.  At some level they are rejecting the notion and expectations that the binary concept of womanhood brings.  Whether that is their authentic identity or they’re ‘pumping the brakes’ so so speak from a place of anxiety in their perception of an over-sexualized society that they aren’t prepared to engage in… it’s all good.
Well, getting a binder would not change her body. It would just make her chest appear smaller. Only difference between sports bras and binders is the binders making the breast appear smaller than sports bras, and wearing sports bras would probably make her feel more dysphoric.

Also, their dad can’t assume that it’s just a phase. It’s try that sometimes people can be confused, and realize that they really are cuz. They are also a child, but if they truly feel like that, then it wouldn’t just be a phase. No one should tell her it’s just a phase or something like that, and people should always support her, no matter what they realize to be
You're a great parent, and you're doing really well. You're using your kid's pronouns, and letting them express who they are. From a non binary person whose parents didn't let them do these things... Thank you. ❤️ 

I work in mental health, and one of the biggest protective factors for trans and non binary youth is having people use their pronouns and chosen name. It's also widely recognized by LGBTQIA positive mental health providers that the only treatment for gender dysphoria is allowing people to transition. It's important that you let your kid explore their gender and access what she needs to do this!! 

As far as binders go, there is a safety concern, especially since she is young and still growing. I would encourage you to do some research on binder safety and communicate with your kid about how they can bind safely. I recommend GC2B binders! The ones with books like bras can be very dangerous. It's also important that they don't wear their binder for too long a stretch at a time! Please do your research, but as others have pointed out, binders will not permanently change your kids body unless worn improperly. They won't stop breast development, but they can lead to rib injuries if they don't fit well or are worn too long. I highly highly recommend you buy your kid binders and make this an open topic. If their breasts make them feel uncomfortable, they'll likely find a way to bind them, and it may not be safe. Also trust me, when you see how happy they are when their body looks the way they feel inside, the joy is contagious. 

As far as your husband's outlook goes, this kind of thinking is invalidating and harmful. The truth is, your kid might realize down the road that they're not non binary. They may be trans masculine, a trans man, cisgender, or simply queer. That's ok though!!! The important thing is that they're allowed to explore that and allowed to find relief from the gender dysphoria they're feeling. The damage done by not allowing them to transition if they are trans could be grave. If they aren't trans and this is just something they're exploring, the worst that happens is that they learn something about themselves... What's the harm in that? 

The Trevor Project is a mental health and suicide prevention organization that has lots of wonderful resources on supporting trans and non binary youth! I recommend checking them out and reading up on these topics!

While many people have already said this, I definitely encourage you to do more research on binding! It’s perfectly safe as long as you’re using a properly fitted binder and don’t wear it for too long at once, doesn’t permanently alter your body, and ultimately is way safer than not binding might be — if someone who experiences chest dysphoria doesn’t have access to a real binder, their dysphoria is likely to feel even more crushing and they may resort to using things like ace bandages to bind, which CAN be dangerous. Binding is a completely non-permanent way of managing dysphoria and is perfectly safe when done correctly.
I'm nonbinary. I always felt out of place in any gendered activity. I assumed this was how every body felt. I assumed it was normal to feel like I want to die when being told about being a girl and what girls are supposed to do and not do. At age 10 I realized this pain was because of having to by boy or girl and wishing I could opt out. Never had any concept of anything queer so I just went on assuming life was painful for everyone and at 12 I started regularly praying for God to kill me sooner. 

Learning as an adult some people reject being a boy or girl let me know there was a way to live life and not be in pain. 

If your kid seems excited, it's probably because it's pain avoidance, not because it's ""glamorized."" For every person that openly supports us there are 2 more that are openly against us. 

I understands it is confusing. Sometimes we're confused to. I'm confused as to how to wear my hair so I don't feel like a liar pretending to be a woman (I wish I was bald.) 

But please try to do what helps your child feel better. Because if you reject it there is a high chance you would be directly causing them pain. I think you don't want to cause pain
Hello, im max, a masc leaning nonbianary kid
I just wanna say you are an absolutly amazing parent for being so open as to hear our thoughts on how to help you understand this

Im assigned female at birth and i presented as such for many years. I only came out as nonbianary to my own mother as recent as a couple of years ago but i understand the fear of your child trying to change their bodies as such a young age. Or at least, the idea of them trying to change

Ill be honest, this story really hits close to home for me, i started puberty in the begining of 5th grade, and while gender identity wasnt a concept i was very familiar with nor cared to be, I did suffer from major dysphoria for years. I grew up in a mostly liberal but Very cis/het town, i never had anyone queer in my life to refer my experience to till midway through middle school. But even before then i was finding ways to keep my chest pinned down in very unhealthy ways.

Dysphoria doenst come from just wishing to be like ones peers, and it can be very dangerous. 
I tried to come out as a trans man to my mom when i was twelve, but all i really wanted at the time was just to have a binder.

Naturally she was just as scared as you are now, of me hurting my body, not only because i was growing but i also had asthma as well and she refused to entertain the idea of any kind of binding.
In the end i hadnt been able to wear a properly fitting bra for years until very Very recently. I still have the sports bra from middle school that would lock up my ribs and kept me from breathing deeply.
It was never a fun experience, and i didnt tell anyone for years. Anxiety and dysphoria can make you do a lot of things, especially when you feel isolated in that experience

But theres so many more resources out there now that i never got to have. And as everyone says, there are safe ways to properly bind ones chest without risk as long as everything fits properly
And even that little bit of acknowledgment and opportunity grow can mean so so so much
Perhaps it is a phase, but thats what we as humans do. We try different things, some work out and some dont, and we forge out identities through. Those expirences
And i think giving your child the space to learn and grown into whatever it is they may be is a wonderful thing. It really does warm my heart to know your kid is getting a supportive parent to help them through this new path they are trying
I think there are a lot of very good comments that give advice already, so I only have one thing to say:

THANK YOU

For believing your kid, for deepening your knowledge about this, for everything you do for them, THANK YOU
There are a lot of really long comments here so I'll keep mine short. 

I'm really glad you are being so supportive of them. This is a really difficult time for parents with trans children and it's always so heartwarming to see parents reaching out places like this. Your kid will thank you when they're older. Unfortunately, I think it's wise to be equipped to defend them. Understand the things people say about trans and nonbinary people (ex. ""it's just a phase"", ""sex and gender are the same"") and be equipped how to tell people they're wrong. 

While I don't want to say your therapist is wrong, psychology is a study of individuals and culture, meaning culture influences individuals behavior. Our culture is changing; being more accepting of our diversity, more critical of ourselves and our traditions. Nothing in culture is rigid. It ebbs and flows through each of us, from one generation to the next. Discovering the spectrum that is LGBTQ is part of the slowly changing tides of our human existence. It's discovering that we are who we make of ourselves. We decide who we want to be, and we create our destiny. 

That being said, people may have a hard time understanding, but not because of an innate human trait. Nonbinary isn't necessarily multiple boxes or no box, it could just be a third box. It could also be that boxes don't work for gender, being that men and women alike are called out frequently for not fitting in their box, or are pressured to always be in one. 

I hope this helped, though I know I probably made this bigger and more confusing for you. Still, I encourage you to look up more on gender expression. And keep supporting your child. Protect them how you want, keep them informed on their changing body just like normal, but let them be who they want and dress how they feel comfortable. I wish you the best of luck
There are teams kids that know at 4,so there's nothing weird about up or 10 year old exploring their gender identity! In fact if being queer wasn't ""trendy "" aka known to general public she might've spent years being depressed because they could tell something wasn't quite right but they wouldn't have had the knowledge or words to expresses what she wanted.
Firstly, you seem like a great parent. If everyone has this attitude, the world would be a much better place.

But aside, there's gonna be a lot of discovery here. I think the important thing to point out is yeah it *might* be a phase, but it might also be a huge part of their identity, and the opportunity to self discover now will save years down the line. If hrt or surgery is something they want to pursue in the future, then having explored already will save the effort of having to do so beforehand, both for making sure, and because legally that can be something that's required. This is *especially* important when you consider some treatments decrease effectiveness with age. Much like if they wanted to cut their hair or wear some new style, you should just let it be, maybe it'll be a passing thing, or maybe it's part of who they are. Ultimately they will remember that, and it will affect how they view you. Either you'll become the parent who kept them from exploring who they are, or you'll become a caring parent who nurtured and guided them through this, even if it wasn't truly who they are.

Also binders are harmless, just teach them good binding technique and it'll be fine.
Sup, anyways you are doing good, and I was Nb since I was 10(recently came out as trans boi)and I have experience with this stuff, usually sports bras do the trick coz binders can me constricting, I don't have much info to share, so good luck to you and your homo sapien spawn
If you don't help them with it, they'll probably go elsewhere and that's when they can get into unsafe situations. You don't want them buying t shots under the table and doing it behind your back. 

It might be a phase but that doesn't mean one should be any less supportive. Your child will learn through this who they can and cannot trust to be their real selves around, even if that self changed through time (which regardless of gender identity it will). 

Also Re glamorizing LGBT; I'm sure this has been harped on but can you imagine if we said the same the same thing about heterosexuality and regular schools glamorizing THAT? Because they are. So is mainstream media. In fact we're constantly bombarded with messages that heterosexuality and being cis gender is ""right"". I would take a good long look at your own prejudices you're bringing into these conversations. This forum was a great start! But now you have the task of unconditionally supporting someone through this process and that's going to require real, hard work yourself. It's pretty ducking cool you get to do this with your kid. In my day (lol) kids went through this alone and ashamed. I don't recommend that path unless you want them on anti depressants or worse
I’m 49, AFAB, non-binary. I knew I was different basically from the earliest point I can remember, but I didn’t have the language to describe it until about 2011. Thankfully, your child doesn’t need to go through the same fear, confusion, and self-doubt I went through, because they have the ability to experiment with terms in a safe and supportive environment. 

It doesn’t matter if it’s a phase. This is the point in life where it’s okay to try on new pieces of personality. A binder won’t change them permanently. New pronouns won’t change them permanently. Nothing here is harmful in the long term, so long as they’re treated with respect and given autonomy over these choices.

They may change their mind later. Or they may not. Either way, affirming their gender decisions now will also affirm their trust in their relationship with you.
Your better then my parents they call people like them and me It and completely ignored me coming out and use my dead name even more now

Your husband is wrong, my parents say it’s just a phase even though I’ve been this since 2018 that’s far worse then simply not liking your child cause that makes them think their feelings are genuine and can screw with them

And try and have a open mind, that’s how I got rid of my terrible ideas and misgendering friends cause I was to lazy to learn, it all takes time but I’m sure they’d appreciate the hustle even if their to young to truly understand (I tried rephrasing that but it only came out worse)
Is like to pose a warning. My younger sibling came out to our family as nonbinary about 2 years ago.

My step-dad was of the opinion that it was all just a phase and that my younger sibling was being influenced by their friends at school. So he refused to go along with it. He refused to use the correct pronouns. He continues to use very gendered language when referring to my younger sibling.

And guess what? My younger sibling made a plan. Since the prospect of coming out didn't go over well with their dad, they decided that they would intentionally act as if it was all a phase from the beginning. They stopped talking about gender identity. They stopped experimenting with clothing.  My sibling and I are close so they told me that they are going to basically pretend to be a ""good little girl"" until they turn 18 and can move out of the house and never be involved with certain family members ever again. 

My sibling has managed to learn that they cannot trust their dad to support them. And now at the age of 15 they have accepted the fact that they are going to have to break ties with many of their family members simply because no one has believed them when they've said that they aren't a girl.
As a genderqueer person, I’d say the best thing you can do for your kiddo is to love and respect them. Actively listen to what they say, without projecting your own experiences/thoughts on to them. Continue to do research when you have questions. Remember that everyone has their own experiences and just because something is true for one enby person, it may not be true for your child. If you and your husband don’t already have your own therapists, I’d strongly suggest finding someone. 

I didn’t find a label that fit my experiences of gender until my late 20’s and was super anxious to come out to my very religious mother. But she surprised me by responding with love, listening and educating herself. We had some great discussions about gender as she learned new things. That unconditional love and support is why we have a relationship now. 

Check in with your kiddo to see how different pronouns and other changes feel to them. Create a safe space of open communication and listening to one another. Let go of who you thought your kiddo would be and celebrate who they are. Gender is so personal, don’t allow yourself or your husband to push preconceived notions onto them. Explore your own gender identity with your kiddo, see the world through their eyes. If there’s something that concerns you or you don’t understand, tell your kiddo that you need to do some research and you’ll get back to discuss it further after you have more information. I’m not saying agree to absolutely everything, but leave your biases at the door. 

You’re off to a good start, keep the momentum going. And light a fire under your husband. Being a parent is incredibly challenging, but will help you grow as an individual and family cultivate true respect for one another and yourselves. The work is totally worth it.
One quick note on the binder - not body altering, but make sure you get one that fits properly and make sure they take breaks with it - they can wear it when they go to school or go out, but when they're home and relaxing especially alone they need breaks from it. Fucked up my ribs bad when I was younger by wearing too-tight binders for 16+ hours a day.
First, the binders are not dangerous like you seem to think. Definitely do some research on measurements and proper binder care before jumping into buying one (the wrong size can cause pain/discomfort and sizing too small can pose a safety risk) but binders are literally the least invasive, least permanent thing your kid can do when it comes to transitioning. When binding becomes genuinely dangerous is when done with improper materials like ace bandages, which can cause actual harm to your child. Binders are no different than any other piece of clothing. Also, so what if it's just a phase? Everyone goes through them, but claiming it's ""just a phase"" and not respecting your kid for what they are going through right here and now is only going to do one thing: make them understand that they can't come to you for unconditional love or support. I understand for you and your kid's dad this is a ""big change"" and ""difficult,"" but please realize that this isn't about you. You are allowed to have complicated feelings about something that you maybe don't entirely understand, but please still place your kid's wellbeing and needs first. They matter more than your comfort during this. 

You're on the right track and I'm glad to hear that you're trying and willing to learn. That's so important! A lot of the other comments I've been reading on this thread have great resources and are accurate/trustworthy. A lot of the links I would have posted have already been done. Just keep an open mind and keep learning, and keep loving/affirming your kid no matter what  :)
Everyone is saying binders are completely safe, I disagree. While yes they’re not permanent, they can be dangerous. Make sure they don’t wear one too small since they are young, they are growing and can easily grow out of one making it too tight on their chest affecting their breathing. It might be hard to notice because they might like how it looks but you need to keep their safety in mind. Also make sure the binders are not worn during physical activity or at night because it can be dangerous. It squeezes the chest and if it’s not the right size can really damage your kid. As long as it’s the right size and they understand when they can and cannot wear it, it’s completely safe. But I don’t want anyone overlooking the potential dangers if used incorrectly.
This is so well put. It also occurred to me reading this as a parent, thinking about this, kiddos go through phases all the time, and most parents still support that through purchases if they have the money . Liking Lego phase? Buy legos. Liking soccer? Invest in soccer stuff. So saying it’s “just a phase” in order not to buy affirming clothing shows internalized transphobia in a different way. Even if it were just a phase, as the comment or here says, we all have phases in life. Even if it were just a phase, support it. And as far as binders, maybe it will help you to just think of them as shapewear. As a non-binary person I felt a little weird about binders until I thought of it this way. All bras are shapewear in a sense, they’re just going for a different gendered shape than a binder. Bottom line is that supporting your child will help them feel good and feel good about your relationship. Not doing so can have pretty severe mental health and relationship consequences down the road as well.
Binding is safe IF done correctly! OP please make sure to research how to safely bind before allowing a ten year old to do it. There are health risks if not done properly. If you refuse to let your child bind, they may turn to unsafe methods. It’s important to make sure they know how to do it safely.

Well put together ✨
Excellent and well-put.

Binders were the first thing I ever did to affirm my gender, and there was a noticeable difference in how I felt about myself and my confidence.  If there is concern that your child may wear (or want to wear) their binder for longer than 8 hours, you may want to consider a compression top that is not as “binding” but still gives the flattening effect that your child wants.  [TomboyX](https://tomboyx.com/collections/gender-euphoria/products/adjustablecompression-chai) has a compression top, and [Girlfriend Collective](https://girlfriend.com/products/black-mia-high-neck-bra) has a sports bra that many trans/non-binary people have compared to a compression top (though it does appear that it is being discontinued 😢).

As far as it being a phase, I am 23 years old and I am not out to my parents because I have constantly heard comments like that about trans/non-binary people from them (even though they say they are LGBT friendly 🙄).  I have accepted that I will probably never share this part of myself or my life with them, which is honestly unfortunate for them.  Children are more perceptive than we give them credit for, so even though you and your husband are trying your best, your child may feel that there are things she feels are off-limits to discuss.  Tell your child explicitly that you are listening to them and how they feel, and that you are working on addressing your own feelings about the matter to better support her.  It will make a huge difference, I promise.

(Edit: forgot to include that TomboyX is a great brand in general for underwear etc., though it is a tad expensive)
You, my good person, get an award.
Exactly I wear binders/compression top sometimes and the rule is you don’t wear them for longer than several hours a day and you NEVER sleep in them!
My only concern is trusting a 10 year old to adhere to safe binding practices, I knew so many kids (including myself) who wouldn't even wear a bike helmet. If OP is confident they and their kid can handle that responsibility, full steam ahead I say! 

This comment spells it all out really well, a lot better than I ever could've. Good shit.
And even *if* it’s something the child will grow out of, the best way to help them figure out who they are is to respect who they say they are so they can learn and figure out what feels right. If you never let them live as non-binary how are they supposed to figure out that feels wrong if they’re actually cis? Or a boy? Or something else?
Thank you SO much from the bottom of my heart. I have read all your posts and threads and dont even have words for how grateful I am 🙏🙏 I've changed my mind on the binders and giving my husband some reading to do. Thank you for being such a kind and caring human ❤
The BBC also has a great podcast called NB that I found really validating!
I am 25, so relatively young. I have grown up in a relatively liberal, openly gay and trans place. I came out as trans at 22 and even though I “pass” as the gender I transitioned to, it has NEVER been cool or fun to be openly trans. I mean it’s nice to feel like myself and sometimes that’s cool. But society as a whole is definitely not accepting and I think even a 10 year old would pick up on that.
Thank you so much for your comment. We are both in research mode! Thank you for introducing me to Jeffrey marsh and Alok! I have been watching all the videos and ordered Aloks book off amazon. I am so grateful that such amazing humans exist! ❤❤
The shtick about ""glamorizing LGBTQ"" is often rooted in the idea of the""gay recruitment"" conspiracy. 

Basically, the accusation thrown at queer rights activists is that they where trying to lure children into the ""homosexual lifestyle"" by ""glamorizing"" it.

Tale as old as time...song as old as rhyme...
Exactly! 
If you don't give your child a binder (which, as stated above is very very safe!!) they will resort to an alternative that is easier to obtain, such as bandages, but it is also more dangerous
Oh my goodness Cosmo, you are wise beyond your years! You give me hope! Thank you so much for your comment and great links. I am doing all the research I can and have changed my mind about the binders. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your great advice ❤
Yes! I would say the fact that improper binding can be dangerous is all the more reason it's so important for them to have a supportive adult in their life who will help them find a way to do it safely and comfortably! Binding is only dangerous when ppl feel backed into a corner and have to improvise.
It’s also better because it makes it clear that it’s important and worth spending time/money on. It celebrates them for who they are rather than just feeling like it’s “permitted” for them to be non-binary.
Thank you so much for your comment. I have changed my mind on the binders and am looking for a customized one. Thank you for the information and giving me a good place to look for the right one!
Exactly! There are even guidelines for safe binding. No more than 8-10 hours a day, take breaks, don’t sleep in it, etc, and you’re good.
Under the guidance of a pediatrician — i don't see why not
Thank you so much. I hadn't considered puberty blockers. Your comment and the one above inspired me to do some research and I am trying to get my kid into a pediatric obgyn who has experience treating trans and LGBTQ patients. 
(I also changed my mind about the binders 😉)
Thank you. This is something I hadn't considered. Your comment inspired me to do some research and I found a pediatric obgyn who has experience with treating trans patients in my area. I am waiting for a referral to be able to get my kid in to see them. I find it a bit frustrating that her current pediatrician never brought this up despite problems she has had due to heavy periods, etc.
Yeah. That's what I'm thinking, too. Ten really is on the early side for puberty; if I were their parent, I'd be seriously considering blockers just for that reason, to keep them from developing while all their peers still look like little children--to give them some time to be a child before they start looking like a grown-up. Ten might not be so young that puberty blockers are actually indicated for precocious puberty alone, but it IS on the young side. With both those factors there, it might be worth thinking about. They might already be so far into puberty that it wouldn't do much--but you won't know that unless you find a doctor and talk about it.

That said,young AFABs are not in nearly as much of a hurry to get on blockers as AMABs are, all things considered, because it's pretty easy to get a chest reduction later on if you need it, and everything else will change with hormones. But your kid isn't going to be thinking about that kind of thing for years yet, probably not until they're an adult. A binder, and maybe hormone blockers depending on just how early puberty is affecting them, is plenty.
Thank you for sharing your story with me. You are so very right. This is some of the best parenting advice ever. I am so sorry for how you were treated, I can't imagine how that felt and still feels now. I want you to know you really helped me with sharing this. I hope your future is the brightest, whether or not you have contact with your parents. ❤
Thank you so much for your comment. You are absolutely right and I changed my mind about the binders. I am searching for the right company that can make a custom one for them, hopefully in time for back to school!
I’d also like to add that saying that your child is supposedly being influenced by the presence of queer kids in school and almost being concearned about it is a little weird because queerness is natural and it’s human, also I don’t see parents worrying about their children’s gender and orientation nearly as much when they say they’re straight and cisgender, just a thought…
Thank you so much for your comment. I am looking into getting a custom binder for them and hopefully seeing a new doctor soon to discuss options like puberty blockers. So much great advice here. 

I really aim to be that 100% safe space for my kid. I'd like to think every parent does. Thank you for your insight and thoughtful comment! I just got some of the best parenting advice ever. ❤
If you do decide to let your kiddo wear trans tape or binders, I’ll leave a few links of brands that are generally well liked by trans and NB people. Another person left different resources that you should check out.

Also, DO NOT buy a binder from Amazon. They aren’t safe. The trans tape from them is fine.
also, pat yourself on the back. Your kid telling you their identity means they really truly trust you and feel safe telling you deep, meaningful things they know about themself. You seem like a lovely parent.
Binders are fine at any age. You just are only supposed to wear them 6-7 hours a day if you’re under 15
You get a greater number when enby kids like mine and other LGBTQ kids are pulled from the crap public school system where they're bullied, or here in Florida treated like the government wants to eradicate them from existence, and placed somewhere safe. Personally, mine homeschools.
If there are so many lgbtq kids in this school is probably because they know it's a safe school and all go there, not because they are pretending... I mean, each school does not have a diversity in gender, sexual identity or even race or social classes that parallels society perfectly! Usually in ""good schools"" you have higher classes, and ""bad schools"" you have lower classes for exemple.
So much this. Free award went to you because I *really* like your addendum to this other person's post.
Thank you. I will keep this in mind as an enby who wants to give binding a try.
I'm so glad I could help! I wish you and your family the best of luck on this journey. And remember we're here for support when you need us :)

Is this the guidelines for people still developing, or for adults done developing?
and don't exercise in binders \^\^
Yes! Please talk to a doctor before hand to see what can be done.
Oh yeah, depending on how far along they are in puberty, blockers can be a great choice to give them time to figure things out for sure. If it turns out they really are a girl, then they stop the blockers and puberty resumes, no harm no foul. If they turn out to be a man, then they switch to male-based HRT (testosterone, aka T) once they are mentally ready for it and their doctors determine they’re physically ready for it. And if they’re nonbinary, they consult with their doctor on just how femme or masc they want to be, and figure out the right hormonal balance for that.
Adult height and hip width are also things that are impacted by going through estrogen-dominant puberty and are not undone by later HRT.
Thank you, again, for being the kind of parent to hear that comment. It made *me* feel better about my own life just to read about a parent who's genuinely invested in their child's peace. I wish you and your baby the richest, most rewarding relationship.
Of course, you seem like a great parent who loves this child so I’m sure it’s going to be ok, you’re doing really good.

I don’t know where you’re from but if there is an LGBTQ+ center in your area, or even a Trans center (which would be even better), I strongly recommend reaching out because they could guide you through the whole process and help you find trans friendly healthcare professionals (endocrinologists, therapists etc). They might even have support groups for both parents of trans kids and even for the children who would like to make some new friends who share their experiences. 

Good luck, I really wish you and your child all the best, if you need anything we’re always here, happy to help :)

Edit: if you’re interested, you can go [here](https://www.wpath.org/member/search) to look for trans friendly healthcare professionals in your area. Also go through the site because it’s really useful, especially read the standards of care if you want to have a better understanding of how transitioning works; by the end of this year they’ll also update the document and include some chapters specifically about non binary people.
I’ve seen some evidence that they can possibly impair rib growth if worn for too long, and sports bras don’t do that. For a child that young, I’d personally go with the guaranteed safe option (there are even compression bras designed to flatten the chest) but I fully understand why someone else would feel differently. I just think a kid might not understand how important it is to bind safely. If it’s every day, sports bra, some days, binder, imo.
Hun, the thread is like early half a year old. Get a hobby or something.
Both, I’d even say 6-7 hours for youngn’s under 15, and absolutely no exercising in it
That's true. But hip width is skeletal hip width; the fat padding changes nicely with hormones, and it's pretty hard to tell the difference. And height--well, yes, that's true; but if they've already had their growth spurt--which usually happens earlier than the first period--then that's unfortunately water under the bridge already. A doctor could tell; on an X-ray you can tell if the growth plates have closed.
The kiddo should definitely be educated about the risks but imao there are also risks to them being left to suffer through dysphoria

that’s true! Just my opinion."	wihhh4	NonBinary	632	0.99	2022-08-07 14:50:49
Denied top surgery	"Went on my last meeting today where they basically told me that being nonbinary isn’t a thing and that they only treat people that are trans with gender dysphoria. Two years ago they said I’m nonbinary bc I’m obese…. then I lost 15cm in my waistline out of spite. Now they said I’m showing too much progress so I have the ”capability to live with my struggles.” Fuck Sweden. LGBT inclusive my ass lmfao

Also doesn’t help that I’m autistic so they just think I’m being confused.

EDIT; oh gosh, I didn’t really expect to get 40+ comments so this is a bit overwhelming but thank you guys for the support !!

I had been advised by most of my FTM trans friends to lie about my identity but sadly it was a bit too late for that as I was halfway through my meetings. 

The reason I didn’t lie is because after the first meeting, the doctor told me that the gov had gotten more inclusive and included nonbinary people. I had thought to myself: 
”Oh, I’m getting lucky!! Guess there is no need to lie.” 

The meeting I went to yesterday she informed me that.. the gov had removed that right once again. She really wanted to help me but she was simply just not allowed to anymore. The only other organisation that included nonbinary people is across the country and now that has also been limited by the gov.
They’re really just trying to limit us from getting help and being happy.

Next step will be time consuming or money consuming and honestly at this point I’d just want to go the money route despite how limited my wallet is. 

Oh well. I’ll get through this eventually :’)"	"Whattttt so sorry to hear this D: 
Is going private an option for you?
Lie to them I guess?
I'm sorry to hear this.
I also live in a country where they don't recognise non-binary as valid. Didn't even try it here. There's only one gender clinic with 10 years wait.

I'm getting my top surgery next week. Going abroad where you don't need any medical proof, just mutual acceptance. Downside is that you need the money for that. But I couldn't be more excited right now.

Have you looked into this possibility?
Sadly its the same thing in Canada (at least when I got top surgery). Although I do have gender dysphoria, I said I was a trans man because I heard that the surgeons will deny people who are nonbinary from getting top surgery.

I'm so sorry about that. It's not fair.
They thought your gender identity was caused by obesity? 🙄
You ""kids"" are trailblazers! Keep fighting for your right.

I'm 53. I'm nonbinary. I have always wished I could have my boobs removed. They get in the way. Bras are awful, uncomfortable and damaging. I don't use them so why have them?

But for me there was no surgery available because I was born a woman and women have boobs. You ""kids"" have changed all of that. 

Duck that. Push. Fight. Change doctors. You deserve to be the best you that you can be.

I'm proud of you. Good luck.
If you are looking for advice: lie to them

If not, man im so sorry. Its bullshit that they don’t recognize your gender or respect your wishes.
idiots will blame everything on obesity
I'm so sorry to hear this.
 I always thought if there's any country in the world, where enby top surgery would be covered it's sweden.

*Sigh.*

In germany there is the option to flat out lie to all doctors and psychiatrist/psychologists that you are a binary trans* guy (you then still may need a ""good"" reason for not wanting to go on T ; or find a doctors who is accepting and understanding and willing to lie to insurances with you )

Or

You pay for it on your own- most places I've looked into also have options for payment plans- 

I don't know if any of those things are an option for you.

I wish you all the best and hope you'll be able to find a way eventually.
Transphobia and ableism wow.
????? Goofy as hell.

Pull a fast one and just say you're a dude. What're they gonna do, put your boobs back in once they do the surgery?
You would think that they would support nonbinary people since they’re the same country that officially implemented they/them pronouns in their language
Ugh I'm so sorry. Unfortunately when I go to the Dr I have to larp the ""Hello it is me, He/Him super binary man and I love monster trucks and fishing!"" in order to get healthcare. It honestly feels impossible to force them to understand the nuances of gender, so my only advice is to just lie. It sucks but the end result made it worth it for me.
Yeah, Sweden sucks. r/transnord recommends lying about it and saying you're FtM.
🤗 (If you like)
Find a new doctor/therapist.
I feel your pain, I was denied in Germany a few years ago because I naively believed they'd accept non-binary people. I'm so sorry this happened to you.
can you go back and say, ""so after some soulsearching it turns out I'm ftm""? or can you approach a new care organization to start fresh?
I'm so sorry this happened to u

The gatekeeping system is so fucking disgusting in the EU 

This is just institutional oppression, nothing else
Pal, you better lie.
So sorry to hear this and I hope you find another way forward.

Sweden is honestly the most conformist non-affirming place I've ever been to and I'm from Africa.
Hi from Stockholm. I wanted radical reduction because my chest was giving me dysmorphia. I went to Kry to a GP ask about that. And they told me “that kind of things u do privately “.
I told her it’s not the case, that I can be diagnosed and get my surgery. So they put me in a waiting list to a clinic that does it. 2 years waiting time for the first appointment, and then it can take 2 years to be diagnosed. The GP was calling me “transsexual” coz her English wasn’t good and my Swedish isn’t enough to talk about medical issues.

I could have a regular reduction as I qualified but then they would make it just a bit smaller, “proportional to by body”, which I am sure it’s not what I need. Long story short I went privately in Dec…
Feel you 💔❤️
Lie, many Non Binary people to do it to get care. 
I was lucky i didn't need to lie, but about half of my Docters asked if i wasn't just a trans man. Because I'm really masc leaning.
So sorry to hear that.
What the fucking fuck. I’m so sorry. That’s not okay
I'm sorry you're going through this right now!! One of my partners is Swedish and they've expressed having a hard time getting trans health care. The trans healthcare system in Sweden truly seems to be garbage.
Honestly, I would send this info to the news. Read just now in DN about how a tv profile who appears to be nb (använder hen som pronomen men är fem-presenting) apparently had few problems getting breast implants to better conform to their gender. They might have done it through private means, was a long text and don't quite remember, but at least the topic is getting a bit of a spotlight at the moment
I’m so sorry your going through that, I hope something works out soon for you!
Lie. Get what you need.
i shall sprint to sweden and commit murder for you
The fact that I knew this was one of the Scandinavian countries just by reading the first few sentences omg..  
That sounds horribly frustrating and we got a pretty similar situation here in Norway from what I've heard. I'm definitely planning on just telling my doctors that I'm a trans man (technically half-true, so it's fine) because anything else is way too big of a risk. Progressive countries like ours shouldn't be this behind when it comes to trans healthcare. Super frustrating tbh
As a nonbinary person who is also seeking top surgery, this is my biggest fear and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 
You are valid in your identity, and I urge you to not give up on getting what you need to be comfortable in your body. 
Much love, friend!
I’m just stopping by to show some solidarity. This sucks, it’s wrong of them to deny you this, and I’m sorry that it’s complicating your journey even further.
Gaddam Sweden sure is handing out the backhands for troons today. In another sub a trans girl said they told her she has to be socially transitioned for a year (wearing skirts and makeup out before passing) before they allow her HRT. 

wtf I thought Sweden was like the beat place in the world to live or some shit
Jävla dårar!
That sucks! Exactly the reason I never wanted to transition medically (I'm also in Sweden).
well.. yes.
Em isbitnstill a demand that you get sterilzed before you can under go g""gender affirming care""?
I'm sorry.
it MIGHT be? There is another organisation but its all across the country. it has recently gotten a rule that I need a doctors note that my doctors arent allowed to give bc I’m nonbinary so it’ll be a bit hard
This is, sadly, the way. The amount of times I've needed to lie to doctors due to gender bias is infuriating.
What country are you traveling to?
How much does it cost? Im from the uk and the guidance says they only do top surgery on people who have been on T for 2 years. Im not interested in going on T but have a lot of top dysphoria. Cost for private surgery here is like 10000. Way outta my budget.
Good luck with your surgery btw and let us know how it went!
That's genuinely baffling to me. I'm in the southeastern US and like nobody had an issue (and I'm AFAB and generally femme presenting). Like... its your body and if you want to lob your tatas into the abyss then you should be able to lob your tatas into the abyss.
Wait, they will? :(  
I'm a Canadian enby who has thought about top surgery but never mind, I guess...
Really? I know several non binary people who got their top surgery covered by the Canadian govt in Ontario.
Anti-fatness is the real disease - it makes people act like monsters and treat those in larger bodies as less than human.  Like so what if someone’s fat?! (A word which I use in a neutral sense) If they want to chop their boobs or get any kind of gender affirming surgery, care, joint replacements, etc., why tf are they being denied - I do not buy this utter bullshit about ‘well the anesthesia is harder to do and dangerous and blah blah blah - like no, because you’re happy enough to rush someone into surgery and take their money when it’s a bariatric surgery.  But God forbid fat folks have access to life-improving care of other types.  SMH🫠  Bigotry is so gross.
Can confirm. Everything from my intelligence to my health to my gender to my sexual orientation to my political convictions is somehow caused by and/or invalidated by my weight. It's maddening.
Do you have tips for dealing with the psychiatrist examinations in Germany? I've talked to another guy about this and he said that I won't get their approval bc I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and now I'm (ironically) too scared to continue looking for one
Exactly. This makes my future look darker, too be honest
Unfortunately my understanding is that Swedish authorities work hard to shut down all providers that do not conform to their rigid rules. That sucks terribly badly but medical tourism is an option.
Ya
Barcelona, Catalonia. I have surgery with Dr. Brasó
Yeah, it's exactly the same here in Ireland.
In Barcelona you're looking at 5-6k in a good clinic, maybe less if a less known clinic. They're also more used to doing them surgeries over there, so I do trust them more than if I was to get it here.
[deleted]
It really depends where you are in Canada, don't lose hope! The place I went was fine with NB people getting surgery
Not everywhere! I've actually never heard of that, its disappointing to know parts of Canada are less progressive. But, my friend is non-binary, they're not on HRT (they dont plan to transition that way), and they recently got top surgery in Vancouver :) I believe the wait was much less than a year and it cost them like $15 lol (had to pay for anesthetic)
Not everywhere and not every surgeon! Mine was covered by OHIP and this was back in 2017-2018. Things may be different now, but back then I had to lie about being nonbinary.
Oh mine was covered too! I only paid $2000 out of pocket after the OHIP coverage.  


I'm saying moreso that I had to lie that I was a binary trans man (and also that I didn't have any mental health issues) in order to get top surgery. This was back in 2017/2018. Most nonbinary people I talked to had told me to say I was a trans man because many of them were denied for being nonbinary. Others were for being autistic.
My biggest recommendation is going to/calling/email-ing a dedicated counseling for trans*.
They know the local doctors, psychiatrists , etc and frequently deal with health insurance relate trans* issues.

Having other diagnoses does not automatically mean you can't get a diagnosis for dysphoria, being trans*, etc and medial letters and access to at least parts of trans healthcare.

There are people (even frequent psychiatry in-patients with multiple diagnoses) that get at least indication letters and HRT...

Approval for surgeries is in most cases a long and complicated process, often with rejections, for all sorts of reasons (according to my friend who was in contact with a trans counseler in a big city in NRW, she started her process in 2022)
Quite frequently only not accepting the decision of your Krankenkasse and going to court gets the final approval... 

I'm sorry I don't have more details or more positive things to share, I hope it was helpful anyways.
I hope there is some kind of support existing in your area - knowledge about who and what to look for (and what to avoid) can make daunting tasks much less scary.
Thanks a bunch! Gives me some hope for the future.
Oh I’m well aware that I’m one of the lucky people and not everyone can access care. I don’t personally have anyone telling me I can’t do what I’m doing (well nobody with the power to stop me).
This was in Ontario and back in like 2016-2018 for me. It was covered by OHIP for me besides $2000 (to make it 'look nice'). But yeah, things might be different now!  
I just know that prior to my top surgery, I had nonbinary friends who advised me to say I was a binary trans man."	10wcdoi	NonBinary	631	1.0	2023-02-07 20:36:20
new here . in need of support, no one in rural Iowa is gender bending ☹️		"i hope this is an okay compliment but u are one of the most beautiful people i have ever seen
As a queer from the rural South, it really helped me to get away from where I lived and be in a larger city that had more access to community that felt like mine... I know this isn’t an answer that fixes anything for you today (and queers should be able to lead a happy existence anywhere!) but maybe moving is something to consider. Always happy to DM if you’re needing someone to chat with.
Hang in there! Life is full of twists and turns, I hope yours will lead you to people who understand, accept, and support you. This sub is a great place to start- imo everyone is very lovely and supportive and has really helped me cope with some of the trauma I experienced living in rural Michigan ❤️
I wish you the best! I also wanted to say that your eyes are very pretty, they are almost like my cat's eyes!
You're valid :D
I see you and you are valid ❤️
I feel that, I grew up in small town Iowa and it was miserable, I'm so sorry for your situation.
My best advice is just to start trying stuff out on your own!
You're valid, if you ever need someone to rant to I'm here.
As someone who's from the middle of no where in Tennessee, I feel ya. It's hard not having anyone like yourself around. But we welcome you here :)
Your tattoo!! I wanna be ur friend msg me im 23 from california
hi! your very very valid and hang in there! i believe in you. also, your eyes are very pretty!
Oh im in the exact same spot, i feel u :( rural iowa and brasky arent a fan of anything out of their ‘ordinary’ huh
Hi friend! If it helps, I think you're a very attractive person and if I saw you out in public, I would sneak looks (respectfully) because you're hella cool, and you look very much Friend Shaped!
Same boat here. I’m in rural KY and scared for my life to come out to anyone other than family. Please remember you’re freaking gorgeous and ever so valid.
Pretty blue eyes 👀
(Valid valid valid valid valid valid) My DMs are always open! 🥺 stay strong! You are valid!
you're valid, beautiful and i hope you have as great a day as you can :)
You are so valid. I know how hard it is feeling like you're the only one around you who gets it. Stay strong 😁
Love your eyes homie. I know the feeling. I lived out in the sticks for a while
Fellow Iowa queer sending you support!
Sorry your community isn’t supportive. Just know that you’re super valid and you’re not alone. Bending gender is a super radical thing to do, pun intended, and I commend you for being awesome and brave enough to engage in it. Much love to you from a fellow enby. 🥰
i felt that one! i didn't even realize i was nb until college where i moved from the south to boston lol. you are so valid!!! don't let the corn fields tell u otherwise!!!
Oooh oh pick me pick me! Lol
I live in north central Florida (and for those of you who don't know, it's basically just like every other southern area😩) and I need more friends like myself. And I'm sorry if I'm overstepping, but you are very beautiful😊 (not that my friendship and beauty have to coincide, I hope it didn't come off that way😅)

I've never been to Iowa, but as soon as I read Rural, I knew😅 Rural areas aren't very kind to people like us, and I'm sorry if you've ever had to experience just how unkind it can be💛
You’re hella valid!! (Also hella hot holy sh*t)
This might sound like kind of a wild suggestion, but I’ve heard about AMAB folks in queerphobic parts of the country embracing cowboy culture as a way to play with gender expression without putting themselves in danger. The rural Midwest has a lot of hick types, so people would likely write off someone wearing something in that style despite its flashiness. Think studded boots and colorful western-style shirts embroidered with flowers.

I’m getting more low-key vibes from your pic though, and I understand if flashy isn’t your thing. As a fellow rural Midwesterner, I understand how alienating it can feel to be in your position. Hopefully you can find more people in your life that understand and support you soon. Until then, please know that this random internet stranger is rooting for you! Good luck and stay safe out there
I grew up in a small town in Indiana and I never felt like I belonged there. When I was younger, non-binary just wasn't common as a phrase, if it existed at all. It took me a long time to accept myself for who I am, and you're already there. I'm a little envious. (I hope this helps to put things into perspective for you.)  


You have a lot of people here to talk to, so just vent to us when things get difficult, and know that you don't have to be stuck there forever.
thank you 🥺
I’ve definitely considered that very seriously and I’m not against it. to some extent though I want to become completely satisfied where I am because I know that feeling will always come from within and I can’t blame my surroundings. At the same time, the exterior conditions effect your state of mind.
thank you! I feel better already ❤️❤️
thank you!
thank you friend ❤️
thank you 🙏🏼 and same to you
where did you grow up? eventually moving seems to be the smartest option ha
I am very independent and self-reliant so I think I’m good at that. I’m mainly just exhausted at having to answer the same questions and I feel like I’m constantly required to prove the validity of my existence. Thanks for your advice ❤️
I messaged you
I still love Iowa, the land is beautiful
I love your imagination but yeah I’m a little more lowkey. I do have kind of a country boy aesthetic just less flashy however I think most of the offended men I encounter are actually responding to the genuineness of my masculinity as I don’t have a big mouth and my attitude is very self assured. Next thing I know they’re posturing and asking invasive questions. I’m like, you good bro? 😂
Exactly. We’re not totally dependent on our surroundings, but we aren’t totally independent either! We’re interdependent. There’s no shame in finding soil that’s more fertile to help you grow...
At some point you may need to come to terms with the idea that becoming completely satisfied with *where* you are just isn't compatible with *who* you are.
I need to learn from your mindset. I’m in Alaska which is so bigoted and I mostly hide it because I don’t want to make things weird with my conservative christian boss.
I used to think this way and for many inner problems, it is 100% true. But for my queer identity, it wasn't. We need to connect with others in our community who are not only happy, but thriving. We all need active role models in self-advocating, fashion, mindset, culture, etc.


Rural places can often make it hard to want to challenge the norm, because it's life-threatening and ostracizing. But the truth I live is that I'm happy on the outskirts of ""normal"" society — but ONLY because I have a small, queer circle to reach out to on a daily basis.


If you're seriously considering moving, then do it. Just don't expect changes to happen quickly or a community to just be ready... Most communities want to see you showing up consistently and, in some cases, as they expect you to. (Queers can be bigoted, too!)


Don't give up on yourself yet! We're here for you in the meantime <3
Technically I grew up in Canada, but from age 11-19 I was in Sioux Center. Small town of maybe 8000 people, 90% white, and I shit you not, 27 churches there, it was ridiculous.
I understand the effort of trying to prove yourself. Its unfortunately something most queer people have to go through. Im still working on it myself and being able to be confident in myself. But everyday you be yourself it'll get easier the next one. Even if its just in your room ❤❤ hope this helps
Check out Orville Peck
I'm in Alaska, too! Anchorage isn't perfect, but there are a few of us around <3
bruh what my town of 4000 in nj has 5 churches and i thought that was a lot
It's been ages since I last checked but when I was in college (Christian college, mind you, it's a college town) there in 2007 there was a list in the dorms and I counted.

Remember during the 2016 election, Donald Trump said ""I could shoot someone on Main Street and not lose any votes""? That was at that college."	mfeoay	NonBinary	632	1.0	2021-03-29 01:21:42
Made a pic to share with anyone else who needed to hear this! It sounds obvious now, but it's sometimes hard to get there without support		"\[Image Description: two cartoon kiwi birds on a white background. One's standing on half a kiwi fruit, leaning forwards and looking down, while the other sits surrounded by three kiwi fruit slices. (The sitting one is teal for character differentiation purposes.) The left kiwi says, ""What if I don't figure out the reason behind my gender"". The right kiwi says, ""That's not a prerequisite to being your gender"". On the bottom right of the image is ""bitl.y/post-binary"".\]

&#x200B;

I want to keep making and sharing images! One of the most consistent stories for nonbinary folk is that they needed to find information ""out there"" to verify and validate their gender identity. If even one person can be more comfortable with their gender, or even one person comes to recognize there's a word that describes them, then our effort in making and sharing these pics will be worth it!
When I'd just come out I really enjoyed listening to the Queery podcast hosted by Cameron Esposito. She's a lesbian comic and interviews people from all over the lgbtq+ spectrum. I think it was Shadi Petosky who's trans and said it doesn't really matter why I am what I am: it's baked in so I'm going to have to just be it. Words to that effect. 

Imo it's got a bit too showbizzy recently, too much talk about their acting careers and not enough queer content, but the first several dozen were great conversations.
Great advice from the GenderKiwi. 
Yep. You shouldn't pathologize your gender and assume there's a ""reason"" for it. There doesn't have to be an issue; it can just be what you are. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Aww.. This is so wholesome
Thank you for making this and sharing it!
Adorable. I often struggle with this, so thank you for this lovely message. <3

Fucken RIGHT?
Why are kiwis always so wholesome
That’s really neat. I’ve never even thought about the “why” of my gender. I guess it would feel like asking why I had fingernails because they’re just there aren’t they, but now I could see how other people could question that. Thanks :)

Lost a job opportunity due to my pronouns	"Hi! so i'm not really sure if anyone here will have insight or suggestions for me but im open to everything. i had an interview at a local, family owned record shop that went extremely well. the owner admitted i was perfect for the job and that i would really benefit the shop. for the next week, almost every day, the owner and his wife made it very clear they wanted me on the team as soon as they could, and that they were excited to work with me. 
 
that is until one day he asked to see my social medias since i would be doing a lot of social media work, photography and marketing for him. my pronouns (she/they) are in my instagram bio which he saw. he said he needed to call and talk to me about a few things. he asked ""so i saw you had these pronouns, what's with that... what are your opinions on them?"" i gave a simple answer along the lines of, ""oh well it's not something too important, usually people im close with can decide how they'd like to refer to me"" he continued to say how sensitive society is and how he doesn't want to get in trouble for calling me a she. i kinda laughed it off and he ended the call saying he would keep in touch and suddenly sounding skeptical about hiring me. 

a week has passed and he let me know i didn't get the job because another employee asked for more hours. my brother thinks that's a complete lie and that i should consider it gender discrimination. i'm not really sure what i can do other than just be frustrated. if you have any advice or support it's appreciated."	"The most sensitive people complain about society being sensitive. This is abhorrent. Sorry it happened to you :(
the acceptable answers to an employer asking “can i see your social media?” are “i dont have social media” or “no.”
Hi. Please reach out to a legal local aide. 

You were openly discriminated for your gender and orientation. Never share your socials with an employer unless you signed anything stating you have to own the job.

A job discrimination complaint may be filed by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. You can find the closest EEOC office by calling the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000, or by going to the EEOC's Field Office List and Jurisdiction Map and selecting the office closest to you.

Queer people are a protected class so you have a case.
I dont know If you can do something (depends on the law) but I am certain that your Brother is right.
Funny the owner didn’t hire you because he was afraid of liability for possibly misgendering you, yet he likely actually discriminated against you by not hiring you. It’s probably a long shot to prove discrimination, depending on the evidence you have available, but you can consult your local ACLU office. If they can’t help you, always ask if you have a cause of action and can they suggest someone who can help.
I know it's frustrating losing a job opportunity, but if the owner reacted like that, you definitely dodged a bullet. He sounds like he would have been a bad manager or a nightmare to work with if he's worried about people being ""too sensitive"". If he were a stronger manager he would have read up on how to work with people with different pronouns, confronted any biases he could have, and hired you.
Being afraid of getting in trouble for calling someone “she” when she has made it explicit that it’s OK 😐

But in a way, he was right about society being sensitive.
I’m sorry this happened and I have been in a similar situation. Unfortunately, I believe it’s hard to pursue legal action bc he technically is not your “employer”. 

However, I think leaving a review on yelp, google, etc. will make an impact and effect his business accordingly. 

Keep being you and know that you are worth way more then this job and the owners’ ignorant opinion. 💙💚💖
your brother is absolutely right and I'd say the same thing if I were him.  Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do. That definitely sucks and I'm sorry you had to go through that
this is absolutely terrible and i’m sorry this happened. what a fucking dolt. your pronouns are she/they and he’s worried about getting in trouble for calling you “she”… literally one of your accepted pronouns?! wtaf

on top of that though it was completely unprofessional for him to ask to see your social media. imo that was a HUGE invasion of your privacy and he had absolutely no right to ask you that. what kind of record shop clerk is also the social media manager for the business…? was that even in the description of the job you applied to? did he always expect you to be their social media rep or what? and besides that, he should have a brand account for you to use for that, not your personal accounts… something seems very weird about this and i genuinely believe you dodged a huge bullet.

leave the worst review you possibly can and report the business for gender discrimination.
Flip it around: they lost an opportunity to work with a great team member because they were disrespectful.
If that's all of the context. Then I feel it's not enough to file for gender discrimination. Regardless, you're probably better off not working there if the owner is like that. You don't want to be in a toxic workplace. Trust me hun.
If you are in a country with an equal employment opportunities committee or something of the like, I don’t see the harm in notifying them of what happened.

At least it will be on record, and if others follow suit, there may very well be a pattern that may as well confirm what happened.
He... said he didn't want to get in trouble for calling you ""she""... when you say right there in your bio that you use she and they? Like... you're cool with she pronouns and wouldn't get upset if he used them, but he was being an idiot about it anyway? God, what cis nonsense is this lmao. Sorry you had to go through that, but it sounds like you dodged a bullet working for a douche like that.
So sorry that happened to you. Although you can't say definitively that is why they didn't hire you, it is not debatable that his questions and comments were inappropriate and transphobic.  Writing a review is a good way to let folks know that this organization may not a safe space.   
In your job search, try to look for companies that have publicly stated diversity and inclusion statements on their website and when you apply let them know that YOU chose THEM for this reason. Good luck on your search.
Please consider reporting them to the better business bureau! That's definitely workplace discrimination.
Think of it this way- if you were a cis woman and the guy had said ""I don't want to hire you because I'm afraid I'll get in trouble for harassing you"" what would you think? I'd think 1) you dodged a bullet, and 2) that's absolutely gender discrimination. Your brother is completely right.
I think you’d be hard pushed to prove this was the reason you didn’t get a job but it sounds like it almost certainly was the reason. My boss openly says that he bins any CV’s with pronouns mentioned, I think it’s depressingly common.
Ughhhhhhhh if there's any silver lining, you dodged a bullet not having to work with this asshole. There are legal aid places that do a free consults with employment lawyers if you want to look into that because yes, this is obviously discriminatory
Ugh I'm not excited for this. 

My last job was at a queer-friendly dispensary, but my assistant manager decided to flirt with me. I actually ended up liking her, and it sounded like she was going to wait for me to find a new job so we could date. Instead, she got back with someone she was seeing before and essentially tried to ghost me. And because that really hurt me and she refused to communicate, I decided that I couldn't do anymore shifts with her. So they fired me.

If I didn't have luck in a queer-positive environment...idk what the fuck I'm supposed to do. For now I'm just going to take out a student loan.
This is arguably illegal depending on where you live and you may be able to sue. You should not be discriminated against for having words in your social media bio.
Personally, I begin my resume with my legal name, followed by my preferred name and pronouns (they/them). It may hurt the rate at finding a job especially depending on area, but ultimately if they see my pronouns in my resume and decide not to interview me based on that, then that isn't a place I would've wanted to work anyways.
They violated your rights under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

Please contact your state’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing. You can find that info if you search online. I’d be happy to help if you need it.
Depending on where you live this could be a human rights complaint. In Canada, gender identity and expression are protected grounds and I think especially if you have emails back and forth you could have the basis of a case… but idk about other parts of the world
I also think i once got refused because i picket other on an ""anonymous"" form
1) The manager is rubbish and it's probably good that you don't work for them
2) That's a clear discrimination that worth reporting
3) Don't give employers social media
I’d sue
I've had a similar experience as a trans male /nonbinary individual.  They seem fine until they realize I'm transitioning or ""have pronouns"".  Then all of a sudden they become unsure and/or awkward
Kinda hope to hear an update about this after filing a discrimination complaint. Tho that may take a really long time.
Report them to someone. That's definitely  illegal.
bullet dodged imo, also depending on where you live I'm pretty sure that is illegal and I would recommend that you seek legal advice from a professional (if you can of course), Good luck in the future :)
I lost my job at a gas station for this exact reason, been looking for another job ever since
Well it’s 100% gender discrimination, but, at least you can be glad you dodged that bullet before it was too late! That is the positive sode of this. You will not be working eith those transphobes😌

There will be another job opppirtunity that will be even better soon, you see! You’ll get your dreamjob. This wasn’t meant to be
You will get there and find a place that appreciates you for who you really are. 

I thought it would be so much harder to get a job after coming out and changing my pronouns. But I just got my dream job - better than I ever thought possible, and they respect my pronouns and my identity! You will find the right place too, it’ll just take time and energy and maybe a LOT of applications and interviews.
Let us know how it goes if you can. Good luck.
no one wants to hire people that will end up suing the company because the minute they see pronouns they know ""this is trouble, its a liberal""
this. they call us sensitive for having pronouns, as if everyone (spare for those who actually do not use pronouns) has pronouns. they really get pressed over how someone is called and think they arent the sensitive ones.
Seriously. My private social media account is none of their business. I don't care if managing their social media is part of the job, my private life and everything to do with it is none of their business. 

And I won't add co-workers to it either... unless they genuinely transition out of the work-friends zone and into friend-friends, they aren't worth it. I have seen people suffer because they didn't keep those boundaries firm. You never know what some work only acquaintance is going to take offense to and get you in trouble with your boss by using something on your private social media accounts.
Yeah employers wanting to see the social media of their employees is pretty invasive. Like I'm not showing them my Facebook or god forbid my other reddit account, like that's none of their bloody business!
in hindsight i 100% wish i had just said no. i just didn't think much of it because my socials are mostly a place for me to share my photography, and that's something he liked on my resume. i thought he'd just be interested in seeing more of my work
Came here to say something like this. You have a pretty good case between asking to see your social media and the comment about ""getting in trouble"". I'm so sorry this happened to you. This is clean cut discrimination.
this needs to be the top answer.
100% this. What that business owner did is discrimination and definitely illegal. Report it.
thank you for agreeing with him and taking the time to read through. my brother suggested that i leave a google review to share my experience and recommend other lgbt+ friendly options in the area, in hopes to deter people from shopping there.
I mean normally it'd be harder to prove but there's a clear demarcation - OP was the stated chosen candidate, then there was a phone call to specifically ask about their pronouns, followed by a retraction of interest. The timing makes it incredibly sus even if they tried to CYA by claiming that another EE had asked for more hours. Especially if OP contacts the EEOC and it opens an investigation, I doubt these assholes have the forethought to *not* hire anyone else to support their story re not needing to hire another person bc an existing EE requested more hours, and if they moved forward with another candidate or have no evidence of the supposed request for more hours that makes it pretty clear that it was just an excuse. 

OP - I would encourage you to contact the EEOC about this.
she never signed a contract, so technically there's nothing on paper. Also how can ""misgendering you"" happen since he said ""afraid of misgendering you"". The court would side with employer knowing the pronoun person will just bring havok to the workplace. This is why I removed all my pronouns from all social media - I don""t want employers to think a blue haired leftists commie soyboi
I definitely dodged a bullet, but i had quit my previous job assuming i had this one (i had to quit anyways due to hostile environment) but i guess that just makes it more frustrating. im definitely looking into businesses that openly accepting and lgbtq+ friendly now :)
Fucc society
To clarify, an employer doesn't have to be *your* employer to commit employment discrimination against you. Employment discrimination laws apply to the entire process, including recruiting and hiring, and being passed over for a job bc of a protected characteristic is actionable employment discrimination.

But that's a whole Process and leaving reviews will be much more immediately satisfying, so.
i agree, my brother suggested leaving reviews as well, and i think that's my best option considering effort and outcome. 

and thank you, im looking for jobs now that are openly lgbtq+ friendly, so i do have the ability to keep being myself :)
since he's a smaller business with limited staffing i didn't think that much of it, he was going to allow me to do a lot of my work from home, mostly coming in when i needed to film more content, then going home to edit and post on his shops account. i definitely should have been more skeptical when letting him see my accounts, i just didn't think too much of it because my accounts are a mix of person stuff and all of my photography and video work, so i figured he wanted to see that. and i agree it's absolutely stupid for him to be worried about calling me she when that's one of my pronouns. i present feminine majority of the time, and clearly he didn't think anything different during the interview
thank you so much, you are so kind
no i agree, there's not enough proof or evidence for legal action, it's just frustrating because i quit my previous job, thinking i had this one pretty secure (i had to quit due to hostile environment anyways though)
oh wow you worded this really well thank you so much, i really appreciate the support. my parents haven't thought much of the situation because they don't really believe ""the non binary thing"" is actually like legitimate (im doing my best to help them understand), so maybe explaining it like you've said would maybe help them support me as well
if it makes you feel any better, my previous job was also queer friendly, but i had to quit because it was an extremely hostile work environment. 

but i have since been looking and interviewing at more queer friendly businesses here, and some have seemed really nice, accommodating, and super accepting! i tried looking for places where the staff seemed really comfortable being expressive in the workplace, and so far it has been going well!

don't feel like all hope is lost, some businesses and managers will be better than others, we just have to seek out the good ones :))
My previous manager actually sought out my FB based on my name. I only post Halloween stuff on there anyway, but it's a common thing. Managers want to know if you're a responsible person. I don't know how I feel about it. On one hand it's creepy, but on the other you're posting it publicly. (I wouldn't show an employer my Reddit though, that's the more personal stuff.)
Don’t feel bad about sharing your pronouns! If you wanted the job, then yeah in hindsight it was a bad idea to share them, but honestly do you want a job working for people who don’t respect you enough to refer to you the way you’ve asked? If someone can’t be bothered to use something as basic as someone’s pronouns they wouldn’t respect your time, mental health, financial obligations or anything else. Sucks that you lost a job opportunity but I’d see it as dodging a bullet in a way
I love the review idea. Probably the most pay off in terms of effort/result.
thank you, i wasn't sure if there was much i could do, but i think you're right and it'll be worth contacting someone in my state. i really appreciate it thank you.
The company must have at least 15 employees for the EEOC to have jurisdiction. That’s why I referred OP to the ACLU. This is potentially a case under Bostock and the ACLU can best make an assessment of the actual evidence and refer OP to the correct entity or take the case itself if there is a cause of action. 
I don’t disagree with your general assessment, but whether this case is clear depends on the actual evidence admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
I know we are strangers, but if you need a convincing reference feel free to DM me. I have had management positions before and can make a convincing case if you don't have any references.
>my accounts are a mix of personal stuff and all my photography and video work

oh no no no… ok, well this is your sign to create a seperate portfolio account for your art. i’m sorry no one told you this sooner but it really isn’t the best idea to have your personal and professional/hobby/portfolio accounts be the same. pretty much for this reason, to keep your personal life private and personal.

i’d strongly recommend keeping those things separate. keeps you safer online and apparently will keep you safe irl too. 

but to be clear what happened isn’t your fault at all, bc you’d still have your pronouns on any alt portfolio account anyways 😂 but it helps keep other more personal things away from employers, since they have no right to know anything beyond your name age pronouns and what your capabilities are anyway
I’m personally completely against it. 

I mean, just because something is available to you, doesn’t mean you have no boundaries to pursue it. What I mean is, even if your BFF leaves their journal wide open in front of you, you wouldn’t take that as an okay to read it, right? I feel like boss asking for your Facebook is like my parents actively seeking out my social media (I’m an adult), I’d be weirded out. 

I understand bosses wanting to more if you’re responsible, but that’s what working hours are for. My boss doesn’t come and check if I did my laundry or paid my rent, so why should they be able to check what I do online? I can be the most irresponsible person ever after 5pm so long as I do what I’m paid to do before it
That’s why I keep any account with my full real name on it locked up like Knox. Sure, my employer could find my Facebook. But they’re not gonna see anything other than my name and PFP
definitely a dodged bullet just really irritating where i hadn't made a big deal about it before, he just saw the pronouns in my bio. she is one of my accepted pronouns and that's how i am typically presenting and received, so i truly just don't get all the fuss. but again, i dodged a bullet, and can now seek out places that will be accepting
I agree, but mostly because I love the idea of ahole business gets reputation destroyed on social media after discriminating against a perspective employee being hired to handle their social media. Poetic justice ftw.
yea i knew the day would come when i would have to separate my accounts, it was just easier at the time to keep it in one because a lot of people i went to school with, became my clients. it was easy for them to just go to the account they'd always recognized as mine and email or send a message from there. i don't post a ton of personal stuff anyways, just pictures from concerts or dates with my partner usually, but i think you're right and it's more than enough to constitute another account. thank you for the suggestion and the time, it's a really frustrating situation and it's nice to have the support :)
Now *that’s* irony."	w4ahyt	NonBinary	624	1.0	2022-07-21 07:37:08
Need help with pronouns	"My child recently told me they want to use they/them pronouns and they have chosen a different name they would like to go by. I understand the importance of supporting these decisions so I am really trying. 

I do have a question though. When I am speaking to other people, what do I replace the word ""son"" with? I though ""child"" or ""kid"" but they're going on 15 now and that feels a little demeaning maybe?

Update: We talked at dinner. We are going with kid for now. And maybe loin-fruit when we are just at home together.  Thank you all so very much for all of your support and advice!

❤️  Keep being awesome and remember, you are enough."	"That’s something you might want to talk to them about, to see what they prefer and are comfortable with! Personally, I think child is fine and doesn’t necessarily mean they’re little. You could also call them your teenager.
just want to say it’s awesome that you’re asking! its up to personal preference but i’m an adult (24) and am comfortable with my parents calling me their child. maybe ask them if they are okay with being called child or kid and if not, if theres another word they would like to be referred by. really shows them that you care by asking 😊
You could say ""teen"" or ""teenager."" I've heard parents use that even for kids who aren't trans/nonbinary. Saying ""my teenager goes to (school)"" or ""my teen plays way too many videogames"" sounds fairly normal to me.

The best idea is to ask your kid how they want you to refer to them, though.
My parents often refer to me as their ""adult child"". Personally I think I like kid the most, as it's often casually used for people of any age who have parents. But your kid may have other opinions, so it's best to ask them.

You sound like a good parent. Thank you.
I know this is what everyone else has said but communication is key. Im a non-binary teen and would personally want my parents to discuss this with me if they were confused.
You can use birth order. (my first born, \*name\*) or age (My 15 year old, \*name\*).

But the best thing to do is to talk to them, and give them agency over what they want to be called, rather than trying to guess what they will or won't like.
child or kid they'll always be your child and you'll always be their parent nothing embarrassing or demanding about it just a fact
15 is a hard age. I was a hormonal kid at that age. I suggest being open to what your 15 Year old wants. Be open. Be supportive. 🙌❤️
I tend to use things like kid/child/teenager/spawn/offspring/youngling. One more year and I'll have to cross teenager off the list though.
I’m in my late thirties and my parents call me their child.
My parents primarily use child (I'm 20 lol) because that's what I feel comfortable with. They also sometimes use spawn to refer to me which I honestly think is hilarious. I would recommend just asking what feels the most comfortable for them. Not everyone is the same and they might not even know what they want to be referred to as yet which is totally okay. Just take it one step at a time.

Also you're doing such a fantastic job using their pronouns! Go you!
The best advice I can offer is to check with them.

Firstly, they may not be ready to be out to a wider group of people yet. If they’ve only recently told you this, you may be among the first to be told, and outing them to other people, even when it’s accidental with no ill intent, can be bad for them. 

Second, not all nonbinary people are comfortable or uncomfortable with the same words being used to describe them, and may even feel differently about the same word in different contexts. Given they’ve told you they have a different name and use they/them pronouns, it’s fairly safe to assume that they’d be more comfortable with gender-neutral words like kid and child, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t like being referred to as your son. 

Third, checking with them about this, especially where it’s unprompted by them, and they’re allowed to decide when they’re comfortable doing so, helps to show that you accept and support them. 

Fourth, keep in mind that what works and doesn’t work for them now may change in the future. If that happens, it might mean that there’s (another) adjustment period as you get used to the changes, but the more you get it right and are seen to be making the effort to do so, the better off they’ll be. Likewise they may not have the answer for the best word to use: I’ve spent a lot of time trying to work out how my niece should describe me, as the usual gendered words don’t work, and the non-gendered ones like “auncle” and “parsib” that I’ve found don’t sound right to me. If none of the words like “child”, “kid”, “offspring”, etc fit for your’s, one possibility would be to reverse how you express the idea: instead of “You/they are my child” something like “I am your/their parent”. 

Fifth and final, despite your best efforts you may slip up at some point and use the wrong name or word for them. While it’d be better if you were perfect (😉), fixing the mistake and moving on without making a big deal of it is the next best thing. And if they spot the error instead of you and correct you on it, same thing: acknowledge the mistake, apologise and move on. A big song and dance about how sorry you are, how you’re really trying hard to get it right… can be embarrassing and may even ring a little hollow, no matter how genuine it is. Moving on and drawing as little attention to the flub as possible is the best way to go. 

That you’re trying to find the best way to do this is awesome. We’d all be better off with more people like you out there. Follow their lead in this and both of you will do great!
I don't have anything new to add, I just wanted to give you a shout out for being an awesome parent! Your child will be your best resource, and you have no idea what an amazing thing you are giving them with your love and support. Good luck xx
I like my parents to use child but I would definitely say just ask because it’s different for everyone
i, 17, would just prefer kid

but you should ask them! everyone is different  
communication is always important, especially in unknown/new situations
Offspring or progeny are fun! make you sound like a space alien :)  


but ask them, they'll be happy to work it out with you I am sure!
I go by child, and asking is probably the best choice, but child/kid are also ok too ;)
My mom uses spawn for me. Or child of mine.
I am 21. But it was a conversation we had before about it
as a nonbinary teen i'd probably like to be referred to as my parents' child, as i feel like the word is regularly used that way anyway. i would recommend asking them specifically though, as they are the only one who can really know
Child could work. Kid also works as they are a minor. I'm nonbinary myself and my mom doesn't know that I'm nb and she calls me her kid and she refers me at times as kid. I love it.
We love a supportive parent! - a nonbinary 19-year-old
My mom calls me her oldest child. I'm 30. It's fine. You get to a point where you know you'll always be her baby. 

Child, kid, spawn, offspring, expensive medical bill, all good gender neutral options for your youth.
You can call them a lot of things that aren't son/daughter without risk of misgendering: youngster, offspring, bud, youth, junior, munchkin, small fry, kid, spawn, successor, apprentice. Pretty much come up with a fun pronoun nickname between you, the choices are endless.
Yo thank you for being a good parent!  
  
My mom calls me and my siblings by our birth order a lot. I'm ""my oldest"" then lil bro is, ""my second kid,"" and so on.   
  
I'm 28 and my folks still call me their kid/child, and in private still use my childhood petname (Stinkweed)- I don't find infantilizing at all, it's just their way of expressing our closeness and I love that we speak to one another that way. Definitely ask your kid!
The ultimate answer is always “ask them”.  But child, kid, etc, are used by many people even talking about their non-trans, adult children!
I would honestly just say talk to them about how they'd like to be referred as. Maybe they have a preference, maybe they don't. You'll never know until you ask. And good on you for asking!!
Depends, but do speak to them about what they're comfortable with.  
""My teenager"", ""My eldest"" (if they are), ""My 14-year-old"", and you can use their name too.  


After reading these comments, I'm going to start calling my three ""offspring"" :-) even though they're binary (M, M, F).
""Spawn, come to the kitchen for dinner!""
Check with your child on what they prefer. Mine is still okay with daughter, but I usually use ""kiddo"" or ""child."" But, mine is going on 12 -- so still young.
I go by ""spawn"" or ""offspring"" jokingly
Honestly, my favourite one with my parents is just ""kid"" but I also love when my mom calls me her ""monster"" haha, so you can get creative with it too! Just ask your kid what they enjoy!
Jokingly: my offspring (your child will appreciate this joke)

But otherwise I think just using their name is good

""Ash did really well on their maths test recently! Yeah they scored 89%""
My parents refer to me as offspring and 
Progeny.
I am 35 and would like my parents to call me their spawn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

jk my parents still call me their daughter, and I'm currently ok with that. I pretty much use she/they pronouns just for other people's comfort.
if you have multiple children you could call them your youngest/oldest.. or as others have said you could say your teenager. but ofc you should ask them these questions yourself
I have my mom use a mix of daughter and kid/child but like 80% child
You sound like such a good parent and I’m glad you’re trying for your kid < 3
Edit: Loin fruit is hilarious
I kinda like being referred to as 'my youngest' by my parents. It's still really personal for them, but isn't gendered. I'm 50+ so there's an added bonus for me which may not work for others quite so well :)
Seems like you dont need help, but I would just like to say thank you for being such a supportive parent
I'm going on 30 and I still identify more with kid than most other descriptors in general 😅 I definitely personally wouldn't mind being called my parents' ""kid"" in conversation. :)
Offspring or progeny (if that applies). I've used these in my life just to be odd.
As a nonbinary person that came out very young and I still live with my parents I had to have a discussion with them on gender neutral terms they call me there child when talking to others even tho I’m older (also it’s so good to see more parents be accepting
spawn is my favorite
I know you already gave an update and it's so awesome how supportive you're being! I wish I coulda come out at that age :' )

I'm an adult, but when I came out to my dad I still asked him to just call me his kid rather than his daughter/son. I also said he could call me his Eldest Spawn but sadly he didn't go with that one 😂
I know you e already gotten a lot of answers but, mom calls me her kid/child. I'm 25, and it doesn't bother me any. She still refers to all of my siblings as her babies when talking about us, and the oldest one is 30. Sometimes when specifying my, she'll say ""the middle one"", which also let's people know who she's talking about.
This might be my parent bc I’ve gone through this exact thing recently, but anyways- some parents try to say that « my kid » or « my child » sounds too young. It’s not.
Can I just stop by to say that it’s really nice seeing a parent actually support their Enby kid’s identity and pronouns, as well as make an actual effort!! 

Thank you, this has made my day better, and I hope your kid realises how lucky they are, amongst enbies and trans people, to have a supportive parent…
I'm in a similar position with my 13 year old and I often say ""my 13 year old,"" or ""my teen kid,"" or ""my older kid."" (I have 2.)
Cheers and thanks for being an ally to your kid!
My mom just pretends I'm not NB and still calls me her daughter to her friends because shes embarrassed 🙃 0/10 do not recommend
Laughing at loin-fruit

&#x200B;

Just to add to the collection, my parents called my sister and me their cuttings (as from plants). At least that's the best translation to english I can find
My parents have always called me their Eldest Spawn. Things like that are always good. I also don't think ""kid"" is demeaning or infantilising, but that's just me personally.
I’m so glad there is parents out there actually looking for help and respecting their kids it makes me so happy
So my dad has always called me ""kid"" or ""kiddo"" growing up, so when I came out as nb, he didn't really have to change it. My mom liked calling me ""girl"" or ""girlie"" so she has had a hard time adjusting. I like ""kid"" a lot, and I'm glad that you and your parents have come to an understanding.
If I was fully out, I’d probably get my parents to use kid or to say something like “my 15 year old” instead of “my daughter”
glad you worked it out! just as another option (I’m twenty) my mom calls me her twenty year old, so you can also go with that! It’s nice to have options :)
If you and they have a sense of humor about the whole thing, you could go with “spawn” or “offspring”. That’s what my mom uses for me :)
i tell my mom to call me her spawn, we think its hilarious
glad you’ve figured it out with them!!! (talking it out was going to be my recommendation lol)

my mother had the same dilemma (I came out as nonbinary/genderqueer when I was 15 as well, I’m now college-aged/young adult for reference), and we talked through terms (settled on “my child/kid/teen/eldest” as gender neutral ways for her to describe her relation to me)

but yeah, in general, I would just recommend keeping an open dialogue about this (and other things, ideally), and listening to what your kid is telling you about their wants and comfort levels. it worked out amazingly for me (I consider my mother to be one of my best friends, we text every day, and I feel respected and heard and loved in the way she treats me) and I am of the opinion that many people would benefit from more frequent respectful conversations about identity and comfort, most of all parents and children :)
As a piece of advice I’d say use their pronouns when you aren’t together, like just say sentences over and over using their correct pronouns and name, addressing them correctly etc. And eventually it should just feel seamless when you use them in everyday life.
Your child is always going to be your child no matter what so it would be normal to just call them your child, or you could just call them by their preferred name. If you’re not sure about it though, I would just ask them what they would prefer you to refer them by
I'm sorry, loin-fruit lmfao

Enby teen here, just go for what they feel is the best, ask, communication is key, make sure you say they can tell you anything/everything and then show you do your best to work with them on those points.
My mom likes to say ""you'll always be my baby, no matter how old you are."" I'm in my 30s and she still does this.
Spawn works.
Lmao I love loin fruit
I use “kiddo” or “my oldest” (or youngest, middle, second child, etc) or “my 16 year old”. I hope this helps, and you are a great mom!
My dad calls me his eldest spawn
Ooh ok. Thank you!
This. Mine is 12 and has said they prefer child or tween. That could very well change as they get older in the same way a child might ask to stop using a childhood pet name later. (I about died when my grandma was still calling me ""Little Miss Muffet"" in public at age 13.)
Behold, my offspring!

But yeah, as others have said, ask them
Thanks! I'm glad I found this community. Yall are so nice.
Thank you! Seems like asking is the way I'm gonna go! It's in 3 for 3 so far. <3
Thank you. I try. I want my kids to know I'm always going to love them and I will never judge who they are.
Thank you so much! I love hearing that from you.
Echo, First of Their Name. I don't knownwhy, but the way you said it, that was the first thing that came to mind.

😄 

Thank you!
Thank you! I like kid but I'll also be asking. You all are so quick with advice. It's much appreciated.
Indeed. They've been through quite a bit in the last year as well and I just want them to be comfortable and happy. 

Thank you <3
Heh. I've used spawn before. 

Thank you so much.
not the younglings!
Huh. I wonder what my parents call me. 

Thank you!
Thank you so much. It is easier in text. They/them feels impersonal to me to say out loud. Thats.my baby, you know? It is a difficult transition. Not emotionally but just retraining my brain. I can’t even remember my own birthday sometimes. I'm so scatter brained. So I am so worried I won't ever be able to be consistent. But I recognize there isn't really any one perfect option. Our language is dumb. A lot of other languages actually already had really good gender neutral pronouns I recently found out.
Thank you. I appreciate the thorough response! I feels.like thank you isn't enough but I hope you all know I really really appreciate it. ❤️
😊 ❤️ thank you!
Thank you! I will ask when they get home. <3
Thank you. I like having feedback from someone close to their age!
Oooh progeny. Feels very powerful lol

Thank you!
Thank you!
Oh nice. I wasn't home when they got home from school so we will have that conversation this evening.

Thank you!
Perfect.  Thank you.
Thank you!
❤️
Thank you so much! 😊
Sounds good actually. To work on it together and make it special. 

Thank you!
Thank you!!
Thank you! 😊
Mhm. We talked about it at dinner. They said kid is fine. Thank you!
My favorite has bee progeny. We talked and we're going with kid for now.

Thank you!
""Alexa, drop in on Spawn's room.""
Thank you 😊
I call them all spawn jokingly. I don't know that I've ever used offspring.

Thanks so much!
I like monster. I use to call them stinky buttface buuuuuut... might be more embarrassing than anything at this point.

Thanks!
Ah. Ok. Thank you!
Super cute!
That is very considerate of you. I wish it wasn't necessary. 

My friend just suggested loin-fruit. We had a giggle fit.
Thank you!
Ooh I see. Thank you!
❤️
That sounds very sweet.

Thank you ^_^
❤️
Yeah it's certainly more on the affectionate side. I do like it.

Thank you! 😊
I think it's cute really. Progeny sounds powerful too. Thank you
I like hearing about other parents being accepting too. Thank you!
It does seem to be popular. Thank you!
Thank you. I haven't cleared reddit for my kids to use yet so if that's you, you're grounded. 😜
❤️  there is WAY too much hate out there. I just don't understand how people have the time. It is so much easier in life to just love and accept.

Thank you
Oh thank you so much. I appreciate another parent's pov too!
I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely won't be doing that. We'll have to take it slow with my mother. She still doesn't understand that they don't like to be touched and have a right to say that so it is one step at a time there, but otherwise we're fairly well set on an open minded family and friend group.
That is super cute. Thank you
Yeah they said kid is fine. I was just wary because I don't want to hurt their feelings. They've had a fairly rough go of the past few years.

Thank you!
❤️
Thank you
Oh I do like hearing from your age group. Thank you so much!
Oh yeah. That's true! Thanks 😊
I think kid in company and loin-fruit in the home is what we've landed on! Thank you!
I like a good sense of humor. Thanks!
That is really amazing to hear. Thank you!
Thank you 😊 I'll start doing this!
Thank you ^_^
We've been using it all day now. It's fun to say.
./nods

Seems legit the best option right?
>Ooh ok. Thank you!

You're welcome!
Mmm. The general consensus seems to be to ask. Y'all have been so great. Thank you 😊
Coming out is a difficult time for them. There are a lot of people online who have been kicked out, abused, prevented from transitioning etc by their parents when come out, and so kids and teens hear all these stories and they're scared it could happen to them. Make sure they know that's not going to happen to them, if you haven't already.
Ooh I like that.  And you are welcome!
No prob here to help
Thank you for making the effort to understand and be good to your kid! Wishing both of you well. :)
Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. No one's perfect and messing up is totally normal. Heck, I've been out as nonbinary for almost 3 years and still mess up my own pronouns from time to time. It happens. As long as you show that you are trying, I promise, it will mean the world. All I ever wanted was acceptance from my parents. The fact that you are on here asking questions and asking for advice, shows me at least that you're trying and putting in effort. Take it one step at a time. You'll get it.
This suggested pronoun nicknaming is more for when addressing them, to others usually ""my kid, my child, my teen""  are all already in standard use
>Thank you! 😊

You're welcome!
You're welcome, and thanks for trying to make your kid feel the most comfortable possible! It's nice to see! 

I think stinky buttface would have been pretty embarrassing as a teenager haha, but id probably just laugh now and play along if my mom called me that now XD
I approve of loin-fruit
it’s really good you made this post! i can tell that you are a great parent :)
That’s- actually quite profound. I think I’ve just come to a realisation, or am coming to one. You say that it’s easier to love and accept — but it isn’t. People’s default is hate and fear… or is it? Maybe some people genuinely find it easier to love and accept? I’ll have to think on this, I’m not sure what it means. 

Maybe that’s what a good person is? Someone that finds it naturally easier to love and accept, than to hate and fear? 

Either way! You’re doing something right xD 
Thank you for the thought-provoking comment!
of course!
I think I have drilled that into all of my kids' heads for years now. That I'm not going anywhere and they should be whoever they want to be. I know it took Echo(formerly David) a long time to believe me. But thankfully we got there now.
Ok gotcha. Thanks again
Maybe what I mean is hate is letting someone live rent free in your mind. Not that it is necessarily easy to choose love over hate. Just that if you do, you have a clearer and easier mind. It really takes up way too much time and energy. 

Speaking as someone who had an immense hatred of someone(not unwarranted. He made my life absolute hell) I can absolutely say that I am way happier now that I just decided to stop giving him that space in my head.
Hi! First off major kudos for trying your best to be accurate and respectful. Might I also suggest avoiding dead naming them moving forward? I understand the attachment to their birth name but other people, those who didn't know them growing up, don't need to know their dead name. :) Also you can totally always go with spawn lol
Thank you! It's wonderful seeing a parent showing so much support and care!
Ah I didn't realize. I was going for clarity like how will people know im talking about them in particular but I guess it would have been implied anyway. 

Thank you!
Of course! It's a leaning curve for sure. It might help to think about it like Maiden names, most who take their husbands last names to introduce their maiden name only their married name. :)

I'm a HS teacher who goes by Mx. this year and the students have been so supportive and affirming. Y'all, we're gonna be alright.		"The only questions they've asked are ""what is it/does it mean?"" and ""how is it pronounced?""

If a new person comes in and notices it on the board, they inform them like ""yeah, duh, don't you know, nbd"" in that wonderful blasé teen way.

I still get many Ms. out of habit and I don't enforce it. Admin and faculty either are affirming or oblivious. 

Really this is all best case scenario in SE US and I'm delighted.
I'm becoming a teacher soon! (Student teaching in the spring).

Have you been using Mx. for long? I'm still toying with the idea of pronouns and honorifics, but Ms./Mx. combo sounds nice to me.
I'm also a high school teacher who uses Mx. and my students have been similarly supportive!
Yo! Middle school Mx. here! There are dozens of us. DOZENS!

But really though, it's great to see how quickly the kids accept it <3
I wish you were my science teacher in school holy shit 😍🥰
That’s a beautiful snake! I’m so glad everyone’s been so supportive, congrats
Mercury?

God damn I meannnn hello tattoos and sexy snek combo 😍🤤
your snek is such a cutie!!!! give that lil snoot a boop for me <3 much love
💚💚💚
What morph is your wee baby snek? I love them
Your tattoos are awesome, your scaly friend is awesome, and you are awesome! =)
That’s so awesome :D good on you and also your students!
I also have a ball python, his name is Arlo and it's awesome because they have no real external differences in gender
I have a ball named Noodle 💜❤️ I hope everything stays awesome :)
Honestly I'm way more impressed that you're a ball python that can teach high school students.
Hey me too. Except middle school. It's on my school ID and everything.
I’m a teacher as well and this semester is the first time I’ve been out with my students. Surprisingly, or not, they get it (and respect it) far more than my colleagues.
That’s wonderful. I teach HS as well and I’ve been thinking about going as Mx. I co-sponsor a GSA and was going to start with my kids there to see how it feels.
Stuff like this makes me really hopeful for the future. Esp in the SE US, it means we are raising kids right. Even if my own generation is mixed due to the generation prior. 

Keep up the good work!
Is that bp a class pet? I love snakes
What is the meaning of the arm tattoos.  What do they represent.
I can’t see Mx and not think MxPx. Anyway, glad things are looking up!
You Mxs are awesome!

Your students must really love you. I met my partner through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates) and an Mx!

I feel very fortunate to have met someone who values and loves their career.
How is it pronounced? It reads like ""mix"" in my head
Second year teacher. Rolled out slow second semester last year. Only observant students picked up but it spread a bit. Everyone seemed chill so I went all out this year.
Nice! The kids are alright.
I KNEW I wasn't alone!
I have the solar system. Trans symbol doubles as Venus, Earth, and Mars. Mercury is sometimes used as nb symbol.
Hello. Thank you 😊
Banana pastel ball python. A good kiddo.
Sssssscience is cool kidssssss
Nice! They used my full name and I'm too lazy for a legal change. Simple sharpie fix.
Gen z needs more credit for their kindness.
Yup!
I have a science sleeve (in progress) that spans atoms to our solar system and the levels of life organization in between. It means I'm a dork.
Yup. Mix. I have a how to pronounce guide of my name on the board.
I've always wondered this too, especially since my husband and I are NB, and have thought about being referred to like that (we just don't know how to pronounce it lol)
Some people pronounce it the same as ""mystery""

"My parents say that i ""won't be taken seriously"" when applying for jobs because of my chosen name on a CV"	"The title may come across as my parents only trying to ""protect me from discrimination"", but read the post for context. (TLDR at the bottom)

I (16) am non binary, and have been identifying as such for three years. my parents are not supportive and continually misgender and deadname me on a regular basis.

I was in the middle of writing a CV as i want to apply for a part time job over the summer (in like a bookstore or a school shop) and i asked my mom to quickly review it to see if there was anything i should add or remove from it. After giving me tips, she noticed my name at the top of the document and told me to change it to my deadname as they ""wouldn't possibly take me seriously with a name like that"".

i prefer not to share my name online for privacy reasons but my chosen name looks like a nickname for my deadname, so it won't be as obvious that i am a trans person but whilst still making me feel comfortable with the name as it is different to my deadname.

my dad agreed with her and told me to change it as it was not ""formal"", everything escalated into an argument. it wasn't even about the job anymore, it was the fact that they don't take my gender identity seriously as it's ""too hard"". it's really not a big ask. i'm not even going to come out at the workplace. literally my tutor, year head and the deputy principal of my school call me my chosen name when that's in a formal setting lmao.

i know i'm valid and they're simply ignorant people when it comes to being transgender and lgbtq in general, and quite frankly they'll never learn, but it's just really hard when you have your primary caregivers trying to dictate who you are and what you should be just because you're their child. i just want basic respect from them.

tldr: i'm aware that the possibilities of facing discrimination as a trans person are there when it comes to jobs, but i'm not exactly outing myself as a trans person at the same time, just as someone who doesn't go by their birth name. my parents think this is an extremely big deal and demand that i use my deadname as i ""shouldn't be taken seriously for my chosen name"" and they mock me for it, not for my protection or anything.

EDIT: i didn't know until now that the word 'transgenderism' is a derogatory term, so i have changed my wording in the sentence it was in - my apologies for that!"	"Put what you want to be called on your resume and job application. Put your legal name on things related to taxes. Any company that would pass judgement on someone solely because of their name isn't a company worth working for anyway.
Will some places judge you on that? Yeah. Do you want to work at the places that won't hire you because of that? Probably not.
I'm NB and used to work in HR.

Weird names get noticed, yes, but I can't imagine it would be judged. If nothing else, those names are more often birth names given by parents than chosen names, not to mention folks from other cultures.

I seriously can't see it being an issue, even a trans-phobic place wouldn't flag it because they'd assume it's your birth name until told otherwise.
[Dr. Marijuana Pepsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Pepsi_Vandyck)’s name—which she was assigned at birth, not that it matters—didn’t hold her back.
I have my preferred name and pronouns on my resume and have gotten work with it. It's possible it will affect the hiring manager's opinion, but so would any other information you choose to list which could appeal to an internalized bias. 

It's just as likely to make your CV stand out as memorable and indicate authenticity.
If I waa an employer and wanted to employ a 16 year-old for the summer I would be okay if their name is Toe or Kelp or whatever. I just expect you to do your entry level job
I mean, my NB child's (12) legal given (by me) name is River. Names are wild now a day anyway. And any parent who says accepting you is ""too hard"" only sees you as an extension of themselves and their ego. I'm sorry your parents are like that. Hopefully, they will come around, but know there is a bug community who loves and accepts you.

*Mom hug* (if you are comfortable with that)
While such discrimination is *probably* illegal, that doesn't mean you won't face it. Realistically, it will reduce your options. That said, it will also help filter out some nasty work environments. Ultimately I'd say it depends on how badly you need the work.
They can fuck off tbh.

Put the name you want to be called by, I doubt anywhere would judge you negatively or take you less seriously for such a thing (and if they did, they wouldn't be worth your time in the first place)
It used to be “cover up tattoos” and other things like that.  Clearly not applicable in this day & age.  Times have changed and you’re right to put a name you’d like to be called on your resume so that if you get the job you can be known by that name.  Otherwise it’s confusing!
[removed]
I worked with someone who only called herself ""Bug"" so I think you'll be fine. She owns her own business now, the name suits her and while I'm aware of her birth name that's just a legal matter & it is just not her name, her name is Bug.
You put your name on that resume.
If someone discriminates based on a name you probably don't wanna work for them anyway.
Start calling them by their first names. 

They will correct you and say it’s their preference or a matter of respect. 

…tell them to do finish that start.
As a professional adult I’ve applied to jobs with my preferred name (I don’t say it that way just put it in the name spot on my resume) and pronouns on my resume and companies that don’t want to hire me automatically self select themselves out. Also have a chosen name that looks like a nickname for my legal name so should be fine
My CV also contains my nickname derived from my birthname and during the sessions revolving around CVs I've had at uni lately none of my tutors or the external professional running the optional sign up workshop specifically about designing a good CV had an issue with this at all.

It's like someone called Charlotte putting Charlie or someone called Robert putting Bob - if it's clearly derived from a longer birthname and is what you prefer to be called I really don't see an issue with it, especially for a Summer job as a 16 year old.
I think applying for my Job with my real name and pronouns actually raised my chance of getting hired.
Oh lord. Listen, a guy named Spoon ran for my local town council last month. It's fine. You're fine.
My name is Pluto my parents told me no one would hire me with a name like that ive had no problem getting hired. None at all. Our parents are transphobic and ignorant for thinking a name is enough to prevent you from getting a job. Do what you need to to be comfortable, how are you supposed to stay mentally healthy if you have to be deadnamed almost daily.
Its hard to say without knowing the name, but let's say it's a short version of a common name such as someone going by Jackie instead of Jonathan or Jacqueline. 


There is bias in job applications based on names (gender, race, nationality,  etc) but I think this vs ""sounding professional"" can more often be a concern when it comes to say hiring white collar profession jobs.  Might a hypothetical ""Jackie"" get turned down for a judge clerk job over a ""Jonathan""? Maybe. But you are talking about like an entry level retail job. You can look around the store first and probably get a sense of the gender/age/racial diversity of a place, and see that for plenty of such jobs will not care about something like a name.  


This isn't to say none will, since some retail can be toxic in all sorts of ways.  It's also certainly not to justify bias in any job.  No one should be judged for their name, gender, orientation, race, etc, but yes it does happen in the real world at all sorts of levels.  But my experience is that at the retail level they care far more about can you show up on time and not lose your temper at a customer. 


This sounds more like (a) your parents like your deadname and (b) are trying to sway you back towards using that full time or at least out in public. Maybe they feel it reflects badly on them, or they don't want others to find out.  Either way it's kind of a backhanded way to put pressure on you to use it, and I'm betting 9/10 times your chosen name will be fine. You could ""compromise"" by putting on the resume you show them, but submit your own name when you actually apply, if that keeps the peace.  If this job will have a name tag (very few do but some will), that can be it's own battle then.


Hope that helps, sorry for this situation and good luck with whatever your new job ends up being.
If you don't get a job because they are transphobic towards you(because that's what it is) then you don't want to be working there anyway.
https://www.advocate.com/business/nonbinary-job-applicants

While illegal in many place, discrimination does still happen. Probably less of an issue for summer entry level jobs. Nicknames are common, and I've also known people with odd legal names. 

Sucks about your parents, working as a clerk in a bookstore isn't that ""formal"" of a job. Queer people working in bookstores definitely isn't uncommon.
 There are people who will accept you even though your parents don’t. Some of the best “gender affirming” comments come from new people calling you exactly what you ask them to. Things will get so much better for you.
Most jobs I've applied for ask for my legal name and then have a field where you can enter what you're called. My LinkedIn has my legal name as well as my preferred name. If anything, it's useful because if someone calls and asks for ""Legalname"" I know it's a scammer.
First of all, you’re not applying to be executive vice president of a Fortune 500, you’re applying for a shitty retail job that probably pays minimum wage. No one gives a shit what your name is. (You WILL, however, certainly face discrimination for being trans throughout your career and even now.) Most people get jobs because they know someone. Do you know anyone who works where you want to work? If so, ask them to get you a job. Many don’t require a resume, you just walk in and fill out an application (or do it online). Use the name you want people to call you. 

(Side note: you’re not writing a CV - or curriculum vitae, which means ‘life’s work’ -you have no life’s work. You’re, at best, writing a resume, but if this is your first job a resume won’t have much on it. What you DO want to get across is that you’re serious, you’re a hard worker, and you won’t flake on them by not showing up or coming in late. You can list any relevant skills or interests you have, like ‘avid reader’ for a bookstore. )
As a hiring manager of many years. 
Your father is speaking from a different time. 
I assure you that you will be fine. 
And in fact better to use the name you want to be called. 
It's very confusing to do an interview or hire a ""Lawrence Smarmy McFancypants III"" and then try and remember to call the person Cole.
I recently went through a hot second between jobs and doing job apps. I put my pronouns (he/they) on my resume. I got hired and I'm starting my new job on Monday.

Job applications are a two way selection process. If you see red flags (like signs they don't respect queer identities, or racist hiring practices, etc) then that's your signal that this is not a healthy environment to work and thrive in. 

If somewhere won't accept you for who you are, you should find somewhere else to be as soon as you safely can. This applies to jobs, to parents, to friends, and damn near everything else.
I do a similar thing where my chosen name is essentially a nickname for my legal name for many reasons. I've never once had an issue with any employer using it as my name and I never had to out myself. The only issue I've run into is if I'm on a phone call some people think I'm saying Beth and not Beck and it makes me wanna die inside lol but really not a huge deal. I just really pronounce the k now. Apparently people don't know how to listen in person either cause I gotta repeat it like 3-4 times sometimes and it's like???? There's literally a musician with this name come on now. Y'all never heard of the letter k?

Anyways lmao, you'll be okay, ignore them. As long as you use your legal name for legal documents that's all that matters. Most employers ask what your preferred name is anyway for your name tag cause a lot of people go by a nickname.
bruh... these modern moms will name their kids everything possible under the Sun. im sure your name isnt the issue at all
If you named yourself, idk, Zagreus or Arson or something I would consider also picking a “work name” that feels decent to you. It probably WILL reduce your job options a bit and might lead to annoyances at work if people pester you about it. 

If your name is something that someone could feasibly have been given as a birth name, though, they’re just complaining about it to complain.
My college roommate was named something that looked like a nickname. If you have a name that is really out there or extremely goofy, I could understand your parents being concerned. However, I think that anyone who is hiring a 16 year old is probably not going to freak out if you are named Van or Li. Good luck with your job!
The way to protect you from discrimination is to do something about the discrimination.  Victim-blaming serves no one except the establishment. 

She's projecting her own bigotry. ""We assume of others what we know of ourselves.""  She knows she doesn't take you seriously as your name, and so assumes no one else will either.

to be -very- precise, most minors do get stuck with the shit name their parents chose for them, but! even the cis can change their names. it's just that parents don't like that. i've noticed that some parents take it as a personal affront if you don't keep the name they gave you, and sometimes has nothing to do with the kid's gender(s) and everything to do with the parents' egos and their perception of their child as an extension of themselves/achievement, so. .... there's that™
use your name.

if a company is going to discriminate against you for that, would you even want to work for them?
no.
I'm openly non-binary at my job. It's a corporate job in the game industry and I've been met with open arms for the most part. I say 'for the most part' because if people have an issue they are keeping it to themselves. 

Will you come across jobs that will judge you and not hire you because of this? Sure, that will happen even if you remain what your parents want you to be. People judge others, it's a fact across the board. However, additional risks come for us, mainly in the safety department. Only you get to decide what you will risk to be who you are. 

I risked my career, and have no regrets. I was prepared to be quietly shifted out, but I've gotten many commendations for my work instead. 

My advise is know the risks and understand the consequences your decisions can have. Then make the best decision for your life. I get you are not an adult yet, but I think we need to let kids make decisions as they get closer to adulthood. In just 2 years you will be a legal adult. 

The world can be a cruel place but it's also filled with so much beauty, tolerance and inclusion. You just have to find where you belong. 

I wish you all the luck OP!
When I applied for my job I put my birth name, thankfully I have a birth name that has like 1000 different nicknames so everyone always asks me "" so do u go by this or this ECT"" and I always can tell them my chosen name, I go by it at work, they don't know that I'm trans and Im scared to tell them (not because I'm scared they will do anything it's just not something I like doing) but on everything important
Your parents are wrong. Put your chosen name on your resume and application. When you are hired, give your legal name on your tax forms. I have the nickname version of my legal name on all of my resumes, email address, etc. etc.  It's what I go by. My legal name literally only shows up on tax forms and doctor's paperwork. 

If they won't get off your back about it, you can tell them to check the Ask a Manager blog, as she'd say the same thing.
Unless your chosen name is something like Princess Bubblebutt - which I highly doubt, based on your description - your parents are just being jerks.  Put whatever name you want people to call you on your resume.  I sometimes put *Legal first name (Nickname) Last name* on mine but that's because I'm ok with both.
Hi! I have a name that is different from my legal name. I put my name and pronouns at the top of my resume and when I’m offered the job I let HR know that I have a different legal name they need to use for legal documents. My mom was confused by what I do when this came up and I explained it to her as I just did. It’s really not a big deal. Some older folks think it’s a huge deal and makes it difficult but it’s not. I just make it clear that my name is my name and use my legal name only when I have to. Any respectable organization will take you seriously.
My name is a gender neutral portion of my birth name (think like ‘Sam’) - I am in my 30s and work as a graphic designer in a corporate finance environment. No one has ever had an issue with my name. People generally don’t care unless they struggle to pronounce a name, and even then it’s embarrassment at their own struggle in that case. 

In my casual summer jobs I worked with a “Moss” - no one was concerned by that name either. Most managers dealing with teenagers are accustomed to working with younger people with different ideas of “professionalism” and having a name you like to be called is normal. IIRC, my last University job made you fill in your preferred name - you had to type out your full name if that’s what you want. If you have to, print a copy with your deadname and let them see that - then hand out your actual name to actual jobs.
Put your chosen name. I have plenty of friends and former classmates being taken plenty seriously as lawyers using their chosen names. Because it is their name.
i can relate to this, i’m going to college in the fall and my parents are not happy about me wanting to live in gender inclusive housing
My mom said similar things when i was writing up my cv but she added that my legal name is required on a cv. I searched up on Google and it gave me several results that you can put your preferred name on your cv, no ""legal name required"" bullshit.
Just put your preferred name on there, parents can't do anything about it.

Edit: This is just a thing i noticed but the cv's with my preferred name were more accepted than the cv with the legal name.
I put my dead name on job applications because I thought it was illegal if I didn't 😭
Tell your well-meaning but stupid parents that I legally changed my name to Rizzo and got into a graduate program as a medical laboratory professional and all my clinical rotation sites love me and call me by my REAL (chosen) name. I've worked in multiple hospitals as Rizzo, both before and after it was my legal name. 

Discrimination 100% exists, but it's also societally frowned upon to discriminate against people. People (hiring managers) like to think they are good, reasonable people, and so try not to discriminate (if they are not raging assholes). 

If you expect discrimination, you will see it everywhere. If you are open to letting people surprise you, you will discover that people are willing to look past what they don't understand a lot of the time. Don't let the media make you believe every trans/enby person is struggling. The fact is, a lot of us are thriving.
Sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders, I’m sure you’ll manage to get one of the jobs you’re going for! And like a lot of others said, any jobs that wouldn’t take your name seriously aren’t places you want to work at anyways. Sorry your parents aren’t getting that.
I have never put my legal name on any resume or CV, I’m 30, and I’ve had many jobs here and there. From part time jobs when I was younger to career jobs.

It sounds like you’re already aware BUT their reaction is definitely based on their own issues and inability to accept you for who you are. Be you, put your real name (not your dead name), go forth and see how many people will accept and respect you!
Ugh you meet cis people with bizarre names all the time and they get hired no problem. It sucks that your parents are like that :/
I (nonbinary adult) initially read just the tldr and I wasn't going to comment because you have received some good answers that I agree with here, but after reading the whole post I realize that your parents sound similar to mine in some ways, and I could share my experiences with them with you. 

My parents were always very controlling. My mother dictated what I was to be called when I was younger. She had specific rules about it; I was only allowed to use nicknames she allowed. Needless to say, I've had to have them on an information diet for what I'll tell them about my thoughts and feelings. There are other reasons for that which I shall not get into here. 

Among the feelings I never had the guts to share with them (until recently) were my feelings about my gender. They don't accept me and are uneducated on all of this stuff. They would never consider using my pronouns and they constantly misgender me. They won't be open minded enough to allow me to inform them of what the truth actually is about these things, and so they will probably continue to be bigots. They also have this thing where ""humor is when we make fun of everyone we say we love, laugh about it, and you can't say anything or do anything because we'll be hurt that you took it seriously."" They'll make fun of funny sounding names, dyed hair, look down on people with tattoos and people who don't believe in their religion ... Most of it absolutely falls under the categories of racism, xenophobia, and transphobia. Because of all of this, my parents will hopefully never know my chosen name. 

About showing your parents your CV: depending on how old they are and when they were last applying for jobs, they might not be the best people to go to for advice. They may have some very old fashioned ideas that aren't really relevant anymore. You also already know that they don't accept who you are, and they are purposely hurting you by not using your chosen name and pronouns. I hate to be the one to suggest this as it is a very painful thought to have, and anyone would want to believe the opposite of their parents, but your parents may not have your best interests in mind. My parents have an agenda. That includes trying to get me to follow their religion and keep control over me. I don't know your parents so I can't say what they want to do. But please be aware that not all parents are the loving people they claim to be.
“Not being taken seriously” is shit that cissies love to hold over our heads. I say, fuck it. Apply with your name, man. If you send out numerous (and I mean maybe 10) applications with no luck, then maybe switch it up. You’ll never know if you don’t try. Chances are, since you’re 16 and applying to a summer job (and you didn’t mention it being work-study or an internship) it doesn’t matter what you’re name is.
As someone who's been in change of hiring, I can tell you that the name is nearly the last thing I look at, and frequently forget the candidate's name in favor of looking through expirience.

You name isn't going to hurt your chances, finding a job at 16 with no previous work expirience will though. The toughest hurdle is getting that first job, but it's going to have nothing to do with your name. As someone who's hired high schoolers- make an impression, be kind, be eager, be enthusiastic, and it's okay to reference that you are nervous at a job interview. 

Best of luck, and sorry about your parents. Peace and love- they likely have no idea what it's like nowadays. 


On a morally grey note- I'd be most likely to hire someone like you out of other equally qualified candidates.
Inclusivity hire feels bad, like being a token, but God damn is that a real phenomenon AND a foot in the door. It's okay to use it, and I'd encourage it if the company/interviewer feels like an ally.
I haven’t changed my name, but I am in a highly professional position and out as non-binary. They’re full of shit, and you’re absolutely fine.
I used to work for the state government (parks & rec) with a preferred name as well as my legal one.  If the old park rangers could handle it and the state bureaucracy could handle it, I bet pretty much any job you pick can handle yours too.
I put my chosen name on my résumé’s when I was applying for jobs. It also sounds like a nickname. (My legal name is now the formal version of it but I still go by the nickname all the time and would still put it on a resume.)

It never caused me any issues.
Honey, I work in CONSTRUCTION, and these burly, hairy, sweaty, constantly-spitting dudes and dudettes have ZERO problem calling me by my chosen name. I'm starting to find that many of these companies now have a place in their record keeping specifically for chosen names. I've worked with hundreds of different people at this point and exactly one person gave me a hard time. So I stopped working with him. Your parents are lame and making up lame things to try and keep you from doing your thing because they don't want to be embarrassed. They aren't actually worried about your feelings at all but they don't want to admit that. This is a really common way people try to ""nicely"" control people they are close to.

Tldr: You do you, boo!! You's a star!
Do it anyway. You don't want to work for someone who wouldn't hire you for your name anyway.
I always put my prefered name/s (I still haven't decided on a name but i usually put the name I am currently using/testing) on the very top in big font on my resumes. And then i put the legal stuff and contact info in the smaller font under it, like my legal name, my email, and phone number. I also include my pronouns. 

(Name)_______.

(Pronouns).

Legal Name: _______.

(Contact info).

This way I can make sure they know that the name I will be using at work is different from my legal name/deadname, and that I use certain pronouns. If they are thrown off by that at all, I know they don't have the same values as me and I know not to go forward with the job. My advice is to not accept a job offer where they state that they cannot use your specified pronouns and name, and they will only be using your legal name and pronouns associated with your gender assigned at birth. Even if it's a good paying job/internship, it's not going to be good for your mental health and overall job experience.  

They will need your legal name as part of the requirements for the background check, if applicable (not all jobs do this), but for the most part, many jobs use nicknames for their employees anyway, so there really shouldn't be an issue concerning them using your name instead of your deadname (unless you're in a formal setting or a government job). 

I say go ahead with putting your chosen name on your documents, but keep in mind that at some point your legal name will come across, so make sure to tell someone that you don't use that name. 

Good luck!
Hi! I occasionally get to review résumés (CVs) for new hires at my job, and the name is literally the last part I let myself look at so I don’t form impressions based on unconscious bias. That said I’m always very happy when a resume I have already found impressive has an usual, unique, or otherwise “weird” name at the top…because I’m a big weirdo and am most comfortable around other weirdos.
Having an unusual name could very well help you land the job that you’ll be happiest in anyway, and if it keeps ignorant ass hats from taking you seriously, well, you didn’t wanna work for those losers anyway.
your parents are full of shit and also abusive
When I read your title, I thought your name might be Sock or something (cool name, but yeah that resume is probably getting thrown out). But dude, a nickname to your deadname?? I see absolutely no reason why that wouldn’t receive as much respect as the full name itself.
The same thing could be said for any name that doesn't conform to dominative cultural practices and norms, whether they're chosen or given. Frankly, the idea that they mock you for having an ""abnormal"" name doesn't just signal transphobia to me but a disrespect for anything non-normative, if not some latent bigotry even beyond trans people.

I'm sorry your parents are being transphobic. I trust you know all this--especially because you said so, yourself--but just a reminder.
Your first sentence gives it away.  Your parents are transphobic and everything they say or do while having this mindset is just going to be to either an effort to turn you straight or hurt you.  Especially anything having to do with your name, identity, or expression.
put your chosen name. i am in my late 20s and have done hiring processes - i barely look at the name when i’m sorting through resumes. especially for a part time job as a teen, you’re totally fine. if a place judges you for that, i promise you don’t want to work there!
Make someone who support you check your CV instead of your parents, and when they think everything is OK apply to the job anyways. Better if they're someone who know about the topic (maybe someone working on human resources?), or if they have knowledge on queer stuff (like my psychologist, yay! :D). Yet better if both. You may have to lie to your parents saying you ""obeyed them"" and used your deadname, but the risk is worth taking imo

&#x200B;

Btw, your parents don't love you. Sorry for being too direct, but the truth must be told. If they did, they would respect your chosen name and pronouns, and make sure you feel supported by them. However, as I always say to queer people with unsupportive families: chosen families can be better than biological ones. Even if it's just internet friends on Discord or the like, find people who support you, who care about you and love you. There are lots of queer servers and chats out there, and if the cyberworld isn't your thing, I'm sure you'll find company in your local queer group
Your chosen name isn't something like ""Moonbeam"", right?
I’ve gone by a name completely different from my given name for my entire adult life. It has never given me a significant problem at work. Schools gave me a hard time sometimes, but I’ve never once been given a hard time with it from a job.
I read once that statistically, shorter names have more success in the workplace. 

If your parents can call someone ""Mrs NewNonMaidenName"" after that person gets married (yes I'm using an old traditional example - the parents are old traditional), they can call you by your chosen name.

Usually it's not that it's difficult, it's that it messes with their tiny minds.
My parents made me cut my hair before getting my green card picture taken and before applying for jobs. I would have my goal-length by today, twice over probably, if it wasn’t for that.

I feel like parents’ reaction to injustice is “just don’t belong to the oppressed group lol,” which is annoyingly pragmatic, but also very invalidating
So my sibling wanted their name to be Ender and I put a stop to that because I do want them to get a job. 

Their name is still very unique but now we can point to our French roots. 

It sounds like your name is an actual name. Many people today have “nicknames” for names- I’ve had mine for 31 years. 

Your parents are wrong.
some job applications actually have a place to put your preferred name. so while some may not like it, others won’t have a problem. just depends on the employer.
If it's any consolation -- my gf (20 & non-binary) applied to a (really good job) with their very stereotypical non-binary noun name and got it with no questions asked. That's not to say people never discriminate based on names, but things are definitely changing for the better
Never ask you parents for resume or career advice. Go to your school counselor or a younger teacher or even a peer who already has a job. 

First, the kind of jobs that you'd be applying for are really struggling to find worker's right now. 

Secondly, most business now ask if you'd like to use a preferred name right on your job application. 

Third, kids your age have ridiculous names! I would know because my daughter is your age and she had a classmate named Moxie in first grade. I knew someone who named their kid Ryder after Rider on the Storm, the Doors song. I've worked at all kind of customer service jobs and come across some really, really awful names. 

TLDR; your parents are wrong and no one is going to care. Apply with your chosen name.
Honestly, I meet cis people all the time who work in a formal setting who have odd sounding names 🙄

It’s very common practice where I live for people of Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern and Slavic descent to have their legal given name, and then a westernised chosen name because it’s “easier” for people to understand. No judgement for the names they chose at all but I have seen everything from Ken and David to Tiara, Noddy, Silver and Strawberry. These have all been people I’ve met in upscale hospitality, office settings and emergency relief.

If cis people with names like these can be not only considered but hired, then you have absolutely nothing to worry about. If the issue they have is with your name then you can rightfully assume they are choosing not to consider you because they’re transphobic or homophobic. I don’t know where you’re from Ofc but if you’re discriminated in this way in Australia, it is in fact illegal. In the end you don’t want to work in that kind of environment anyway.


From what I’ve taken from what you’ve said, I’m sorry to say that it probably won’t matter what name you choose, how you present or what you do, your parents will take issue because of their uneducated bias. 

Hold firm to who you are and remember this is your life to live and not theirs. It may sound harsh but this took me 28 years to learn: if they can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t deserve to be in your life anymore. For the protection of your own mental health, please consider whether you want this kind of energy around you or not.

I wish you the very best my enby sibling 💜 

Peace, love and jellybeans xx
My full legal name is a nickname for a much longer name. I get asked if it's short for anything all the time, and I just say no. But besides that it's never been an issue at all. So I dont see why youd have any trouble if it's easy to pass as a nickname for a longer name.
Yeah fuck that. Do what you want. Yeah it can make things a bit harder depending on where you are but it can be worth it to not be dead named at work. I know a lot of applications I've done recently had a place for both legal name for tax reasons and a ""nickname or preferred name"" kinda category. And also if you're applying to places like a book store you'll be fine. My bf worked at Barnes and noble for a while even in a relatively conservative town in texas and he said he has almost no cis het coworkers lol.
They’re being bigoted and aren’t in touch. Your name isn’t a problem anywhere else it seems, just to them.
I had a teacher in middle school who went by a completely different name then hers. She just did not really like her name.

On official documents her birth name would show up and everyone would go ""huh? Who is that?"" because literally no one knew lmao.

But honestly, if you are not out and need a reason to why you go by another name just tell them something like ""oh i don't really like my name because it reminds me of something sad / someone that passed away"" or ""oh kids at school used to make fun of me for my name so i don't really like to use it anymore"".
All I got to say is, I got poached on LinkedIn with my first name listed as Jeneni and my pronouns listed as she/they as I’m non-binary transfemme and obviously not afab. You do you!
If it’s a place worth working the name you put on your professional-looking resume isn’t going to make it suddenly “unprofessional.” Cheering you on as you apply!!
Just want to chime in as someone with an unusual chosen name that I got a job with no issues. My name never came up - my employer was more concerned about my skills. I had a legal name change by then but they gave me the job before I sent any legal documents (and HR handles that anyway so thankfully no one in my department has seen my birth certificate). The funny thing is, even though my last name is more like a first name which I thought would be a dead give away, I still get asked ""How did your parents come up with your name?""
We were told in one of my classes that nothing relating to gender should be put on my resume. I put it on there anyway because it lets companies self-filter. If you have a problem with me being non-binary I don't wanna work for you anyway.
Let's take the practical approach: e.g. : Legal / registered / official passport  name is Nicholas. But please call me Nicky when at work.

Perfectly simple and  keeps it all largely in the middle. If someone has a problem with that you keep it simple by asking why. And if they answer - whatever answer- you keep on asking why. Un-arm any army with asking - . > WHY < ?
my heart goes out to you and i totally support your decision with the chosen name! it’s your life, your cv and your decisions regarding it!
I have my now legal name on my resume, and it does not always match the perception people have of me. I have lost job opportunities because of this, and I have still gotten jobs cause I like to think I have a pretty good resume for my age. If the name is such an issue use a letter abbreviation but honestly, it is not the make or break of getting a job and it will always be more difficult if you are trans. My best advice is to try and connect to those hiring. Bring your resume in mid day when managers are typically out if possible, email the group if that's alowed, make a good impression cause at the end of the day that got me more jobs and interviews then anything else.
yeah i know i have to use my legal name for certain things like that but this is just for how i want to be addressed at the work place, nothing else lol
My go-to solution is (first initial). (Preferred) (Surname)

So like if my birthname was John but my chosen name is Jane, I’d put “J. Jane Doe”.

It makes it clear that there’s a legal first name, but the only name that actually appears anywhere (other than legal things) is the preferred. In my experience, it helps prevent confusion. And it also doesn’t necessarily out you because there could be any number of reasons a person doesn’t go by their legal first name.
This. I put my legal name only on the few documents that absolutely require it. Everything else has my chosen name and no one has ever had a problem with it. If they do, you don’t want to work for them anyway because that would be the beginning of a long line of mistreatment from them.
This is not good advice at all. You don’t know which country this person is from and unfortunately if the work is really necessary. If necessary the name might make a difference and unfortunately people might not hire them for that reason. It would be amazing if people didn’t care about it and respected others for who they are but that’s not the real world.
yeah it all comes down to not wanting to work at a place with people who will treat you differently just because of a name
toe 😭
*accepts mom hug*
""Realistically it will reduce your options"" for a part-time job? Incredibly unlikely. A quarter of Gen Z use they/them pronouns and plenty of people use gender neutral or even opposite gender nicknames who are not trans.
I lived in a very white middle class area for a long time. I moved and got a job in a bigger city, and asked about the dress code because my previous employers had been really strict about it. My manager was like, ""ah, well, you're not allowed to have facial or neck tattoos and can only have facial one piercing, but honestly we're an urban store location so we'll probably overlook it"" LOL
This is the right answer tbh
I'm really, really surprised about how far I had to scroll for this comment. At 16, you're not applying for anything ""formal"" in the slightest; you're applying for retail or food service. They need a warm body manning the register, so they genuinely do not care what you're name is.
no. it's three letters long and if you were to look it up online plenty of other people use it as a nickname.
People go by different names all the time, or middle names, etc. It isn't something that is unique to trans people. Think somebody who goes by Matt, but their name is Matthew, or Mike for Michael. (sorry, these are just examples from my work, off the top of my head, I work in IT, lots and lots of dudes)
I mean, if that's the case, you could introduce yourself like this: ""Hi, my name's (deadname), but I'd really prefer if you called me (nickname)."" (I apologise if this comes off as rude by any chance, I'm rubbish at social interactions)
Great advice.
Well that’s just simply not true.
A quarter...? That alone so baldly, openly wrong that I don't really need to address it. And am not sure why I am, but whatever.

Regardless, even in my extremely aggressively trans-friendly city I receive noticeably fewer responses when I put my pronouns on my job application, so I'm not sure where that's coming from. Ideally you'd be right, and I get the culture in this sub is to be positive, but this person is asking for legitimate advice and society still sucks.
Then it sounds like they're just being disrespectful of who you want to be at the moment and they're trying to keep themselves closeted or in denial.

I'd just put whatever your chosen name is on the CV and only use your legal name for taxes and other legal documents. 

This could also help weed out shitty employers. You don't want to get the job only to realize you're surrounded by bigots.
yeah exactly that's what i was thinking. im not even going to come out at work or anything, im literally just going by a different name to my birth name. that's it
My son's dad has a nickname that isn't even remotely close to his first or middle legal name and only ever goes by that. We worked together for a full year before I knew his legal name was different and we only found out because our boss called him that on the loud speaker intentionally to piss him off. Also a lot of people go by their middle name. My brother actually has a first and two middle names. He's only ever gone by one of his middle names. Plus plenty of Drews who are Andrews, Richs, Dick, Ducks that are Richard, Bills that are Williams. It used to be a common thing for Johns to have Jack as a nickname, etc.
There was a study from the UK that said almost a quarter of Gen Z uses they/them pronouns and half of Gen Z includes their pronouns in things like email signatures. That doesn't mean 1/4 of people are non-binary, because this would include people who are cis who use they/he, they/she and any/all pronouns. However that is still a really large number of people.
It's been widely reported in the [media,](https://www.joe.co.uk/life/nearly-a-quarter-of-gen-z-now-identify-using-a-non-gendered-pronoun-such-as-they-them-study-finds-390943) the study was performed in the UK. I can't find an original source for it but my daughter is Gen Z and a lot of her friends are trans or non-binary. There are a lot of people who use they/he, they/she and any/all pronouns that would be part of that.

The OP didn't even say anything about putting their pronouns on their resume, they asked about putting a chosen name on their resume which is super common for people of all genders and doesn't even necessarily indicate that they are trans or non-binary. 

The culture in this sub often isn't positive and what is irritating to me is a lot of us don't have the privilege of being able to hide our identities.
Terrible example I know, but if Newt Gingrich could be taken seriously, I cannot imagine any nickname you could pick that would do what ‘newt’ could not and unserious you out of the work force. 

(I hope the name you go by is not newt. But [newts](https://www.britannica.com/animal/newt) are cool. I like newts. They didn’t deserve Gingrich.)
You are going to need to link this study. What’s the sample size? That doesn’t match up with peoples real life experience.
Oh yes, JOE, a ""social media publisher,"" citing ""a study"" without in any way linking to it, saying who did it, where it was published, why is valid, whatever. You might as well say ""my uncle Joe said it and he's a scientist and has gay friends."" Friendly media like JOE is less likely to actively try to hurt us, but that's not the same as being about to just assume anything they ever publish is true.

And to be clear, I don't have that privilege either. Getting the interview does seem to be more difficult than getting through it, though, at least in my experience, and my birth name is also my real name and is gender neutral by means of obscurity, so via pronouns on my resume are really the only point of reference that I have. I came out before I entered professional life so I can't use that as my point of comparison, and I've always had my current name so I can't use that either. We can pretty easily infer that their chosen name would be a tell that they're nonbinary, or they wouldn't be asking this question, and obviously-nonbinary pronouns are an effective proxy in this case. I think you already knew that, though.
The study was in the UK can had over 2000 participants.
No I think you're just a negative and sad person who wants everyone else to be negative and sad too.
Again, link please.
lol, okay.

One of my kids came out as non binary	Hello, I'm a mother of two lovely kiddos 🥰 My 15 year old son (Correct me please if I'm using wrong terms, I'm  not used to this and am looking to understand) has come out as non-binary and wishes to use they them pronouns. I totally support them! And I want to be the best parent I can for them, but they're very awkward about talking to me as they're closer with their father. Does anyone have any tips on what I can do for them to make them more comfortable? I've started using their new name and pronouns but I want to be able to accommodate them more. Thank you for reading if you came this far 🥰☺️	"With using their new name and pronouns, you are on the best way! Maybe try to not use terms like 'son'. Try to stick with more gender neutral terms like kid or child. But overall, everyone has different need and just try to listen to your kid if they don't like something you're doing. Or talk with their father about it, if he's closer to your child. Maybe he does know more about their needs :)
in terms of using son just ask, if they’re comfortable with you using son then that’s great and it works out, and if they aren’t maybe just ask what they would like you to call them.
I agree with what everyone else is saying here. It’s really best to just ask them what they’re comfortable with if you’re ever unsure. Open communication and acceptance makes this whole thing a lot easier for us. I, personally, wanted to change my presentation after I came out. I cut my hair and got a couple of new items of clothing. Your child may or may not want to do something like that, so it may be a good idea to ask at some point. Also, it’s a good idea to ask before you out them to anyone else. It’s always stressful to be outed to someone before you’re ready to tell them.

Also, I’d just like to add that you seem like a really great parent. Thank you for being so accepting. It’s really nice to see. My family weren’t great about this and it was really damaging to my already poor mental health, so I’m really glad your child will have better support. I wish my family had been more like you. 💙
definitely do some research and ask if they need anything, clothes, make up whatever. my gaurdian did research and uses my chosen name on birthday cards etc, i told her i bought a binder and she helped me with with sewing to make it fit better and told me she saw online i shouldnt wear it for too long etc. just the taught that she went out of her way to inform herself on my gender and safety binding made me feel more supported than ever.
Try to space out questions and ask if they’re okay answering them! People have great suggestions here on asking them, however, for me, I don’t like being bombarded with too many questions or questioned at not the best time so make sure they’re okay with the timing of your questions, too!

when i came out to my partner, they didn’t have questions at the time, but later asked if i was okay answering a few things they were confused about. i felt cared for that a) he wanted to ask questions and b) that he was allowing me the space to say no if i wasn’t up to it. 

i think it’s great you’re here at all, trying to navigate something different for you. thank you for being willing to learn 💜
Welcome to the sub. It warms my heart that you would come here to ask questions. I'm 29 and still deep in the closet stuck living as my agab due to medical descrimination and the fact that nobody I know in real life will even know what I'm talking about... ah well.

I wish one of my parents were like you.

Try to space out your questions for your kid, try to use neutral language whenever possible. Ask permission to ask questions, because sometimes questions can feel invasive and overwhelming. 

Maybe offer to take them for a shopping spree and let them pick out whatever they want for their new wardrobe. A lot of us want to change our gender presentation when we come out... but be understanding if they say no for now. Sometimes we want to take our time and do it piece by piece. 

And I'm afraid to say it... but your kid is going to experience harassment and bullying. There's no way out of it. It's just going to happen. The school might (probably, honestly) try to blame them for it so they don't have to deal with it. It'll be your job to go to bat for them. Be their best supporter, best defender.
Child*

Glad you're supportive, that's so sweet!!! 🥰
I’m just so thankful they have a great support system! You’re already supporting them in the best way you know how.

Your child is so lucky to have you and your husband as parents. Thank you!
Ask your child what words they want used for them (ie “son”)  who they want to know they’re non binary (don’t out them to extended family if they aren’t ready) and take them shopping!!!!
As many other wonderful comments have said, just ask what they’re comfortable with! It’s gonna be a bit awkward, but trust me, they’ll appreciate it so much
Fellow enby mom here. I’m a couple of months ahead of you in this. One thing I’ve found is to ask questions via text. Then, my offspring (their preferred term) can answer at their leisure and it doesn’t have to be awkward face to face. You could ask them if this would be an acceptable option. Or maybe you could write down all of your questions and email it or give it to them and they can answer as they feel comfortable.  Once my kid has seen that I’m very serious in my support, it has been less awkward for them to answer questions, although some of it probably stems from actually having thought about some of the questions I’ve asked too. Figuring out their preferred terms to be addressed as was the first thing we tackled. Next was who they wanted to have know, if they were going to come out publicly, whether they wanted my help coming out, etc. Third was dealing with their image via clothing and hair changes.  It is a lot for everyone to deal with, but you’re doing great. One thing I learned is how gendered and binary my language was. I’ve had to really work to not do that anymore and to find more neutral terms in many situations.  DM if you want to talk or want some online support resources.
the biggest and most important part of my transition as a nonbinary person was to let go of ideas i had about what being trans was like and what it means to not be male or female. the most important thing was and is to be myself and to do what I need to be happy, even if it's not what someone expects out of a trans person.

it would make my journey smoother if others would also unpack their ideas about gender! now is as good a time as any to ask yourself questions like: what are men and women? how do I know I'm the gender that I am? why do i participate in the gender roles and presentation (eg the clothes you wear) that i do?

you are already doing great!! using a person's pronouns and name shows you care. when I meet someone who doesn't use my pronouns even when they should know them i know they do not listen to me
You are already on the right path, supporting you child and creating that openness is the best thing ever. Let them know you support them and are inclusive. As questions from a learner space and not a challenging one. 🥰🥰🥰
Love how caring of a parent you are :)) Just ask them about how they want to be referred to. All nonbinary people are different and some might be okay with language that others aren't. Having an open dialogue with your parents is so important, especially as a NB kid.
I say, “my kid” when referencing them in general conversation. I try to refer to my child by their name they’ve chosen as much as possible to reaffirm both for them and my brain. You’re doing great!  You’re gonna slip up sometimes and that’s ok, they just want to see us trying and supporting them.
Just ask them! They know themselves best. If they are ok with son then keep using it, it they change their name then try to practice using it with someone else to get used to it. 

All in all, keep yourself in check, please don’t be like my parents where they speak incorrectly so freely that they don’t even catch the mistakes.
You can also refer to your child as your ""oldest"" or your ""youngest"" depending on how old your other child is. I'm nonbinary and I'm the oldest of two, so sometimes I'm my parent's kid, their child, or their oldest. 

You seem very accepting and I love how you immediately started using the right pronouns. You seem like a great parent!
Hi there! 23 year old nonbinary person here, thanks for being an awesome mom! If you want to know more about what nonbinary gender is and what it might mean for your child I can't recommend enough the zine ""How to Support Your Nonbinary Family Member"" by Alyssa Giannini. The author is also non-binary and expresses so many of the things I want my parents to know when I come out to them including how to navigate discussions about gender with your child. It's available free from their website [here](https://www.alyssagiannini.com/nonbinaryzine) Hope this helps!
You are an amazing parent for respecting your child! I wish more parents were like this!
As an NB mom of an NB child, might I suggest crotch goblin or womb fruit? Instead of son, daughter, etc. I sometimes just use kiddo too, or product of my loins, or Homefry to my hash brown. Honestly, I think the best way to handle it is just to find terms you’re both comfortable with, that convey your love to each other in ways that feel good. They don’t always have to be your typical titles, have fun with it! 💕💕
My child is 16, and they came out as non-binary about a year or two ago. I mess up, I used she/her with them, but we talked and I told them that I am actively trying. 

They loved that. They said if I use she/her, it’s okay, bc I was their daughter for 15 years and it’s a hard habit to break. But I correct myself without apologizing, and it’s getting a lot easier with time. 

I had to talk with their dad about things he’s said and such. Learning and being active about educating yourself is the best step!! Just let them know that you’re accepting and trying your best. It makes it easier all over if you don’t beat yourself up over missteps.
Just have a talk with them. Ask if they are okay with terms like “son” or “daughter” or if they prefer totally neutral ones like “child”. Ask if there is any ways that you can help them out, if there’s anything they have questions about (you may not know the answer but you can help them research and find the answer), or if there’s anything bothering them. The most capable person of answering a lot of your questions is gonna be your kid themself.
On top of what others said, sometimes there's a tendency for trans kids to be a bit self-conscious and expect the worst, like expect ignorance or transphobia from family, and when you expect it you might find it where there is none, or maybe there is SOME but nothing major, and something you could easily stop if they tell you.

So what I'm saying is, if you say or do something and your kid gets really upset and you don't know why, tell them something along the lines of:

""I love and accept you for who you are, and I'm not trying to hurt you. Just tell me what the problem is and we'll work through it. I don't mean any offense and I want you to feel comfortable being you at home and around me.""

And don't feel terrible even if they seem super upset. You sound like you're trying your best and that's all you can do - just don't add drama where there doesn't need to be any. Don't be upset with your kid - just be patient.
You’re doing great!! Among all this other great advice, make sure your kiddo knows that you accept them and are doing your best with pronouns and such. Maybe even show them this post! Knowing that someone is doing their best is a huge thing, even if they mess up sometimes
I am 15 and nonbinary just like your child. I can give some advice based on the stuff that my mom doesn't do;

I recommend not using gendered terms like 'son' (unless they clarify that they're alright with you using that term, some NB people are comfortable with terms like son, daughter, etc). use gender-neutral terms. My father always refers to me as his 'youngest' like ""My youngest is nonbinary"" or ""My youngest is really into KPop"" (can be substituted with eldest if he is older). 

From my experience, don't be sad when you get corrected. We know that it can be difficult to adjust and there's no need to beat yourself up about it, it's always about your intentions. Also, if you mess up and you happen to catch your mistake, you don't have to be overly apologetic, just a simple ""sorry"" and immediately correcting your mistake will do. 

If someone is doing or saying something that is transphobic, stop them immediately, no matter how small it is. It could be as small as simply refusing to use the correct name and pronouns. If they continue to be disrespectful then leave them immediately, don't let them have another chance to be disrespectful to \*your\* child.

The most important thing is to just \*talk\* with your child (or their father if they are unavailable) to find what's comfortable with them and what will make them feel heard, validated, and accommodated. Talk with them about what to say when someone who doesn't know about their identity change, like if they want you to correct that person or not. Ask how they want to be referred to. 

May I add that I think you are a very good mother! I wish my mother had done what you did and just simply \*asked\* me about stuff. I wish you and your family nothing but happiness <3
There is a wonderful Instagrammer named Jeffrey Marsh who is a great source of information, inspiration and loving messages!
Something I wish my parents would do is just sit down and talk about it with me. Every person is different and has different preferences.
Just showing your support and asking them what they want and need might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it's the best way to know for sure that you are giving them the support they need.
Just being on here and asking questions shows how supportive you are and how much you're trying, I wish more parents could be like you. :)
It is important to make sure you do not out them to someone your child may not have wanted knowing. Have an open conversation with them and ask whether or not they want other people to know. They may want you to use their old name/pronouns around a specific person because your child may not want them to know that they are nonbinary. It is in your best interest to have your child have full control over who they come out to and when. This includes even the people closest to you.
Absolutely affirm their choice of pronouns, terms, and name. Another thing that I personally think is important for a teen is to tell them ""If after a while with these changes you decide to do something different, like use female pronouns or ones like Xe/Xer, or ANYTHING else, I will be understanding and follow your lead. This is your journey and I don't want you to feel trapped in one identity just because it's the first one that felt right. I love you and will learn whatever I need to in order for you to live as your happiest self.""

It helps because a LOT of Enby journies go in stages. Some kids eventually decide to go back to older pronouns or try new ones.... I like to think of gender identity as trying on clothes to find your personal style. Young people can worry they already asked a big change and feel like they can't keep evolving for fear that their parent will be frustrated that it keeps changing..... Being forthright and unconditional can be a huge weight off.
Using their name and pronouns is huge. That will build trust for them to talk more. Use it even when they aren't around and as long as they are ""out"" with others reframe politely when people get it wrong. 

Example, using random names: 
Them: When Jack said that he could...
You: Jay. 

Also, I'd ask:
I thought you might prefer a more gender neutral term that son- how should I describe our connection? Is child ok?

I personally still use my gendered terms like Mom and wife but use they/she pronouns.  

Try not to say anything about it being hard/difficult. Instead thank them for their patience and for helping you learn and grow. 

You've done the most important thing already: you've cared.
Communication is key! ask them if they want to be referred to as a sibling (if they have siblings) and maybe refrain from calling them your son
Nobody here can tell you if ""son"" is correct or not. Ask your kid.
The best way to know what they're comfortable with is  by asking them. you're already trying to use their new name and pronouns which is great. but you might want to sit down and talk to them to see if they would prefer gender-neutral terms like child or offspring . Or they still okay with the term son.
I’m so happy that you’re actively seeking ways to accommodate your child! Just keep in mind that it’s ok to make mistakes, you don’t need to feel like a slip of the tongue is the end of the world. Yes it can be painful for your child sometimes, but if they know you’re trying and especially if you immediately correct yourself, then just the effort alone will really make your child feel more comfortable and seen. Just a bit from my experiences as an enby (nonbinary person) who has been out since I was 16.
Another option to avoid using gendered language that I haven't seen brought up in this thread (that being said, I haven't read all the replies so I may be wrong) is to say ""my 15 year-old"". But as others have mentioned, the best course of action is to just ask them what they prefer 🙂 other than that, you seem to be doing well so far with what you have mentioned, so just remember to celebrate the small victories
With a lot of nonbinary people, gendered language like ""son"" for example doesn't make them feel all too good and I'm guessing your kid using they/them pronouns is a way to break free from gendered language so that's something you could keep in mind. But everybody is different and the only way to know for any individual what they're comfortable with is to ask so I'd say the best thing you can do is to talk to them and ask what words they're comfortable with and go from there.

And as other people also already said, research is good and it shows clear desire to understand. One important thing also is that they're probably also still learning about their identity and exploring what it means to be nonbinary. Which I think we all are tbh 😂
Ask if they want to expirament with more affeminite looks, if they want to go shopping for clothes, offer your help with makeup, outfits, and jewelry. If they want a gender therapist or to go on hormones, help them eith the process
Say child, not son.
Okay, I'll definitely talk to their father about it :) Thank you for your reply!
A few more: kiddo, youngster, love, dear,offspring, sweetie, my pride and joy.
Okay, will do. Thank you!
I'm really sorry your family wasn't accepting 😢 I can't imagine how tough that could be. And thank you for the advice! I'll definitely talk to them and their father more about this. You've been very helpful 💙💙
Noted! 💙 Thank you
I'll definitely keep this in mind, thank you so much 💙💙 You're so helpful! And I only wish the best for my kids, I wish to learn as much as I can about them 🥰
We will do whatever it takes to protect our kid from any sort of harassment for sure! We take bullying very seriously and will make sure they're only doing their very best when interacting with their peers. We have a strict policy about the kids telling us parents or a trusted adult who can contact us when they're experiencing any sort of bullying or harassment, and it's worked very well in the past, and I hope my child doesn't feel awkward or scared to tell me about it.
Ah, sorry, I'm so used to calling them that - will definitely try to get better at it 🥰
Of course, me and my hubby are very supportive of whatever makes our kids happy! 💙💙
We have just finished having that discussion 🥰💙 It went very well!
Yes, absolutely. We sat down and had a really good, deep chat about what their preferences were and they really opened up! I'm so glad they feel comfortable and happy 🥰 And I will definitely take your advice when it comes to neutralising my language 💙
💙💙
I love those ideas! I'll definitely discuss that with them later 💙💙
I showed them the post during our conversation and they were extremely happy to see that I was using their pronouns and that so many people had responded who felt exactly like them. They're beyond happiness!
I absolutely agree with you, and I'm so grateful for your advice. We've had a long talk about it but I'll ask them if they're up for some more questions later as I'm still trying to understand. Again, thank you!
I'll look into that! <3
Definitely!! Whatever would make them happy and comfortable 💙
Apologies, I'm very new to this and I'm not sure how to phrase myself. Me and my child talked about it though, and they said it's okay but they prefer child :)
You can ask if they want you to correct others as well. It can be hard doing it all on your own. It can be embarrassing at other times. You only know for sure if you ask them. It can also hurt if you use gendered pronouns when talking about them with other people, and other people might never get it right if the same pronouns aren't used consistently.
Advice based on mistakes my mom makes:

If they ask you to correct something- be happy to change, not sad you were wrong, so they can feel comfortable telling you again in the future!

If they complain about a problem, validate them and their feelings. If they say that something a person was hurtful to them, don't try to get them to ""see the other side"", focus on them and their feelings only. 

Don't ever let anyone say anything negative about trans people in front of them without being stopped. Seriously, every time even if it's only mild. Make sure they know your house is a place where trans people WILL be respected, or that person will be removed. If someone gives pushback about it, you really have to remove them immediately and not let them get a second chance to disrespect your child in your house. Your kid will internalize it if you allow if through passivity. 

Also, if a tv show says something negative or questionable about trans people, get it off the tv immediately.
Eldest or Youngest work great too! 

""My eldest is really into soccer"" 

""Oh my youngest is a dancer actually""
I always like the genderless term child, but you should talk to them and see what would make them more comfortable.
Yep! Write out a list and have them tell you which they’re okay with. This goes for compliments too—cute, pretty, handsome, beautiful... Also maybe let them know you’re happy to help them adjust their style (hair, clothes, etc) to whatever they’re comfortable with. Sounds like you’re doing great, keep up the good work :)
Thank you. 💙 I have accepting friends though, which is really nice. And work has been okay about it too. 

Of course! Thanks again for being such an accepting parent. All the best to you, and to your child and their father too. 💙
It probably won't do any harm to make it clear that the policy very specifically hasn't changed.
I call my little enby mini meatbag, kidlet, notspawn (we're not bio related), teen,  foundling, etc. They're cool with all of these slightly embarrassing choices

Your kiddo might not know yet what will be affirming to them-there are a ton of options out there if they want to try a few different ones

r/momforaminute suggests *duckling* for posts without gender indicated, and I think that's an adorable option as well
It's hard to remember sometimes but I'm sure they'll appreciate the effort! 💖
Not all of us were as lucky! 

Your support is saving your child years of hurting. ❤️
Oh one other thing! Non-binary people tend to choose names that seem silly to a lot of people but these names often are very important to the person choosing them, so if ur kid chooses a name you think is silly, please remember it might not be silly at all to them. 
For example, my partners Chosen name is Trash. I’ve met lots of people who have said “I’m not calling them that it’s rude and silly” 
But for my partner it isn’t, at all. My partner dumpster dives as a way to reduce food waste, they genuinely find Trash an endearing name because to them Trash isn’t just garbage, trash is food, trash is useful, trash is recyclable, trash is reusable. One persons trash is literally Trash’s treasure.
Aww I’m so glad to hear it!!! And seems like you’re doing really well on their pronouns, well done!! Your kid is lucky to have you❤️
No problem! It makes me so happy to see supportive parents <3
What ComradeVidali said, but that being said - definitely talk with them about it first! It's for them to decide when and to whom they want to come out, for example they might not want you to use the correct pronouns when talking with the neighbor who has a kid in the same class, if they haven't come out in school yet.
Or the dreaded middle
Unless you have only one.
That's good to hear! And thank you, we try our best 💙
Of course 💙 I told them at the end of our conversation about all of this 🥰

My coworker refuses to use my pronouns, and it's causing distress and disassociation at work. Every time she does it, I'm not in a position to jump in and correct her, and reminding her politely just does nothing. I don't know what to do, I just started this job and it's already making me miserable.	UPDATE: I talked with my main manager and she apologized and encouraged me to correct her more if she slips up, which she did later but corrected herself almost instantly! We had a conversation and while she doesn't really understand nonbinary queerness, she said she'd try harder and told me about her gay niece and how she wanted to be supportive. I already feel so much better about the situation, as she can hopefully help with the others learning as well. Thank you all for your advice and support! Much love ❤	"I should add that I wear my binder to work every day (7 hour low stress shifts) and wear a pronoun pin with ""He/They"" next to my name tag. I even asked if I could wear it and she acknowledged it and said it was fine.
I'm sorry. Can you escalate this with your boss? Are trans workers protected from retaliation in your area?
Talk to HR and tell them your gender identity isn't being respected by your boss and coworkers. I'd look at your employee handbook or company policy on discrimination and what their stance is first to back you up
I heard someone have success with misgendering their coworker back. It sounds shitty, but that's kinda the point. The coworker realized how crappy it felt to be misgendered constantly and in front of others and actually stopped.
You could try and embrace the chaos and misgender them “accidentally” a lot. If they say something about how “I’m clearly [pronoun]”, you can say “sorry, maybe it would help me remember if you pinned your pronouns by your name tag, like me” and helpfully gesture to your name tag. Tho this is more of a *let’s start an actual fist fight* style of pushing back lol

/this is mostly a joke but like maybe a little serious
Call them the wrong pronouns back. Usually changes them pretty quick. Or ignore them until they call you correctly.
How this ends depends on how large your company is and what state you live in. Start creating a paper trail. You have probably already done so, but email the person asking them to stop, cc HR if you have one. If they don’t. Email your next line up stating similar, cc HR. Go up as far as you have to. 

Now that the document trail is out there. The state/country you are in matters. If they have laws that protect trans, then you’ll have the right docs for a suit. If not, they’ll just fire you. Either way, I’m looking for another position because you already aren’t respected there.
Trying requires the vulnerability of learning publicly—being wrong and correcting oneself. They’re not doing this at all, and you deserve to be treated with basic human respect. I’m so sorry this is your current reality OP. 

If it’s any consolation, I’ve totally dealt with this is several jobs. I calmly stand my ground and repeat people’s sentences with my correct pronouns, whether they acknowledge it or not. Doing that has helped me feel valid and seen by myself—respecting myself and being gentle with myself in those moments makes all the difference for me.
I have a friend that works at a restaurant and this happened to them. This is how they got their problem resolved.


Step 1-Ignore her. Anytime she tries to speak to you and is using the wrong pronouns, do not respond. Continue doing what you're doing

Step 2-Acknowledge it. If she confronts you or her boss about how you're not listening to her, start asking her questions like ""Well I thought you were talking to me, but then you said she/he. Who were you trying to talk to?"" Or ""Is there someone here with the same name as me? I heard my name, but you used she/he. That's not me.""

Step 3-Take this up higher. If it continues, report this to your HR department (if there is one available). Explain how she makes an uncomfortable environment for you to work in and how it's hard for you to work around her because she doesn't respect you. 


After discussing it enough with HR, they should start realizing how severe it is that they do respect your pronouns.
Would you have a code of conduct that includes pronouns/respect that you can rely on to advocate for your case?
I'm sure most people would get annoyed if you use kept using the wrong name or pronouns. You aren't overreacting, they owe you some basic human decency.
I am glad to hear the Update was positive. And yeah, that's the answer--if you're not being respected, talk to a manager. If the manager won't listen or you have concerns regarding them, go to HR.
You need to correct them in the moment. Be a broken record.
document everything. write a journal documenting how people are using the wrong pronouns for you, when you correct them, and them continuing to use the wrong pronouns, for both your coworker and your boss. go to HR, and see if anything happens, make sure to document. if nothing still changes, and you live in the US, file a complaint with the EEOC. I believe purposefully misgendering someone is considered harassment of a protected status. That is a federal law.
Find a new job. And don't give them 2 weeks. Literally just stop showing up. Every time a workplace disrespects me, I give them shit when I leave and quit without giving them 2 weeks notice. It's a mutual respect. Correct them next time they use your pronouns wrong, and if they don't correct themselves, look them in the eyes and quit. This way they know what they did. Want to keep your workers? Want your workers to respect you? Respect them. Everyone tells me ""don't quit without giving two weeks, you'll never find another place."" And it's the biggest lie people will tell you. I currently work for the best office ive ever worked at, and literally during my interview I told them about leaving my prior job without giving two weeks because the place was disrespectful and I view a respectful leave as something mutually deserved, and they kinda just laughed it off. Seriously. Don't be afraid to find search for new opportunities and tell them during the interview that you demand mutual respect at a workplace. If they don't hire you because youre non-binary and have a preference in pronouns, Sue them for discrimination.
If i was you id tell her straight up “its he/they” 
Dont even say sorry just be straightforward
You did nothing wrong and do not have to justify yourself. There is no burden on you to dress in a particular way or wear a badge. Once your coworker knows your pronouns, the burden is on them to use your pronouns or your name. This is not a you problem, this is a them problem. Good to see that it is working out!
My boss is even worse, and it's not like anyone is mean or aggressive about it. They just straight up never use the right pronouns and pretty much ignore me being trans entirely.
The problem is I've only been here a week and I really don't want them to see me as throwing a hissy fit or trying to cause issues. They said at the beginning of the job that they would try, and then proceeded to never gender me correctly. However, anytime it's brought up, they're ""trying"" and ""learning."" I want to believe that's true, but they will literally turn right around and do it again. I hate drawing attention towards myself, and it makes it really difficult to correct them, especially when they're not talking to me, only near me. It's complicated and maybe I should be putting in more effort, I'm just frustrated that it seems like nothing will change without causing any drama...
I probably will try this, it seems like the only thing that might make it click.
This is what I personally would do but I do realize I am privileged with having a union job and pretty well protected. Not everyone has the luxury of being an asshole back to them which is unfortunate.
This is what I was going to suggest
😂 That would be so funny actually, if it comes to that then that's an amazing comeback!
The problem is they aren't talking to me, always about me to a customer or coworker, so I feel like I can't butt in. If they were talking to me, it would be so much easier to quickly correct them. I can't ignore anyone without getting in trouble, but I might try casually misgendering them. If they actually notice, could be a good way to show how annoying it is, not to mention disrespectful 😅
Unfortunately, I live in the American Midwest and it's a very large corporation with lots of fast food restaurants, and in my experience, upper management is extremely dismissive. I don't want to go to HR just yet, and I don't even have the emails for any of the people I work with, but I do see them face-to-face 5 days a week. For many reasons, I will be stuck with this job for at least a year, so I really don't want to be fired. I'm going to try to be more insistent tomorrow when I say something, and if it still doesn't help, I'll see what I can do.
I have not tried repeating the whole sentence, that's actually a great idea and might get ignored less, thank you!
Yeahhh that would be lovely, but it's not that easy to get another job. I just found this one, and I don't have a vehicle, so I completely rely on working in the same area and at the same time as my partner. It's also a great job and the misgendering is the only problem.
Where do you live? In the US UK or EU this is considered harassment and discrimination. Trans people are protected under law (for now).

It doesn't matter if they're noticeably aggressive or not. 

If you are in those areas contact a pro Bono labor attorney and see what they say. There's a good chance you can sue and you get paid
That's not throwing a fit, it's asking for the bare minimum of decency. If they get away with it now, they're gonna keep doing it the entire time you're there
1)Gather evidence 2)Show that your complaint for harassment was ignored in writing 3)to a lawyer 4)get a payday
There's nothing to ""try"" or ""learn"" if you've been using he/they the whole time they've known you. Do they have this much trouble addressing new male coworkers as ""he"" or are you just special? 

That's a rhetorical question, btw. They don't care and this should go to HR.
Now is the best time to start things right. It's gonna be tougher later. Just know that no matter what, you will not lose your job if you properly bring this up with the right department.
You absolutely can butt in when they’re talking to a coworker, especially if they know you are there. And you really - *really* should consider doing so, I think. 

Since you mentioned you wear pronoun buttons in another comment, I think you should think to do it in front of customers. Probably makes life less confusing for them when an employee says one pronoun and then points to a guy who has another on their chest.
To be honest, what others think of you is none of your business. This is the hardest lesson to learn. I’m 39 and just finally getting it through my head…fuck everyone else. Be you. Do you. Ignore the haters and embrace those around you and those that are welcoming. Life is too short for us to walk around stressed about other people. You are enough as you are and that’s all that matters. Chin up friend!💜
I hope it helps, friend!!

That's true, I feel like nothing is going to change, but I want to make sure it doesn't go from dismissive to hostile because of how I go about putting my foot down. Even if they start gendering me correctly, if it's from getting in trouble with HR I have a fear of being stuck here for a year with everyone resenting me.
The customers are almost all very old or yeehaw so if they notice the pin, they just say *ma'am* with more conviction. The pin is, or was supposed to be, a helpful guide for my coworkers 😅 but you're right, i probably should just start being annoying with it until they change
Good for you if you can think like that, but for me it's about respecting me as the person I say I am. I don't mind customers misgendering me at all, it's not their business to know or my business to correct them. But I am with my coworkers every day for 7 hours, and every day it happens a handful of times, which is enough to make me want to crawl into the oven. I know who I am and that most people will not realize or remember that I'm nonbinary, and that's okay, but these people seem to be purposefully ignoring my requests to not be called she constantly and it does hurt me, whether or not it's ""my business.""
The thing about that is that a lot of trans and nonbinary people have really bad dysphoria and things like that that look super small make it so much worse usually. It's not a get over it issue for most, it's more of a this is causing clinically significant distress issue. And that leads to a lot of bad things.
Labor laws exist
Try to arrange a formal meeting with your manager maybe?
Maybe yeah. She's honestly been the worst at it so talking to her one on one again might help. I really hope so.
Look up the laws in your area about recording conversations you're part of. if legal, record your conversation on your phone. If it goes poorly, take it to HR with your recording
Thank you for the tip
Carry an air horn and let it off every time they misgender you. Eye context, deadpan expression, 3 second blast. Every. Time.
You're amazing and I want all your bold life protips."	yqm6pi	NonBinary	515	0.99	2022-11-09 15:31:29
First time my family is going to see my quite this femme. They’re supportive and I’ve been out for a while but I’m still nervous 😬		"Looking great. Hope your family has seen you looking comfortable in your skin and clothes and celebrates you being yourself.

I am envious of your locks. 💕

How does your family support you?

I have come out to my family but I don't feel supported. Having trouble figuring out if it's them or my own insecurities though

you look amazing. you got this. also you have the best phone color
Wow
I'm jealous of how well you pull off those shorts!
Amazing hair you've got beautiful
They accept me and my identity completely, they use my name and pronouns (although they make mistakes), the don’t give me judgey looks or make backhanded comments. For the most part they just let me be me and don’t really treat me any differently than before I came out.
My family probably use my pronouns correctly about 5% of the time and it's stopped me feeling comfortable expressing myself further.
So the caveat to what I said is my dad and step mom. I’m not close to them and they’ve been getting better but they’ve been terrible (borderline not even trying) w names and pronouns. I’ve given up on trying to correct them or ever expect them to get it right. 

With the rest of my family I had to correct them a lot at first and still do sometimes but they always make the correction immediately. 

My advice, try to be really consistent with correcting them. If they’re truly supportive they will correct themselves and get better over time. If they don’t show any sign of wanting to try, they’re not really being supportive"	x4xo74	NonBinary	507	1.0	2022-09-03 15:53:01
