#OOTD		"I love your fashion choices!
I zoomed in really good to try and see all of your tattoos. I currently have 60. I spent a long time covering myself up due to body dysmorphia. Now I feel like my tattoos make me uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

Anyways you are adorable and absolutely slaying that skirt
You look great! Love your tattoos and skirt.
I love your tattoos!
It took me a second to figure out that didn’t mean Ocarina of Time Demo lol. You look awesome, and love the tats.
Tatoos look swag
Thank you! 😊
Thank you!! I appreciate the kind words! ☺️

Absolutely relate to that feeling. Honestly don’t think I’d have nearly the tattoo coverage had I began my transitioning earlier.
Thank you! ☺️
Thank you! ☺️"	uxosfu	trans	67	0.91	2022-05-25 19:17:09
