My boss / coworker has a trans daughter, and I absolutely ADORE his enthusiasm about the subject.	"I was working yesterday with this guy - a super kind dude - and he was telling me about his kids.

He explained, ""I got two kids. And, I'm still learning, but one of them is transgender. And she always teaching me stuff. I really support that stuff, I really wanna support my kids.""

So, I looked at him, held up my pride lanyards (one gay flag, one trans flag) and said, ""Well, if you have any questions you can ask me, because I'm trans, too."" Enter in the shock and the 'I had no idea's, as I pass 100%, nowadays.

Then, to my surprise, he started absolutely *gushing* about his daughter to me, showing me pictures, talking about the hormones he's buying her, about how he's always learning, she's always teaching him. Because, as he explained, there were three main reasons he is so adamant about support:

* He used to be very homophobic, as he said he was in a gang and that's just how people thought. He said that's the old him, and the new him ain't like that.
* In the black community, he said it's real dangerous and frowned upon - ""and it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be at all"" he told me - so he wants to make sure his daughters are loved and safe.
* Because he has complete custody over them, alone, he wants them to grow up safe and strong and knowing that they're loved.

It made me want to cry. I kept telling him, ""You're such an amazing parent. You're such a good person."" Since there are so many of us that are alone, or feel alone, especially when it comes to family, I wanted him to understand how much I appreciate what he's doing. This guy just made me *so damn happy.* He cares so *much* about his kids.

Of course, he's trying his best, and he apparently texted his daughter something like, ""I met a transgender at work!"" To which she told him, ""Actually, dad, use transgender PERSON. But awesome!"" Or something like that, you know?

And he was so *excited* to show me his mistake, saying, ""Education is so important. It's so important to keep learning.""

When I told him that I'm happy he supports this trans girl, he asked, ""So when you say 'trans girl' you mean...someone like my daughter?""

I explained, ""It's just like when you have 'boy' and 'girl', only you're tacking on 'trans'. They're still boys and girls."" Right?

He was *elated,* like, ""Oh I get it! See, that's so important to know!""

I adore this man. He's trying his best, of *course* he isn't perfect, but just seeing him trying and wanting to keep his daughters happy and safe gave me fucking *life.* In a world where I always fear trans kids have to grow up alone, knowing this teenager is loved and accepted by her father is the greatest thing.

Anyways...I just really wanted to share this. It was so wholesome.

**EDIT: Aw man, I'm so glad I ain't the only one who was just** ***hype*** **with happiness / near crying at this! Hope everyone is doing okay! <3**"	"this is so wholesome
That's so wholesome It makes me want to cry. I wish the world had more parents like him in it
this made me cry lol
I'm actually crying. Tell this blessed man he gives hope to all the tiny trans people in your phone haha
I really enjoyed reading that, thanks for sharing!
[deleted]
It's awesome to read something so positive, thank you for sharing!
I squealed when reading this post. This is so freaking cute!!
That dad is a Saint! 

I'm so afraid of my environment if I eventually do decide to transition, they will react badly. But maybe I'm the real transphobe...
Lord, this is more wholesome than a quart of fresh milk! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Thank you for sharing! That was incredible.
This post is turning so many people into waterfalls…this post is so bitter sweet to a lot of us. I hope we all can find someone as encouraging as this father.
This needs to go on r/wholesome and r/mademesmile
That’s so amazing!
Oh I needed to see this today, glad to see there are amazing people out there!
Man, I wish my parents or brother were half as enthusiastic. Anything that's hard or they don't like, they'll just say, ""I'm old"" or ""I love you so you shouldn't be upset,"" instead of trying to learn about the community, our experience, or change behavior when told something it's harmful or phobic. 

Nonetheless,  I'm still happy for her - her father is a blessing and may they stay close 💜🏳️‍🌈
Bless him.
Oh my god this is so cuteeeeeee
What an awesome person, if only everyone could think like him!
Hes a legend and the kind of parent any LGBTQ kid needs
chills and tears welling rn tbh
This is just the most wholesome thing. Thank you for sharing!
This is so wholesome it made me want to cry
My heart is going pitter patter pitter patter and it’s getting really warm in there. We need more parents like this, that are excited to learn more, get educated and more open. Not a lot of parents are like that, most of the time they tend to draw back and be more closed off even if they consider themselves open. In my experience it’s not easy to teach a parent when they live by the idea that “I was born first and am older so I know more than you” or “well it’s not like that back in my day and I never knew about it so I don’t think it’s that great. It’s just a trend anyway and you don’t know who you are.” I appreciate parents like him who are so ready to actually care for their kids and learn from them to make it better for them. Bless his soul and his entire heart and family
This is my motivation for the day. I'm glad there are parents out there like this. It makes me so happy!!!
You've got a great friend! I adore how wholesome this is!
I’m crying on the bus now. This was so lovely
We need more people like this
Damn.

This post made me want a good dad. I didn’t know they existed like this 😢🥺
Can he be my dad? 🥺
I

Am

Crying
Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this.
I have not been feeling great and I needed this. Please more of this on this sub.
This is so sweet ahhh Im tearing up omg
What I'd give to have my parents be like this...
I needed this today. My mom chewed me out for forty minutes straight last night about disliking my transition and this was after a half hour of right wing covid propaganda... I'm 23, I'm an adult, I hate that she feels she has the right to do that. So seeing someone actually be a supportive and caring parent for their trans child is refreshing. Thank you for the dopamine hit today. Wishing you and his family the best.
I love that omg what a brilliant dad
Thank you so much for sharing this!!! I’m a ‘new mom’ of a 23 year old daughter and this is making me so so happy. Thank you
i love this sooo much.  i love that he is sooo happy about learning and he cares and wants to make sure he does the right thing.
Hey, who's cutting onions? 😭
I have a coworker similar to this! He's an older white man, and while he doesn't have a trans child, he does get attached to younger coworkers in a really supportive ""fatherly"" way. Two trans people work there, one being me, and he's always trying to research and learn about trans stuff. Always trying to make sure he's referring to us in ways that we're comfortable with, and apologizing for any mistakes, though his mistakes don't hurt as bad because he actually puts genuine effort towards it. He's a serious sweetheart! ♥️
Fuck, now I’m crying
There’s nothing more uplifting than a person telling you they support the trans community before they know you’re a part of it. Because people will obviously tell you how they’re supportive after they know, almost to the point that it can seem insincere.  But your boss realistically didn’t know how you would respond to hearing about his trans daughter and he told you how proud he was of her anyway.  Great guy.
Aww he sounds like a great parent. If he’s on FB, there’s an educational group called “You Might Wanna Learn More About Trans People” that he might benefit from joining. Everyone is welcome there and he can ask questions if he has any and get answers from trans and nonbinary folks with lived experience.
We need more parents these like these
🎼💕🎶❤
Awww 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Definitely not crying...
I was really worried about my boss at work, who is an opinionated older white woman (who could easily be a terf, she gives off those kinds of vibes) but when I came out to her she literally said ""that's great! My granddaughter is trans. Do you need any help finding places that stock cute shoes in your size?"" 😍

Enthusiastic trans ally bosses are the best!
All the hugs for this guy!!
I *love* parents like that!

He may not know all the terms yet, he may not know the best way to say things yet, but he’s enthusiastically supportive, and willing to learn and fix his mistakes.

What a wonderful ally and support his daughter has!
omg 🥺🥺🥺 good dad alert 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

this is something I emphasize to any of my cis friends when they ask questions or are confused: it's always okay to grow. if you don't know something, then you just don't know, but as long as you're open to learning and growth then you'll do alright in this world
this is one of the sweetest stories I've read ever ;u;
I love parents who are accepting of thier LGBT+ kids
What a great person!  That's true love and curiosity at its best and made my day!
I'm crying reading this. I have never met this man but I would die to keep him safe. What an absolute gem.
whatever smiling and weeping at the same time is called that’s me
Someone so enthusiastic to learn and grow who cares so much. Oh it makes my heart soar.

His daughter is so, so lucky.
Omg, reading this made me cry. This beautiful person, bending in the wind as he learns, and being so enthusiastic about learning about his daughter’s transition, and walking with her…I want to hug him. I want to hug his neck and tell him that he’s the parent we all deserve. Mine are supportive, but not enthusiastic like this. And for him to cone from the background he came from…he is a truly beautiful person. Thank you for sharing.
My kiddo (13) came out to my wife and me as non-binary recently. While it was a bit of a shock, we are doing everything we can to support them because they’re our child and we love them more than anything in the world. I don’t understand a parent who would do otherwise, it makes no sense at all.

That being said, love you all here and if you need a dumb gen X dad to tell you that you’re wonderful just as you are, I’m here for you.
Holy moly that’s some serious love. We love to see it
Omg I'm in tears that's so adorable and great! I wish every trans*person could have a dad like him <3
I really love this. ❤️
I fucking love this. Give your boss my regards, and tell him this trans girl would love to have him as a father.
Aww that’s so wonderful ❤️ trans kids need parents like that it touches my heart 😭
This is so so so amazing, hearing him so excited to learn and being so proud and excited for his daughter is just amazing! She's one lucky kid and I'm glad he's your boss!!!
“No man is an island entire of itself”, and this man makes the whole so much more wholesome.

I hope this man lives another 50 years at least, because the minute he’s gone it’ll be like an entire continent sank into the sea.
I want to hug this precious man. I'm so happy for his daughter, and his children in general that they have such a good father, and I'm so happy for you that your boss is so amazing.
I'm going to cry this is so wholesome
literally my mum
I wish my dad was this enthusiastic about me being Trans🥺
I absolutely adore hearing about awesome parents like this!
i LOVE the fact that hes so excited to show that he made a mistake and learned from it. most people (especially transphobes) are just too scared of making a mistake, so when they do make one, they pretend that they are right and really just make the situation so much worse. the fact that he is willingly talking about his mistakes and how he evolved from them is just so heartwarming
Dude show him all these lovely responses he got on this post, he gotta know that what he’s doing is not taken for granted and that he’s fucking acing this parenting thing!
I wish I had a Dad like that and not one on the complete opposite end. It woulda helped me transition at a way younger age and/or at least be confident in who I am.
Parents like this really give me hope. Supportive and proud parents of trans kids, you're fighting against the tide and doing amazing.
Hi hornies
ugh
[removed]
wholesomeee
Such wholesome tears running down my face!

His curiosity and love are so beautiful to exist at all, and to have been able to read about and experience it; it is so lovely to know that there are people out there so utterly loved and cared for.

I wish we could have all of such curiosity to withhold judgment about things we do not *yet* understand and the empathy and love to fully take them all in.

May they all have as much happiness as they can hold.
This makes me so incredibly happy. Shit, I'm crying.
Please tell this amazing man, that he's giving many of us so much hope that it's to meet people who are supportive.
my dad couldve really learned something from that guy😭thats so sweet
A late comment but please keep us updated on him if something else happens, I wanna learn about what he learns!!
This is how it should be.
Now you see, it's people like him, he's why we CAN have nice things!

\+1 Faith in Humanity
Well now I’m crying. I wish I had parents like this.
This is so adorable I actually teared up a bit. I would've given anything for a dad like that.
Yo can we clone this guy?
I'm glad he is so big on it.  Even accepting parents can have their negative moments and that sticks with you, so seeing that he's both positive and willing to learn is awesome.  I've had to remind people a time or two that their child/cousin/sibling/whatever is still their child/cousin/sibling/whatever no matter their gender.
This is literally all we want. 99% of days I deal with my mom’s transphobia I say I want to cut her out of my life completely but on the 1%, I’m just so sad and lost and I realize… God I wish my mom would just love me. I wish her love wasn’t so transactional in that I have to be everything she wants me to be for her to smile at me and love me and be there for me. I wish she would help me and support me and realize that I’m just happier this way and be happy for me. It’s so fucking hard, so so so fucking hard to go through it by myself without a parent’s reassurance. Sure, you can have a partner, a best friend, a good support system in spite of all estrangement but sometimes not having a parent support you just hits different…
Lowkey dad of the year... I applaud that he's trying to learn and be more accepting and mature than his former self.
This made my day
If we were all like this man the world would be a better place. I hope he's doing well :]
Meanwhile my parents:

Look, I know you won't get it right 100% of the time right away and that's okay, just put in an effort, okay? That's all I'm asking for.

What? No we can't POSSIBLY do that, this is asking WAY too much, this is all so complicated oh by the way deadname, why do you seem to never talk to us?
Wholesome parent posts really are a bright shining light these days
Protect this man at all costs
I cry every time I hear a story like this. It makes me so happy that fewer and fewer trans kids have to go through what I did.
Awwww this makes me so happy!!🥺 Wish more people were like him!
I wish I had parents like these so I don’t need to continue to hide in fear
He sounds so sweet!
I want to hug him and his daughter🥺🥺
* waves and points to himself* I'm trying to be like him.
It's so wholesome it DID make me cry 😭
Dude, I was getting all teary-eyed in the middle of my shift haha.
same lol made my day
Same here and I seldom cry from positive feelings. This makes me so incredibly happy!
I absolutely *will* tell him! <3
Of course! :D
Right? I'm thinking of telling him, the next time I see him, that I made an anonymous post about him. Show him everyone's comments and stuff. Because I think it may make him happy to know just how *awesome* he is in everyone's eyes, now.
Absolutely, no problem!
No, no, that's a valid fear. I know so many people that are terrified to come out or begin transitioning, even in adulthood and living on their own / away from parents, because the fear of abandonment or being hated by those who supposedly love you just *hurts.* So, you have every right to be afraid, in my opinion.

Hope things get easier for you. <3
Of course! It was absolutely amazing, so I just really wanted to share it with everyone!
Hopefully that's a good ""ugh""? I'm sorry, I hope this didn't upset you. I just really wanted to share some positivity.
I mean, homie, I perused through your posts. I know you're seemingly for right-wing political values. You don't need to disguise your trolling as actual concern, you can come out and say, ""I'm transphobic."" It's totally okay, sweetie.
Same here!!!
You're a great parent then!
Same here same 😂
❤️
And he’s helped a mom too
And you did, to use your words that gave me fucking *life* :D
for them it is a good thing obv

"Told my grandma what nonbinary is and she said ""I want to be nonbinary"""	I've been out for awhile, she's been knowing that I'm trans and on hrt. Tonight we were talking and I explained to her that I'm not a transman, despite being on T, but that I'm nonbinary. I told her nonbinary is a catch-all for people who don't identify strictly as man or woman, and that some nonbinary people don't identify with either. I said that I feel like some mixture of man and woman, and she immediate said she wants to be nonbinary. (:	"Well, I'm 74...started my transition 3 1/2 years. Tell her it's never too late.
I’m pretty sure my grandma was a trans man and she just didn’t know it :(
Your grandma sounds pretty awesome.
Grandma's in luck because wanting to be nb is like the one requirement for being nb.
I have great news about being non-binary for your grandma :)
My mom realized that she is asexual after she heard me talk about lgbt identities. It's never too late.
Ya I haven’t came out as trans yet but when I came out as bisexual my grandma said that “both women and men are hot I like them both to” it made me so happy when she said that :)
Nice grandparent.
Had I know about non binary as a kid I would have much preferred it too. I like being a woman and am happy to stay as such but had I known there was a choice I would have chosen non binary. So glad you have a supportive granny xx
Wholesome grandparent
I've had similar experience with my mom. I told her that I was nonbinary and she told me that back in the days she felt the same way :00
Where's my wholesome award when I need it?! Gonna have to go with a ""love"" award instead. Your grandma sounds like the one we all need in life.
There’s a lot of sadness in the comments about how peoples elderly relatives might have identified had they grown up in recent times. It’s really touching but I do think a more proactive response to this would be to clearly identify the factors at play within older peoples’ lives that may have stopped them from exploring their identity and/or coming out. 

The typical  “aw :( it was a different time” response (especially from well meaning but uninformed allies) is vague and also does not acknowledge the action and allyship that was actually always taking place, just hidden away and ignored by history.

If we can clearly name the power structures, systemic issues, and organisations that oppressed queer people, we will also be better at identifying them in today’s world. This is especially important because they are starting to creep back in. It would be a dangerous thing to assume that progress is intrinsic to the passage of time. It has been hard won by our queer elders.
Can I have ur grandma, I'll trade u my father.🥲
Had something similar happen when I came out as ftm to my mom. She said she doesn't think she's entirely cis either and thinks she's more on the nb/andro spectrum. Said being called a tomboy all her life never felt quite right and she was just being herself. I have a cool mom.
Your grandma is AWESOME
cute
Wholesome gram 🌈💖
My dad said the same thing! He is not ready to talk about it fully to me but first time i came out he said he knew exactly how i felt and that he always felt the same , (He still uses he /him and refers to himself as a man )
Wholesome grandparent moment
j'ai 14 ans et sa fait 2 mois que je sais que je ne suis pas une femme je refuse mes sein et je sais pertinemment que je ferais une torsoplastie et que je prendrais des hormones mais je ne sais pas encore bien si je suis trans ou autre.
Oh my gosh that's so cute!
what is a word for an Enby grandparent besides Grandparent
I'm 36 and nonbinary as well... 💜💜💜💜 I'm so proud of everyone in here..  And to those that are still finding your way, we are all here for you!!!!!
Aww she sounds amazing <3
That's the cutest thing I've read this week. Thanks! x
/egg_irl
go grandperson go
Time to get grandma a copy of the dysphoria bible!
I’m so happy for you! Please show them how much you love them. Some of us had family that reacted harshly and would give the world for a hug from your grandmother.
Ask grandma if gender neutral pronouns would feel good to hear! Also, maybe “grand” might be a fun nick name to remove the gendered ending! Maybe!
i thought you were born nonbinary and not did choose to be one lol.

edit: funny how the lgbtq community here doesn't even know what they are lol.
Reminds me of how my mom is agender. After I came out she decided to come out as well basically. Very wholesome.
Is it weird that i  found it cute?
I think you cracked an egg
I am 63 and I started at 56. I finished MTF GCS. I still feel part man, part woman. I identify as female but am more of a tom boy type. I have a lot of skills that both men and women usually learn. I think being trans gives you different opportunities at different points in life.
 I am lucky that I always pass. I am just glad I will never again  get called Sir. That absolutely bugs the shit out of me. It's funny how a little facial stubble can send you down a funk hole. But as time goes on you just get used to dealing with it. 
It never seems to get easier but it's still one hell of a journey. Now after all this I just became an activities director for a local HOG group. I transitioned from a leather bear gay man into a biker chick wearing leather and riding a Harley. I am out to the club and they are all supportive. 
In the beginning of this new second chance at life I was afraid and thought it impossible. But after all the pain and loss there has been tremendous growth and a whole new world to explore. I am leaving the trauma of the first 2 years behind me and getting on with the rest of my life. 
It's never too late to live your truth! ""Just Do It!""
Haven’t read the post just the title but I’m already crying
My grandma when was young said she wanted to be a boy to her mother and mother said to go every day and pray for that by the pond. Grandma did for a while but eventually gave up.
Well I'm just as bad as grandma what does nonbinary? I have never heard of that word
Seventy mother frickin four. You're a rock star. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
!! That's amazing! Congrats on living you're authentic life 🥰
Thanks for sharing.  I'm 55 and I feel too old sometimes to transition.  I feel like why bother.  Then I remember all the years I spent depressed.  I tried to be what others wanted me to be.  I need to be happy.  I'm a trans man!
Omg that is seriously amazing!!
> Well, I'm 74...started my transition 3 1/2 years. Tell her it's never too late.

you're a queen! I just started my journey at 35 and I felt like I was way too late... thank you for that
I am kind of terrified of getting any surgeries, I know that not doing it doesn't make me any less trans. I just want to say that you're amazing. I only just came out back in May and I am 30
YOU ARE AMAZING 🥹
74.. And on Reddit, now I've seen everything😹💗💗
Thats so cool :D
My grandmother doesn't even know what Reddit is! I find this cool in of itself. It's never too late!
I've met 70 and 80 year olds who had just recently started their transitions. It truly is never too late! I remember one of them saying how its the happiest they felt in their whole life
Congratulations, I don't know you but I think it's awesome that at your age you are being your athentic self. ❤️
that's amazing ❣️
This made me tear up. Love this for u ❤️❤️❤️
❤
Yes a lot of older people would have expressed that they were lgbtq if it was more accepted in their time.
When I came out to my Grandma, she didn't respond with any type of uncertainty or fear. She just said ""that sounds really hard.""

As the dementia took her more and more (and I had to keep coming out to her), she told me several times about she had wanted to be a boy when she was younger, because boys got to do all the fun stuff. I try not to read into it too much, but I also know that there's at least some hereditary factor to transness.
Same for my mom
Same lol
Wow really?:( what makes u think so if i may ask?
Unrelated I like your name my friend!

I'd change mine to my new name, but reddit says no apparently. Wear it well my friend!
She is 74 and the kindest most open person I know!!
!!!
How do I not know about this and where can I find it?
That site is great, all the feelings I had had but didn't know what they were it was like yep that's what this is. I never had anyone to tell me, I didn't ""know"" for sure that I was trans until I was 28.
I'm a trans dude too! I'm 13 though. Congrats on being your authentic self!
r/TransLater

i've seen all ages... i was in late 40s before i figured out how to start on my own (i was gatekept in my country for some 10 years)

i'm glad I transitioned... no regrets ;)
Damn you make me feel better about the waiting for my medical transition! Even at 17 I’m wondering whether it’s too late at 19 or not. You older people are absolute legends! Love on you !
I’m a little younger than you and cis, but have a few friends who transitioned later in life (late 30s and 40s) and it was life changing/affirming for each of them with no regrets except that they never felt comfortable doing it younger. For all of the baggage that builds up from decades in the closet, they would all say it is still the best thing they ever did (or at least tied with finding their spouses or having their kids).
Apparently when my cousin came out as bi to my grandma, Grandma said something along the lines of ""I understand. Back when the boys were away in the war...""
Which is why I’m so open about being trans so people my age and older can see it’s normal and not scary
This is exactly it. It isn't that there are more lgbt+ people in younger generations. It's just that we grew up having the language and knowledge to understand more identities and, for lack of a better word, choices of label. If I had a dollar for every time I've read a story about how a zoomer came out to their grandparents only to be greeted with some variation of ""I didn't know that was a thing, that describes me too!"" I could afford top surgery for myself and everyone I love lol.
Which is incredibly sad, Judging by the population of queer people in Gen Z compared to those of gen X and boomers we're looking at more than 15% of the total population who have lived their whole lives stuck in the closet. I was stuck in it until 30, it's no way to live.
My grandmas cousin always had a ""really good roommate"" that came to family reunions with her and was introduced as her ""really good roommate"" for around 30 years straight before gay marriage was legalized so
Because she was never ‘female’. 

Hated being a mum, worked in manual labour before she got married, then worked as a teacher and was never a stay at home mum.

She also hung out in ‘male only’ spaces, she used to attend a gardening club for men. She never wore ‘female’ clothes or makeup or any of that stuff.

And she didn’t know because she was 96 (she died this year)
I miss grandma sometimes. She was a bit odd and goofy and didn’t tolerate no laziness.
Fortunately for your grandparent, the only other (and it’s really really minor) requirement for being NB is being cool as heck, and they definitely meet that requirement.
You can Google gender dysphoria bible or just go to genderdysphoria.fyi
I just started the medical transition ~6mo ago, just before I turned 35. First dose of estradiol was the first day of the month I was born. So by birth I would be Pisces and by rebirth Aquarius, if one subscribes to that belief.
woahh what a twist!
a few months after i came out as bi, my grandma’s sister pulled me aside at a family gathering and told me she was bi too 🥺 made my freakin night!
I share that sentiment (:
You're doing gods work
Same. It's the single most effective thing we can do to gain acceptance, IMO.
Seeing people on here be so much happier having supportive partners and stuff is what really helped me come out.

I miss my grandma as well. she probably is the only one that would fully understand me and support me. everyone elsee.... I dont wanna be around family.
I’ve met some very shitty enbies. Though most are great.
These kinda stories are what makes it easy for me to believe that this stuff is (at least partially) hereditary, and the patriarchy has ironically let it run rampant by forcing people to repress it. So many more people were born from gay people who felt they had to blend in by having a family.
[Here is the artist!](https://serytama.com/collections/all-stickers/products/cute-kawaii-crystal-monster-sylveon-sticker)
heck yeah I agree 100. Had my mom said she felt two spirits but, never did anything. had whoole families say suspicious lgbtq stuff.
I hope we never ever find evidence for that to be true I dont think the subsequent advocacy of eugenics on like everyone who has a lgbt family member would be very fun for everyone
Agreed! I’ve seen young pictures of my aunt who looked very very similar to how I did pre-t, and after I came out my dad mentioned to me that a lot of the things I said/did that may have been signs of me being trans when I was younger reminded him a lot of the way she was when they were growing up. Since we looked so similar I think it may be possible we shared the trans gene as well if such a thing exists, unfortunately I’ll never be able to talk to her about it since she passed before I came out as trans publicly :(
It's actually shown that people with lgbt family members are more likely to be lgbt, strong likelyhood if one of your siblings is!
Srsly. I just recently found out one of my cousins is nb, another is ftm (from a different set of parents no less), and my mom is bi. My parents always joked they had ""reverse rolls"" where my dad would stay home and cook and my mom would work and bring money. There has to be some kinda link.
Or it’s just common enough in the population that each family will have a few LGBTQ+ people if not repressed."	wawfkw	trans	3524	0.88	2022-07-29 05:38:25
The attitude toward trans men vs trans women is insane	"TW: hateful speech about trans women. 

I came out as trans (ftm) to one of my coworkers (F55) and she’s been 100% supportive. So far she’s been asking a lot of questions regarding how the hormones work, the different kinds of surgeries available to trans men, what the timeline of transitioning looks like, ect. 

There hasn’t been a single time where I felt she was over stepping any boundaries or say anything intentionally harmful. She’s made her intentions clear that she means absolutely no harm in the questions she is asking, she’s just never met a trans man before, hasn’t been exposed to that side of the LGBT community as much. As such, I’m more than happy to answer her questions based on my personal experiences.

However, because I am FTM, nearly every conversation we’ve had regarding trans people has been about trans men. Until today when she told me about a trans women that she had encountered in a public restroom.

From what I understood this woman was extremely early on in her trans and didn’t pass very well. I did my best to explain the differences between testosterone and estrogen, and how it can take longer for trans women especially after puberty to see the effects of HRT.

The conversation then took a turn about Dylan Mulvaney. My coworker said that she dislikes Dylan being the face of different beauty campaigns and compared her to a predator. She said that publicizing trans women puts “real” women down. In the same breath she said all trans women are “pretty much men anyways and I’ll never trust them”. More was said but I’d rather not type it down. 

Needless to say I was completely shocked. A few days ago this same coworker was hyping me up and exclaiming how excited she was to see how I look in a year (I’ve recently started T). She offered me a hand and said if I ever needed help regarding my transition she’d do anything to help. But when discussing trans women she had a complete distaste for them and was just hateful. 

After reflecting on this I realized that this unfortunately isn’t entirely uncommon. 

To my trans sisters, you don’t have anything to prove. Stay safe and I love all of you."	"Yeah, bro, I'd be questioning the validity of her ""support"" if I were you. I've run into this with TERF-y types before too; they'll appear supportive because they think of you as a fellow gal pal who is just playing pretend and don't actually consider you to be a man, so you're therefore not perceived as a threat to them. On the flipside, they see trans women as men who are trying to co-opt womanhood and therefore as a threat. They're not *actually* supportive of any trans people, they're just shitty bigots.
In other words, she probably doesn't see you as a man either...

Thanks, bro.
Unfortunately this sounds suspiciously like she still sees you as a fellow woman, and thus is being supportive, whereas she sees trans women as men and thus feels they are invading her spaces.
Oh yah, don’t worry you’ll be seeing transphobia from her once you start passing more, or whenever you show the mildest sign of disappointment or irritation. Then you’ll suddenly be a “roid raging mysoginistic man-thing” whose being “poisoned” by EVIL Testosterone, and just as predatory as the trans-woman in her eyes. Right now, in her eyes she either considers you a woman or a “UwU femme soft-boi who needs help because he is very smol”, so not a threat and not a nasty predatory man. Her support is entirely contingent on how you look and how much ass patting and “good person” points you give her. 

Edit: To clarify, trans men and trans women will see the same levels of persecution in different ways. In regards to being seen as “predatory” trans men go through stages: 
You are a child-like victim who thinks being a man will save them from Patriarchy and can’t make your own decisions > you are an in-between femme man-thing who is non-threatening, but is slowly being “poisoned” and made ugly and mysoginistic by evil T. You need to be told constantly you are turning into a monster, all past and current experiences of discrimination do not matter and you must never speak of them > You are now considered a man and are a predatory enemy. You transitioned purely to hurt all women, you are now a tool of the patriarchy and are the reason cis women have to say “birthing person”. You are nothing more than a grooming r*pist who deserves death and persecution. 

All of this rhetoric is rooted in the idea that hormones are what determine a good vs bad person, a predator vs a protector. The evil is in the T and any proximity to it is evil.
Yeah I recently have had coworkers be fine with certain aspects of LGBT+ and then horrible about others.

When they found out I identified as a gay male they were 100% fine with that. But because trans people has been a hot topic online for conservatives lately they’ve been talking about it and they have been saying transphobic things. 

And here’s me at least accepting that im trans to myself finally but I could never be out honest about it at work without changing jobs 🙃

It’s disappointing but at least you found out what kind of person your coworker is and you should understand that you don’t need someone like that in your life.
You do understand though that the fact that she's got that attitude towards trans women but is all girlfriends with you means that she still completely sees you as a woman?
Sounds like a slimy terf to me.
This co-worker is a despicable bigot.

She doesn't see you as a man. She feels comfortable saying these things to you because she still sees you as a woman.

Gross.
Be careful around that overinvolved woman.   
She‘s probably going to snap when you start to pass, or hang around more men.  
Bet she doesn‘t consider you a man at all.
I'm so sorry babe, but she sees you as a woman, not the awesome man that you are, dude.

Best wishes from a trans sister. <3
Yeah it’s a thing. It’s not really “trans men” or “trans women” as much as it’s cultural attitudes on men vs women in general. It’s misogyny. Even when trans men don’t pass early on in their transition, it doesn’t really matter, because society has firmly gotten used to masculine women and tomboys, that there isn’t the same painful period for trans men. Trans women can go for years through an emotionally devastating beginning, where there are definite times when you can be seen as a joke, some hideous thing, because that’s been the culturally ingrained view of “men dressed as women”. It was fodder for decades and centuries of jokes. And there’s also the notion that “women = inherently sexual”, and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. It’s complicated.
Yeah ~~internalized misogyny~~ sexism is the core of all the problems trans women are facing and this comes from women just as much as men.

It also probably means she doesn't fully see you as man either or she'd be just as hostile towards you, even if she doesn't recognize it herself.
i think trans women are just more victim of public transphobia campaigns. The right wing keeps shouting themselves half horse spreading misinformation about them, so a lot of people who may not be inherently transphobic pick up on the misinformation and start getting wrong biases. whereas for trans men, as you said the public eye isn't on them nearly as much, so the first thing people express is usually curiosity and ignorance and not bigotry
I’ve noticed that as well.

It sometimes feels like transphobes either don’t realise, or have forgotten, that trans men exist. Especially with things like trans bathroom bans.

And when they do, they try to separate them from trans women in discussion, almost like, for want of better metaphor, they’re a model minority. I say this because, in terf’s eyes at least, trans masc aren’t as “pushy”* as trans femme.

*they say pushy, intelligent people say just asking for respect, the right to exist, and to be safe, while living their authentic selves.
that's basically because she sees you as a semi-woman while she sees trans women as men. People with this type of behaviour act and seem supportitive towards afab trans people because they view them as Woman Lite rather than whatever they actually are. 

They talk and behave like they think you're a guy, but they don't view you as one- at least as long as you look non-threatening (and are pretty). If you're a huge bear who's not pretty or handsome, and often just very fat that support tends to fly out of the window. 

This set of beliefs is also a byproduct of TERF rhetoric being disembodied from the context of TERFs by being amputated and sutured into other discourse and ideology. They acknowledge that trans people deserve to live but they don't actually see them as who they are, whether consciously or subconsciously, because they've internalised to themselves that a man is always a predator who steals from women, and a women is always a victim who is stolen from by men.

they live in an alternate social gender binary that defines man and women by the social positions of predator and prey.

they're friendly with people who they view as woman lite because of this, and if you pass too good or are ugly as a trans man you're expected to constantly apologise for existing and being a man because according to them that's enough to be harmful and evil, while trans women need to be white, skinny and very pretty to receive any kind of validity, otherwise they're seen as Men In Dresses who secretly deep down have the biological urge to prey on women (that somehow vanishes the second they're hot enough). 

it's utter fucking shit and it's just one of the ways TERFs and TERF beliefs have prominently poisoned people's minds over the years indirectly via other queer discourse
I think she still sees you as a woman 😔
Maybe confront her about it?
Terfs be wilding again
your co-worker still sees you as a woman, honestly, and she is full of hatred towards any 'men' (which in her book includes trans women)

trans men don't have it easier, they just have different struggles. we all have a difficult road to travel.
I just threw up in my mouth a little. This is the kind of shit that made me go back in my shell and detransition 30 years ago and I'm not putting up with it any longer. I almost killed myself slowly and I lived in hell. Everyday I prayed for death i barely took care of myself. 

I found a piece of clothing from my transition days. A very worn out but still cute and laundry day usable pair of panties. I put them on and it all came back. The gender euphoria/dysphoria the realization that I was living a lie that was killing me and I had to free myself once again. The egg was cracking again and I kicked it open because my life depended on it. That was 4 years ago. Now I'm 60 and lost 140 lbs got healthy and I've been on hormones for a bit over 6 months, again. So I log 3 puberties now. Not doing this again, this time it's forever.

So for all those trefs out there that say I'm not a ""real"" woman, I say you don't know what it takes to be a ""real"" woman and that is the saddest thing in the world. To all my Sisters out there that know the ""real"" truth, Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. We are more the same than we are different. Not some nice platitude, that's science.

God bless each and everyone of us. We are butterflies that won't be kept a caterpillar. Crack open that shell spread your wings and fly.

Rant over. Love to you all. Also, Trans men are MEN. We are all in on this together boys, thanks for the support.
I definitely think that’s a TERF. I think she thought of you as “yasss queen break the gender roles and act masculine!” and thinks of trans women as “men want women’s struggles smh”
Your co-worker is a TERF, it sounds like. She may not even see you as a man.
TERF alert.
She’s not your ally despite what she claims.
I’m a trans man myself and I’ve had a co worker who was openly transphobic to trans women and non binary people but for some reason I was an ‘exception'. It didn’t take me long to realise that her bigoted views didn’t exclude anyone. Terfs are everywhere dude. I’m sorry you had to experience that.
I worked in a restaurant with people just like this. It was incredibly toxic and the “support” was insincere. All the FTMs who worked there had their identities acknowledged, but when it came to being the only trans woman, I was treated like the plague and denied my pronouns/identity. 

So glad I left.
Asking questions about surgeries and hormones is crossing boundaries.  It is not normal to go around asking people about their genitals/surgeries.  All too often, when trans people come out, the genital survey begins.  

In this world we live in, why don't people just google it if they need to know so bad?  Why do they need to know in the first place?
Unfortunately Transphobia is deeply rooted in sexist ideologies like how they view men as predators and women as passive. Hence why they see trans women as predators trying to invade and dominate womens spaces (which is absolutely ridiculous) whilst seeing trans men as confused butches.
Honestly, I would cut communication with her if you can. She probably will use the fact that “I’m friends with a trans person.” to continue being transphobic if you don’t. So sorry. :(
Transphobes in so deep they don’t even realise when they bingo themselves.
Reminds me of that shitty JK Rowling quote (paraphrasing here) ""Ironically, TERFS aren't exclusionary as they include trans men in their feminism"". A lot of the support I've seen for trans men seems to come from others that still fundamentally view they as women.

I'm kinda lucky as I'm two years into mtf transition, but live somewhere progressive enough and am enough of a homebody that I've not run into anything too bad 😅 But it's definitely held true in my experience that afab trans people are often infantilized, while amab trans people are usually portrayed as a predator/deviant :/
Questions of her *actual* support aside.  If it makes you feel any better, it's actually pretty common for us, too.  Not the inverse.  But like, people who hate trans women like to make ""exceptions"" for me.

The amount of hate that has been shoveled into their ideology honestly just falls apart and isn't sustainable when it's challenged by actually knowing someone.  They'll treat you like you're special or different.  Somehow, the one normal or deserving queer.  And if that doesn't work, then maybe they'll think you're not queer at all.  That you've been tricked or groomed or misled.  Anything to distance you from the community that they hate so much that it doesn't even hold up to what they can believe about a person in their life.

It's their black friend who ""just seems like a normal dude.  Not like those other thugs. ""  Their queer friend who ""doesn't make it their whole personality, though.""  Their girl friend who's just ""one of the guys.""

When their beliefs and stereotypes about groups of people are challenged by meeting them and seeing that it's not actually accurate, they can either reshape their beliefs or they can view the challenger as though they aren't a typical example.  Most people I know chose the 2nd option.
If her argument for not trusting trans women is because they’re “practically still men” then shouldn’t she also be cautious about trans men? It’s hypocritical.
The fact she implied trans women aren’t “real” women says to me that she really doesn’t see you as a man either and is trying to keep the civility. It reminds me of a racist person smiling and being friendly with a person of the race they hate. The hate is there, just under a friendly looking blanket.
Doesn't this put her under the classification of TERF?

Also, I don't mind doing some proving. I want the people actively doubting me to choke, and I'd love to do the choking myself.
I literally just posted on another trans sub about how a few of my friends who fully support me were being transphobic about trans women!! Like wtf man how can you not see how shitty and hypocritical that is! I feel like damn do they think this stuff about me? I tried to let them know thats not okay but I feel like they kinda brushed me off. I hate that trans women get so much hate while trans men are either ignored or lifted up. I wish there wasn’t such a fight for validation or even common decency for our ladies:(
Run.
Thank for sharing, and yeah it is just the world we live in. I hope your friendship with this oersons helps them to one day be less of a terrible person. 

The kind message at the end is appreciated, and frankly this story is the reason I'm.so uncomfortable in all toilets I use. I try to avoid the need to pee when I'm out these days cause of it.
Transmisogyny :(
hr asap
the amount of times i’ve come out as ftm to people and they were chill with it but then they share their nasty opinions about trans women near me…. like atp their support means nothing to me
w t f
I'd be taking her interest in hormones and procedures as a red flag out the gate if I'm honest. I personally find those questions invasive.
I think a big part of this is that right-wing hate mongering almost exclusively focuses on transwomen.  ""Transwomen are just men trying to invade women's spaces for predatory puproses,"" basically.   Whereas transmen are painted as victims, we should feel bad for and take up a lot less of the discourse.

This has always bothered me on a different level, beyond the basic hate.  It's the underlying assumption of gender discrimination.   Transwomen are given the same amount of fear and consideration they give to male minorities, and transmen are treated like helpless women and as victims.
As others have mentioned, I don't think your co-worker is being selectively transphobic to trans women only because she does not seem to take your manhood seriously. Although it may seem like she is more okay with trans men than with trans women because she may be nice to you on a superficial level while saying mean things about trans women, it seems like she doesn't take your trans identity seriously and is being transphobic to you as well.

Think about it- if this person knows you are trans, then it should be obvious to her that any general statement that is negative to trans people will hurt your feelings and be obviously offensive to you. The fact she has absolutely no hesistation to say such blatantly transphobic things right in front of you shows that she doesn't really see you as a man or even as a trans person overall. It's likely that in her eyes, you are just a quirky kind of woman, and it seems like she is expecting you to be able to relate with her complaints about how trans women are negatively affecting ""real"" women, because she sees you as being one of those ""real"" women who is being negatively affected by trans women.

I'm not saying this to deny that the fact that misogyny and hatred of women and of the feminine does contribute to trans women generally being more marginalized in society due to the intersection of transphobia and misogyny, but I also want to point out that in this specific situation, your coworker is not being just selectively transphobic to trans women, and is transphobic to trans men as well due to how she treats you.

I appreciate your show of allyship to trans women by pointing out how transmisogyny is playing a role in her behaviour, but I also don't want that to overshadow the awareness of the fact that you are a victim of transphobic behaviour from her as well, and that your own needs are something to consider and prioritize in this situation.
I wish more trans men would acknowledge this terrible double standard and speak against it. I appreciate you doing so. We all face transphobia, and neither is necessarily ""worse"" than the other, but trans women face transphobia rooted in fear, hatred, and disgust, whereas trans men face transphobia rooted in infantilization and contempt.
Yup.  Read any of the most influential/ culturally prominent transphobes -Ray Blanchard, JK Rowling, or just any average TERF -  their focus is 100% on trans women, almost as if trans men didn't exist to them.  It's hard to know exactly why this is the case, some say Blanchard has a fetish for trans women, and he was so bothered that some trans women were lesbians and wouldn't sleep with him, it inspired his ""typology"".  As for Rowling - some say it's because she was traumatized by men years ago and this is the toxic way she processed it.

I'll bring up cis people, it's in the same realm as, women can wear ""mens"" clothing and no one cares -  no one think tomboys are creepy or predatory. But a cis man wearing a skirt is seen as a deviant. It all stems from those same fears.
Transmisogyny is a bitch.
I feel like people are more suspicious about mtf than ftm, because it's taboo for ""a man to become a woman"", while it's kinda okay for a woman to ""become a man"". And because they think of trans women as men, they see them as predators, because you know, men are bad.  A kind of ""wolf in a sheep's clothing"" kind of thing. Also in my experience people are less aware of trans men, while everyone know that trans women exist, so they focus on them more.
The attitude towards men Vs wome is insane.

Men get called pedophiles for taking their children to the playground, trans women get called sexual predators for going to the toilet.

It's the same narrative (we saw it previously with gay men aswell).
From men it's misogyny (they don't want to fuck men)

From women its misandry (men are dangerous)

FTM doesn't matter because ""i wouldn't fuck them anyway"" and it's a woman doing what she wants.
There is a very good she is a terf and believes you're just a confused butch, they are known to do that
Not only is she seeing trans women as men, but her friendliness indicates that she sees you as ""one of the girls"".
You deserve better.
The level of entitlement some cis women have over trans women is unreal.
Sadly, she doesn't really support your transition either, she still sees you as a woman, one who is in need of the ""sisterhood"" to help her out.  

This generalization that ""anyone who's ever had a penis is either a pedophile or a predator"" is just the fucking worst.
Trans women are women. I haven’t met anyone in the bathroom who didn’t ’pass’, but if I did, I wouldn’t raise a stink about it. Goodness. Some people just can’t mind their own business.
My expirience with a lot of cis women is that they're super supportive of me being a woman with a beard or some kind of political statement that women can be masculine too. When I start talking about transitioning and shit they make a 180 and see it as me being a little gay boy with mommy issues trying to appropriate womanhood. Now that I pass they're all just super confused lol

She probably sees it as the opposite for you. You're proof that women can be just as strong and masculine as men, not just a regular old dude dude-ing his way around through life.
i saw the warning and read this anyways [https://tenor.com/6Tar.gif](https://tenor.com/6Tar.gif)
Did you confront her on that topic, or keeping in mind how helpful she may be to you in future, you stood silent?
Absolutely disgusted.
Like how can someone support trans men but not women and vice versa?

It sounds like she has some internalized hate towards men and I’ve noticed often those that have that hate can’t/refuse to see trans women as women

And those who have sexist/misogynistic views of women can’t/refuse to see trans men as men

That’s just my observations
The way I see it, society still sees men as better than women.
So people will see a transman as someone ""upgrading""
to get a better life.
Theyll view a transwoman as someone downgrading, and thinking the only reason theyd do that must be predatory.
I wonder if trans men are regarded as “safe men” and trans women as “unsafe men “ by these people

I am very curious but not surprised
A lot of people are calling into question coworkers true support of OP, but I wouldn't be surprised if this person actually does support trans men.  I think this person has the potentially be an ally for all trans people, and OP is doing a lot of good by trying to explain things to them. I think their problem comes from the patriarchy.

In a patriarchal society, an AFAB that takes on masculine qualities, or transitions to male, could be seen as pursuing power and privilege.  This makes sense to a lot of cis people, power is good, men have power. But when an AMAB takes on female qualities or transitions, cis people see that as relinquishing power and privilege. This isn't true, of course, but it confuses people, so they assume and project ulterior motives of deceit or perversion.
It’s always problems with trans woman haha. Sports, bathrooms, etc. if only trans men existed there would be no trans debate lol
Combination of two societal traits unfortunately. 

First, bith gender and socialization trump identity for many cis individuals. More shared experiences at early ages make you relatable. Where the opposite is scary.  
 
Second, is misogyny.  It's ok to be masculine but not feminine. It's ok for ""girls"" to be boyish. But a boy being feminine is wrong.
shit. I don’t even know what to say now. I just hope if I do transition society wont be fucking delusional
Good luck dude.
Sigh, they sure sound supportive on paper dont they?
Yeah I'd stay away from her dude. Her transphobia is nasty and she probably doesn't see you as a man at all.
From a trans sister to a trans brother :❤️
dont be fooled by ppl like this, i guarantee she’s said mad shit behind ur back. i mean fuck dylan mulvaney but fuck this person more
My partner has explained this to me a couple of times and I think it has merit. Unfortunately, cishet women, no matter their preference in partners will see transmen as “wayward sisters” that have just strayed from the lesbian identity. I think there is some merit, but I think that there is always a double standard for trans women compared to transmen. Transmen face their own struggle, completely, but I think it’s that society has become more comfortable with women or girls wanting to have experiences as men in the same vein as tomboy has become a term that does not really question someone’s “straightness” while the most comparable for boys that identify with their femininity, femboys, are seen as either say gay, queer, or even trans. So the attitude shifts when looking at how someone presents based on where they start and whether they pass. This is not true this is just an observation that could be completely wrong. Either way that woman isn’t really an ally, and has internalized patriarchy that is harmful to trans folk imo
I don't mean to be mean but: You realize that only now?
The fact that she said she could 'never trust any men,' is more telling than anything else for me......

That is an VERY EXTREME position to take on half the world's population.
People being so concerned about trans people in the bathroom is crazy but it has an underlying issue to it. When discussing this with my Intro to Queer Activism Professor she brought up how women, her included, are and have been taught to fear being raped by a man and to be on guard for it. Not that this is necessarily a problem in of itself however it is teaching women that they need to be afraid of men which is not good. There are gender-neutral bathrooms around my campus and I've had conversations with people about them. One person who was a woman mentioned how she was uncomfortable with a man working after her. Nothing happened other than that person existing. When people are taught to be afraid it hurts everyone. We need to teach about rape and what consent is. We need to teach how to be away and not have to be afraid. It is not a problem to feel uncomfortable with a man being in the bathroom but you should do something about that personally like use an individual room. It really sucks how fear is implanted in society and how that is taken out on marginalized groups.
Just a reminder that using “early on in transition” for someone whom you have no idea about their transition path is pretty transphobic. Especially if it’s coming from a cis person. It implies that there is a right way to transition and in such someone else can tell a stranger’s position in their journey. 

If you rephrase it to what they actually mean, it’s usually that they don’t “look enough” like the gender they are perceived to be presenting as. Keep this in mind please. It can be really hurtful.

Thanks for the insights sir. As most trans women know, it's all about passing. This whole trans. Women and bathrooms issue is so goddamn childish it's amazing. Does she think that a trans woman hopped up on estrogen and Spiro is going to be a threat of rape to her?
[removed]
I just want to send hugs as already many comments already punch the terfism of your coworker. Sending hugs and strength to you and everybody who needs it.
Most of the hate for trans women starts with the assumption that they are always men and that all men are dangerous sexual predator, that that’s normal and that it’s acceptable. Right wingers have no issues with men being rapists.
Someone’s JELLO
She probably doesn't even view you as a boy. She sounds sus
I think one of the hardest parts about being a transwoman is simply how much more attention we get, and to an extent, I'm a little jealous of how transmen don't get the same attention. although it also makes me very glad y'all don't have to go through the same kind of struggle. Either way, I appreciate your kind words. 🫶
The transmisogyny seems to be always lurking just under the surface for many cis ""allies"". Sadly.
Don't worry we are used to with it like world is sadly discourages us that's why most of transfem don't even talk in public
That's really sad. I'm sorry to hear this. She's clearly been influenced by transphobic lies on the Internet. If you care for this coworker and are willing to put in the work, they may be a chance that you can teach her - she's within your circle of influence. One key thing that I've found with most people is that they don't understand the difference between gender and sex. Its so crucial to understand this. Not understanding this is the root of transphobia.

I did a talk at my workplace recently about this, and I think people found it really informative. I'll give you the link to the slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D5X8KOkolX1y_mgp4jGpe0DIFqyD38C-uJb2AJIULSo/edit?usp=drivesdk

Its actually a really long talk -- it's worth going through the beginning bit really slowly (so they can understand the difference between gender and sex). I've had to split it into two talks at my workplace. I've done part 1 already and will do part 2 soon! You're welcome to use them.
I don’t like Dylan either and I’m a trans woman. But that lady sounds very TERF-y.
this is sadly extremely common, like stupid common im not even kidding
Agree with a lot of the responses about how she likely sees you still as a woman. I’d note that, within the framework of patriarchy, people tend to infantilize women and afab people and disregard them. You are likely not viewed as a threat so she feels she can be supportive. On the flip side, trans women are viewed as men invading women’s spaces. Because women are infantilized they need protection; men don’t. Additionally, I think a lot of the disparate treatment of trans masculine and trans feminine people comes from the fact that, within the framework of patriarchy, transitioning from female to male makes sense to people. It is perceived as involving capturing more power and privilege. Transitioning from male to female doesn’t make sense to people and is seen as an abomination because it involves giving up power and privilege. This is viewed as an abomination because it more directly contradicts the power structure of patriarchy.
I would be cautious around her because she might be one of those terfs that think they're 'rescuing' you from being trans, she might just be supportive because she wants you to trust her. That being said, the point of this post is still true. Transmisogyny/transphobia aimed at transfems is fucking rampant, I even see alot of transmascs participating in that shit
As a trans woman, I often find myself having to keep my lips sealed tight. Bc if I don’t I’ll have already gone off on so many people without even realizing it.

I always try to be respectful towards everyone but when they’re so bigoted like this… OOOH I WANNA LOSE IT!
I'm curious how do people think us going on hormones is pretending? Why would they be supportive if they think we are cis? I'm genuinely asking because I also have had this happen
>I've run into this with TERF-y types before too; they'll appear supportive because they think of you as a fellow gal pal who is just playing pretend and don't actually consider you to be a man, so you're therefore not perceived as a threat to them.

See also how many stories there are of trans men with initially supportive female friends who suddenly drop off once they start to pass.
yep! i second this. its very common trope on the TERF forms to think of trans masc people as lost-women that are victims of the woke mind virus and that trans femmes are the 'bad' ones.

trans masc people are generally celebrated as long as they look androgynous but as soon as they start to pass these TERFs will drop them hard
This. Unfortunately anything OP felt as ""genuine support"" should be questioned at this point. The biggest tell is that she doesn't appear to trust men. That means that OP's gender is likely not actually being validated. She would be untrusting of OP too, but from the sounds of it, sees him as a ""gal pal"" as you put it.
I never trust CIS women
completely unrelated but i can't help myself i just wanted to say i love your user flair sm 

*what do you mean, normal men?*
If she saw o.p. as even ""pretty much a man anyways,"" she obviously wouldn't trust him... in her own words, at least
Came to the comments to say the same exact thing.
Take my 👻🏅! 💐🦈

Fr...
Bingo. I'd have told the coworker to fuck off and never talked to her again if she was talking that way about any variation of trans people like that to my face. These unevolved idiots need to be shamed.
As a Transfem that is kinda new to this whole TERF debate (aka only knows about it because of a certain author), doesn't the argument that T is the evil by extension mean that all cis men are evil?

Edit: spelling
couldn't have said it better
I am a cis male (53), my son (17) is trans. Between age and antidepressants, I don’t struggle with this much anymore, but I remember being young all too well. He hasn’t started transitioning yet, really, but I have offered him this warning:

Testosterone is a powerful drug. It can make you want to eat, fight, or fuck *everything.* It is your responsibility and duty to be strong in the face of that, to peer through clouded judgment and ensure that you are treating everyone with respect *at all times, no matter what, no excuses.*

For me, it’s just been the last four years or so that I’ve felt myself relieved of these effects. (Yes, there are also downsides to that, which is how I can be fairly certain it’s lower influence of testosterone.) I can’t express to you how much easier it is to be a *person* now.

I know everyone’s experiences are different, but this is mine. My observations of other men’s behaviors seem to indicate that plenty of people have a similar (or more challenging) experience.
The ""women= inherently sexual"" thing is huge. And it also affects trans women themselves. How many times do you see a trans woman's outfit posted here that is skimpy/revealing? I see it way too much. Hand in hand goes the imposter syndrome of ""maybe it's just a fetish and I'm making an excuse.""

That's completely ignoring the societal perception that leads to the BS predator stuff.
I actually think it's the opposite tbh. I think people see MEN as sexual and sexual predators in general because they have a high sex drive and women do not. Thus, they view a man doing something like turning into a woman as something sexual because men will do things all the time just to get laid. It's a sad thing men deal with because they can be accused of doing things for sexual or flirtatious reasons when that isn't the case. But a woman transitioning to a man isn't inherently sexual or dangerous because it's a woman doing it and they aren't seen as sexual predators.
A woman hating on people she perceives as men would be misandry, not misogyny
A woman hating on people she perceives as men would be misandry, not misogyny
she knows what she’s doing. don’t make her comfortable talking ab that shit in front of you. she can gtfo
> an AFAB that takes on masculine qualities, or transitions to male, could be seen as pursuing power and privilege.

This is the delineation. An AFAB. all OP will ever be in this person's eyes is a defiant, go-getter female. No matter how much she says she respects OP, he will always be a man* in her eyes until she addresses the latent Transphobia.
Why fuck Dylan? 

I'm not exactly a fan of her myself 'cause I find her personality a little overly-bubbly and grating but I haven't seen anything she's actually done wrong, has she fucked up somewhere?
Wait I'm out of the loop, why do trans people dislike dylan?
I mean if you’ve detransitioned and you’re not a man it would be pretty hard to see yourself as one.
Anyone can be a threat of rape. However that doesn’t mean a trans woman, passing or not, is more dangerous than anyone else.
[removed]
Because TERF-types think trans men have been duped by the patriarchy, and once they realize it they will de-transition.
Most cis people have no idea how many effects those hormones have. They have no idea that they can totally change what someone looks like, and they often think that physical changes are the result of surgery or something.
I think it has more to do with TERFs and such tend to crave the same power dynamics of the patriarchy and thus see trans men (but still seen as women) as invading men’s spaces appropriately. In a way to enhance and further women’s power subversively. It’s why so many are aligned with the conservative right wing in many ways as it is the current resistance to the further “eroding” of male power in society. These women and allies want that power for themselves, not feminine power or authority but women claimed male authority. It’s beyond stupid, the last thing the world needs is MORE patriarchy, especially from women. The contradiction and hatred of TERFs is astounding as it does not further women’s rights at all. Really at the end TERFs and TERF like people tend to not make a great deal of logical sense as their entire premise is based on emotion and the exchange of that rather than logical or well thought out reasoning.
> I'm curious how do people think us going on hormones is pretending? Why would they be supportive if they think we are cis? I'm genuinely asking because I also have had this happen


I think it's just because they don't really think you're ""pretending"" or that you're cis, they just categorize people by their sex more than by their identity. 
Like, many people here are saying that it means these people don't ""really"" support the people the people they appear to be supporting, but I honestly think that's a big stretch. 
Someone can think a trans woman is a type of a man and still support them transitioning simply because it's what they want to do and doesn't hurt anyone, so why not support them? 

Many people use different classifications than most trans people would prefer, and man/woman is still most commonly a reference to someones sex over most if not all of the world, and this idea that this is inherently hateful towards trans people just seems silly.
It's just like putting on clothes, body modification. It doesn't change who you really are, your spirit, your self is still the same.
Yeah I sadly lost a lot of closeness with some of my friends who are cis women the more I started to pass, and I have a horrible feeling it's because they were hoping I'd ""pass"" in the sort of softboi anime twink kind of way and failed to recongise that I am over six feet tall, have always had the shoulders of a linebacker and that, if his appearance is anything to go by, my father might not actually be a Norwegian man but actually a sort of bipedal Norwegian man-bear hybrid. 

Like there's nothing wrong with being a twinkier trans dude, I was just never, ever gonna be and I feel like some of the cis women I was friends with - even the ones who were queer in some way themselves - were weirdly disappointed by it.
This is transmisogyny not feminism
Ban evasion accounts be like:
I think you meant TERF not just feminist
Coworker is a FART. Feminism-appropriating radical transphobe. ""TERF"" would imply she's actually a feminist.

Edit: I have been informed that ""FART"" is cringe. Please accept as an alternative, ""FIB,"" for feminist-identifying bigot.
Look up the definition of feminist. Plz.
I'd assume so. Most of the women who do ascribe to TERF ideology tend to be the ones who believe all men are evil predatory beings.
Radical feminism has always been more about being anti-men than being pro-women. If you’re transitioning FTM you’re joining the ranks of the enemy. If you’re transitioning MTF you’re an invader. You’ll never win with that crowd.
Yeah, and that's why they try to say their feminists. It's all about ""protecting"" cis women from men of any kind. It's stupid, but unfortunately here we are.
Yes TERFs/Radfems are extremely misandristic.
They hate men/males in all shapes and forms, they hate Trans women only because they are assigned MALE at birth.
Yes. The thing about Terfs is that it’s much more about hating men and reinforcing their version of the gender binary (the white female one) than it is about actual equality. They ignore any and all marginalized men and genders, and are focused on preserving white female victimhood rather than egalitarianism. Anyone who falls into the proximity of masculinity is undesirable (this includes black cis women and trans women of color, in particular) and an enemy who needs to be snuffed out and kept in line. Terf ideals are very insidious and revolve around a blend of misogyny x misandry and white supremacy (trans-misogyny is a term used to describe this. Contrary to popular belief, trans men experience this as well, but in different ways. But, the root of the discrimination is the same.). it’s easy thought process to fall into, so much so that you’ll probably see it echoed by white trans people and other queer people as well. Part of what makes it so appealing is that it plays off the trauma many people have faced at the hands of cis men, and it provides an outlet for that trauma, fear and aggression while offering an illusion safety beneath oppression.
Medically, what you’re saying is just false. 

A lot of these ideas and why it’s so hard to “person” as a young male are due to socialization and gender essentialism excusing a lot of inexcusable behaviors. 
When I first went on T I believed these myths and thought I’d become aggro, violent and horny, easily irritated etc… Color me surprised when the exact opposite happened. I mellowed considerably and I’ve yet to see any anger or aggression from taking T. Yah, my libido went up and it was tricky to manage finding private time and getting used to the physical feeling, but that’s about it. It didn’t make me some angry predator.

I also verified this with my doctor, who confirmed that what you’re describing, and what is commonly believed about T, is just not true. 

T isn’t any more “powerful” than any other hormone and if you have too much of it, it can even convert to estrogen which actually can cause irritability and trigger mood swings. But too much of anything in your body is a bad idea. We not so sexually dimorphic as a species that T is some wild “drug” and E is not. 

For the sake of trans men, and men in general, we really need to stop forcing these myths onto guys that T is what drives these behaviors, or that T is some major indicator of aggression, because it’s not. The way we teach men how to process their emotions and cope with the world around them is what drives these behaviors, not hormones.

Also, the idea that T is a powerful drug while E is not, is what keeps trans men from life saving healthcare, and it’s also what allows other gender essentialists to paint us as unmanageable predators (and by extension, other marginalized men as well) who need a firm hand. It’s not a cool stereotype, and we need to lean more on medical science than myth.
I've been suffering through that myself. Questioning whether or not its a fetish, I don't believe it is, but my mind simply refuses to stop going back to that possibility of ""what if its a fetish?"". It's been driving me bat-shit crazy.
I agree. Women are seen as being inherently sexual objects, men are seen as predators. That’s what I meant.
I know. I was referring to the idea that women are of lower value, and that “a man dressed as a woman” is lowering themselves
Fair enough, what I actually meant was sexism but I just woke up and picked the wrong word lol
[removed]
one person does not mean all trans ppl lol
Dylan is a bit like sugar-coated trans experience especially her content on tiktok which feels more like targeted to cis people then trasn people, lot of trans people don't like her content because of it (I don't either, but I have no problem with her). However, lately, she got a lot of attention because of all kinds of super privileges, and a lot of people probably either feel jealousy or annoyance that the most famous trans woman is somebody they feel is not good representation of us.

Dylan is the lottery winner of our community she is super lucky, and because of that, she is also really privileged, and people who have already disliked her because of her personality now hate her too.
I meant when I identified as one. Another trans man I know says they don’t really feel like a man so I don’t think it’s an uncommon thing.

Edit: I think I’m referring to trans masc people. Not trans men cause trans men do feel like men.
Exactly. But MtF trans women taking HRT are scientically have lower sex drives than, say, cis males who statitically speaking are far more likely to commit rape. The only people saying that trans people are groomers are liars, QAnon suckers, and social vermin spreading the contagion of hate. Time to sue them.
[removed]
Why encourage the HRT then? Do they hope it will make the person regret it? 

As a side note the pressure of feeling like I was betraying women was very strong and it took me a long time to work past it. I hear that's a common experience
Transitioning is literally fighting against the patriarchy though.
Glad I scrolled before replying. I'd add that they also don't realize:

1. How different trans people are mentally from their AGAB, to begin with.
2. How many mental effects HRT has.
But it is inherently ignorant and bigoted🤷
Oh god, so much this. Cis women love trans men when they are androgynous ‘softboi’ types, but not when they are big hairy bearded dudes. All forms of expression of masculinity are totally valid for trans guys, but cis women definitely tend to fetishise the more feminine forms.
Hey there's a lot of us who like the hairy burly trans men lol. You're valid too.
Can we not with the ""fart""? I get that you don't want to call her a feminist, because she isn't, but fart just sounds like something you'd hear from a six year old on the playground. ""Gender critical transphobe"" works.
> It **can** make you want to eat, fight, or fuck everything.

Can, not will.

> I know everyone’s experiences are different, but this is mine.

You'll also note that I never said anything about estrogen.

You're not wrong about cultural excusing of inexcusable behaviors. This is true far too often. But your assertions that that is the *cause* of those behaviors *in young males* contains the subtext that young males at best have no conscience of their own, and at worst inherently desire to do inexcusable things, apparently purely because of their ""maleness.""

That's an uncool stereotype, too.
I didn't get that impression from OPs description of events. It seems more like their coworker is resentful towards men in general, rather than seeing women as lesser
She has no responsibility for how people see us. She didn’t cause transphobia. She didn’t create it. She isn’t sponsoring it or encouraging it. It’s disgusting to blame trans creators for transphobia. Blame transphobes, not Dylan.
I really dislike her content, but she didn't do anything wrong. She's being constantly harassed by anti trans activists... So why are we getting mad at her instead?? Like, Matt Walsh can come and find a random trans woman being cringey and suddendly she's the asshole? Instead of the transphobic pos whose mocking her?
She’s nice and I support her as a person, but I’d much rather be represented by a trans person who’s actually done something significant (and non-trans-related) with their life, has been trans for long enough to truly understand things (like more than 5 years), and that is strategic politically. 

She’s just a kid and has been trans for not even 2 years. Those attributes are not particularly what I want in someone representing us.
Tbh I’ve seen a lot of trans people who fucking hate Dylan. Specifically r/MTF which is arguably the most insufferable trans subreddit I’ve seen. Lots of… takes…

As for me idfk Dylan and really don’t care to all that much unless there’s a valid reason I should
Yes def. a privilege thing. Most people can access gender affirming care as quickly, or as easily as she has just within the last year in some people’s entire lives! 

I think she has also been accepted in a way that poor, or BIPOC, or non passing, or more fluid in gender expression trans folks typically are. 

She really represents a very niche tiny part of the trans community and I think there maybe is the fear or frustration that cis people are following and watching her as representation for all of us. 

When actually apart from being trans, there is really isn’t a lot in common.
Because I’m assuming you figured out you’re not a man? It’s hard to see yourself as something you’re not
[removed]
Maybe she doesn't believe HRT will cause that many changes.
No it's not. Plain and Simple.
Is it? How and why?
Its akin to them loving having a male best friend thats gay.
More for us
Give me an acronym, not an initialism, and I'll consider changing.
Well, she kinda has responsibility on how people see us.
I completely understand what you’re saying, and I agree that we need more public role models like the ones you’re describing. 

I also want to mention that Dylan did have a successful broadway career before transitioning, which I would definitely consider something significant, if not only in the music and theatre community. I can confirm as another trans vocalist that it’s easy to feel we have to give up on any dreams or careers in musical theatre, opera, or public performance when we transition because very few roles (no roles in older shows) are written for women with a tenor or lower voice. The fact that she is actively working to make a return to the singing and acting community is an important message for trans artists and to cis casting directors, content creators, and audiences. This process is slow for her, and will no doubt be assisted by her privileges and visibility, but is a vital step in helping trans women access the arts as women, not perceived as drag artists, and for all trans and GNC folks. 

I’ll also mention that as a trans woman who started her transition around the same age and time Dylan did, seeing her unabashed pride and joy in who she is and in her womanhood in spite of being early in her transition has been very important for me. I suspect I’m not the only budding trans woman or trans person who feels that way. Trans creators who are deeper in their transition timeline are extremely important also, but for those who are early in our transitions it can feels like we have to wait five or more years to be “real,” “beautiful,” or “valid” like they are. This is a woman who when early in the process of HRT, without bottom surgery, without top surgery, and before FFS said “I am a woman’s exactly as I am, and you can be also.” I would say that in many ways this is equally important to seeing public figures who have been through public transition, HRT, or surgeries for 5 or more years. In that sense the issue becomes not a matter of “either or” and more an issue of “why does society only allow one or two influencers into the public sphere to represent our community?” Perhaps if she was one of many more visible trans people she wouldn’t be so much a topic of debate, and as such I wonder if we could unite on identifying the problem as systemic and social, rather than personal. 

I lastly would like to have some sympathy on the fact that, as far as I can tell from keeping up with her content, she had no intention of becoming as visible as she is, and frequently finds it overwhelming. She has mentioned many times, for example, that she feels someone else, such as a trans woman of colour who has been out as trans for longer, may have been a better fit for interviews, meetings with the president, or activism than she would. One could argue that she should have referred those people instead. But… realistically we know that these public appearances are being requested as a result of her celebrity status and that they wouldn’t necessarily accept a substitute who would gather less visibility. I think she is trying to do the best she can to act responsibly with the opportunities that have been thrown at her, and has been very vocal about requesting that older, more experienced, or less privileged trans people are given the same platform. If I were given the opportunity to help bring visibility to my all-too-often-silenced community I think I would accept that too, and I doubt I’m alone in saying so. I also don’t blame her for taking the opportunity to make a career out of sharing her all-too-often-silenced life and struggles with the world. After all, one’s capacity is limited by their wealth and if she can gain stability by telling her story it will help be able to continue telling it. 

Broadly speaking, and perhaps beyond the context of this comment chain, I want to say she’s taking a lot of bullets for this community. Transphobes are going to fire at whichever of us is in the public eye regardless of how far we are in our transition, and they won’t stop firing until there are so many of us that they can’t keep up anymore and the public finally sees through their baseless hate. She is taking on a responsibility in being visible when it means she will be targeted for it (including media assaults, threats, and doxing) and she is helping to hold the door open for others to become visible too by being who she is in spite of it all. This woman is just trying to live her life in finding trans joy and euphoria and trying to tell other trans people and youth that they can to. I’m sure the last thing she needs, and we need as a community, is to pile onto the assault with friendly fire. I much prefer to choose to appreciate the good she is doing than to join those hateful of our community in criticizing her.
Yeah I agree
What's wrong with that sub?
This. 
  
They overemphasize childhood socialization and underemphasize the effect of hormones. 
  
Which is so backwards because we’ve heard what some men will say when they don’t think any women are around. It scared us. It didn’t give us ideas ffs.
This is what I've noticed whenever a trans related thread makes it to r/all, especially with regards to sports. The vast majority of cis people have ZERO idea of the effect of actual HRT and how impactful hormones actually are. They assume chromosomes are absolute. For example, some people think every trans women need top surgery, they can't process that breasts can grow simply from being on HRT.
Because trans women are women, and trans men are men.

How do you define sex? Chromosomally? Hormonally? Organs at birth?

Most people don't use sex, most people are just ignorant.
I'd previously used ""FIB,"" feminist identified bigot. Just like they call us ""trans identified male"" or TIM, or ""trans identified female"" or TIF. Now I just prefer to use the same language for them that they want, so they can't run away from their beliefs. If they want to be called ""gender critical,"" ok fine. That means gender critical leader Posie Parker wants armed men to go into the women's room to decide who belongs there, and gender critical activist Lily Cade said we should be lynched.
She's a person, it's pretty gross how you're implying that everyone has to be perfect all the time or it's OUR fault that people despise us. How do you think that attitude affects you, in the way you live your life? Aren't you exhausted? Or are you the exception?
No the ABSOLUTE FUCK she doesn’t? That’s like saying Taylor Swift is responsible for how people see women. Or saying Harry Styles is responsible for how people see men. One celebrity from a minority does NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE MINORITY. Blame transphobes for transphobia. Blame bigots for bigotry.
I think that you described it very well and you're right, I take back what I said in my other comments, I didn't express what I meant properly. Although I'm not quite the kind of person to watch her content and am not a fan of hers, she's definitely a beautiful and talented woman who is unfortunately just being used by fascists to discredit us, only because she's enthusiastic and their lives are dark and hateful.
I just noticed that it got weirdly negative about OTHER trans people, and not the ones we should have issues with (transmeds, pick-me’s, etc).

I’m talking specifically the non-passing or the successful, and generally the sub just tends to get so absolutely negative. I was once told that “no cis woman will ever respect us” and it got hugely upvoted. 

Then there’s the comments about Dylan such as stating her transition is for clout because that’s what she made a brand off of, how she’s making us look bad on the big screen, and so on. Just really stupid takes, now put that on any other successful trans woman.

And there’s also the whole “Lia Thomas RUINED trans people in sports she’s a fucking traitor” which happened.

Honestly the sub just sucks.
>Which is so backwards because we’ve heard what some men will say when they don’t think any women are around. It scared us. It didn’t give us ideas ffs.

This. Holy shit, so much this. I don't want to think about some of the conversations I've heard when they thought they were out of earshot. Outside of friends and some family, I do not want to be around men anymore and I'm still boymoding pretty much everywhere.
Literally this there are two trans masc men in my friend group me being mtf all the cis friends thought that the only way to get boobs was to get surgery
Not by any absolute, universal definition.
They can be, if you define those words in a way that causes them to be, but you aren't de facto hateful if you don't.

If that is your threshold for considering someone transphobic, that term becomes pretty meaningless.
I'll admit, I like FIB.
I'm not saying it's our fault, neither am I saying it's her fault. It's just that the fact she is that famous (and focuses specifically on the trans topic) means she will influence how a lot of people see the trans community because people generalize. It's not her obligation to present herself more seriously and virtuously, but it'd definitely help in making our community look better.
Sorry, this is super unrelated, but it’s super exciting to see a fellow member of the Eve Council c:
Lia Thomas....the middlingly successful body builder?
I disagree.
And you didn't answer my question. So I suspect that you are sealioning, and not discussing in good faith.
It’s always fun to see another comrade! It’s a great name am I right???
The same one with the crazy never before seen huge wild record (the same one which was beaten less than a year later)
>I disagree

That's fair enough, I'd be happy to hear the specifics if you're up for sharing them. 


>How do you define sex? Chromosomally? Hormonally? Organs at birth?

In the context of identifying it, by visible indicators like body shape, facial features, etc. I'm not anyones doctor so my identifying is only used for shallow social differences, and there are no horrible consequences if I happen to be wrong, just a ""ah, sorry"".

if you mean how I define sex on a conceptual level rather than in practice, I suppose it would be based on what gonads a person has, just to pick a relatively unambiguous function. Obviously living creatures come in a wide variety so any single defining factor can be insufficient for certain scenarios, but that is the case with most categories. 


>I suspect that you are sealioning, and not discussing in good faith.

You can suspect that, but I feel that it's fruitless to speculate on the motivation of others. You don't have to respond if you don't wish to, and you don't need to justify why to anyone, you don't owe me any answers.
Want an even cooler name?

Evelyn is derived from Norman Aveline c:

And due to etymology Evelyn is the diminutive of Eve and not the other way around lol
I see, apparently she meets the requirements for low testosterone to keep swimming competitively. She took testosterone suppressors for two years so her levels are low even for cis women. (Which is bad for your bones, don't add that to your transition goals)
Your definition fails on a simple factual basis; look up the guevedoce.

If your classification system fails regularly *it is a bad system*.

Your problem is that you are ignorant, so much so that you don't know what you don't know. This is also called the Dunning-Kruger effect.
> Evelyn is the diminutive of Eve

Okay, THAT is kinda fucking sick. Def gonna use that from now on.

""Name's Eve, Evelyn for short""
And that’s barring the fact her skill degraded strongly. Her times are incomparable to where she used to stand in terms of time itself. Placement wise she actually stayed more or less in the same upper echelon. She had good games and bad games but in general she was consistently a top-tier swimmer so who’d of fucking thought it would translate over proportionally
>If your classification system fails regularly it is a bad system

Depends on the useage of the system and whether those using it expect it to be all encompassing or not. 

What is your suggested better alternative system to define whether a human is male or female? 


>Your problem is that you are ignorant, so much so that you don't know what you don't know

I'm fully aware of the existence of a variety of intersex conditions, and I specifically mentioned that the variety of humans means that the classifications will not always apply. 

I'm curious what point you're making though. Do you really feel that a categorization can only be useful if it applies in all cases? Most categories used in daily life would then fail to meet your threshold.

I really don't get the mind dysphoria part, can someone explain it?		"Habitual behaviors and thought patterns we've picked up by performing our AGAB but make us go ""Ew I don't like being like that""
[deleted]
The other commenter summed it up very well. For me as a trans man it manifests as being disdainful of my emotionality. I cry very easily and this has always felt wrong and uncomfortable. Even though I know that there is nothing wrong with crying and would not fault anyone else for it no matter their gender, whenever I do it I get intense feelings of dysphoria. I don’t want to be reacting in that manner; it feels like there is a disconnect between the person that I am and how my body reacts. I want that more traditional male stoicism and when my emotions don’t line up with that it makes me dysphoric.
This is like a pie chart for me 60% mind dysphoria, 20% social, 20% body
Brain fog, disassociation, frustration, depression, dysphoria can cause a bunch of mental effects. Many known many as yet only theorised to be linked.

Put it this way, pre hrt I was diagnosed with dyspraxia which explained my poor time keeping, poor understanding of time passing, poor hand eye coordination and terrible sleep pattern, since going on hrt all of that has basically gone to the point I probably wouldn't pass a dyspraxia test anymore. 

So fuck knows I'm not a neurologist but I do know my brain just works better on hrt than when I wasn't.
It’s basically your thoughts and emotions causing you dysphoria. For example, transmascs might feel it if they cry easily, feel a lot of empathy/sympathy, are passive, etc. while transfems might feel it if they are cold, distanced, aggressive, etc.
I read it as a dislike of the hormones effects on one's mood. There are many accounts, frankly in both directions, of people being calmer and more at peace with themselves after starting up their hormone of choice. For a significant fraction this effect hits way quicker than physical changes have a chance to manifest. While transfemmes will often talk about feeling a greater depth of emotions and less anger, transmasculine folk tend to report feeling less anxious and more chill as it were.
Biochemical dysphoria is also a thing. My brain literally works better on estrogen. Running it on testosterone was like putting diesel in an unleaded car.
All of it, mix 100% of all three categories into one pot and you get the nastiest dysphoria pie and me right in the center of it
Things like being dysphoric about crying/not being able to cry, subconsciously misgendering/deadnaming yourself, feeling emotions that are stereotypically masculine (anger etc.) or emotions that are stereotypically feminine (vulnerability etc.)
It can be like the emotions you feel (ie, crying too much and feeling too feminine, or being too angry and feeling too masculine), or it can be from things you perceive as feminine or masculine, like how you walk or talk or certain things you're interested in. It's mostly a feeling that your ""soul"" or ""mind"" is too feminine/masculine for some reason.
My social dysphoria kind’ve causes my body one. When I wear a mask, I get seen as male and it’s great. But then it makes me scared to take off my mask because I don’t want to be registered as female. I was once at the gym and I decided to use the male locker room and i left my mask on but because I was wearing a tight shirt (with a binder but I have wide hips and a small waist), I was so scared to get clocked. I mean in retrospect, no one looked at me or cared I was there but there’s still that part of me that thought maybe they were just being polite.
I have all 3, body is easy to understand, social is also pretty obvious, but mind I only really understood when I took hormone blockers.

To me, on Testosterone I had WAY more thoughts of having sex, agression, violence and general disconnection to my feelings. 

I hated feeling aggressive in a ""masculine"" way, (I haven't taken E but I assume the way you experience aggression is different) I hated having aggressive sexual thoughts, I hated having that disconnection from my thoughts... 

Empathy is also impaired while on higher T, in my experience. It's easier to think of people as objects. 

I don't mean to say ""only women have feelings"" but please, understand that hormones have a profound effect on your mind and behavior.

Some people might want those masculine traits, they can be great! Make you more confident and dominant. Less sensitive or prone to crying, most of my FtM friends are happy with those changes.
I get mind dysphoria. I ask my self why am I like this? Why do I have to feel this way. I'm very comfortable wearing feminine clothes and clothes assigned to my birth gender but I have recently also been experienced some body dysphoria
I think it’s like, if you identify as a boy but you get really emotional and cry a lot, you feel like you’re ‘acting like a girl’ which makes you dysphoric
For me it's mostly the masculine conditioning to not cry, especially in public, and deadnaming myself in my thoughts
I 100% have mind dysphoria thinking about it. I feel like my emotions are almost stifled, sometimes. I want to cry or laugh but I just can't get into the full range of emotions I know exists.
See Dara Hoffman-Fox's ""You and Your Gender Identity: A Guide to Discovery"" chapter 12 (specifically pgs 175-177 in my edition). Amazing explanation!
Would an example of mind dysphoria be something like hating how I can never seem to cry?
If we reject the mind-body duality, then mind dysphoria is a form of body dysphoria where the part of your body you're displeased with is your brain: the way hormones affect neurology, the way social pressures have shaped it through neuroplasticity, etc..
bro i gots all 3 cuz i have 0 fem pieces of clothing, literally today i laid in bed and was just cuddling a teddy bear bc i was upset the my dumb masculine body is a fucking square 🟥 and also today as that i've recently become trans, i keep on saying things that my normal male self would say like ""yo"" which isn't really even masculine but my brain dislikes it soooo....
For the mind, I see it as your mind expects one thing, your body does something else. Like, pre-T, I could be confident as hell for public speaking. But the second I heard my voice, it was like an out-of-body, something foreign taking over to come out of my mouth. That would make me blush/shake/etc. Even if my mind was screaming 'I don't give a damn what any of these people think, why is my body doing this?!?!?', it still would go on. Haven't had a single issue with that after starting T. 

Another would be crying when angry or frustrated. The emotions I felt and what my mind said would convey angry or frustrated. But my body would still cry for no reason. That would only increase the anger and frustration. Again, something I haven't had to deal with since starting T. 

So I would say it's from having one expectation that you, well, expect to happen. Only for the dominant hormones in your body to do the opposite. Hope that makes sense and helps you understand it better. (And this is just my take, so it differs person-to-person)
Once a month right before That Time Of The Month, I get terribly sad and lethargic and anxious and confused, and usually have doubts whether I’m trans. Then I start bleeding and I’m like “oh right, that’s a thing that happens to me. I stop making t for a few days.” I can’t wait to actually fucking be stable instead of fighting for it and pretending; I hate this goddamn rollercoaster. I don’t like dealing with emotions bc it makes me fucking exhausted. I used to be so even-keeled as a kid and now I have to fight to act the same throughout the month, because lemme tell you “acting like I’m on my period” gives me dysphoria like nothing else. Except my tits. And birth name. And not having a beard :(
Mm yes all. All- me all.
Pretty lucky overall. Just sometimes my internal self image pixelates I'll get a glimpse in a mirror and be surprised that I look like that already, wow!
50% social, 40% body, and 10% mind for me
Semi-related question: can you be trans/nb without feeling dysphoria?
I feel … seen?
From puberty to when I started presenting fem (about 14 years), I had an almost constant sense of dread - that something just on the edge of my perception was deeply wrong. Gender affirming activities/clothes and estrogen are the only things that have ever made it stop. I'm pretty sure this is largely biochemical dysphoria, a response of my brain expecting estrogen and receiving testosterone.
this really helped me, i never got the bad social dysmorphia but seeing that my mind brain dysphoria is valid really helped me come to terms that not having insane amounts of dysphoria doesnt make me any less trans
To me it was a lot about libido. Male libido terrorised me. The way my brain wanted me to view women disgusted me (am the lesbian) and I missed something - that came with E. Female libido is what I was always after - a fulfilling, emotional experience, my brain finally views women in this fluffy, non-sexualized way.
I get dysphoria from being so emotional, crying a lot, liking certain things etc, because I associate these to be feminine things. I think that can be mind dysphoria?
It's like if you think you're ""too emotional"" cause you're ftm, or ""too angry"" of you're mtf. Or like if you don't get ""only men understand thus joke"" type jokes as ftm, or ""things only women understand"" not making sense when you're mtf. Not sure what the equivalent would be for nb people
I don't feel it, but my best friend (a trans man) does (or used to). He felt really dysphoric about traits he views as feminine. He hated getting emotional, crying, or being ""soft"" because it made him feel womanly. I think that at least in his case it was the effects of toxic masculinity
Hormones have an effect on emotional regulation. Pre E trans women and pre T trans men experience emotions in a way that feels wrong because they're missing a physiologically component that determines how intense those emotions hit them.
For me I know this sometimes manifested less as learned patterns and more as the chemical reactions in my body not lining up with my personality. Before I started HRT testosterone boosts would sometimes affect my emotions or thoughts in ways that gave me a panic attack. I don’t know if anyone else has experienced that.
I'd reformulate the part about mind dysporia as your thoughts and emotions not lining up with your *expected* gender identity. I can see gender roles and/or norms feeding that feeling of discomfort. Heck, at least that's how my dysphoria feels...
Ah, the one I deal with most. When you misgender yourself, when you behave in a way more akin to your AGAB, stuff that nobody else can really witness but you absolutely *hate*.
Yeah, for me, I think I still feel like I can't really act the way I want to because I definitely have those feelings like I'm invading women's spaces. And because of that, I get a lot of dysphoria when I do something remotely masculine. I'm really scared sometimes of seeming like an effeminate gay man. Also, I feel like vocal dysphoria kind of fits into mind as well as body dysphoria because it's a combination of physical characteristics and mannerisms between gestures, character in tone, and even the content of speech.

Recently, I've been thinking about how dysphoria is really not like anything else, and it's a really isolating feeling. So I'm glad I have a lot of people around me that also experience it.
Some could be from stereo type. “Men act/ think this way, women think that way” kind of thing, and emotions could be similar but also there are things like how testosterone makes emotions deeper and harder to express, or how estrogen makes it easier to express them but they’re also more sensitive
I've never really thought about mind dysphoria before but now that I have I definitely feel it.   we had to put down the family dog and my mom and sister were so upset, and I ended up crying because I felt like I should be crying like them but the emotion just wasn't there.
i still dont get how male and female brains are apparently different, it doesnt seem like a real fact, even if it is
Wow this is totally on point. I am going to make this a poster and pin this to my board at work.
Out of the three I mainly contend with emotional dysphoria and much less of the other two.
This inate urge to want so desperately to be a girl. Your feelings, the way you talk to yourself everything is female except for the outside you.
I feel like it might be like how people associate certain emotions with certain genders
plumbus from rick and morty lol
Birth gender
I still don’t understand 😭😭
All of the above.
Add the ""All the above"" box.   


Looking more like I want to and acting more like I always have but more correct to how I like, but the dysphoria and fear is real.
I actually feel like I get mind dysphoria the most. I’m a trans woman but most of the time I have a tough punk tomboy personality and only act super femme when I feel like I have to avoid a complicated social interaction.

It feels fucked up and it gets me in my head, like I’m somehow inappropriate or just not femme enough, but I also know that’s bullshit and I’m valid anyway. I don’t have to act like a ‘daddys girl’ or whatever you want to label it. I’ll kick your ass and I suck dick, come at me.

I guess like all dysphoria there’s ways to manage and counter it but it still fucks with me and it still sucks sometimes. But I am who I am and I won’t apologize for it.
at first i couldn’t understand it at all but then i realized it’s something i’m deeply familiar with. dysphoria relating to emotions, personality traits, etc that are associated with a particular gender. in my case i tend to feel like a failed woman for being too “aggressive” and not empathetic enough.
I’ve got body, and mind and I guess soul if you believe in that thing. My best friend and I were born in the same hospital a few hours apart cuz our parents were friends, and she always felt she was meant to be a man, and me vice versa since as young as we can remember. So 8mm still like 98% sure our souls got swapped somehow or something.
[removed]
for me mind dysphoria is not fitting into the gender stereotype of the gender I identify as , even though I am a typical teen girl (unless I am depressed) I still get mind dysphoria and I cannot express myself as a girl to others,
I have mind dysphasia but tbh I don’t get it either and I think that’s the dysphoria part as well lol
Ur brain says ""this gender acts this way and u don't therefore u aren't who u say u are"" 


Mental health stuff never makes perfect logical sense
Bingo
For me (transfem) it’s things like

* not being able to cry

* feeling emotionally flat

* struggling with empathy

All of these things can be exacerbated by testosterone. Not that all people on testosterone have these issues (or see them as problems) of course but for me it makes me feel dysphoric (depressed, anxious, irritable, etc.) when I can’t access the emotion I’m trying to feel.
Uh, is it bad that I feel all 3?
mind is complex. it goes from emotions you associate with the gender you aren't (like being angry as a trans woman as anger is seen as a more male thing) that when you feel em you get dysphoric. it probably also includes dreams causing dysphoria. like i am on tiddie skittles since a year and i have still dreams where i am a guy and those dreams make me dysphoric. basically anything your mind cooks up that then causes you to feel dysphoric. like for me when i am horny i sometimes feel dysphoric when it's like an aggressive kind of horny that i associate with male. it's honestly really hard to describe cause mind dysphoria is very subjective.
I don't know. Maybe like. Having some dysphoria over having interests that align with their birth sex? I don't really understand it either lol.
behaviors we do, it's pretty simple actually, social is when others don't perceive you correctly, body is when your body doesn't define you correctly, mind is when your behaviors don't define correctly. for example if your agab is female you might feel dysphoria doing things or playing roles that are stereotypically feminine, or having feminine behaviors, interests, or emotions. a lot of people understand what this is but don't know it's dysphoria
Oh wow I had no idea mind dysphoria was even an aspect but that makes SO much sense for me personally! Thank you for sharing. It's hard to put into words but I'll have a think and try later.
Aaand i feel all of these
for me its 40% social 30% body and 30% mind
I don't really suffer from any if them thankfully
I have them all, amazing
Uhm- is it bad I feel all three-
This idea has intrigued me for like a year (since I first saw this image). I think it hits right at a super critical core, but I've not really been able to explore this at all from my single point of view, and I can't find any writings or discussions about categorizing dysphoria or exploring commonalities in a more structured way
I felt gross and masc in my mind but since starting hrt 5.5 months ago my mind is the one type of dysphoria that has totally vanished. I feel great in terms of emotions. Not that I'm saying I always have positive emotions (they're mostly not) but the way I feel them is gender affirming now. Most of the negative emotions are from the other kinds of dysphoria though 🙃
The mind one i think is if you feel sad or emotional (stereotypically feminine qualities) but you identify as male, that kinda thing maybe
My mind dysphoria mostly consists of residual self-image, when my theatre of mind automatically creates an image of myself that looks like egg-me, making me dysphoric. Or my inner voice sounding like my actual voice because my brain can't picture what I might sound like on T one day. When I read a chat log between me and another person and my brain goes funky fem on my own lines, that hurts. 

On the emotional side it's just tiresome to be so extremely peak-valley all the goddamn time and I hope to find more balance when I get on T.

In general I have a hard time ""feeling like a man"" against the whole dysphoria package that I carry.
It's the social dysphoria for me, mainly cuz A) I am not in a stage of my transition where I could even hope to pass and B) My outside family doesn't even know I'm trans
I get this tbh. I notice it most in the way me (pre T) and my cis process our emotions, and it makes me really dysphoric. It's like, even if we feel the same level of emotion, I am so much quicker to well up with tears without wanting to. It's an uncontrollable thing, but he simply doesn't get this, despite being an emotional person. 

It's like the automatic response I believe to be because of the hormones - you hear about transmen finding it harder to cry on T. 

So yeah, I guess we're referring to the emotional impact of the wrong hormones. Period moods/pre mentrual syndrome is another example for me personally.
The first two, got punished for it a lot as a child so I keep my mind/emotions under tight control to ""fit in"".  I suspect that has a lot to do with why I tend to be introverted.
Mind would probably be able to be explained as ftms getting really emotional pre-HRT and since that emotional thing is stereotypically a feminine thing  it causes dysohoria
I have huge body dysphoria
Maybe it's supposed to be about your interests and stuff as well as emotion? Like a trans guy feeling dysphoric about himself because he cries a lot and likes makeup idk
The mind one confuses the fuck out of me, ngl.
Oh. Oh joy. I have three types.
Wow i only knew an edited meme version of this where mind dysphoria is replaced with mario. Just mario
[deleted]
When in need of a cry my mind goes man up and I cant cry so I sit in sadness. Idk if that exactly it but that's my take.
My experience with mental dysphoria was a goddamn terror. Any time I acted as I assumed a birth-gender self would act or indulged a birth-gender aligned interest or adopted a posture or took part in an activity I aligned with my birth gender in any way? I would spend the next several hours to several days invalidating myself and my trans experience. It sometimes still gets to me but it's less so now, and far less often... How'd I do it?

1. Internalizing the fact that ultimately, all gender roles are constructed phantoms enforced by a society that ultimately uses those cues to imply and defend a power structure which I already don't agree with. There is no singular trait or activity or state of thought which must necessarily belong to any given gender experience.
2. Recognizing that in relation to my own system of definitions, however arbitrary, I have a gender that is fluid. My experience of my mental gender can and will change over time, sometimes as a slow trickling current, and sometimes as a crashing wave.
3. That within that fluidity of gender experience, along with the internalized precept above, my presentation and my interests and my actions can either defy the conventions of my momentary gender or conform to those conventions *and that both outcomes can be desirable at different times in different situations.*
4. That my comfort with or need for any label can and will shift as my experience of gender shifts in different times and environments, and that this is *also* a valid aspect of my evolving self concept.
5. That an attachment to the act of transition, or to any label, and the striving to conform to the conventions of a gender or label which I am more comfortable with on average was actively harmful to my sense of self, to my mental health, and to my ability to honor my own momentary experience.

So now? When people ask questions about gender experience from a trans feminine, non-binary, gender fluid, quazi masculine, or bi-gender perspective? I answer as I feel my experience is relevant rather than restraining and confining myself to stay in a single lane. I am not in a single lane. And it is no wonder that at times when I refused to accept this about myself that I caused myself such incredible pain for not conforming to a set of arbitrary self-imposed restrictions which I adopted not to please myself, but for the sake of being easy for others to understand.

Now, for those of you suffering mental dysphoria... I'm not saying ""accepting that you are non-binary/genderfluid is the answer to mental dysphoria."" It might not be for you. But I am suggesting there's a good chance that internalized transphobia, gender essentialism, misogyny, or misandry is a factor in why you find certain thoughts and attitudes to be aligned to a gender which you don't experience. Understanding why you perceive a passing thought or experience as necessarily unaligned with your gender is key to defeating this monster. Because ultimately? Its a puff of smoke. It's something you were taught and conditioned to feel which you probably already don't intellectually believe. 

Alienate your ""self"" from that experience and apply it to a hypothetical ""other"" if you can. Ask yourself if it would make this hypothetical other invalid or less their own gender if it happened to them. It's a great way to highlight how often the last holdout of toxic gender attitudes are self-applied standards we would never dream of putting on someone else.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. This ramble has been brought to you by genderpunk.
Have a wonderful weekend everyone 🌹
It hits me more as like, the ""man"" emotions that were beaten into me as a kid. My inability to cry, being forced to be angry instead of compassionate so on. It's taken me years to unlearn some of this stuff but I still think like ""oh a woman wouldn't react like this in this situation so clearly I'm still a man"" and it's pretty hard
Like when you imagine you in a situation and imagine yourself as a gender that doesn't align with your identity. Happens to me a lot when I have more impressions of women in that particular thing and just can't really imagine a man etc in that situation (motherly stuff for example)
I thought everyone had all of these. Interesting.
On example from a trans femme: being AMAB often times you’re taught or encouraged not to show lots of emotion and hold things in. Or discouraged from showing emotions in a stereotypical “feminine” way (I put that in quotes because while there is a feminine stereotype there is no one way to be feminine). Basically this conditioning makes you have a really flat affect and makes you feel very unemotional when you otherwise might want to be. And once you start transitioning you often start expressing your emotions in a more “feminine” way which can alleviate a lot of dysphoria. While some emotions even may be negative, if they feel gender affirming it will usually lessen dysphoria. Another example would be how you talk to other people. Again from a trans femme perspective before I came out to certain people, talking certain ways as an amab person caused people to view me as a cis-gay man. While there’s obviously nothing wrong with being gay, I don’t want to be a cis-man. I’m a woman and want to be viewed like that. But after coming out, me addressing my friends like “hey girl” or “hey bestie/bae” is just seen as girly. Which can be very gender affirming because you realize people are now viewing you as the gender you really are and want to be. Rather your AGAB. Ofc this is only from a trans femme experience I can’t really speak on transmasc stuff as I’m not transmasc
I know I'm transfemme. At least I'm pretty sure. But my social dysphoria at being considered a guy is low. Maybe it's because I realised it a couple months ago and no one has actually especially treated me like a guy since then, or it's because socially being a woman just gives me anxiety right now.

Which basically adds up to the fact that I just present as genderqueer/non-binary a little bit, and am thinking of recognising myself as such for the near future. I have no idea if that'll work out.
I haven't heard of this term but I feel that I experience it. Like sometimes I get frustrated with how I emotionally react because I think things like ""a guy wouldnt act like this or think this"" generally i try to push these thoughts away though because they unnecessarily reinforce gender stereotypes? but even so I do feel I experience it
Gotta catch them all !
like for me it's when my voice suddenly gets too high or the ""accent"" that women speak in ifyk what I mean. or when I suddenly walk with my hips swaying.or my hands being extra campy. like for me, in my mind I'm ....me . but I wanna be seen as NOT feminine if not masculine. so it's like a loop inside my head that goes on and on.
I feel like mind dysphoria is more precipitated by the type of gender that is fought hard against by feminists given that there is no real difference beteen minds
sort of like how you react if you do something that is stereotypically of your agab, like sometimes i look at a typically feminine clothing and want it then in my head i go “AAAA im a girl no no”
i have all of them💀
Types of Gender Dysphoria*

I have Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria and it has nothing to do with being trans and everything to do with being Neurodivergent (ADHD) and a total failure and loser and having everyone hate me.  God why do I even exist?
The mind thing seems like something that can stem from either of the two!
(From the perspective of a trans male)
“I’m getting so emotional, that’s for girls.”
“Why am I so shy, aren’t boys supposed to be strong and fearless?”
“I should stop liking art and get more interested in something like football. That’s what boys are supposed to like”
I feel all this every time
still cis tho
almrd D:, nunca pensé en la disforia social, siempre pensé que mi disforia de cuerpo fue muy baja pero considerando la social me doy cuenta que tengo mas de la que pensaba .\_.
WAIT WHAT??!?! 
THIS COUNTS AS DYSPHORIA?!
I thought I was just weird! Like, speaking in a high voice whenever I'm meeting new people. Or when I walk in a flowncy way. Or how I act all flirty and low-key promiscuous to get people's attention to prove I'm pretty. Not to mention I took this test online hoping it'd say my behavior was like masculine or androgenous or undetermined and got super super uncomfortable when I found I act like a woman. My behaviors are passive and sweet and nice like a woman. But I'm not a woman. I'm just me. And me not being overly confident is seen as a feminine trait. I really wanted for my behavior to be masculine. Or at least not feminine. 
Wow.
I think the ""bro nod"" (rather than the little hand wave women do) is an example of such behavior that can induce dysphoria, right?
OH.
This is where it started for me.

“Boys don’t plan ahead”

“Boys don’t say stuff like that.”

“Boys would never think this way.”

“Boys would not think this maturely.”

“Boys wouldn’t think about marriage they’d think about sex!”

Mmmmmm I was such an egg!! Wish I wouldn’t known sooner
Isn't that what's described by social though? Genuine question.
BRO THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING, I HAD NO IDEA THIS EXISTED
In spite of the third b\*tch in the image, I like to think that making d\*ck jokes doesn't make me any less femme.
You described it damn near perfect
 Thank You
As a trans man, pre-T: I cry whenever I get angry, frustrated, sad or overwhelmed and it makes me really dysphoric. T is gonna make me cry less probably
Anger is everyone's game but it's how you choose to express the anger whether you're masculine or feminine. Women will stereotypically verbally joust each other while men will just straight out fight. Of course, this is all bullshit because, when I was in high school, girls fought more than boys. I once saw a girl slam another girl's head into the lunchroom table. The guys did fight, yes, but it was rare and it was never at school.

The women of my hometown are vicious and would kick anyone's ass that tried to pick a fight with them. It's probably why I like MMA, martial arts, and HEMA so much and associate sword fighting with feminity for some reason.

Sorry if I went on a rant. I just realized why I might like fighting as much as I do, though I would do everything I can to never fight and always watch fighting
That’s a great, brief description. I’d say it kind of feels like my mind is operating in black and white instead of color (not my eyesight but my emotions mostly). 

I’d probably include the way my mind processes attraction in mind dysphoria, too.
yeah T did this to me and getting rid of it fixed it. one of my favorite effects of HRT
I love this explanation! That's so similar to how I feel. Or have felt. I feel so much better being on E and spiro. So much less aggression. So much more euphoria. HRT feels like the medication I should have been taking my entire life. It's literally a lifesaver and a lifegiver. :)
Women are not extra special creatures with more depth of feeling than men.  That idea sounds terribly misandrist, not to mention leaning on misogynist stereotypes of women being ""irrational"" feelers.
this was a rlly good comment thread to read; idk how to put it into words but like. It was just a good discussion.
Holy Heaven, I DO have dysphoria!
This. Sometimes I even wake up dysphoric because I had a dream where I presented as a man. I'm MTF by the way
I'm trying to get the male voice out of my head. It's Sooo hard though, what's the best way to do this?
I feel this in my bones but just didn’t know the right term for it until now.
Oh i have this as well! I feel so awful right after I'm angry at someone.
Literally this, the bain of my existance
Came here to say pretty much this 👏
I recently learned some neat information that might suit you too. About 70% of our thoughts during the day we simply think out of routine. I found this can also impact how I think about myself and That there are some pretty outdated self images at play. It’s important to stop at these moments, if one realises it, and make a conscious effort to break the pattern.
[deleted]
This hurts. Literally, I'm agender and I get gender euphoria (ironically for someone who doesn't have a gender) from androgyny or people being unable to determine my gender. 

Literally, I didn't realize how bad my mental dysphoria was. Especially with my emotions; I get uncomfortable that I cry like a baby over everything. (Literally, I was watching Ratatouille where it had the scene ""I pretend to be a rat for my dad. I pretend to be a human for Linguini. I pretend you exist so I have someone to talk to. I know who I am! Why do I need to pretend?!"". It's a movie. About a rat chef. And I was bawling my eyes out. 🤦‍♂️). And when I feel happy, it feels so feminine and innocent. It's seen as feminine and I'm like ""Why can't I just feel happy androgynously?""

But at the same time, literally any time I feel angry, it feels so masculine and destructive and I'm like ""Noo. Why can't I just not feel angry all scary like?!""
Not to mention that I get uncomfortable when I repress my emotions and try to appear like things aren't bothering me, it's seen as masculine. There is no winning for me. 

Like, I just want to stop being overly emotional but not cold or detached or stoic like stereotypical, toxic masculinity or masculine in general. 
But yeah. Emotions are a big source of dysphoria.
I thought I was the only one. I also hate myself whenever I act feminine
I get anxious and start crying and then it feels like two juxtaposed feelings. The anxiety, and on top of it now I'm angry because anxiety made me cry and I really very very much don't like it. And then it spirals down to unworthiness, and a sense of being a failure because I want to be reliable but I only could get anxious AND also cry over it. And now I feel angry and disgusted upon myself, like, self-loathing because I really didn't want to act like that, but it seems to not be in my control to do otherwise.
Do you say that some of that disgust and self-loathing that makes me beat myself up (sometimes not so metaphorically even :c ) when I'm anxious or emotionally fragile might come from gender dysphoria????? O crap, that would explain a WHOLE bunch of stuff.
me too! it makes sense now thank you
The crying thing is on point for me but the oposite as a trans woman. I sit in sadness that I wish could just come out in tears then making me more sad and also less able to cry the more I think about it. Even perpetuating things like man up in my head it's horrible. And when dysphoria use to make me sad alot it was like an endless cycle at first
Once you go on T, you might not be able to cry at all anymore. You're gonna miss it then, believe me.

Personally not being able to cry feels more 'me' but it's also a source of emotional disregulation that causes problems down the line.
For me 70% body; 20% social; and lastly, 10% mind dysphoria
[deleted]
For me it's like 50% body, 30% social, and 20% mental.
35/35/30
It's really hard to separate it in percentage because I feel strong dysphoria in every aspect. Not necessarily in the same degree, nor in the same time. It depends in my mood, but when I'm relax, it tend to be like: 40% mind, 40% social and 20% body.

If I have to go outside, it's 70% social, 30% body

When I'm looking at myself, 50% mind and 50% body
Same, mind is definitely the strongest (for me). I feel like it is also the most difficult to describe to others, at least from my limited experience.
50% mind, 30% body, 20% social
Mines like 50% body, 40% and social 10% mind
For me I feel like it is 50% social dysphoria, 30% body and 20% mind. Interesting how it can be so different!
50% social, 40% body, 10% mind
Same here, no dyspraxia but all sorts of issues and trauma from extreme prem birth at 25 weeks gestation in June 1982, brain and general health are way better on HRT than not, started hrt initially to both separately stop menopausal symptoms I had since age 7/8 or so, depression set in at puberty and gender envy kicked in then too, didn't have words for gender dysphoria or anything until I put dots together age 19/20, only got onto hrt age 37.5 in Dec 2019, now way better and wish I'd started earlier so I didn't have to suffer health issues and more for so long
Are you sure it might not have been ADHD?

Since it manifests differently depending on the hormones in your body.
My very goodness, I'm spamming this post because everything is so informative and explains so much!
I'm autistic, don't have a dyspraxia diagnosis but I know I have it because I experience all the things that you refer since I was a little kid. I very much really hate that from myself, ever since I didn't knew what it was. And while I'm  down for neurodiversity and autism acceptance, I just can't with the dyspraxia related stuff and the complications it brings. It sends me to a downward spiral of anger, anxiety, self doubt and self-loathing that I've already described on a previous comment to this very post. And also have disassociation episodes. 
Are you saying that HRT can be helpful? Where can I start  looking for information about this?
Yeah!!!! There's a lot of mental effects that come from dysphoria like that, poor memory and brain fog as well as depression symptoms are all of the big stuff for me. (Edit: I forgot one of the biggest ones: super low energy!! Spoon theory stuff very much resonates with me and I think mind dysphoria is part of why) 

Turns out when your brain is expecting certain levels of certain chemicals and hormones but is getting way too much of one and way too little of another, that causes a lot of subconscious brain issues!! (Thats all afaik). 

And as you said, brain works better on hrt, when your brain is getting the right amount of hormones it's expecting and was designed to receive, the effects of that not being the case for so long start to clear! That's how I see it at least :p
I struggle with my cold distanced and aggressive thoughts. I don’t like them and they make me unhappy but I’d say that’s from being socialized as a male. Ever since coming out I’ve just wanted to embrace the feelings I was told young that weren’t ok for AMAB such a crying and just being an emotional person I’m slowly becoming more in touch with how I really feel inside.
Could you elaborate on this further?
I don't want to be more dominant. But I feel like my body and mind are hypersensitive and generate a huge heavy lot of emotional load that I don't even manage to process properly. It's excessive. Heck, as I write this tears come on their own from all the explanations and info I got from this post.
Could you paraphrase it?
FVCK I LITERALLY STARTED IT WITH ""BRO"" WTF
Yes, it does make so much sense that I can't keep myself from spamming this post, while crying and pillow punching. I make sense. This that happened to me for more than thirty years is something that can be described. Holy heck I make sense. I don't know if I like which sense do I make (hence the pillow-punching) but this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle I needed to know what was going on all these years.
This but with hormonal cycles related to periods. I feel like absolute crap for a week, until the red banner drops. As I'm so very much disconnected from my body, that I always fail to calculate when it will be, even when it makes me feel so unwell.
They aren't? They maybe different in a minimal way in relation to grey matter white matter ratio, but other than that very minimal ill important subject, it's all hormones.
By the way I'm unlucky mostly it's just mods banning me without even reaching anyone
Where is my price ???
I don't hate you I don't know you but I definitely don't hate you
I completely understand this feeling. But if it helps, try to remember that all of these things are mostly societal stereotypes that actually have very little to do with your gender. There are plenty of cis men that act feminine and are still considered men. Your actions and mannerisms are what make you, you and I don’t think you should change your personality to fit society’s expectations of what a man or masculine person should be, because in all likelihood your personality and mannerisms are beautiful and handsome and wonderful.  

It’s just my opinion so feel free to completely discount it, but I think it is society that should change, certainly not you. But, of course, never discount or invalidate your feelings either, whatever they may be.

Much love xx
You described my habits pretty perfectly. It's nice to know I'm not alone :)
I mean speaking in a higher voice when meeting new people isn't a feminine thing. It's a social anxiety thing. Like when I'm in public, I have a ""Public voice"" vs the voice I use with my family and friends
... wait what do you mean ""act like a woman""?
I *hate* the bro nod ._. when I catch myself doing it I'm basically done talking to whoever I nodded to, because if I keep talking to them I won't stop thinking about whether or not they think of me as masculine
I usually just respond to the bro nod with the wave and most of my dude friends respond to the wave with the bro nod. Nobody seems too upset by it so I guess it works.
I'm the exact opposite, I cannot stop waving to people with cute girly wave. I wanna bro nod. Every time I see my friends I wave even tho I wanna nod because that is seen as more masculine. My dumb mind.
Ah, not ""bro""...
I relate to this! Before T I had issues of crying at a time I really didn’t want to cry. Like when I’m standing up for myself. But I couldn’t cry when I wanted to!
Now on T I can both cry when I want to and not cry when I don’t want to. It’s great!
[deleted]
T definitely makes it harder to cry. I've only been on spiro for around a month but I've already found the mental block that always made it so hard to cry has lifted. Im not sad more often, its just that I'm crying when I actually feel I need to now.

Now on to estradiol so I can really become a mess 😁🙃
cismen also do this, though toxic masculinity has informed us that it's not ok to cry. I'd encourage not looking at crying as something to be ashamed of, regardless of gender.
It's not necessarily how you express the anger, but also largely how you feel it.  In my experience.  The shift seems subtle but I feel really different when I'm angry than before I was on E.
[deleted]
Yeah, we know, but gender is very closely relates with society steriotypes, and dysphoria is not rational, so a person that grew their entire life hearing that boys don't cry and girls are fragile, will have dysphoria with this patriarcal imposed toughts, even if dislike them and know that you can cry as a boy and be tough as a girl.
This. It can be tempting to dislike anything male but you should love men for who they are, like your father. He created you, surely you wouldn't be better off if he was self loathing and depressed. For he wouldn't have met your mother to begin with.
the issue with the idea of irrational feelers is that rationality and emotionality aren't mutually exclusive, unlike what most people think...
Yet people who are in the last months of pregnancy and who have just given birth cry far more easily than people who don’t have those levels of estrogen and progesterone.  Hormones have real effects on emotional experience.
Now that's a very interesting thing.... I tend to not remember what I dream. But when I do, I don't experience ""gender"" and just don't see myself.
[deleted]
No problem. And honestly? That would be really nice, I’d gladly swap
That’s almost exactly what it’s like for me. I have pretty bad anxiety that manifests by making me cry over the smallest stressful incidents. I remember once I was in meeting with one of my professors about my honors thesis and he was giving me constructive feedback. It wasn’t anything rude, it was actually rather nice but I got so anxious about it that I literally started crying. I hated that so much because I *knew* I shouldn’t be crying over this, I didn’t want to be crying over this, but I just couldn’t control my own body. It felt so wrong and made me so angry with myself. I wanted to be stoic and in control.
T does not make a person unable to cry. Maybe you aren’t able to cry because you’ve psychologically convinced yourself that it makes you unable to cry, but this is very extreme for something that doesn’t happen. Ask a cis guy if he can cry, he may say he doesn’t die to social stigma… but he still cries. The only cis guy I’ve ever known who couldn’t cry also had ASPD, a disorder that makes it hard for him to feel emotions. T does not make someone unable to cry. You might want to see if there’s other issues going on, or if this truly is the case for you, you might wanna tell a doctor about that. 

I’m not here to force you to do things with your life, but I don’t want people to keep believing inaccuracies. Another comment explained dpdr and dysfunctional biochemistry, pretty well! Here it is if you are interested; https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/uu9zzs/i_really_dont_get_the_mind_dysphoria_part_can/i9fjels/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

I’m not trying to invalidate anyones experience here, just trying to shed some light on a misconception!
We have the same percentages but in reverse lol, for me socially it’s 70% and 20% body
This happens to me when I sometimes get to use masculine pronouns for myself. Like, I know I love it, I know I can relate better to my emotions and to physical sensations when I treat myself as a masculine subjectivity. Then I get up, dress up, look in the mirror and it just feels a thing so illogical to do, that I end up not doing it.
Yea if I was to sum hrt mentally up for me, it qas like waking up from a bad dream, you know like those dreams where everything just not quiet right, everything just off and distressing.
Dunno, and getting diagnosed as an adult in the UK is as long a wait list as the gender service waits soo....
It helped me, my sleeping is alot better, depression is gone, still got some anxiety but that's mostly from society, terfs e.t.c kinda normal stuff to be anxious about, I bump into less stuff, more aware of time passing, not disassociated.

I'd say ur best bet is to talk to specialist in gender dysphoria or try hrt if you can get it.
I don't want to sound medicalist about this - some people talk about ""male"" and ""female"" brains but I don't think it's really accurate or helpful in terms of trans issues.

However, some people's brain structures can end up forming in a way where they're expecting a biochemical environment dominant in different hormones to the one the body produces. Not every cell in our body is the same, has the same DNA or the same organelles.

In my case it manifested as dissociation. I felt disconnected from my body sometimes, like my mind was a passenger in a meat suit. I now feel so much more connected to and in tune with myself on estradiol.
Really roughly. These are snippets I took from it:

""Mental discomfort can be difficult to pinpoint and describe because. It's been there so long that you have gotten used to itYou figure it must be the way you are supposed to be feeling and you just need to live with it. You don't know what else to attribute that feeling to.

Some statements that show mental dysphoria:

I had no idea how much irritability/dissatisfactin/stress I was feeling on a regular basis until I...
I didn't know how depressed/anxious I actually was until I...
I never knew how much I wasn't 'me' until I...
I had no clue how cluttered my mind has been all my life until I...
Having to wear 'guy' clothes to work didn't bother me (or at least I didn't think I did) until I...
I didn't realize how disconnected I was from my body, myself, my life, until I...""

(This is an awesome book, by the way:)


I've also heard it called indirect dysphoria, managed dysphoria, etc .... Some great articles on indirect dysphoria are:

let's normalize women using bro tbh
Bro, if it helps, I'm AFAB Agender and saying things like ""Bro, dude, yo"" all the time. 
I know it might not mean much but I do it all the time. 
Stay safe, kid.
I like this 💕
I don't know if you meant to but you made my day. (And low-key cry a little /pos)
The fact that cis men can still act feminine or have feminine mannerisms and people don't think they're women. The fact that even if I act feminine like a woman, that doesn't make me a woman and doesn't automatically mean people will see me as a woman either. Just Sam with feminine qualities about them. Just the fact that I don't necessarily have to change for people to see me as me or to 'pass' is just really comforting. More than I thought it would be.

Thank you for your kind words. 
I hope you have a good day today. 
Thank you again. 😊😁
Hold up. So that like voice that I see women do when  meeting new people is social anxiety? Ooo double fuck.
Apparently there's things that qualify as ""Feminine behavior"" which is why I ""act like a woman"". 

This is things like:

Being shy and passive 
Being quiet and not outspoken
Not being overly confident or lacking confidence in yourself
Crying a lot/ emotional
Talkative
Not very analytical or logical.
Not being blunt when talking to others. 
Nurturing
Empathic 
Gentle
Vulnerable 

(A little example from the Wiki on Female Behavior:)
Traits such as nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding have been cited as stereotypically feminine.

So basically, If you act like any or majority of these, people will naturally see your behavior as feminine or ""acting like a woman"".
don't worry, it gets better after a while. I still sometimes do it out of habit, but regularly interacting with a small friend group of mostly women really helped me learn the hand wave.
So do I.
I always nodded, and felt terribly uncomfortable when as a kid my family tried to pressure me into waving. I've been nagged endlessly because of that. Until some day when nagging just kind of stopped and I don't know why. But it was like, 1994 and I was eight and we did knew nothing about gender.
I'm astonished.
Oh my apologies that's my default response. Please forgive me
Ah that's great!
I get that!
I know cismen also cry but it is a fact that hormones heavily influence the way you experience emotions.
I've experienced the same thing. The best way I can put it is that it's like the difference between frying and baking certain foods, like potatoes. Both methods cook the food and the end results taste mostly the same, but there are still slight but noticeable differences that can completely change the experience.
I'd describe it as actually being angry, instead of being mad.

Before getting on E any time I was angry I would fall into a type of blind rage, logic didn't mean anything and I'd trip over my own thoughts trying to stay angry and keep that adrenaline flowing. After 2 months on E I can say that the anger is truly anger. It is directed, it is pointed, it has a known source, and it is easily defused. Anger is now a feeling, not an activity.
No worries.  Sometimes its less that I'm sure a person meant X than I'm worried someone would infer X from what someone else says so I jumped in to clarify what I think is an important bit not to miss about gender stuff.
The thing is it's not necessarily clear it's T vs E as much as it is compatible vs incompatible hormones in the brain. Many transfem people have dpdr pre-transition and then when taking E it alleviates. Same for transmascs - they often have dpdr before taking T. It's not that E is the emotional hormone and T is the unemotional one. It's that dysfunctional biochemistry in our brains leads to messed up emotions.
True.  I just feel like for everyone's sake people should strive against the ugly stuff the culture puts in our collective heads.  Accepting that men are emotional is important for their health and everyone else's.  Part of the hammer terfs swing us is that we can't possibly be as good and moral as ""real"" women because we, being men in their eyes, lack something vital and essential in our feelings and moral processes.
I don't think it's the estrogen, I think it's the raised hormones in general.

(P.S. I'm not trying to start a fight, I know this string of comments holds some tension but I didn't mean to add any in my comment.)
Thank you.
Yep, was brain fog and bad dream for me and trying everything to get the body to be in sync with the mind (body felt stuffed and slow and the  mind was racing all the time too fast, nothing internally was in balance or homeostasis), 

realised pot brought things into balance but only lasted so long, alcohol was good for calming the brain but wasn't good for when driving...and tobacco was nasty despite being a good stress reliever at the time; 

then I started listening to my body when I was stoned/drunk and clicked that I needed something and that everything was off balance, that I was drinking and smoking for medicinal purposes rather than to purely get stoned or pissed, that realisation was in my early 20s when I first came out (but didn't get onto hrt though), 

Stopped social transition because I felt others were judging me and I second guessed myself and fell to the pressure of parents and all (this was 2003-2005 here in New Zealand, then came out again and onto hrt in 2013 when I was 31/32, instantly felt better but didn't have progesterone (since learnt that progesterone stops addiction issues due to hormonal imbalance...), Back into the closet in 2014, then age 37.5 in Dec 2019 came out again, started hrt, cut ties with my parents and started living my life for me, since then everything has been great!
Holy Wow!! That sounds super cool! I didn't even know that was a thing! 
So basically it's kinda like your brain is built for, in your case, estrogen and whatnot. 
Like running a petrol car on diesel or something. Or employing a lawyer to do construction work. Put the lawyer in a court room with a law suit and the lawyer does better. Wow! Well I'm hella glad that estrogen helped you out so much 😊😁
Literally, this is something that needs to happen more often.
I don't use bro, I think at all, but dude is something I think I've used pretty much interchangeably for a while, along side ""you guys"" when referring to a group. Might just be me though lol
thank you 🥹
No problem, any time mate. I’m really glad it helped and you’ve made my day in turn!

Have a great one xx
I think it can be both depending on the person
I mean potentially. When you meet new people, you put up a facade, whether you mean to or not. You don't wanna show your true self because they might not like you, so you inherently put up that facade. That facade could be anything. How you sit, your expressions, or how you talk. For some reason, lots of people think a higher pitched voice is a ""nicer"" tone. I don't know the psychology behind it.
You mean I'm a Girl? Well, Hallelujah! ☺️ 😉
I think that's pretty sexist ngl
I'm the only woman at my job and have no time for social situations so I have to kill the nod when everyone nods
Sure, though our bodies know the best way we personally need to discharge emotions so they don't get suppressed. Suppressing emotions results in worse outcomes (anxiety, depression, etc) and having something like an anger outburst due to ""behaving successfully as a male"" is only perpetuating more societal issues and isn't helping anyone.
Funny, because even though I'm the exact opposite, this was also how it was like for me. Pre-T I was easily irritable and easy to anger. It was pretty intense, but usually converted to depression, randomly, and I'd usually ""rage cry"". Now not only has T seriously mellowed me out and fixed a whole lot of brain issues, but I'd say I feel anger more ""normally"". It's directed and has an obvious source, and is so much easier to manage and defuse. And I don't wanna break down every time I'm simply mad anymore, which is all a major win.
This!
Yes, you are right, we need to overcome this concepts in general, but when dysphoria strikes you can't be rational and think better, terfs are shit and many of this type of dysphoria come from what they say.

So, terfs deserve jail and people struggling with dysphoria need support and a safe environment where those aged concepts of gender are irrelevant.
Alot of the really is vlose to how I've experienced things! It's like a hitch or a lag in the pace of my brain and the pace of my body, also everything felt stiff like I couldn't move properly like I was 70 years old at just 15. Could never place wtf was wrong! Got diagnosed with dyspraxia as alot of it fit but was never the full picture. 

Went down the booze and drugs road, alcohol helped, then it took more and more to help, then came coke, and spiraling, and other issues and more destructive way to cope, then last September I had breakdown confessed everything to my gf, expected what I'd feared that had kept me in the closet for so long that everyone would reject me and I was fully just ready to finish what I started 10 years earlier with my first unalive attempt, but I was suprised, my gf excepted me, told me she's bi and loves me what ever gender, sister was next she accepted me then I told a few freinds only 1 ended up being a royal dick but he was also the one that introduced me to coke so fuck him, told my mum and she accepts me, not only that she allready knew.... she'd worked it out when I was 10.... just didn't know what to do or to ask or push it and as I'd never said anything she just left it........ 

I was lucky I had the funds to go private for hrt and thank god for gendergp, I know there not perfect but they had me on E within 3 weeks, I'd have not survived the 5 year wait on the nhs, I've been clean off drugs since last October, E and prog helped I've had no cravings at all tbh, still can't kick tobacco and I have a drink once or twice a month but that for pleasure nit to feel normal. Life is fucking fantastic tbh, yea the terf bullshit in the UK gets me down, and goverment is transphobic as hell and I'd love far more physical changes and all that and I'd love to just pass but tbh, that's all secondary for me, my brain finaly is normal.
Exactly!

And I want to emphasise feeling that way doesn't make someone trans or not trans. It isn't a prerequisite. It's definitely a thing, though.
yeah and my very cis girl friend uses “bro” and “dude” loads
The fact this makes so much sense though it it just clicked. Wow. Thank you so much for writing about this. I really appreciate it. /g
😁😊
Happy to help 😁😊
It is. Very much is. Rooted in a lot of ""women have to act this way"" and ""men have to act this way"". Lot of patriarchy fucking things up. 
That's part of the reason why I'm so glad to see cis men doing things like painting their nails and wearing skirts and dresses. Not because of aesthetic reasons but because I'm happy that they're happy being themself and are unlearning sexist, toxic masculinity shit. 
Sadly, dysphoria doesn't care 🙃
I'd never want to suppress emotions. I don't know where you got that idea
Yup, yup.  I'm satisfied everyone is on the right page now so I'll toddle off now.
Yes, the passing and all is secondary for me too, having a brain that feels normal and that works and works well is so beautiful! 

I bought a vape and cut down tobacco with that, then eventually I gave up for an initial 3 months (everything (booze, pot, tobacco) and then I drank for pleasure, not to function, pot maybe once a week or so (one cone only it seems - have found it doesn't do much to me nowadays, and no tobacco any more (smoked since I was 17 til I was 39 so am very happy to have kicked that habit considering my underdeveloped lungs and all since being born at 25 weeks gestation))
You're welcome!
🙂😍
Avoiding crying is a form of suppressing emotions
[deleted]
Which is something I do not do nor advocate
Yup.  Wanna see my badge?

Edit: Ah, sorry, that's glib.  Sorry for being an ass.  I just worried people were taking the wrong idea about how emotions for men are.  A lot of guys commit suicide because people don't allow them to vent their emotions.  They just suppress until the explode.
From your original comment, that seemed to be intended purpose. Because T doesn't take away the response of wanting to cry but makes it more difficult to (and it's not always a guarantee people will respond to it all the same, anyway), which is why I'm saying for dysphoria reasons it's best to complicate what crying means and make it a point of pride rather than something shameful."	uu9zzs	trans	2674	0.99	2022-05-20 22:58:42
trans rage	"i don't think we talk about this enough, if at all. it's almost like trans people aren't allowed to be angry, yet a significant part of my experience has been characterized by anger. facing transphobia has almost never made me ""sad"" in the way society likes to portray queer people to be - i am not going to cry if you misgender me, i will rip you to shreds, or at least wish i could. 

i have developed a pretty thick skin after being out for years in a still very transphobic country, honestly, but having to face the same shit over and over and over again, nearly every single day, i honestly don't have the words to describe how infuriating it is.

and at the end of the day? i'm still expected to be the one educating people and ""being patient and understanding"" if they don't get it. fuck that, and fuck you. i should not have to explain my identity to every single person that interacts with me. i should not have to put up with being misgendered and outed because ""you just can't understand the concept"". living in a cis society is so. fucking. exhausting."	"I feel the same. I don’t want people to use my anger to think that trans men are violent, as those who stand against us think our “evil testosterone” makes us bad people or something.
I definitely feel like if I get angry, people are going to tell me, “how very like a MAN of you!”
Fuck being sad, we should be full of rage.
Yes. rage has characterized my experience far more than sadness post-transition. I got sir'd by a huge group, ignored them, then they all kept shouting sir at me, trying to get my attention. My tits are so obvious, def presenting femme, and there they are just sirring their hearts out. I cursed their entire family line. Sorry / not sorry.
Feel the same way with my parents my parents are openly transphobic and I bought a dress and they both yelled at me called me spiteful and disrespectful and they took my phone luckily I was able to get it back to see this lol
I've got anger issues so its even worse when people make me feel like the stereotypical trans woman
I get pissed off but I never let em know that. I just give em the “are we really doing this right now?” Look cuz that’s all the space in my mind I’ll give em
Doesn't help that I'm autistic and have meltdowns. Thankfully I've never been around a non-accepting person when they happened
This is it my queers the post i have been searching for years. I'm an anarchist queer trans woman and i have always said i dont need to pass for no mother fucking body nor do i need to fit the status quo of what you think us trans women should be. I pass as myself and i will be respected or your ass cussed the fuck out. i have called people whiny bitches who don't like the fact i am defiantly me and will remain the woman i know i am. I don't put up with misgendering or being fetished or only like cause cis men see me as an experiment no honey bunny dummy i am a whole as experience and a beautiful one. the woman i am you can never find because you can't search for this monument.

Bless you for this real post we have needed. I love you for being you i know you are exhausted but please rest and don't let the bastards get you down. much love and shalom always.
We won't be ""allowed"" to be angry until we're considered equals. As of current, the underlying idea is still that cishets *allow* us to exist in public and *grant us* respect/basic human decency, but have the power to retract that at any point.

It's the same as with gay people, with black people, with women, and will be the same with disabled people once trans people have some basic rights established and that'll be the ""new"" big social topic - not in the sense of ""we move from one thing to the next"", but as in ""the next thing white cishet progressives decide to grant a voice"".

The idea that we're lesser is what allows them to do the tone policing - if we were the ""higher""/more socially accepted party, we'd be the one able to tone police transphobes while them not being anything but kind to us in public would lead to public outcry.

That being said, not to incite anything, but it's not like the marginalised groups i mentioned above got their rights by being peaceful and not getting in their oppressors' way, so...
I am incredibly angry all the time about this exact same shit.
You know there is a statistical tendency where ppl with lower income tend to be more social

And ppl with more money just tend to go the opposite way

Bc they have the option to not deal with ppl when they dont want to

We seem to generally avoid ppl when we have the option

Like ppl are building guarded societies and stuff to keep all those idiots out and not having to deal with them

Like we have the social value of


Everyone matters and is valuable


But it seems a lot of ppl seem to be not as striking to ppl when they have the option, and they still do fine without them


Like thats a statistical generalisation, still

I remember some rapper beeing like

""i really want to support the ppl in my old shit neighbourhood, but they just keep stealing my shit""


Same as area for me as

""Democracy assumes a informed population ""


Like we are not gonna say anything explisit

But like ppl seem st be sht
That's a pretty good observation. I can't say what the FtM experience of that would be, but as an MtF person, I definitely feel what you're saying.

It's like on the one hand women are socially conditioned not to show anger. And growing up as a closeted trans person, nevertheless I subconsciously absorbed and tried to follow a *lot* of female-coded social conditioning.

But on the other hand, testosterone. And anybody who says T doesn't shorten your fuse and put your anger on a touchier trigger, well, they don't know what the F they're talking about.

And on the third hand, the constant paradoxes that being trans subjects you to are genuinely infuriating, so there's a lot of anger to be had. As much as you want, and none of which you feel you're allowed to express. Even if you wanted to, which you probably don't, but it's there anyway.

And it's going to come out one way or the other. You can't keep it all bottled up forever. 

In this bind of having rage that I was not permitted to show, I had to let it out in private. I punched a lot of walls when nobody was around. And, here's your PSA for the day, I don't recommend it. I went through years in college where my right hand pretty much always hurt. I'm certain that I fractured and hairline cracked several bones in that hand, which never really got the chance to heal before the next wall-punch came along.

Don't be like me. Don't punch walls. I'm way older now, and I can tell you, you don't want to get to my age regretting the arthritis and chronic pain you're going to have to endure for the rest of your life in your punching hand, even though you kicked the wall-punching habit years and years ago, knowing that it's your own damn fault for doing that damage in the first place.

But if you're here reading this, you're already ahead of that game. The rage didn't start to go away until I figured out I'm trans and could start processing these feelings in an accurate context for once. If you're here then you know you're trans, so you can go down a better path than I did.
YES. The one that super gets me is that sometimes the CIS will come and comment or post in a queer space like this and if anyone says ANYTHING other than ""ooohhh poor baby! Let me teach you you perfect star child, thank you for just being here!"" Then it's the queer folk who get dogpiled for not coddling. I'm all for education and for not being cruel, but holy shit sometimes people need to be told that they just need to do better and that anger doesn't seem to be allowed.

Here’s an essay about Trans rage I think y’all might communicate with, if meant a lot to me
I like this energy of yours, which I share myself. Being a femme trans girl, is not going to stop me from cursing the sh\*t out of myself, if I come across a degenerate bigot.
I get what you mean. Then we are told ""just go somewhere more accepting"". Like do they realize that they are defending bigotry? I hate society
I just get cold and calculating anymore.  I don't get sad or mad, I think ""what's the quickest way to get me away from this person that would cause the least drama?""  They don't deserve my anger or sadness.  I just want them to leave me alone.
I have spent so much time being angry (or in fight or flight) since coming out. I discovered my family members, who said they would support me no matter what are actually incredibly transphobic/homophobic, and I’m afraid of being a hate crime stat. anytime I am out in public when I dress or present how I feel most comfortable and my authentic self. I am tired of it. I hear you, and I’m so sorry. I am of the mindset that rage is part of the “experience”. It helps me remember there’s something we’re fighting for, and that the world is changing. It gets exhausting not yelling at or swinging at transphobic people, though.
This is true words. I haven't been trans long but the entire time its been nothing but anger.
I completely agree. Dealing with ignorance and bigoted people on a daily basis is so tiring and it makes me so annoying, angry and disappointed. I hate it so much, but I can’t do anything because no one likes to take trans people (and queer people in general) seriously.
My least favourite thing of all is when you express the anger/frustration and Cis friends say something along the lines of “nobody’s going to listen if you’re angry” - if your being an ally has conditions, then you’re not an ally. I am not about to reject the identity that society assigned me against my will only to “fit” into THEIR comfortable narrative of what a “good trans” is. 

This is MY life, MY existence, MY experience, and I’m not about to abandon my identity that I worked so hard to be able to have in order to appeal for a superficial “ally” if you’re an ally you’re an ally, no strings attached, no conditions, no expectations for us to adhere someone else’s narrative.
I think our brutal and unrelenting rage needs to be shown. I mean I've literally used Commander Erwin's charge speech when expressing my rage and talking with other trans folk.
while education is important, NO ONE should be *expected* to educate people and feel like they need to justify their existance to people, and that they need to be patient and understand. fuck that. 

personally, sometimes I feel like I'm in a good enough place to try and help people understand, and sometimes its too much for me to even try when I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking at the seams and I want to just be myself. My experience has been largely sadness but a good ammount of anger too. dunno what else to say but yeah.
There need to be safe and understanding places to just VENT OUT ALL THE FRUSTRATION WITH EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

Be patient and understanding, everyone's patience has its limits, nobody has infinite patience and you are expecting too much from trans people. Nobody's a f\*\*\*\*\*\* saint. And when trans people get tired and overwhelmed (like normal humans) people make it a much bigger deal.

This honestly also goes for sexual minorities, racial minorities, disabled people, any type of minority. There should be spaces where you're just allowed to scream and vent without being judged for it.

Or how people don't understand the difference between venting and actual hate. Sometimes you just want to scream how cis people are unbearable, but you do it after an awful interaction and you need to get it out of your system. That's not hate, that's actually necessary for a healthy mind. Vomiting the anger out of you is healthier than keeping it inside.

Mental health is stigmatized and misunderstood. Add transphobia on top of that and it's a mess. I'm really glad the trans subreddit has a ""vent"" tag because that is so very needed in this environment.
It’s unfortunately the price we have to pay for doing nothing other than be our authentic selves
I mean, those are the kind of emotions that start protests, and protests get us rights, so no complaints here.
I feel the same way makes me want to commit arson on their st**id ass
I’ve gotten pretty vengeful towards the right wingers since coming out as MTF. I never realized how hard they try to actually stop us from existing
I feel the same way. I live in the states; Texas specifically. I am misgendered every day by my own mother and some of my own friends. I infuriates me and yet I have to be patient. I am lucky enough to be in a very tolerant high school with a lot of fellow trans/queer teens. But I'm still in the southern U.S we're I can be discriminated against just be cause I want to be a girl, or because I like guys and girls. I still have to be patient, I still have to be educating, and I still have to keep a lid on my temper. Because I know that is even one trans kid blows up at a transphobic cis person than the entire trans community could be cracked down on, and it could give the GOP the ammunition they need to start hunting us down like animals.
I agree, if someone doesn't understand than whatever, how hard is it to understand I'm a person with a gender. Treat me like a person, if it confuses you that's because you're overthinking it or looking at it wrong. I don't need a whole interaction explaining why I exist.
100% agree I can’t stand it either
I completely agree, I'm non-binary and pan, I live in the Netherlands and it's not that transphobic or homophobic around me but still having to even explain that there's more then 2 genders is indeed exhausting. One of my previously friends couldn't understand aroace boyfriend - boyfriend relationships and it's so aggravating that some people don't even try to understand like it's a puzzle they can't solve but disrespecting all of us affected, we're not the ones that should educate us, people assigned to should so frig those extra math exercises and teach people about us.
I feel this so much my community is so toxic about anything around gender identity and sexualities to the point that me coming out has cause me to be unable to get a job where I live and has made life a living hell, I’m only 18 and recently decided to tell everyone who picks on my for my large breasts that I identify as male and they can leave me alone or face the consequences but now because I stood up for myself I can’t make money to fucking survive!!
I totally feel this way. Take my upvote
“have a thicker skin!” 
*does that*
“you should feel more like a normal person!”
:/
i have like almost no emotions anymore because ive learned to accept like everything to the point the only emotion i really feel is happiness and stress
Hugs!!
Exactly, and I’m not allowed to be angry or they call me a man or something of that nature. Hell, I have it so beat into my brain that if I get angry and dare show it, I feel bad because I feel like I’m not giving off feminine vibes or something. I completely agree, I’m so sick of living amongst so many cis people who expect so much out of me and us as a group of people
i am thankful that my BPD rage and trans rage haven't decided to hold hands. i fear what i would do if they did.
A great essay at least tangentially connected to this is Susan Stryker’s “My Words to Victor Frankenstein above the Village of Chamounix: Performing Transgender Rage”
When I came out to my parents as a trans man, my mom tried to blame it on period hormones. It should be socially acceptable to beat the shit out of transphobes.
One thing that really makes my blood boil is how cis people justify their tranphobia and shitty behaviour with “I don’t understand these things” AS IF it were a valid excuse, as if they couldn’t just respect someone regardless of their understanding. And then when you give them attitude, suddenly you’re the one who’s not cooperating, they go “I’m trying SO hard how dare you be so mean to me” fuck that. Parents misgendering and deadnaming their trans children because “it will take some time to get used to it” fuck that, it’s a fucking pronoun you dumbass bitch, get over it.
We always have to be the ones to have patience, understanding, stay calm, give people time to “settle” while they treat us like fucking garbage, fuck that, I’m so over it
I remember when I was still entertaining the idea of having my highly religious cishet grandparents in my life, I'd told them in 2019 and progress was incredibly incredibly slow and could be taken away in an instance; the final nail in the coffin for me was them telling me I ""can't wear a dress or be called Rae or she/her/they/themed"" at my great grandmothers funeral, apparently it was because ""there will be people who don't understand there and we don't you to be upset"" because apparently being furious at how both she and my grandfather tried to manipulate the family into ""getting along"" when one side was abusers and the other victims and being angry at being misgendered by them both constantly was me being ""sensitive""; despite all this I went in a dress like top and leggings, but found out I could've wore a dress because my Gran straight up said ""I really don't care"" about the whole situation she'd invented up for me and then tried her best to ignore for a solid two weeks. I tried one more time after that to get them on the same page, but was told (as I always seemed to be by them) that ""We're not from your generation and God said there is only men and women"" and that I should ""understand"" and ""respect"" their position in all this despite only one of us having actual mental harm from the treatment of the other.  


Anyway the long winded moral of this story is cishet people can thrive up their own arse all day and the instant we even show a slight grimace at their treatment they can jump out of their arses to bellow about how we're being rude for not ""respecting"" them; hopefully one day none of us will have to deal with their shit.
I’m reminded of Shovda, a trans Mario streamers. They are *extremely angry* when a level is pissing them off.

“I’m not good at maker anymore, but I will be good for five minutes to spite your ass. That’s what’s you’re getting (Carl), spite-fuelled fuckin’ trans rage.”
I had to stop E because of financial problems and when all the T came back, I did and still do get angry about stuff. My family are “supportive” but think I need to see a “real” doctor about my emotions.
""If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."" — Satoshi Nakamoto
These transphobes are a bunch of whiny bitches who cry at the notion that someone has pronouns. It's time to grow the fuck up and stop digging your nose into how someone else lives their life. They need to live as they preach and stop getting offended over my existence, you don't see me obsessing over what the fuck is in your pants.
Wait, who says we can't be mad. Im mad all the time. Anger is one of the only feeling i have left!
Whoa, this is SUPER topical! Just this morning I heard a [story on NPR](https://www.wesa.fm/arts-sports-culture/2022-05-09/scholar-says-many-trans-people-are-discouraged-from-publicly-expressing-a-full-range-of-emotions) about a Sal Malatino's new book *Side Affects: On Being Trans and Feeling Bad*. From the story:

>But like anyone else, trans people experience a range of emotions, including negative feelings from fatigue and anger to envy and burnout. It’s just that, as Malatino argues in a new book, most are discouraged from expressing them publicly.
I'm usually okay with questions but have 'Im not a tutorial' days
I just want to be happy I want to get gender affirming surgeries yet I have to go through a shit ton of things to be happy it's seriously not fair
Exactly. Every time I get misgendered the people who know it look at me like ""oh nooo, Im so sorry for u"" 
No. Fuck that. I'm not about to cry, I'm about to make them cry.

The only simple thing people need to understand about trans people is that we are human beings. What do human beings need? To take your rights/genders/kids away? No. We just fucking want respect. If someone doesn't respect me, Im gonna get angry. I hate people that say shit like ""if you want me to respect you you have to earn it"" like fuck no. Respect is a human right you absolute fuck. Admiration is earned. 
I am angry, I am mad, and I am very, very upset.
FtM (23) and still not on hormones yet. This was a year ago when I finally started learning how to be assertive and advocate for myself. I don't remember what exactly I said, but I stood my ground against my mom and her reaction was to ask me if I had started taking testosterone without telling her. Like for starters, it's none of her f*cking business. And no, as it turns out I'm perfecting capable of metaphorically growing a pair without the help of hormones. 
But yeah, not even anger or agression. Just an ounce of assertiveness and people want to start demonizing trans people and hrt.
cis ally here to tell you that you're just as human as everyone else, and I don't expect you to hide your emotions. i hope i didn't say anything offensive.
Can the revolution start already?
Here's what one African-American writer said about the burden of ""explaining"" racism to white people.  By no means am I equating racism and transphobia; nevertheless, I think the sentiment applies to trans people, too.

>Day after day, year after year, one swallows the   
taste of bile over seemingly minor incidents that cannot be discussed   
lest one be regarded as rude. Then suddenly there is a need to talk, to   
know how one feels and have things explained? No can do.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/08/black-friends-educate-racism/
this really hits home bc like fr? and there aren’t any gsa at my school or anything so i gotta stay quietly angry while being misgendered and having intense dysphoria
Wanna create a country called The Kingdom of Trans? Cause same
Black Dresses, if you want some banger trans rage
I had an experience with someone I was going to work with that wanted to make sure I wouldn’t get super angry and defensive if being misgendered. Like what?  You cannot police my emotions! And do cis people not understand that the anger comes from PAIN!? Pain from dysphoria, a strict gender roled society, transphobia, etc. so of course I’ll emote! I was so shocked.
Me too, I'm stealth in my every day life but I'm so outspokenly trans online and angry. I feel like my strength all these years come from hatred and anger. I hate most cis people I interact with because they have no clue what it's like, and if they guess that I'm trans or knew that I am they're always ignorant and inconsiderate. My ex that I was with for three years would constantly bring up sex even though he knew it made me uncomfortable. Tried to justify it because he's horny 🥴 and he hasn't had sex blah blah blah, I'm poly for a reason I don't want to do anything until I'm fully transitioned and in debt. It's so aggravating to simply exist sometimes.
I read somewhere once, when I started to recognize my anger, that being angry was a good thing because it meant that I expected better. It's so much easier to wrap my head around being angry at a specific person, making amends or finding closure with one person seems relatively attainable. Being angry at transphobia on the whole is so much harder.

I don't want to ""pass"", I've never felt joy in ""passing"". But 2 years into my transition, I recognize that it makes it a little more bearable to live in tiny ways. I hate that it gives me the privilege of invisibility.

A lot of the things I want to see for trans people everywhere may not come in my lifetime. I don't know what to do with my rage on the days when I've already done all that I can to explain or argue or fight.
It's the ""expected to be patient and understanding"" bit that pisses me off the most. 

It makes me so angry because I could literally show the TINIEST SHRED of very mild annoyance about, say, a parent continually misgendering me and suddenly every person under the fucking sun has to tell me to show them grace and kindness and support. Like I FUCKING AM YOU DICKHEAD. God forbid I complain just a TINY BIT outside of ear shot from my parents anyway!!! 

You get so much shit for expecting the basic human respect all cis people get handed automically. It's ridiculous. I don't even show outward anger but I sure as fuck feel it a lot of the time. I hate it because I DO show UNBELIEVABLE patience and understanding to people who 100% do not deserve it but the second I step a tiny bit out of line it's ""why are you so angry!! They're TRYING!!!"" fuck off. Seriously, fuck off. I'm so sick of it.
""Have you ever thought about how YOUR transition would make US feel?""

First of all, mum, do you really think I haven't thought about it? Do you really see me as such a selfish person that I wouldn't even CONSIDER your point of view? I have kept in mind the consequences of my identity for way longer than you could ever imagine. The fact that I decided to take action and actually do something should make you proud of how BRAVE I am, not make you think that I do it to piss you off.

And, secondly, I shouldn't. I shouldn't have to think of your pain about this because you shouldn't EVEN feel it. You shouldn't see me as ""your lost daughter"", or as the source of your suffering, because I am not causing it to you. I haven't done a single thing to hurt you, I have just been myself and I am so, SO TIRED of having to justify it.
Cis people: misgenders, berates, in some cases, physically engages us, pass laws to keep us down, and generally are dicks to us

Us: hey you're kind of an asshole

Cis people: Woah there, calm down, don't attack me you violent [slur]. It's obviously all that testosterone in your system
I called out my friend, pissed but not sad, when he said some really inappropriate transphobic things as a joke (I don't fault him, he genuinely didn't understand the significance of what he was saying and I've since helped him to understand) and instead of acknowledging that what he did was wrong or that my feelings were valid he just kinda awkwardly was like ""it's okay if you don't wanna be friends anymore"". Which idk how to explain it but that was him avoiding the topic, not acknowledging it
This anger has only been building since I came out to myself and a few friends. And now I’m like, fuck this I’m going to start E even if only out of spite alone.

And then I go introvert mode and can’t assert myself for shit. Just ahhhhhh.
UGH I feel this. With stuff like having to be Google for people, I try to approach it all with grace and be like ""well, public education fails to teach this stuff, I'll give this person benefit of the doubt and appreciate their asking"" but it definitely uses mental energy especially since I know that if I did blow up, all of a sudden this person's singular interaction with a trans person is a negative one.

For me the worst holding back is getting misgendered and wanting to correct people. That ""it's maam"" video always pops up in my brain and stops me from speaking up, even if the person isn't trying to be mean.

It's hard to explain the feeling of being misgendered, because --at least for me-- it's not quite sad or angry or anything. Mostly it's exhaustion. ""what more do I have to do??""
One book that did this really well was Dreadnought by April Daniels. The main character, Danielle, is an angry person. Not in that she's constantly violent, or wrathful, but in that there's this constant, pervasive feeling of anger that just seems to simmer under her skin. She's sick and tired of everyone else's bullshit, and when the opportunity to be herself comes along, she takes it for all it's worth and basically dares everyone else to come and take it from her.
Yeah, we are treated like second class citizens but have no outlets to express the rage. The result is just going around feeling terrible all the time. I honestly don't know what to do about this. Sending strongly worded tweets feels inadequate, and we don't really have a militant organization. We only have underfunded non-profits that don't take a hard line against transphobia.
There's a huge stigma towards many groups of marginalized people, that they aren't allowed to be outspoken, aren't allowed to be angry, etc. and if they are, they're heavily looked down upon

It's the condescension of the majority
i think of myself as a trans person who's full of roiling rage. Im full of vicious, searing anger and fury for myself and for my trans siblings. Calling out transphobes aint enough i want them dead. I want them to suffer. I want transphobes to feel the pain they cause us ten times over. I want them to beg and plead for their miserable lives at the feet of every murdered trans person. I see stories of trans women being murdered and i want the killers to suffer the most agonizing of deaths and to experience what they give out. I want to tear down transphobic and hateful laws and all the other bullshit that society enforces to try and eradicate us. I want transphobes to see me and feel fear, i want them to know if they dare try and do anything to me that i will fucking break their bones for their choice of being transphobic. I want conservative/hateful right wing people to be intimidated by me. I want to protect and defend all trans people with the righteous fury of the gods. I wanna be that obviously queer guy at pride whose presence comforts the marginalized, and scares the bigots off from trying anything hateful. And i wanna have the physical strength and weaponry to defend anyone who needs it. I want to utterly destroy the colonizer transphobic society that would gladly see us all dead. I want to raze it to shreds and eradicate it and make a better world for everyone.
Don't forget the ""it's MA'AM!!"" jokes you fucking hear every single time you stand up for yourself.

Fucking disgusting.
Fuck yes. Fight.
You can't be patient and understanding with everyone you encounter who doesn't believe that you are who you are. That who you are isn't real, that it is made up. 

I am not trans, I can only know how frustrating it is having your existence minimised from my experience with autism, through the less common people thinking I am not because I can hold a conversation, or through the minimisation of sensory issues. 

I can also very much understand the difference in the levels between these things. If I was trans I would not be able to deal with people. I already struggle with the comparatively pervasive in our society, but much less of a danger to my being, and much less of an affront to who I am. Having my sensory issues not considered ruins my day, fighting back against transphobia can run a great risk, being autistic doesn't put me at an increased risk for violence or sexual assault. 

People who say openly bigotted things, and then ask you to act with decorum, as if politely saying that you should be arrested for using the bathroom in accordance to the fact you identify as a woman, or saying that teaching kids of trans people's existence is predetory, or actively misgendering someone don't waive the expected decorum of a conversation the moment that the statements come out of their mouths.

They breach the social contract in almost every way but because they fulfilled one clause, acting polite despite their vitreol, they think that you as a trans person should be forced to act polite as well, and to uphold everything they disregarded.
As a kid I always internalized this one anime villain's thing about him not showing anger and just being cold so I don't think I've ever got this problem, people just act intimidated by me lol

But it really is odd how online people misgender me on purpose and act like I'm going to have a meltdown while in reality I care more about the speck of dirt outside
my thoughts go something like this.

""it's not my fault you're stupid, and if you've got questions that don't concern you, then it's not my problem.

If you want to be an ally just change the pronouns, don't judge for being a klutz, and just stay out of the way unless you're going to actually help.""

Usually I just keep my mouth shut, but I just wish others could do the same...
100% feel the same and yeah, a lot of us are just...very mad. And why wouldn't we be? This is totally reasonable. It's exhausting to live in a cissexist, traumatizing society where cis ppl can't even google. When I came out as transmasc, then the questions started. And they basically never stopped. Slap on the transphobia and seeing my peers in pain, scared, it's just a lot?

Of course a lot of us are angry.
I feel this today. Yesterday I came out as a trans man to my parents.
They both refuse to use the right pronouns and my dad told me to ""Never talk to me about this shit again. Do whatever you want with your life, but don't bring me into that stuff.""

Ok dad, one day you and my mom won't be in my life at all.
My two brothers who accepted me and my sister in law will because they aren't transphobic assholes.

I left for work in the morning and when I corrected my mom she said ""Don't say that"" and ""You'll always be my daughter""

I'm so glad I came out because I know that their fucking priorities aren't to love me. There is no unconditional love. I'm so mad and I'm so angry right now.

I honestly feel like crying too though even though part of me knew they wouldn't love the real me.
C’est la vie what can you do
Not having the space to feel frustrated or angry without people blaming hormones or some other important aspect of the trans journey has made me feel like the most crazy individual. Never been gaslighted so hard. 

Before T, if I argued with my mum I was seen as too sensitive and easily shut down. Now (after T) she throws words out like hostile, mansplainer, mental, and has threatened to call the cops because T makes me out of control. (What am I the fucking Hulk?) 

The amount of times I’ve picked up on how wording pre-T and now has changed whenever I show any ounce of frustration is insane. I’m one of the most emotional hate conflict people I know and testosterone hasn’t changed that.
absolutely, it does make me sad, but much much more it makes me want to break every object in sight
FUCK YEAH, LET'S START A *FIRE*

(in a legally allocated place, around which we civilly discuss our frustrations, perhaps raising our voices and using expletives to enhance the mood :3 )
Imagine living in a genderless world?
You'll be treated like if you weren't female or male. Just nothing and everyone is like that... except you.

I'm not trying to shoot you, maybe this day I'm not so patient and have NO FILTERS, because in a sense, I feel like you. I hate to explain even to other trans folks what the F am I.

Many assume I'm like them (i.e., drags, transvestites) l and I'm mistreated by those who claim all the time to be the only ones to be prosecuted marginalized and pissed off.

I'm effing tired of them also. You see, not only you is pissed off today.

Just fuck this world and everyone assuming being trans is a *sexual thing*.

PS: edited fucking typos.
[removed]
i find it alienating even in trans communities. like peopoe get upset when i get angery about them using the q word like in this post while it has no spoiler. it makes me hurt and people still use it
I do get that - and to be honest, it’s entirely understandable. However, anger is practically never the best solution to anything; all it tends to do is spread more anger than actually help.
I 100% agree
I use ti be angry all the time until I started HRT now I'm sad all the time lol
I feel the same.
Yes!
It's just a way to stereotype and invalidate you. Same as the 'gay rage'. No norval person would use it.
I’m not even fully out yet and I feel like a bomb
Like it or not, we are emissaries of our minority status. It is both a blessing (opportunity) and a curse (albatross).

It’s not fair. It’s never fair. But we can use it as an opportunity to be ambassadors for change.
it makes me so angry that i’m not allowed to be angry lmao
hm. i suppose thats reasonable. personally i could never transfer nor. cut my hair much or anything (ftm, family has always refused to let me cut my hair. also too broke to even think of transitioning oet alone a simple haircut unless i do it myself lol) 
so i can't say i understand this much besides the phobia as a general. it always seemed a bit nonsensical to me. 
like confusion is one thing but i mean were all human . yknow - i never even understood the 'testosterone evil raa' . seems a bit cruel to group people like that  . everyone has at least some testosterone . thats just life . i hope it gets better for yall though
Yes... 👏
Trans lives matter. I hope society can do better for y’all. The abortion issue language is also anti-trans. How hard is it to say “people who can get pregnant “ instead of “women.” The bulk of the legislation early this year (in the US) has been anti trans/trans erasure. It’s all going the wrong direction…
I feel you, I live with rage, It's been with me since I was an angry teenager and felt that something was wrong but couldn't figure what yet. The only advice I can give you is to find something to channel it in a positive way, for me it was music, music literally saved my life. For you could be something different, some activity, a sport, art, videogames, whatever that let's you channel all that bad energy in a safe way.
I saw a comment on another post talking about a time where someone was talking shit about trans people in front of them, and they didn’t want to say anything or else be seen as “that one angry trans person” 

Like, BE mad! Is that not a natural response to being shit talked? Let them know you’re not taking any shit. Don’t allow them to think that they can just say whatever.
same
If your testosterone makes you evil, then half of the world's people are evil. Damn, even everyone since cis women have testosterone too (although not that much)
I know this is supposed to be a serious thread, but how do i get the bi and trans flag on my profile? 

Im on mobile
And if I get angry I'm an ""emotional woman."" There's no winning.
I actually got very mad at a karen in my apartment and she said that exact thing i honestly wanted to tear her appart
I always read something about trans women letting their man self out whenever they're angry. Fuck that
Just the other day Joanne had a tweet calling out someone that put a sticker over a TERF flier that had colored knives that said ""TERFS weaponize the patriarchy against transfemmes by telling them what women should be.""

Her tweet was ""you can always tell a real woman by the pretty rainbow way she draws knives."" 

It's just so gross.
And if you're a trans man you get accused of roid raging. And some people really think testosterone and steroids are the same thing. My dad is supportive but even he believed that for almost two years of my transition because of all the deliberate misinformation spread especially during the Olympics.
Is that what it is? I never put two and two together that my breakdowns might be related to my being on the spectrum. I know you didn't intend to help but this actually helps quite a bit. Thank you
Its often said that you should try to be civil, to try and help people to learn about you and your existence, to understand it. To try and aid the ignorant in learning and to dissuade the bigotted through niceties and through setting a good example.

But not everyone can do that. And not everyone should. 

If people are unwilling to learn about how and why a significant group of people exist on their own time, that is their problem. You shouldn't have to walk someone through why you should be allowed to just exist and why your existence isnt a problem.

And frankly, the bigotted will find ammo regardless of whether or not you shout them down or enact violence. If you act nice, they often just think you are one of the good ones, and think that your quality as a person is in spite of who you are. If you act dismissive, they will just make stuff up about you. 

Bigottry is not a smart pattern of though, and it is often reinforced by equally stupid things. At least if someone is publically shamed or smacked, then the stupid thought process of ""if I say this stuff this might happen again"" will kick in and their bigotted asses will be careful next time.

To add, you do not have to pass, and should not have to pass in order to be trans. Its not relevant to what I have to say, but I want to say it so here it is.
thank you, will definitely check this out myself
yes! i was just going to comment the same thing lol
100% agreed. when all else fails, queer rage will force change to occur. no assimilation!

I call them I'm not Google days.
amazing idea
i love their music!!!!
queer has been a word used by this community for years, i beg you to educate yourself on the history before deciding it's a dirty word.
You joke, but a large number of people unironically believe this
Like for real i cant be angry as a trans women or shithead transphobes will tell me i act too manly...
A lot of people drank the gender essentialist koolaid from TERFs and unironically spout those views that demonize trans masculinity. For trans men, us taking T is basically like ultra-doping that makes us angry, violent rage machines and unworthy of support/basic kindness.
I used to identify as a cis woman (AFAB nonbinary person here, she/her) and my behaviors make me think I've got more testosterone than cis women usually do.
I go to a trans support group.  I much prefer being around other trans people.  I kind of wish there was a neighborhood in my metro area where lots of trans people lived so I could move there.
Yeah I definitely feel like I’m not allowed to get angry.
She’s obsessed.  It’s like half of her tweets.
Well as MtF I’ve been on testosterone and this has caused anxiety and anger and I was very easy to start rage. So it’s maybe better working in male brain, but for my female brain it was just terrible experience, I cannot go back on T ever.
Aspergerexperts.com have a great webinar called Deep into Defense Mode - it explains that people on the spectrum freeze first, then when they thaw out they go into fight or flight, either acting out or running away.  They also teach that people on the spectrum *need* safe people and safe places, to be *able* to calm down again, far more than neuro typical people.
it’s hurtful and makes me want to cry. i don’t use >!transexual!< because it hurts others and wish this was respected the same
Oh... I don't want to believe that but I'm sure your right, considering how some people are...
Yeah, a lot of TERF's and 2nd-wave feminist types demonize men and masculinity. When that hurts trans people, it's transphobia.

One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender. If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too. Good feelings for everyone.
my dad said ""not very ladylike"" when i got angry about something

those words felt like a thousand thorns (less now, because he's a transphobe, but y'know)
That's so sad. People generally don't seem to take women seriously which is also another issue

We all have the right to feel emotions but transphobic people will always use anything to invalidate both trans men and women :(
trans exclusionary ""feminists"" explaining how women aren't allowed to speak out of turn because that's rude
There's always the gayborhood in Philly if you're eillimh to relocate. I mean, for all I know you already live in Philly, so maybe it's not really relocating. Either way, at least visit. It's so relieving.
Seriously, if this exists I’m moving there today.
Yeah... That sounds like a ghetto :(
I say fuck that, I will call out anyone who disrespect me
My childhood friend came out as ftm, but refuses to transition because men should all die and testosterone evil
>One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender.

It seems a bit dramatic, a bit too *gushy* to say, but this is why I'm here.  It isn't that I'm here to help anyone - I'm rarely equipped for it - or to be helped directly - I'm at least as lousy at that.  Its that people come here and scream into the void only to find *someone* on the other end willing to offer some small bit of human decency.  That inspires me to help on those rare occasions that I think I can, but more importantly, it has helped me be okay with, well, *me*.
> If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too.

Switching up the positive descriptor when it comes to NB people is trans culture /lh
No I don’t live in Philly.
Let's all move there and just take over the entire neighborhood lmao. A community made entirely of trans people, that'd be nice
Wow that's sad
super sad... trans men are not the ones who should be held accountable for the domestic abuse rates and r@pes made by CIS men (mostly. ofc trans men can do them but lets be honest it's a minority of crimes committed by men overall)
Shoot. Well, if you ever have a chance to take a trip. It's nice and refreshing to see pride flags on every lightpole and queer people on every sidewalk!
Yeeesssss😩
yeah...
please dont try to brush off the issue with this discourse by pushing the blame onto cis men. that doesnt help anyone and is still a bigoted line of thinking
That would be nice.  Where I live is fine.  My neighborhood is quite liberal but I’ve only seen one pride flag out beside my trans flag.
That emoji is not on the reddit list of approved emojis.I wish I was that brave
I suppose it'll be hard to convincz them. I would say that not all men are bad and they can be proof of that
Anddddd yes lol I’m going to make it my mission in life to start making that 🫡
Yeah but he was the kind of guy that would tell me a lot of gaslighting stuff, so not really a good guy.... I stopped talking to him like a year ago because he was saying that America is the worst country in the world to my immigrant family
That really sucks

Everyone please spread the news on a new, fake gender project	"Warning per EliErlick on twitter - A far right media group is trying to entrap trans people into appearing in a documentary under false pretences, using the name ""Gender Unity Project"" as a front. Sharing to help prevent people being pulled in!

Don't seem to be able to directly make a link post but, here OP explains it all in some detail. I reckon this sort of despicable and predatory action should be warned for in trans spaces if possible, because they are clearly trying to prey upon trans folks online who want to speak up for their rights and got close to fooling people who are far more involved with trans rights campaigning than I am.

[https://twitter.com/EliErlick/status/1490799028401020932](https://twitter.com/EliErlick/status/1490799028401020932)"	"Once I started reading the twitter link I realized just who we were dealing with. That tweet, ""We can win this battle"" against trans people, made me feel sick. A battle? A one-sided battle. I've done nothing to these people. We've done nothing, but exist. I know they hate us, I know they would laugh as they murdered us. I just don't understand that kind of hate.
I've read the thread but can't quite understand it. What is the 'project' about?

I've heard PragerU get namedropped but that's most of it.
The Twitter link @genderunityproj has been suspended.
The Right wants nothing more than every single one of us in the closet, or dead. They’re exactly the same as the Nazis burning the Hirschfeld Institute. Fight them in any way you can, even if that means just existing in public, forever. A better world is possible.
Account suspended lmfao.

I’m pretty sure this is 100% against journalism etiquette as someone who’s currently studying journalism
Never trust a conservative and NEVER make the mistake of feeling safe around them.
Of course it's Matt Walsh, the self described theocratic fascist.
Disgusting. Tryna make profit off trans opression.
This is despicable, and actually something you may want to let an actual documentary team know about. https://www.channel4.com/news/contact-us/investigations-team has some contact info.

It's the sort of thing Channel 4 here in the UK are good at, and they'll accept info, no matter who it's from, as long as it can be sourced. Their journalists are trustworthy people, for example Siobhan Kennedy who reports from the US, she's been in British media for 5-10 years now.
The second you mentioned Twitter I knew it was going to be a shit show, thank you for the awareness
Looks like the project’s official twitter page got suspended.
Idk how the reddit algorithm goes but commenting to boost this anyway, this is so horrible. I hope this info spreads like wildfire.
Prepare the hormone grenades. It is time for a crusade!
You could reach alot of people in the community on tiktok using the right hashtags.
Of course it’s linked to Matt Walsh…
their twitter acc is suspended lol. honestly tricking people like that, it’s just cowardly.
I'm telling the PRIDE club at my university about this. I'm going to pass on the warning.
im so done with conservatives
This is so fucking weird. Why do they care? Just leave us alone lmao
Unfortunately, the siblings that really need to see this will not. Because of spreading awareness and the informed of us heeding its warning, the more easily manipulated will be the only ones in the documentary. ):
thank you!!!
This is a new level of sickening shit, Matt Walsh and all his associates should be wiped from the internet.
thats horrible!
It tells you a lot that the fascists need to lie in order to get their evil points across.
Don't look Right to me. Looks wrong.
Their account is suspended so that’s good
I never realized there was so much trans hate. Can anyone link me one of these anti trans videos? I’d love to see their silly ass views and opinions.
I just want to be a woman, Ugh I hate this stupid political Bs
Counter point, send in out best. Can we @ Lavern Cox lol
Exposing them with their lies is probably the best thing to do for now.
Yep. Every day the ""there's no hate like christian love"" expression hits closer and closer to home
We make a mockery of they're magical omnipotent sky daddy yet I find it ironic that some of them would kill us or be happy to have caused our suicide even though the bible commands Christians to preserve *ALL* life it says ""woe to those who destroy God's world"" since all living organisms are apart of God's world
""I've done nothing to these people"" maybe we should do something to these people. god knows they deserve it
It’s rlly sad
My right to exist should not be a political debate.
This shit is a battle the same way the Holocaust was a high-stakes game of Hide-and-Seek that Germany decided to play until the Allies ruined it


....inb4 Kentucky passes a law mandating that that's what gets taught in public schools
Hey now I’ve relentlessly mocked them on the internet for years and have tricked them into viewing an image of a pig defecating onto its own testicles more times than I can count. 

That’s totally comparable to spearheading a culture war against our very existence /s
It's using the guise of an accepting documentary about trans people to trick them into taking part. The producer of this documentary had previously worked on Matt Walsh's show and on some PragerU projects. The fact that they have worked with these people in itself is a huge red flag and shows that the whole documentary is just a front to demonize trans people.
Lol looks like we “won” that one sided war that lots didn’t even know about. Honestly seeing shit like this makes me sick, leave us alone.
When will they just leave people the fuck alone. It’s really not that hard. Matt, Shapiro and other right wing nuts have to go out of their way to harass us. Is tiring fighting but we have to for the trans youth that come after us, and even for us alive now to live in better non-discriminatory world.
It's called razor shoes and a knife. Probably a few milkshakes too for good measure.
Yep,, I try not to think about it too hard cuz it fuels my paranoia but good god it’s scary.
OK that's a bit extreme not every right winger is a bad person you're generalising
It’s not journalism. It’s propaganda with the intent to misrepresent and humiliate. Honestly it’s like the woman from the antiwork sub appearing on Fox. She should’ve been more prepared, sure, but she also shouldn’t have agreed because the point was to humiliate her.
We got 'em folks
Saw a trans girl who *unironically* had “Nikki Haley / Ben Shapiro 2024” on her profile. No awareness. Assuming white privilege let her ignore the fact that they’d legislate her out of existence. People like Blaire White are there to give the hate movement legitimacy, to show that they can’t possibly be bigots, they “have a trans!” White, Candace Owens, even Ben Shapiro fail to realize that if you stop supporting their power structures, they’ll hold a seat on the last cattle car for you.
Unfortunately that's going to be the next NFT in a decade
Estrogen arrows loaded!
I don’t have a tik tok but I hope people who do spread this on there
Never think that your rhetoric, skill, and knowledge can best an editor with full access to filmed footage and an agenda to portray you as negatively as possible.
Never have I heard that, really like it!
I have never ever been with a more hateful person then a Christian
I'm gonna use this
There is no hate like Christian love. I'm gonna start using that.
Admittedly, it's hard for me to fathom religion at all. My parents were Catholic until the molestation came out, but by age 8 I told them I didn't believe it and they pretty much raised me in a secular fashion. Like, don't get me wrong, I've seen enough to know that they feel this way, but it's just such a foreign notion to me.
Nothing about my gender has anything to do with their religion.  I don’t make a mockery of anyone at all with this aspect of my life.  

There is no enmity.  There is nothing at all.  I just plain don’t care what bigoted people think.  They’re not a part of my world; they’re just the shrill, screeching noise of fake politics.

I do know a few good Christians though.  In church every Sunday, always tithe, charitable to others, and mild in their behavior.  None of them cares if I wear eyeliner or take hormones.

News trolls and election bigots don’t represent anybody at all where I live.  Literally nobody cares what they say about this.  This is dumber than last election cycle when they tried to target swingers with their fake outrage.
I'm honestly worried that they're going to win. Fascism is on the rise and those of us on the left aren't doing enough about it. We tend to avoid conflicts, these people are armed, dangerous, willing to attempt government overthrows and plots to kidnap governors, they're in our courts, in our police. We're not even as organized as they are. I'd like to stay positive, but it just feels inevitable.

My Oma lived in a Jewish neighborhood during WW2, she watched as all her friends disappeared. Then, her father and all three of her brothers were executed for being subversives. When the war ended, she moved to the US. She said, ""When it was over, they expected us to be neighbors with Nazi's, but I could never be neighbors with Nazi's."" I think about that a lot nowadays, I have to live in neighborhoods with Trumpers and it frankly disgusts me.
So, they're using trans people to defend transphobic ideals?
They would probably only use parts of the interviews out of context and add some propaganda nonsense to make it sound like they mean something else, without letting the interviewees respond to it.
They won’t leave people alone. Our existence is a threat to their control. It’s up to all of us. Never fucking again.
>Is tiring fighting but we have to for the trans youth that come after us, and even for us alive now to live in better non-discriminatory world.

Absolutely—I could not agree more. At the same time, this is honestly one of my main sources of daily stress. I constantly feel a sense of obligation. The tough thing is, for the reasons you stated, there is some truth behind that feeling of obligation. 

There’s no way to say this without sounding somewhat conceited, but I have exceptional communication skills from a combination of nature & nurture (*cough* mostly trauma *cough*). Hence, when other people aren’t stepping in (or *are* stepping in, but falling into the rhetorical traps that allow fascists to control the conversation), I feel like I *have* to say something…..but it takes so much out of me. Challenging people to deconstruct harmful beliefs is so inextricably linked to my childhood & adolescence where I constantly had to justify myself to my abusive, gaslighting mom. 

I constantly have to weigh the important of my mental health vs. the importance of nipping something in the bud that, if left unaddressed, will add to the already dangerous cultural climate surrounding folks like myself and other minority groups (& thus, ironically, create more chances to end up in situations that will be bad for my mental health). It feels like I *have* to do damage control to minimize the alt-right, TERF, etc. radicalization that constantly creates more and more people that endanger the lives of marginalized people, because many people can’t counter it effectively (which is not at *all* a slight. There is NO shame in having trouble countering fascist rhetoric—none at ALL. It’s engineered to be that way. Of *course* good people arguing from a genuine place of concern are going to be disoriented by bigots acting disingenuously). Basically, I’m always caught between the short-term “I don’t want/can’t afford to feel like shit for the next few days” and the long-term “I need to prevent this person from creating more monsters who will inevitably cause widespread future pain to myself & others.”
 
This is mostly just a vent; I’m doing okay & not really looking for advice or reassurance (although it’s always welcome!). I’ve worked hard to stop judging myself for putting my mental health first sometimes, & I’ve learned skills to manage stress, pick my battles more effectively, etc. (dialectical behavioral therapy for the win!), so I’m not constantly in a horrific headspace or anything. Just needed to lay this out there, because your comment hit close to home & I wanted to share my experience.
Lol, I’ll carry a Glock in my purse and a gock (I just saw this term and hate it) in my panties.
I didn’t come out for years for many reasons, this among them. Did I want to invite that kind of scrutiny and potential discrimination in my life, when I could hide in the background as a cis man? But fuck it, it’s time, I’m doing it for real now.
Not every moderate or leftist is a good person. Many are not. But when your ethos is dependent on the denial of another’s basic humanity, you are, by any definition I care to use, Fucking Evil. Not every reactionary is incurable. Some need to be exposed to personal connections to have empathy. Some are ignorant, some are misled. Some are incurably, pathologically monstrous. The onus does not fall on me to convince you of my right to exist. I am. If you choose to deny it, you’re the one with the problem.
Anyone who supports the right wing is either a racist, sexist, homophobic transphobe, or supports people that are racist, sexist, homophobic transphobes. So no, that person is not generalizing.
Protection is necessary constantly. For instance I keep a dagger on me at all times when I'm in public.
Oh yeah absolutely but they CONSIDER this journalism so I might as well debunk it
I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

> Palestinian Arabs have demonstrated their preference for suicide bombing over working toilets.

Ugh, those ignorant shits will never actually be ""one of them"", no matter how much they smile and dance for them.
People who do this always blow my mind. Like, what are you trying to be? A pick me girl? ""One of the good ones?"" Here's a newsflash for you, sweetheart: to them, *there are no good ones.* Any feigned acceptance is a ruse designed to turn you into a weapon against the rest of your real community. Wake the fuck up.
I dunno what an NFT is
You're right. But they will find someone to be on their documentary. And the amount of damage a totally unprepared person can do is not the same as someone whose used to trick questions and media spotlight.
Yeah obviously like everything it doesn't apply to everybody but there are an awful lot of right wing Christians that hate the LGBT+ community but say that they are only doing things because ""they don't hate us, they love us and want to save us."" Nothing has made me despise religion like people trying to ""save"" me
Oh same. I've met some hateful people and the majority of the time the people that are most racist, transphobic, homophobic, etc are extremely religious. Which I find to be extremely ironic.
>I do know a few good Christians though.  In church every Sunday, always tithe, charitable to others, and mild in their behavior.  None of them cares if I wear eyeliner or take hormones.

There's plenty of LGBT Christians and there's some LGBT specific churches I believe.

While there have been a lot of hateful Christians, it does rub me the wrong way when people make LGBT people and Christians seem to be separate groups that are complete enemies. Yeah, some definitely preach hate. We have all seen that. So have other religions. So have people that don't fall back on religion as an argument. Hate doesn't depend on Christianity or any religion to exist. It has fired it up because it's linked to what morals people have, and people inject their own ideology into it, but being Christian doesn't directly mean you hate LGBT people.

It rubs me the wrong way because you see a lot of people talking shit about people who believe in a ""magical sky daddy"" but then there's this duality where people make submissions like ""can I still believe in God and be LGBT? Can I still be Christian? Can I still be Muslim?"" And the answer is always a resounding yes, despite hate having existed among members of those religions. It's like there's this duality of people hating religious people, then validating them and being like ""oh but not you, of course you can be religious"" when they're LGBT. But if you look at how people talk about Christianity in any LGBT subreddit it's easy to see why people might start thinking their religion is in complete conflict with their LGBT status.

My wife is Christian and loves me despite me being trans, and never has preached hate in her life. She doesn't go to Church because she believes they often twist the words. She's read the Bible in the triple digits, but she doesn't believe in the old testament Leviticus ""man should not lay with man"" bit just like she'll wear mixed textiles. She pays attention to the direct quotes from god and Jesus, which isn't the whole book. I mean, Moses kills a man in the bible. Doesn't mean killing is okay. You can't take it word for word as a lesson on how to live and pull out one part and say ""this means gay people are evil end of story"". It makes a lot more sense to pay attention to what Jesus himself says in the bible if you're truly Christian.
There was a video on YouTube a while ago, but now I can't find it. But basically, someone made a flat earth documentary and tricked a bunch of scientists into participating in it, and cut their statements so much out of context that they sounded like they were supporting the flat earth. The scientists were, of course, very angry. The video was titled something like ""I have no idea why I'm in that flat earth documentary"". 

That's what Matt Walsh is trying to do here, but with trans people. All the big trans names need to know, so they don't get tricked into being in the video (cough like how Chase Ross got used in Abigail Shrier's transphobic book to support her arguments cough and now she looks more legit because it sounds like a big trans name supports her cough).
Yup and also to make a mockery of us like they have in most of their content.
Girl, me too.
I like clock better personally. Clit/cock lol
I’m proud of ya! What’s the point of life if we ain’t tryin to be our best selves, no?
I never said any one political group is good or not they all suck in their own ways even my noble libertarian beliefs they suck because no one cares about Liberty anymore
No that's not true because there's racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic people on the left so if that's the case for the right it must be the case for the left
Legally? I'm just wondering - I would certainly be running afoul of the law if I did that, even though it would be cool.
Good bot
Good bot
I dunno if you guys saw it, but Blaire at some point had like a discussion kinda thing with 3 other Conservatives and one of the women there was JUST shitting on her and calling her a man the whole time. The things they will go through just for the ""Pick me!"" always terrify me.
Keep it that way
Non-Fungible Token is just a sub set of crypocurrency. It's only real world applications would be money laundering and flexing (showing off wealth)
The right move is actually to send in nothing. I don't mean ""don't interact with them"", that'd be not sending anything in. We want to send something in. That something, however, will be nothing. If they contact you, act as if you're going to be in the interview, but cancel last minute because of some made up or real emergency. Ask to reschedule, and do it again. Basically, fuck with their schedule as much as possible without actually giving them any proper footage or quotes.
seriously fuck those dbags
I agree, my wife is Christian too. She even used to be in a quite fundamental sect/community but left that behind when we started dating. She's still loosely in contact with some people from there and none of them have ever said a word against me, neither when we were passing as lesbians nor now when I'm transitioning.

Her community did teach some homophobic things and it would be naive to deny that. My wife was shocked when she read back through the things she wrote about family and marriage as a teen. But she could separate fundamentalism and the good things it gave her, reject the fundamentalism and live on slightly more grounded in reality.

Meanwhile for me the bible is just a historic text. I believe Jesus was a cool guy, but also think he was mystified the same way like other historic characters that appeared only in texts written after their death (many saints, but also Vikings etc) and all those teachings should always be taken with a grain of salt and in historic context (it's good to know who was at war with whom for example to understand why some passages are a bit more violent)
I know what video you're talking about, it's by Folding Ideas on YouTube and it was my fist thought when I read this post. Worth watching to see how grifters can pull off this particular scam even on professional academics. [That Time Geocentrists Tricked A Bunch of Physicists](https://youtu.be/icwDF8wRgF4)
Ew.
Which is why they suck they're unoriginal if they came out and said that trans people are secretly aliens from outer space and are here to destroy humanity then I'd give them points for being original they'd sound like complete crackheads but still
Lol a trans libertarian? That's a fucking new one
Hailey, I’m gonna suggest that you take a look at the real-world consequences of Libertarian beliefs to see what they actually accomplish. It’s very common, especially among the extremely online™️ for there to be a pipeline from Libertarianism to outright white supremacy. There’s a reason for that. 

I also saw that you said you have ASPD - that may make it difficult for you to understand those flaws in the philosophy, because of the inherent selfishness of Libertarianism. I can assure you that whatever pretensions of freedom 99% of Libertarians have, it will boil down to them asserting their freedom to call you a man, their freedom to deny you basic rights, their freedom to kill or imprison you for demanding those rights. If your appearance is 100% passing and hot, and you squawk their opinions, they will let you exist as a curiosity. If you have enough money to treat other people like they don’t matter, then they’ll leave you alone. But otherwise, Libertarians are just fascists waiting for an excuse.
No because everyone on the right in politics is that way, not everyone on the left is. So it’s very different. You are probably about to start sea lioning so I will not be responding to your comments any longer.
Be gay do crime.
Take a bullet for ya babe.

That stuff is just sad to me, like they're never gonna accept her as one of them but she just keeps going. Like either she has zero self respect or is just delusional about her standing among them and legitimately thinks she is safe among them, or maybe she just doesn't care and she's profited from it. 

In the last Canadian election there was a Conservative Party candidate in my city who was a trans woman and it just boggled my mind. I will never understand them.

Shhhh don't tell them 🤫👽🛸
Wtf that is so condescending of you to just bring up a personality disorder you searched on their profile to invalidate their opinion like they don't have convictions on their own

What does sea lioning mean?
Ah yes of course I forgot because some right wingers are bigots that automatically makes all right wingers bigots but if there's any bigoted leftists then that's OK leftists get special treatment
Agreed. I have a sword and I'll be buying another soon, but I feel the cops and the general public wouldn't care for that. A dagger though...
I agree that it’s condescending. I was not looking for ammunition, I was looking on her page to see if she had posted about politics. But I think a lack of empathy is pretty standard for Libertarians, and a society run that way would be exploitative and cruel.
This has to be a troll, right?
It means they keep asking questions or making statements that are supposed to make them appear unbiased or merely interested in what your opinions are, but the reality is they just want to waste your time and attempt to make both sides of an argument look legitimate to sow doubt and confusion. It’s a tactic used by people who know they are wrong.
That's why there are knives. Easier to handle and you can hold more of them in boots and up skirts.
It worked on me to be honest haha
Good point. I have my eye set on a nice stiletto, myself.
I have a standard dirk, but a stilettois more flashy and I like the idea of it more since the blade is smaller and lighter.
I love dirks! Is yours one of the Scottish variety?
No, it's an English spin-off, but the blade isn't as long as a Scottish dirk and it has a boot knife sheath.
I love it!

I've gotten more and more into Scottish weaponry recently. I don't know why.
I really like proto-scottish/pictish weaponry pictish daggers were curved and I found that very interesting since curved weaponry was more standard in India through North Africa.
That is quite interesting. I do love me some curved blades.
Did you see those warriors from Hammerfell? They have curved swords, *curved swords*.""

Just to clarify. The attack helicopter joke is transphobic.	I was being baraded in a sub after trying to explain its not funny. But I wanted to make sure.	"Very transphobic and also just old and boring now too. Transphobes have just one joke and that’s it.
[deleted]
It's transphobic *and* incredibly boring.
What the hell is the attack helicopter joke?

Oh wait is it that one ""I sExUaLlY iDeNtIfY aS a-"" joke? Cause I hate them so fucking much.
https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/Heligender look what trolls did
Back in the day I used to have an image of a ZSU-23-4 Shilka SPAA battery with a trans flag photoshopped onto it that I would send as a response to those, haven't been able to use it in years though.
I'm fine with people using it

But I'm only fine with it because I worked on the surface-to-air missile systems while I was active duty Navy =P

It's still a shit comeback that deserves a throatpunch
I saw a meme posted of a guy in a ""transvacinated"" t-shirt. That shit is just dangerous on so many levels. I was furious.
Honestly though... They're probably close to the mark in their self identification.

Why, you ask? Because attack helicopters require a huge amount of maintenance to not spontaneously explode, they are outdated & only useful in a very narrow range of circumstances, they only exist to make old men hard and they can't function without 6 men inside them
What’s the helicoper joke?
Whenever someone brings the helicopter joke, I just comment r/onejoke and go on with my day.
is it an awful joke? yes

was it what awakened me to take the self journey of figuring out my gender? also yes
When someone says they identify as an attack helikopter I say if that's the case then I identify as a ground-air missile
Yeah, it is
Yeah they prolly understand that, they just want a reaction from you.
What sub?
I originally heard it as a joke made by Enbies and Trans people. I just assumed it was a joke that started as a transphobic but that people in the community took over as a f u to transphobes. Since I have come out I really have not heard or seen that joke but I do agree it's very boring.
I heard a reply to that like ""Oh you do? Hey to each their own. If you don't feel whole unless you have 6 guys in you at the same time, then you do you.""
Jesus I feel dense now...., I never connected the dots that the joke was about trans.....I always thought it was an otherkin degrading joke. 

(For those that don't know otherkins are individuals that identify as a different species, colour or object. Either literally identifying that way and believing they have been born in rhe wrong form, or that they have an incredig deep life defining connection)
/r/onejoke

Yeah...
It's fucking old ""joke"" too I remember years ago back in school that it was a ""joke"" and that's back around 2005-2006
it's transphobic. it's old, too.
guys if u hear this joke just fly away from the situation its not worth it
and also just painfully unfunny
Ugh, I used to make that joke and think it was funny. I was like 9💀

Minecraft youtuber SSundee used it and I didn’t know/cared enough that it was transphobic
When I first heard it I thought it was a joke about how the us military commits war crimes lol
very transphobic and just boring
I've never known it as being a joke. Pretty sure it was always used as an insult to mock the idea of trans.
Yeah, luckily no one has ever done that around me but still it's just not cool. I HAVE been homophobic/transphobic Ally attacked, and also I've had comments made such as 'Oh you know [deadname] from class D? SHE wants to change HER name to Riley.' I'm so glad that next (almost this) year I won't have the person who said that in my class and instead, have my close friends, one who is Non-Binary, the other (like me) is a demiboy.
As bad as it is honestly I just laugh and move on. I hang out with WAYY too many cis people to  hear this. Allot of them are lgbt mind you. It seems like its just a cis thing no matter what community you so happen to be in. Atleast in my observation that is. Not saying anyone is at fault but I mean grow up and stop saying it altogether.
It's just dumb, dull shit only someone w/o a single ounce of fantasy could come up with
I wish someone told me that r/memes is a shit hole before I downloaded Reddit 4 years ago because guess what, I saw a homophobic post and I said homophobia isn't cool or something like that (for the record I wasn't even aggressive or defensive it was a chill ass comment  💀) but I got bombarded by death threats from like the same three people so yep I immediately uninstalled Reddit after that, I downloaded it again a few days ago just to join lgbtqiaapp+ subs
yeah its just fucking boring at this point
Think the only people who use that joke anymore are 12 year old “Edge Lords” but yea, it’s old, annoying, overused and extremely transphobic.
Only reason I found it funny was 'cause 'round the same time the joke was mainstream, I realized I was trans and was an aspiring pilot too lmaoo.

The joke's not funny when shoved down people's throats and directed at people in an attempt to invalidate or demean them. I know.

I have a self-deprecating sense of humor... so the joke appealed to me. Know that I never used it at others or encouraged it. All it did was make me giggle when I called myself an attack helicopter.

Just my thoughts... honestly, I could've kept all this to myself, but the ""attack helicopter"" meme was at its peak popularity during a huge turning point in my life. I guess I'm just happy I found a way to make light of it. It could've just as easily hurt me since my depression was in its ripest state then too.
It’s transphobic and a rly shit joke
Yup, unfortunatly most subs has mods that don't understand or care
It was funny for me when I used to follow Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder on YouTube and I was 16 and edgy. But then I grew up and learned to care about others
My coworker used that joke on me but I retaliated with ""hey thanks, you acknowledge me as something other than cis female"" and we smoothed it out

He used to be super transphobic but situations like this help me show him the world I live in and he's improved a lot
Just to clarify: Yes, yes it is, by implying that mismatches \[such as those that are the underlying source of dysphoria\] are completely arbitrary.

The first time I saw it, it struck me as making fun of ""otherkin"", and how ""I'm not a human, I'm a \[insert cute and adorable animal / mythological animal here\] in a human's body!"" was hurting trans acceptance during the height of its visibility/popularity.  Then the ~~fire nation attacked~~ edgelords latched on to it...
Myself also being trans I never understood the meaning of that ""joke"", it just never made sense to me.
Apparently I live under a rock, because I hadn’t heard of it, so I looked it up. 

Oh yeah. It’s obviously transphobic. 

The website know your meme gives full details and says it “mocks gender and sexual identification posts” as transphobic also
Yeah, the attack helicopter joke is... Most definately from a place of transphobia. 
But I'd be lying if I said I didn't tell people I was an attack helicopter while I was questioning. 

People online: ""are you a boy or a girl.""

Me: ""uhh, I'm an attack helicopter.""

(Edit because ya girl is freaking bad at grammar today.)
I was a cringe mf and used to use this joke and now I'm trans and see the error of my ways. I was awful!
Oh god I forgot about that joke

People are so stupid
The fact that people even use that joke in 2021 is just boring at this point smh
I’m laughing so hard at the fact that we even gotta say this. When we say “conservatives only have one joke,” this is the joke we’re talking about. Of *course* it’s transphobic.  
  
Matter of fact, I’d even argue that it’s impossible to “reclaim” it. That shit is radioactive now. It will *always* be pure transphobia.
It is transphobic and unfunny and overused as hell.
Ah yes i remember when i thought this was funny. Back when I was an uneducated kid (circa 2016) whos main perception of trans people being a ""man who thinks hes a girl and is mentally ill"". And i had no clue about nonbinary people. This is why trans awareness is so important...its no wonder that crap joke surfaced around the time gender identity became more mainstream...
I always lean in to it and ask what pronouns I should use for them if they are a helicopter. Either they'll give up or say something stupid. Then I lean in to that and only use those pronouns till they give up. 

My Husband's (21 FTM Enby) brother (16 M) tried to pull that joke on me (20 MTF Enby) and I just annoyed him back, using the pronouns heli/copter for just about a half hour. Kid hasn't made anymore transphobic remarks since
I get it, but you gotta just have a thicker skin. As a trans man myself, I rarely get upset over small comments like that. Nothing is gonna stop those comments from being made, but it's better to just not let it get to you. Y'all know they're tryna get negative emotions out of you, so don't give it to them.
Dude I'm trans you're literally just attention seeking sure it's not funny it's boring but it doesn't offend you it doesn't hurt you just stop you're completely fine and everyone knows it I mean this in the kindest way possible because every generation is getting even more sensitive back then you could do pretty much anything and people wouldn't be bothered by it so please just grow up and stop making everyone cry for you
[deleted]
I just wanna vent and say that helicopters need reclaimed.

Women of all sorts can be bad ass pilots.

I grew up knowing I was trans and with model Apache helicopters, I love helicopters of all kinds, and I hate this fucking meme.

Maybe we should seize upon the chinook, which is a big happy helicopter especially when painted yellow, but helicopters need trans pilots too.

We can’t have helicopters being dog whistles, we need them to be a source of strength for young aspiring pilots.
I feel bad that I didn't know it was making fun of trans people a few years ago and used it as a ""joke"" myself 🗿

So... Why was this downvoted? I couldn't care less about Reddit karma I'm just curious since I didn't think this would offend people?????  Can someone tell me why? I would totally delete this comment if y'all want to
Edit: I'm still waiting for someone to explain this to me 😭
[removed]
How?

EDIT: lol yea just downvote and have no conversation.
Berated?
Sorry but i don’t identify as an attack helicopter, i identify as a SR71 BLACKBIRD
Attack helicopters kill other people. Trans people kill…
Tbh I think we should reclaim it like we did with other slurs. Anyone down to be part of the helicopter gang?
Jokes can be offensive.  Some of the most famous comedians are some of the most offensive.  The issue shouldn't be if a joke is offensive, but if it's funny.
[removed]
[removed]
...no it isn't?
But... It's kinda funny :(
But not the non-binary ninja joke… we stan non binary ninjas…
It’s the equivalent of the joke “Ah you’re pansexual, so you wanna have sex with pans?” It’s such an overused joke cuz people don’t even try to make it any more interesting. Then they avoid even learning about what pansexual means to the person who identifies as that. It’s also an offensive and boring “joke” that will just makes others more uncomfortable.
Literally nobody ever actually identified as an attack helicopter.  Anybody saying that is just an idiot and transphobic. Millions of people actually identify as transgender though, and this is valid. It's really stupid to compare the two things!
Sounds kind of like saying all lives matter. That's not inherently wrong, and if someone doesn't know the context within the BLM movement, it seems like a benign statement. But when it's said or intended as a response to BLM, it takes on a more sinister connotation, which is to negate that black lives can matter more or ever at all. 

With the helicopter thing, it comes off as immature kid humor in response to something as immense as personal identity. It negates the trans truth and minimizes the movement by equating it to a childlike delusion.

It's important to keep track of this bullshit, because assholes love buzzphrases. But hopefully it fades, like when the Proud assholes tried to take tiki torches from us. Fuck the noise.
But who knows why?
There is this one time a streamer I like used the joke in a scammer trolling call but he apologized for not thinking the joke through.  I don’t really hold it against him since he apologized for it and besides that one joke, the rest of the scam prank call was pretty funny
Hella transphobic, like think about it, when has it ever been used except to degrade trans people? Never? Oh interesting, that sounds like the definition of transphobia.
*berated*******
Was it on the post with the (lazily executed) transphobe shirt?
Oh no front page what have you done
I honestly wonder if it might work like it seems to with unwanted sexual jokes, but could act like we don't get the joke and enjoy their uncomfortably as they attempt to explain it, somehow doubt it works out like that though
No one's ever pulled that line on me but if they did I'd tell em to go ahead and drink jet fuel and see if they were really that interested in becoming an actual helicopter
Yeah.. That joke is incredibly transphobic and overused by transphobes.
Memes is filled with teenagers and trolls. Don’t let em get to ya, they’re not worth it.
Y'all are *not* referring to the 2021 Hugo Award for Best Novelette nominee ""Helicopter Story"", originally published on 1 January 2020 in Clarkesworld Magazine under the title ""I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter"" by Isabel Fall who is a transgender woman, right?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_Sexually\_Identify\_as\_an\_Attack\_Helicopter
my favorite way to deal with that joke is just go with it. ""you identify as a helicopter? thats interesting. what are your pronouns?"" and whatever they say just use them
TIL this isn't about spinning your dick and I've got no idea about memes.
As someone who accepts the validity of all gender identities, when someone tells me they identify as an attack helicopter, I trust that they're telling the truth and then shoot them with anti-aircraft artillery.
they repeat the same jokes since like 2012 and think they're hilarious like dude. you look, sound, and act like a fool.
It's boring but I wouldn't consider it actively transphobic (as in that most times I've seem it used are just in jest)
It's also really lame
Yes.
*surprised Pikachu*
To be honest i have never being able to take it seriously.. way less now that there is a meme sound with it *Helicopter Helicopteeeer*

 It is transphobic. That's the point of the joke. Whether someone might find it funny or not, it's purpose its too harm someone else. There is no ""everyone laughs"" when you say that type of stuff. 

Personally, like i said before, it has never bothered me. It's too stupid, it doesn't even make sense, it's repetitive and unoriginal.
It's not funny. If anybody tells you they identify as this, suggest that they go drink jet fuel.
My 8 year old son loves memes. Not sure how heard this one but he did, and on one or two occasions called me his attack helicopter.  I explained that while I didn’t personally find it offensive coming specifically from him  as if anybody messed with him I certainly would attack, it was very, very hurtful to others. I made sure he knew it was acceptable only for him to say it, and only when referring to me. 
He hasn’t used that term since. Wasn’t my intention, but that’s how he chose to handle the info.
It’s a rare joke, both harmful and not funny.
Back in the day when i was raised in an environment of idiots and had no idea what the LGBT community even was i used to think it was a joke about helicopter parents i.e entitled parents

However yea it's horrible :/

I've always found it ironic how due to the toxic boys i was at school with and just not knowing any better i used to be transphobic and now I figured out i was trans myself 💀

I hate my past :/
It's also just quite obnoxious
if you’re gonna be transphobic, *at least* try to come up with some new, funny material
Incredibly transphobic. Also just plain annoying and unoriginal
I made the joke once several years ago and someone I worked with chastised me for and explained why it’s hurtful. I was ashamed of myself and never made the joke again.
Yes, it is indeed transphobic.
As far as I’m aware the attack helicopter joke was only ever referring to people who unironically want to identify as animals or inanimate objects. Not trans people. Wanting to identify as a man/woman/anything in between fine. Wanting to identify as anything other than that is kinda nonsense.
i find it incredibly transphobic, but not necessarily offensive. mostly because the people who say those jokes never matured after middle school. its just stupid and unoriginal
It isn’t even the transphobia that I care about anymore; it’s just so painfully unfunny. If you’re going to mock me, at least try to be clever about it.
I don’t think I know that joke.  Is it the ROLFcopter or something like that?
Still funny tho

Hopefully one day you will learn to laugh at things that dont matter
explain why
What is the difference between this joke and somebody who identifies as something that is not a gender (eg Deer) ?
I used to think it was kinda funny until I discovered it was created for the sole purpose of offending me and everyone like me.
It is but I generally try and ignore it tbh, the ‘joke’ has been so overused that it’s lost it’s edge to me
im afraid I get this joke from my transphobic family, they don't know im trans
its lame and transphobic, dont let transphobes get to you theyre assholes anyways <3
It is. But it is also so unoriginal I have heard it at least 400 times now.
cope
I don’t find it funny but I also don’t personally find it offensive 

I suppose I can see why it can be hurtful but I just don’t really take it seriously
I feel like if someone says they identify as a attack helicopter I’d be like okay that’s cool when can I see you fly off a building.
throwback to middle school when my friend and I were both closeted and would make that joke to hide it. god, I hate that joke.
Tell them you identify as an anti-aircraft cannon. Then you can legally blow them up and not face any consequences
yeah it 's transphobic, the only reason i'm tired of hearing the joke isn't because it' transphobic though but because it's unoriginal and i've heard it one too mamy times. you want to ""offend"" me, get a better joke you joke
i really hate this one bc it feels very nonbinary-phobic, het and cis passing trans men and women are often more accepted by cis people than nb identity’s because they’re trying to sort trans people into “valid vs not valid and stupid” just because they don’t take the time to educate themselves. very hateful “joke”. i wish these people cared enough to distinguish what a joke is, versus what is prejudice and harassing language towards a marginalized group of people. at this point, with the amount of information we have at the tip of our fingers, it is intentionally hateful rather than just ignorance or “they don’t know any better”.
so are neopronouns
i'm a trans male and i refer to myself as an attack helicopter all the time lol
can someone explain how this is transphobic? i understand if this doesn’t really make sense but this is my view on it

from someone who’s genderfluid and uses different pronouns on a daily basis, someone could *technically* identify as an attack helicopter if they wish. they could also use separate neopronouns. yes, clearly not everyone who is a part of the community is not identifying as an attack helicopter and that part can be transphobic but i think there should be a little wiggle room for those who actually might identify as that.

sorry if that was confusing and i might’ve answered my own question but can someone just put my thoughts straight and explain this to me?
I had to look this one up. 

The google search under a link to KNOWYOURMEME reads ""It parodies absurd gender and sexual ..."", but if you click the link, it is phrased "" It mocks gender and sexual ..."".

I thought that was odd. Must have been edited but the google results page has the pre-edit?

Anyway, seems transphobic to me. Why anyone would get banned from a sub for saying that is crazy. I'd say that is a sub you probably don't want to be a part of.
I dont get it
I'll tell you what is funny. Remembering that military policy is to send a tactical drone destroy anything that identifies as an attack helicopter in US airspace
wait it is? i thought it whas just a meme
It was funny for like a week and it's been 7 years.
I know I’m late to the party but what’s the helicopter joke? 👀
HOW? If someone wants to identify as a weapon of destruction let them

I mean they made how many James bond movie?

I honestly never thought identifying as an inanimate object was transphobic

I mean I identify as a Martian sometimes because I have bad days hating humanity

Am I seriously from Mars? No, but it's a joke, like claiming to be a helicopter. I've never met one person that claimed that actually takes it serious
I used to say this all the time and i cringe so much
Not if a trans person is doing it. I am non binary and I have made that joke a 100 times but it's still offensive if a cis folk does it
I think the worst part of it, is the emperor's new clothes style fear of exclusion, that has so many people bullied into thinking it is or was or could have been at some points a joke and not just some transphobic anti-progressive slogan. There is no comedy or humour attached and it's honestly insulting to the idea of a joke to label the attack helicopter meme as such. 


Sorry if this is ranty or grammatically incorrect, I just feel very strongly about how words and language are used or rather misused more often than not.
I myself make that joke whenever I'm talking to ignorant people, trying to tell them that the internet basically identifies as everything nowadays, even attack helicopters or kitchen appliances.
""Okay? If what you say about being an attack helicopter is true, you won't object to having your head replaced by a rotor, your torso by a cockpit, your arms by turrets and your legs by landing gear?""

...that's what I would say in response! Well, if I weren't so damn shy and awkward...
I dont even waste my time with those people. Words could never hurt me.
can’t believe I used to make those jokes

granted I didn’t know they were Anti-LGBT at the time but I still feel like a total dick about it
This mainstream bigotry is alive and well.
To clarify, how is the attack helicopter joke transphobic? I agree that it is very unfunny, old and just plain boring. I'm fully curious on how the joke is transphobic though. No hate, just curiousty.
Just making sure. Thanks.
I may just be missing something... but why is it transphobic? Not saying it is not since... I don't know so I trust other people who know more... just want to understand why is it transphobic... sorry if my grammar is confused
It's been old and boring for 15 years... it's a fact that hate is antithetical to humor or creativity
I don’t think it was ever actually a joke. Doesn’t surprise me that brains too dimwitted to accept or understand trans people would enjoy that “humor”.
[deleted]
Take it away from them though.

I loved Apache helicopters and I still do.

They’re badass just like you.
You have a point lol.
This comment radiates a horrifying level of shitpost energy due to claiming a subreddit
There's actually an attack helicopter nicknamed 'killer egg' and every time a transphobe tells their one joke, I imagine it's that one
/r/onejoke
r/birthofasub
You're a hero, just like the creators of /r/racerealism and /r/stormfront
Agreed.
And not funny!
Yes it is that joke. I also hate it.
Ye. I saw that a bit back. Gave me a good laugh for a second till I realised someone was trying to say it's a gender. I mean if it's a trans person trying to reclaim the joke that makes sense. But I don't know who added it.
Nice.
Care to share? I know someone that is otherwise accepting of people and isn't getting how lame the joke is
Your throatpunch can be a Sea Sparrow into that self-identified target
Lol
I think I saw that. I was also annoyed by it.
I get your stance, but the AH-64 Apache only requires two people and the same goes for many others
Damn. Committing this to memory.
Its where someone says they identify as an attack helicopter in attempt to say they LGBTQ gender identities make about that much sense.
Lol.

I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>There is no doubt that law enforcement should be heavily scrutinizing the membership and administration of mosques.

Happy cake day!!!
I think they were making fun of gender identities outside of man and woman especially trans and Nonbinary people :(
You are the most non-trans, trans person. Fr sound like an uncle tom invalidating someone’s experiences. I’ve personally been made fun of for being trans with the attack helicopter “joke”. Idk if you are appealing to transphobic remarks because that’s your environment or what, but try to be understanding towards a fellow trans person.
""Creating fad genders"" as you called it is sometimes a result of the person being autistic or in other ways neuro divergent and not feeling a connection to ""normal"" gender identities. It's not just a tumblr thing and it's kinda rude to just assume that.
I'm still kinda wanting answers doe 👀
The basis of the 'joke' is transphobia, it's mocking people for identifying as anything besides their assigned gender at birth. ""Oh, you identify as a woman? Then I identify as an attack helicopter!""

/r/onejoke
Ok I scrolled down and saw the answer I needed.

I always considered the Apache helicopter joke to be mocking the 70 to 100 something different genders listed on Tumblr/BuzzFeed. 

I didn't realize it was actually targeted at trans people. As if make believe...
No... it's the intention behind it. When people joke about trans people there isn't bad intent. But when people who don't take trans people seriously make jokes about trans people then there is a problem.
Discrediting gender understanding isn't a good one, loser. It's normalizing literally dehumanizing trans people. Try harder, and go cope elsewhere.
Its funny untill it's used to invalidate people. Then it looses all funniness.
No, bahraided
Neo pronouns are fine
Cis people do not know we are identifying with gender when we call ourselves trans. 

Cis people think we are deluded into believing our sex is different than reality.

They jest that they identify as helicopters because that is also an identity inconsistent with reality.
Ah... The perfect state of being... Truly magnificent.
No problem, you were right in that situation.
Sorry I would like this but it has 123 and I can’t just do that to your comment without being a sinner for more than being trans. On a secondary note, if you were to call a rock cis then people would have an uproar. Just flip the story around :))
It's equating a delusional belief (""I'm an attack helicopter, yar"") with being a transgender person.  If you look down at your body and see a helicopter, that is indeed a delusion.  A trans person is generally very aware of the reality of their sexed body and/or how society genders them, and they have some desire to change this state.  Either it causes them distress (dysphoria) that they wish to alleviate by making changes, or they believe that by making changes they will be able to live a happier or more fulfilling life.

They aren't the same in either symptoms or treatment.    Additionally, most medical associations around the world affirm trans people's identities and transition related care.  Ergo, being trans is not analogous in any way other than ""something, something, mental illness"".  It's transphobic because it's a mockery of trans people based on irrational prejudice.
It’s meant as a mockery. An example of what a person who uses that might be thinking would be, “This person is about as much a male/female as I am a helicopter!” So it’s just belittling trans people and making us sound illegitimate and playing make-believe.
Basically the joke goes something like this:

**Trans Person states how they identify with a gender other than the one given at birth**

Person making the Joke: “Oh you identify as X? Well then I identify as a Apache attack helicopter!”

Basically the joke relies on the concept that identifying with a different gender is equivalent to identifying as an inanimate object insisting that it is ridiculous in the first place and invalid.

The joke is more than five years old at this point and is regurgitated by transphobes as a “funny” way to invalidate the feelings of trans people and their identities.
It implies that identifying as a different gender than assigned at birth is about as ridicolous as identifying as a helicopter.
I find it transphobic because they are basically saying if we are going to let this happen (Identifying as what you weren’t born as) what will be allowed next (attack helicopters). It also sounds like they are trying to point at all the other non-binary genders and saying that they are equal to saying you are a helicopter
Yes, they do. Check out some of the other comments under mine explaining why.
I WILL BRING CHOLESTEROL DEATH UPON THEM ALL
/j Uhmmm ackshually there's at least 2 so shut up libtards, libs owned, I'm gonna go reward myself by pretending to suck space daddy elon's toes
I just left an ace sub and was trying to figure out why r/acerealism would be a bad thing
I mean, the only thing they sexually identify as is a joke to their family members. Don't pay attention to them. 

What sub/post btw? I wanna read the comments for myself
It is literally the joke. Don't you see that? Why was the joke originally made. It was made to Invalidate non binary people.  But you see what they said is an actual fucking thing now.
So I trawled through my HDDs, couldn't find it, [lucky you I do have photoshop installed.](https://i.imgur.com/jGv6ixD.jpg)

Have fun with it.
The exact system I worked on and still miss, even 16 years later <3 Was a POS, but it worked
The damned thing had over 12k in upvotes. The US has become a cesspool.
Eh, let me have my fun lol

Still works with two men inside them anyway, small adjustment to the joke for future :)
Wtf
Sadly, it isn’t. It’s about trans people, and the delegitimization of trans people. It’s meant to be a play on “I identify as a woman/man/nonbinary person.”  
  
It’s why Babylon Bee still has a site - they make money off making the joke over and over. It’s why they sell a shirt that says “I identify as vaccinated.” It has nothing to do with otherkin, and everything to do with trans people.  
  
And I say that as someone who (extremely regrettably) spent my 20s on TumblrInAction watching people give birth to this kind of joke, and jokes about otherkin. Believe me, they’re even less creative when they mock kids who think they’re wolves.
Good bot
Thank you :>
oh, I understand now :c
Nah you're just sensitive if that offended you then you calling me ""the most non trans trans person"" should just break me down which I'm not so seriously grow up and take a joke you're not gonna get through life easily it's fucking hard and jokes shouldn't bother you
Thx
Loses*

Minor spelling mistake. Victory is mine
That’s not a word. Bahrain is a place but I don’t see wtf that has to do with being berated.
Ye. Its still frustrating getting downvoted to hell for being right because so many people are transphobic.
This is a really strong explanation. Gonna save it for future use. Thank you!
This is the best explanation you could ever give me. Thank you Caitlin😊
I'm not a part of the community, and watching this particular joke I didn't really think it was funny tbh, but I didn't think much past that either. This is such a good explanation of how it's not analogous that my view of it has completely changed. Thanks for such a solid explanation.
Even worse to me are the people who post I identify as vaccinated.  SMH!
Oooohh. Thank you, I never saw it as that... I'll be much more wary of it from now on...
Like the old “If people of the same sex can marry then why can’t I marry my dog!?” Stupid asinine “argument”.
Thank you for answering... I'll never look at it the same way again
[deleted]
It's a double edged joke. If you reply with anger trying to explain that it is a trans-phobic remark, then you play their game. Why should it matter to us how they identify, if they want to call attack helicopter, the more power to them.
Thanks. This is the explanation that finally allowed me to understand!
I see... thank you \^\^
I kinda had the feeling about also ""targeting"" non binaries (I also have an NB friend and they opened my eyes about all these identities🥰). So yeah now I can understand why it is transfobic
I read them. People can be assholes, that’s so childish
r/memes. I'll send the link in a sec.

Edit: here you go https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/rrzfht/trans_rights_are_human_rights_but_we_cant_expect/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Chill. I need an explanation because I'm not educated on the whole heligender situation.
Thank you so much
Damn.
Mhm.
Love this reaction lol
Thank you for your logic and reason.

I should grow up? You’re being hella immature right now. I’m a grown ass adult and I know what it’s like to experience transphobia, that’s why I’m sensitive towards other trans peoples opinions regardless if I agree with it or not. It’s called supporting your fellow person. You fr just sound like a troll account with these shitty takes
What the heck?
/whoosh? Or did I get /whooshed?
A lot of people are just ignorant when it comes to joking at another groups expense.  I think it's the dumbest thing ever, but i've had people explain to me that it's okay for them to tell racist (sexist, homophobic or transphobic) jokes because they themselves aren't racist (or whatever).

And you can't even explain to them that it's still wrong to do it and its not funny.  They see it as ""harmless"" and ""i was just joking, i don't actually feel that way""

I like dark humor, but there's a difference between dark humor and hate humor, and a lot of people think they're the same thing.
Yes! Absolute trash.
Yeah, I’m trans-vax— I’m transitioning to being vaccinated. Appointment for my booster on the 13th babieee!
Not a problem at all! Thank you for asking so you could get a new perspective! Always good to learn!
The meme is exclusively transphobic. It doesn’t have any other application. There is no reason to defend using it. Stop trying to find reasons for it to be not transphobic.  
  
Like, this is the “one joke” that we all say conservatives have. Just Google “Babylon Bee identify as” and see how many transphobic articles that cesspool has written specifically to mock trans people. It’s transphobia. Sorry to burst your bubble or whatever.
The meme is literally discrediting peoples' understanding of their own gender and turning it into a mocking joke, transphobic trash like that belongs in the dump lol

Edit: Maybe focus on listening and learning, instead of posting ignorant comments that keep getting deleted because they don't belong lolol c'mon now. 🤦‍♀️
Tried balancing out your account Karma with some updates. Jesus christ. This is why I never wanted to browse r/memes ever :/
Honestly, all of the popular non-LGBTQ+ subs are toxic. Even places which are ostensibly inclusive like r/wholesomememes will shit down your throat if you’re openly trans or speak positively about trans issues. People on this site are fucking ghoulish.
That place is a shithole
That's why I never go to the r/memes comment section. As my old friend Ben would say: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.

I think part of your downvotes was that you were very visibly part of the LGBTQIA+ community because you stated it under your username along with two rainbow flags.
I definitely don't try to shift the blame to you here. I just think that little things like that are enough to trigger the transphobic masses of r/memes.
By the way, I think the word you’re after is, “berated”. You were berated for your comment and brigaded with downvotes. 

I upvoted you too. Some subs are toxic.
I honestly just posted on that
That's literally the whole point of the joke.
[removed]
They think we're still in 2005 Internet.
I actually agree with this.
R/onejoke is literally this, compiling the gender discrediting conservatives and other losers do, with the attack helicopter ""joke"" as the original foundation.
It’s so funny to me that the comments trying to find excuses for it *not* being a decade-old relic of transphobia keep getting deleted. I’ve never seen someone in the trans community fight so hard to find a reason why **the one joke conservatives have** isn’t actually inherently transphobic.
I left the sub lmao.

I could care less about the karma. I just don't want any people who haven't formed opinions getting bad information from see which side is downvoted.
I'm confused. I feel like your saying one thing then another. hold up.
Lmaooo
It's gotta be either conservatives playing pretend, or truly ignorant goofs that need to grow up, listen, and learn lol
Eh, still updooted.
Good job you took a joke I'm so proud of you

This is reddit, an anonymous website, kid. Ignoring detailed reasonings describing transphobia is for kids that have some growing up to do, and conservative chuds.

My sister wants me to be an “auntie” but i’m a transmale…	I’ma 16 yo trans male and I have been out for two years now. My family has supported me and are making an effort to make changes like saying a different name and different pronouns. HOWEVER. My sister always argues with me that I NEED to be called auntie. She’s about to have a baby and says that this is the one thing she deserves to have. I tried to explain to her that it’s uncomfortable for me and doesn’t really make sense to call a male an auntie… what makes it even worse is she wants her kid to call me auntie… which is just hurtful and would probably just confuse the kid. What the heck do I tell my sister?	"This is quite strange, Idk what to even say tbh. Why would you be supportive of everything but insist on auntie. It’s just a way to refer to someone like why can’t you just be uncle? I’d say put your foot down about it and don’t let her refer to you as auntie but honestly i have no idea that’s so strange
""ok, I'm going to call you Phil.""

If she questions it, ""shut up Phil. I deserve this.""
“Deserve”?
Fuck that. She don't deserve shit. I think she deserves being told to stop being a selfish fuck.
Tell her that you're going to act confused whenever her kids call you that and then act like your sister must be pulling a prank on the kids cause your obviously an uncle
""Deserves""

Tell her fair and square that you're not her fucking prize.
""The way I'm referred to isn't about you. Either drop it and don't call me that, or I won't interact with you or your kid at all.""
""She’s about to have a baby and says that this is the one thing she deserves to have.""

OK, just... it might not work, but straight up ask her ""why"". And don't relent until you get a coherent answer.

What this sounds like is that she doesn't fully see you as a man. If she says it, you can point out how it's a problem. If she does NOT say it out loud, she won't have a reason why you should be an ""auntie"".

I don't know your sister and the two of you's relationship, but this seems like the best way to approach this. It's not outright hostile or accusatory on your part, but leaves very little room for her nonsense.
Tell her that it's not about her and if her children won't address you properly you won't talk with them.
I’d just tell her that unfortunately her kid doesn’t have an auntie, but if she insists on calling you that to her kid, her kid isn’t going to have an uncle either.
Ew, she shouldn't be having a kid if she's that inconsiderate of her own family.
You don't owe her anything. Keeping saying no and teach the kid how to say your name instead. My neice and nephew call me by my name instead of auntie or uncle. And I call my dad's brothers and sisters by their first names too.
[deleted]
She has no right to your identity, she ""deserves"" nothing. You are 100% in the right for demanding that she gender you correctly. Tell her you're a man and that trying to call you ""auntie"" is weird, disrespectful and inappropriate.
Tell your sister, ""no"". She's crossing boundaries and being incredibly transphobic. And why the hell would someone ""deserve"" to misgender a person? It doesn't even make sense.
Damn I wish I was called auntie....



But honestly what does that even mean ""the one thing I deserve to have."" As if you owed your sister for existing.
She ""deserves"" it? What for? And what about what you deserve?
Ok, wtf... It's a word.... Why can't her kid have two uncles? IT'S THE SAME FUCKING RELATIONSHIP, WHY DOES THE WORD MATTER?! 

also, ""deserve""... Seriously, how entitled do you have to be?
Omg, your sister is such a narcissist... I'm sorry for you
She has no right to demand the wrong title placed upon you. Tell her to get it through her thick skull that your an UNCLE. And if she doesn't, you can correct the child until she caves. 

Siblings are a pain in the ass sometimes
I transitioned 40 yrs ago. Yesterday my aunt called me by a dead name.. some people just can't get past their own selves. Correct every time she opens her mouth with the word auntie connected to iy
Don't follow the advice of anyone telling you to misgender your sister. It won't get through to her. It will only teach her that being gendered correctly is a privilege that can be taken away as punishment instead of a right.
Why keep surrounded by those who do not treat you normally.

If something is translated from my language into English through google. I didn’t say anything bad, I’m sorry if I wrote something wrong, in this case, the moderators just delete my comment. Thanks
Get her in a headlock until she says UNCLE!
I’m sure you’d be a better uncle than she’s a sister
Your sister doesn’t get it. It’s your title, not hers. Part of growing up is gaining the courage to say no. Tell her no. It’s not your responsibility to help her understand.
hopefully she will grow up before she has that child
Get everyone else to refer to you as uncle. Maybe correct her every time she says ""aunt"", especially on social media. Maybe you post how excited you are to be an uncle.  The idea is to get the truth out before her lie. I worry if this is how she is starting, she will raise her kid to not respect your identity.  Also you may want repost this r/Entitledparents. She is not behaving like a normal parent.
What a karen. She doesn't deserve to be transphobic to you lol
She doesn’t deserve that. She doesn’t even deserve you being her kids uncle. She decided to have a kid(s) and yeah ofcourse it’s nice to help out and be a cool uncle when you can, but you don’t owe her anything because she decided to have a kid. 

What to tell your sister really depends on who you are and what you want the relationship with her and your nibling to be like. You can tell her you’ll be an uncle or nothing (but as you are only 16 that might be hard to execute). You can tell her your brother can be the aunt, because you won’t be. You can tell her being called aunt hurts and will compromise your ability to be there for your nibling. Whatever works for you
BE THE COOL UNCLE!!
tell your sister to go chew rocks. you are cool uncle breadsmitsmot, nothing else.

I'm sure you'll be a great uncle coming from an aunt who hasn't came out to my nieces and nephews yet
She seems sexist. Why can you provide less support to the child as a man vs as a woman?

Sounds like she just thinks men can't have positive relationships with children, and by only having two ""uncles"" and no ""aunts"" the kid is somehow deprived. 

Get a godmother ffs
Uncles do the same job...
My dad always called my aunt (mtf), my uncle, and my family often called her by her birthname, all I can say is it gave me a weird view of trans people, and I was transphobic until it was fully explained to me. By having her child call you auntie, to me this shows she wants to inspire transphobia in her child
>She says this is the one thing she deserves to have.

She sounds entitled, and I get the feeling that she probably isn't as supportive as she previously appeared to be. What's wrong with an uncle, anyway?
Tell her that she's being harmful and bigoted, tell her in no uncertain terms that her behavior on pronouns is unexceptible.
Put your foot down about it. Tell your sister that you're an uncle and that's the end of the discussion. Don't let her push and prod any more about it. If you give her any wiggle room, she'll keep at you about it, so don't give her any. Tell her that if she wants her kid to have an auntie, she can pick a close friend and give her the title.
Controversial take: let this play out. 


If she wants to call a full ass man auntie let her. She’s the one who’s going to look like an unhinged lunatic. The social repercussions should be enough to get her to change her mind pretty quickly
That’s so dumb, respecting your pronouns etc is just basic human decency. Why can’t you just be an uncle?? Aunt has a male equivalent…
She does not deserve anything and this is disrespectful and impossible anyway …. You are a male and it’s uncle or it’s nothing imo
There’s already a word for ‘male equivalent to auntie’ - uncle! “An uncle is usually defined as a male relative who is a sibling of a parent”. You are a guy who is a sibling of the parent, you are an uncle (congrats!). What she’s saying if she will not use uncle and insists on aunt is that she sees you as not male, which is pretty transphobic, sorry
Babes, sis is a transphobe. Set expectations low, and see if she’s willing to rethink her kid having an uncle or no one.
Yea that’s not right, honestly seems pretty selfish
she doesn't ""deserve"" to misgender you, at this point she deserves to eat shit. why does she even think she deserved that? did she dream of having you as a close family member helping her raise and guide her kid? cuz that can be done as an uncle, but if she keeps on pulling shit then sooner or later she won't have you in her life at all.
enough has been said but yeah, NOPE. youre a man, therefore youre an uncle. if YOU wanted to be auntie (for whatever reason) and it was YOUR idea, then sure. when i was little, my dad had two friends that was both cis men in a relationship, and i called them auntie and uncle but that was their choice.

her choice is that you're uncle or that your just your name to them.
Tell her she's being stupid.

If she does refer to you as auntie, pretend not to hear. And if she refers to her kids about an auntie, and then points in your general direction, just tell them ""she's not here anymore"" and when they ask what it means tell them ""ask your mommy, she'll explain""
If I can be brutally honest... it sounds like your sister needs to grow up and let go of an unrealistic and frankly childish fantasy that is based in cis-normative and patriarchal programming.

You are you, and she's asking essentially asking you to lie about who you are and lie to her child about who you are. Not cool. She doesn't ""deserve"" to invalidate your identity for a tidy, cute idealization of her baby's life.

If I were in your shoes, I would make an attempt to simply tell her that being called ""auntie"" feels the same as being misgendered or deadnamed. I'm a pretty upfront person, so I would probably just give an ultimatum - either she chooses to *genuinely* validate your identity, or she has to admit that she doesn't accept you for who you are.

Stand your ground hun :) The only thing worse than the potential conflict from standing up for yourself is the resentment that will grow inside of you if you compromise and try to change yourself for someone else.

You got this! DM me if you feel like hashing out the situation with a random stranger on the Internet. 🤣

❤️ Ava (22 transfem, she/her)
Tell her to fuck off. I’m sorry to be so brash I just can’t stand people who won’t get it through their heads that this is who you are and nothing is going to change and they are just going to have to deal with it.
That's really messed up she's not entitled to make you that kids aunty, more then likely she'll start referring to you as the kids aunty when it's born but everytime your around the kid and that happens correct her and if it starts an argument maybe try explain how she can't call you aunty because your a man and that she is not entitled to making you uncomfortable or making you the kids aunt other then that I'm not sure what other advice to give you other then to just stand your ground I hope everything works out goodluck
I would say ""If you make your kid call you dad, we have a deal"". Make her find out how uncomfortable it is.
Tell her it's not about her or what she ""deserves"". Only YOU get to define who you are, not anyone else.
Wow just WTF??! Is uncle really that difficult? It sounds like she isn’t actually accepting at all.
""Too fucking bad, guess they'll have to settle for an uncle. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "" is basically the reverse of what I told my sister when she had her first spawn.
You tell her no.
The you ain’t an aunty, you an unclo
Tell her that your not an auntie but a uncle and be just as stubborn as her
That makes no sense, you're an uncle. If she wants an auntie she can always call one of her friends that
Say no. She isnt entitled to anything. Sorry if this part sounds bad but if the only thing the child deserves to have is to call a guy an auntie, why the hell did they think it was a good idea to have the kid? That doesnt sound too fruitful
Looks like she doesn’t take you seriously. You should set some sort of ultimatum
She is not entitled to misgendering you. She does not NEED to call you something you don't like being called. That makes no sense
why not she just have her kids call a friend auntie? plenty of people do that
""I understand that you had a specific vision for your kid that was important to you, and that this must be disappointing. However, being called auntie is painful and dysphoric for me. I want to be an important part of your child's life, but it will likely be too difficult for me to do that if I am being called auntie when I see her. Maybe we can come up with another nickname together, so they can call our brother 'uncle' and me something else?""

As aggravating as she's being, approaching things like this is far more likely to actually work and not put a great strain on your relationship.
Well I see it that way: her kid can have an uncle or severed relationship before they were even born.
My trans partner is going by Ankle.
oh god i relate. my sister has a 2 year old kid and, despite knowing i'm trans and having told me she ""supports lgbtq+ people as long as they're happy"", calls me ""auntie"" and my deadname. i just stop responding to it, but since she essentially taught my niece to misgender me i don't have much choice 🥲
I feel like she’s being selfish here.

She could have one of her good friends who is a woman to take the “place” as auntie.

Even if she wants her child to have an uncle and an auntie it’s not that important. It’s more important about how you feel about it.

It’s weird how she’s trying to push this on you when she knows that’s you are a transgender male, and she knows it makes you uncomfortable.

She’s only thinking about herself in this situation and how SHE wants her child to have an auntie. Her child is not even born yet.

More than likely her child will just be confused if she doesn’t teach them about transgender people at an early age. She is very entitled even when it makes other people feel horrible.

I’m the end it’s up to you of course but if it makes you uncomfortable or/and dysphoric you should set down a firm word with her and tell her no.
I bet you'll be a cool uncle my niece is and nephews don't know I'm an aunt yet
But honestly all I can say don’t feel bad for what you have to do for what’s best for yourself.
cut her off then
I think you need to make sure your sister understands the seriousness of her request. I’m not sure that is support or “fake” support just to please you but in reality they don’t understand what exactly it is that you are going through. Plus, I have to say this is an exceedingly selfish request. Also, if she says she deserves to have an auntie, why would she ask you and not your brother? You are both men but maybe he is up for it 😫
It’s a very difficult situation, but I think you should completely stick with calling yourself an uncle with the child, and try to talk to your sister about how this is hurtful that she isn’t calling you that when she can.  I took a very long time to come out to my closest friend, and I still spend time educating her on my name, my pronouns, ways I’m comfortable being referred to, and she’s thanked me multiple times for helping her understand.  I spoke to my own sister about calling me my actual name and pronouns and that I wasn’t an “Aunt” and she had questions but nice explanations helped her as well.  I thought my parents would never understand but I spoke to them about how I’d felt, and while they still don’t call me my actual name, they’ve improved a lot and show a lot more care and love now.  Your sister probably needs that education too.  It’s hard to be the only trans person in your family and you’re welcome to ignore this advice if it isn’t right for you, but I do think educating someone you still want a relationship with about your gender can help, and I think being firm about the terms you call yourself is important.
Tell her I have my nephew call me by my gender. I can 100% guarantee, he is not confused. Never has been. I have been his auntie for all 3 years of his life. If my nephew can call me auntie, her kid can call you uncle.

If still unconvinced, tell her it will be adorable when the kid constantly mispronounces ""uncle"" as ""unka"". Like both my niece and nephew have done for my brother.😆
This just shows that she chooses to think of you as a girl and doesn't actually respect you and your identity at all. If she wouldn't insist on a cis man being called auntie it is literally transphobic to call you that.
I think a comment that mentioned that one of her friends can be the auntie will most likely be your best bet. It sounds like she has a picture in her head that is precious to her and gives her hope, and didn't expect the trans thing to change that picture. 

She's clinging to this image at your expense, which is hurtful. The thing is, that image is still possible. It just needs to grow a bit to make space for the messiness of life & relationships.

Your incoming family member will have at least two uncles, and can have aunties beyond siblings. There's a lot of cultures that include non-blood related family as family. 

I think she's scared of losing this ""milestone"" and some communication could let her know that it's not in danger to begin with. (If she's willing to have a heart-to-heart, that is).
It is inconsiderate of her to demand this of you, however it is an opportunity for you to have the ‘not all
boys look like boys and not all girls look like girls’ talk early on with your niece/nephew. 

Sorry it sucks.
Seems fair if you and her kid call her ""Daddy"", and only ""Daddy"".
Refer to her as the baby's ""dad""
oh gosh I feel this so much, my sister for some reason is so adamant that her child calls me uncle instead of just my dead name, which I would prefer because its the less gendered version of the two. and at the end of the day it should be between my nephew and I with what he wants to call me? for years he just called me by my dead name and I found it quite affectionate but recently my sister and mum have made it their mission to make sure he says uncle instead. idek what for.

whenever I have brought it up I get made out to be the one who is overreacting and being too needy. I'm not even out yet to my family but gosh forbid having any right to what you want other people to call you...

feel no obligation to answer but if its okay to ask, what is your ethnicity?
I prefer 'male' pronouns (AFAB) and my in laws who have no understanding etc but are 100% ok with me being an ""uncle"" and being called such by their children.

Aunt, uncle, what does it matter as long as you're a source of love and support?

Being called auntie isn't going to magically make you one if you're an uncle, so I just don't get her point?
Start referring to her as your brother and with male pronouns so she knows what she's doing to you
Man up and be an auntie. It's what any real man would do
I would call her Dad when talking to the baby just because I ""deserve"" it. Like ""Ohh look at your Dad over there"" or stuff like that.
then just be it
[removed]
You can just be what she wants you to be. Just like you are whatever you want to be, seems easy enough.
Just ask your sister if she would rather her children have an uncle or no relation with you at all. Those are the options, do not budge of the matter. 

Your sister is being an entitled asshole and needs a quick shot of reality. Your identity isn't about her, and if you let her win in this matter you're not only harming yourself, but her *and* her kids. If she learns that she can get away with behavior like this, she will inevitably end up as a horror story on r/entitledparents
Tell her that you will be called uncle. This isn’t a thing up for debate. She’s just being an asshole.
Tell her to eff off
I'd tell her to fuck off. She's transphobic and dismissive.
Wtf, so weird, how would that even work?! Lol. Is this new behaviour? Could the pregnancy be sending her crazy?
Tell her to fuck off. 
No but seriously this is so stupid. ""Let me have this one thing"" . 1. This ""thing"" is hurtful 2. its really unnecessary I dont understand why it's such a big deal to her
I completely forget that my nieces and nephews will have to call me something other that Auntie Nae-nae. That's going to be weird.
Explain how that would be confusing to the kid and how and it makes you feel and ask her why she wants to do that and what good would come out of that And I wish you the best of luck!
She does not deserve anything she’s saying from you. By saying she deserves you to be an auntie to her and her kids is stepping all over your identity. I’d say to talk more seriously with her about what and why this isn’t good and if she continues then you cut her off. You can go about it the same way. You DESERVE respect as a trans man, you deserve to be seen as who you are and talked to or mentioned as such.
that’s ridiculous- my brother introduced me as my nephew’s uncle and switched immediately after i came out. she doesn’t get to decide anything- you *deserve* to be gendered correctly by her and your future nephew/niece
Tell her you refuse to be there if she can't stop acting entitled. Maybe before saying that say why can't your brother be the auntie then, if its because he's a boy thing then ask why it's okay for him to be respected but not you.

I would honestly not play her games. It doesn't matter how great this moment is she's being a bitch about this and shouldn't be confusing her children because she wants a perfect life.
Your sister is an undermining idiot who's attempting to raise a child who's as equally obtuse. You present as male, you act masculine, you live your life as a man, for all intents and purposes you are a man.

GI joe, not GI Jane if you will.
She does not deserve that, that's not a thing anyone can demand.
what's her logic here?? like?? how can she *deserve* that? why does she want it anyway? tell her the truth - that it would be very uncomfortable for you, give you dysphoria, *and* confuse the kid. if she won't cave in for your wellbeing, maybe she'll at least do it for the kids?
I feel kind of bad that the first two ideas I came up with are both gaslighting but

 1. You and your family basically have the kid think their parent is just very confused and that you’ve always been uncle (name), maybe make up some story like your sister slipped and banged her head on a cabinet one day and has been confused since.

2. When your around the kid trade names with your brother until your sister gives up.

3. You could just go nuclear and cut off contact but even though I feel bad about the gaslighting ideas it still feels better than cutting off someone.
I'm not even out and my family identifies me as more of an uncle to the kids of the tree. That just sounds like straight disrespect to me.
Does your sister use your current name? If so how on earth does that make sense to her.

""Hey kid, this is my brother Phil, who is your aunt Sarah.""
>What the heck do I tell my sister?

To fuck right off.
Tell her no, just a firm no and you won’t be in the child’s life if you aren’t treated with respect as an uncle.
She “deserves” a big ol’ helping of nothing.
honestly she doesnt really deserve anything by being that rude to began with
Tell her that you will do it only if she allows you to call her father.
Ask her if your brother can be auntie and you be uncle. The reality is she probably wouldnt want that.
Kid can have an auntie if either you or your brother marry a woman. Of she can have the kid refer to one/more of her personal friends as ""auntie"". I'm an auntie to kids who are not biologically related, and had several aunties growing up who were not related to me.

Hint: I don't think this is about ""having an auntie"", this sounds like transphobia to me.
Don’t fuck with her no more simple. You don’t need people like that in your life , she says that she “deserves” this wtf is wrong with her what about what you deserve. I’m so sorry you have to deal with this with someone so close to you .
my niblings call me ""untie"", but I chose that. nobody else gets to choose what you want to be referred to as. you wouldn't call any other man ""auntie"", trans men are men, so why would they even want to call you auntie? doesn't sound like they're as supportive as they said they were. you or your brother might end up with a woman for a partner they can call auntie, or the child's other parent might have a sibling that wants to be called auntie. it's not your responsibility to make yourself uncomfortable for someone else's comfort, even if it's your sister.
""Does that make you the father?"" is what I'd respond.  
""Y'know, since it's opposite year now.""
Tell her that you're actually going to be an uncle and a good one at that :)
I might be wrong, the're might be something else you can do, but IMO, if you've talked with your sister and she won't budge, there's nothing you can do but invoke the nuclear option. Tell her you won't, under any circumstance, be their auntie. You'll either be their uncle (or whatever word you'd prefer), or you won't be anything else. I know it's hard to be this harsh, specially when being as young as 16, but if you aren't your mental health will suffer.
Cant make her do anything sadly so if she wont stop u gotta kick her out of ur life
When I 1st transitioned I was more male looking than female I went to the pool had packer, binder was in the pool with my 6 year old nephew playing football with the kids none of the dads would play with them They called me Aunt Fran Later I became Frank-o my sister said I was embarrassing him I said her fat 400 lbs. & fat husband were more of a embarrassment then me and we never spoke again that is over 5 years ago!!!
my sister too 😔
Absolutely not ok on her part. Would she be OK with the child calling her dad? There is literally no reason you ""need"" to be an auntie. You can be whatever you feel comfortable with. Don't let your sister misgender you over something so triviall.
Yeah, no. Tell her that it’s not acceptable. You have lived your truth for two years now. And she should respect you as such. By the time that kid is even old enough to understand your gender won’t even matter. Kids no good people. Gender is not a factor.
Ask her this: “why can’t one of my brothers be an auntie, then?” The answer is that she doesn’t see you as your true gender she just won’t admit it outright.
Say you’ll compromise and be called “uncly”. Mainly cause it kinda sounds funny
If she doesn’t let you be the uncle, she doesn’t deserve to have you in your life.
Your sister sounds very entitled. Be assertive. Don’t let her treat you poorly. Correct them and her if and when they try to call you auntie. 
The kids will pick up on which one you prefer. 
I worry for her children if she behaves like this, though.
Tell her you won't respond if the kid calls you that. At the end of the day, she needs to respect that you're uncomfortable with being called Auntie. You don't need to feel uncomfortable for her fantasy of ""one of each"". 

&#x200B;

edited for wording
Deserves, my ass! You don't owe her shit.
You tell your sister to go fuck herself and that you'll be whatever the fuck you want to that baby, my exact worlds would be ""i could be the kids grandma for all i care, its not up to you what im comfortable being referred to.""
You tell your sister again that you will not tolerate being called auntie. If she continues to fight after you have explained it all, cut off contact from her. I don't recommend being close with people who don't have your best interest in mind. I will be extremely hurtful to your relationship with one another and might take a toll on your mental health. Good luck out there :)
You can't let what everyone else around you wants dictate who you are. Regardless of her wants or needs, you need to do what's best for you. Don't let her issues ruin things for you.
My neice is about to turn 3. She calls me ""uncle -birth name-"". I have never once called myself that. I feel you.
Have you considered Auntle or Uncie?  Uncie seems like it could be an option to satisfy your feelings of being an uncle and your sisters odd obsession to hear the word auntie lol
tell your sister to have a kid with someone who also has a sister
Tell her she’d make a great uncle
""The one thing she deserves to have"" thats pretty entitled of her to think she deserves something like that. People dont deserve anything if an innocent is uncomfortable or being harmed, its straight up not okay. Having someone suffer for your own selfish and entitled desires is low and she needs to grow up. She can have her best friend be auntie
That's gotta be the wierdest transphobia I've seen in a while. It makes no sense lol, I just know she def doesn't see you as a guy.

She isn't entitled to your frigging gender man, it's completely nonsensical for her to say that she ""deserves this"".

Tell the kids you're a guy but people ""used to think you're a girl"" so ""your mom never learnt I'm actually a guy, silly of her, why don't you try correcting her that I'm your uncle and see if she understands eventually"".
She doesn't deserve to have any hold over your identity. You need to set boundaries with your sister about this. Let her know that's not okay with you, your gender identity is not something for her to play with and make decisions on. And if she wants her and her kids to have a relationship with you, it's as Uncle. If it's auntie, then the relationship is built on lies and will crumble over time.
OK great! So you can be a hip uncle!
She can’t be super supportive if she’s insisting her child calls you auntie instead of uncle. And what does she mean she deserves it? That’s weird. I say do some further digging into that and insist your going to be called uncle.
You aren't male tho. I don't get it
If she can't deal you being the uncle then screw her. You deserve better.
My nephew calls me uncle, sees me as cis and has no idea about my life pre transition and honestly that’s how I prefer it. Your sister is being unreasonable and pretty shitty in my opinion.
Tell her you’re an uncle and thats that
Tell her cool as long as she goes by dad
I'm sorry that is happening to you. My only advice is to maybe ask your parents to help you explain to your sister. I understand your sister is her own person and you shouldn't need to bring your parents in but if she isn't listening to you then your parents could help.
she's being selfish you're going to be your nephew/nieces uncle
Her belief in what she’s “allowed to have,” isn’t your problem, and you should tell her so (albeit more politely).

It would be one thing if it was an item, but you are a living, breathing human being and she doesn’t seem to want to acknowledge that.
You should very plainly and calmly tell her - to see a trans man as an auntie is to not see them as male. If she can’t even do the basics and wants to act so selfish in her want to have a sister then you won’t have anything to do with the baby’s life.
Tell her to go fuck her self
The fuck?

Sounds like your sister isn't supportive but is pretending?

I'd not tolerate anyone intentionally calling me ""daddy"" or ""uncle"" (okay well daddy as a joke would be fine in the right context, but only as a joke). Mistakes happen, of course, and that's fair, but this is just... WTF?!
Tell her you're the kid's uncle, not auntie. If she can't compromise on this, maybe have a sit down with her and ask her why she says she's fine with calling you by your correct name & pronouns, but can't grasp this concept?
Damn, absolutely not. Your sister doesn't ""deserve"" to misgender you just because she's dropping a sprog.

Say you're going to be uncle or not be in this kids life.

That's what I would do.

Edit: She'd also be literally raising her kid to be transphobic and to disrespect trans identities. 100% make an ultimatum. 

I'm a 30 year old trans man and came out at around your age - people will take any chance to disrespect your identity they can. Don't show any sign of weakness.
her wanting a picture perfect family being more important than your identity says a lot about her imo. it feels gross that she puts what looks best on photo before a persons identity and emotions.
It’s because she’s always loved the idea of her kid having an auntie and an uncle but because me and my brother are the only siblings she expects me to take up the role as auntie because I’m trans and my brother is cis. It is really weird and I don’t get it lmao.
""I support you, but I won't use the right pronouns and will deadname you for the rest of your life"" - my mom.

Same logic.
This needs to be higher🤣
this is the funniest thing I've read in my life
Entitlement!
If she wants to call you whatever the hell she wants regardless of how disrespectful it is to you, then she doesn't even deserve you in her life bro
This makes it sound like she thinks op getting called male terms is a sacrifice she has to make, and she ""deserves"" to be able to tell her kids what to call him.

No. That's not how it works.
Having a baby is so easy that we, as humans, have dedicated a lot of work, time, and technology to **avoid** it for centuries.

I really can't understand why people are proud of it and why they should deserve anything just for letting nature take its course.

(raising a kid is different)
This is the way.
Your gender isn't up for debate. Its not something you ""get to have"" as a treat. It's who you are. There's no compromises on that. And other people simply don't have claim to your gender.
This is beautifully put!

Ironically this advice seems to come from people who think exactly that… at least towards cis people, idk. I see this on like, EVERY post that discusses cis people misgendering trans people. Shitty advice really
You are totally correct!
this is reminding me of a post where someone said their parent still refers to him as she/her and in the reply had a picture of him looking like the manliest man ever with a full on beard and everything. can't imagine the looks the parents get in public when they still insist on being transphobic...
What social consequences would she face in this case? Babies have no concept of gender or language; they’ll call OP Auntie without question, and if OP pretends that’s cool with him then his other family members will reinforce that by also calling him Auntie in front of this child.

OP needs to take a hard stance and make sure his entire family is aware that he does not accept that title nor is he comfortable with them calling him Auntie in any context. If they’re gonna be transphobic then make sure they know what they’re doing is incredibly offensive and painful. If that doesn’t work then it’s ultimatum time “your kid can have an uncle or they can have nothing.”
zamn bro, that’s terrible. it’s your right to correct someone if they dead name you. I don’t know what your relationship with your sister is but whenever my sister deadnames me or misgenders me I ALWAYS correct her. you deserve to be treated better. maybe talk to her in private about how you’re uncomfortable with it.
I’ve just got a white family but I think it’s just taken a while for my family to get what my gender means to me. My sister has always just valued the relationship between two sisters and she’s not really accepting the fact that she’s got no sisters…
God, so sorry to hear this. We have a niece and nephew who see us once a year, unlike their mom’s cis hetero brothers who see them weekly. Nothing quite as traumatic as watching adults groom children to be bigots like themselves. Hope that kid and you can develop a fantastic relationship in spite of this!
Don't weaponize gender. All this does is frame respect of one's gender as a privilege that can be taken away as punishment. It's not a privilege. It's a right. Violating that right for any reason is not okay.
Thats just not true. It took one night for Nazis to burn decades of transgender reaearch that we can never get back. People shouldn't have to wait for the slow crawl of progress when it can all go away over night because of bigots like his sister who want to erase his manhood and impose an incorrect label on him.
You telling someone who you are is not the equivalent of them telling you who you are. One is the subject identifying an aspect of themselves only they can truly know, the other is someone trying to force their perception of the subject onto them. I get what you were going for but bad take.
Those aren't even close to the same thing. His sister doesn't get to dictate his identity. You can't ""teach the new generation"" when that generation's parents are perpetuating the problem.

100% unrelated, learned recently that through my moms relationship with her current fiance, i am technically my best friends aunt. I am older than my friend by a single grade-
Tell her to have one of her friends be called auntie 😝 you can have people that aren't blood related be auntie and uncle to you.i have a few that I think of in that way
Tell her that she can make your brother be the auntie if she has to have one, see what she thinks of that. If she's against that then you can point out she's just reducing you to your assigned gender and if she actually accepted your transition then there'd be no reason to pick you to be auntie instead of your brother.
Tell her that your brother can be ""auntie"" if she needs to have one auntie and one uncle. Or tell her that if you have kids they will call her uncle, because they ""deserve"" to have 2 uncles.

Honestly it's so fucking stupid, I have 5 aunts and no uncles by blood. Not once have I given any shits about if I have aunts or uncles.
Bro tell her to have ur brother be called auntie instead. Same thing, ur both guys
yea that’s annoying lol, that would make the kid very confused. I doubt the kid will care if they have an auntie and an uncle anyways lol
She should help one of you get a gf so she can have an auntie( only if one of you was interested of course)
Say ""OK, so my brother will be an auntie, and I will be an uncle"".  


If she says that doesn't work or that it's ridiculous or anything like that, ask why and listen to her answer.  


As I said in another comment, it sounds like she doesn't see you fully as a guy. This seems like one way to confront that fact without accusing her of anything.
Damn tough luck, my son has only uncles I'm not forcing one of my brothers to go by auntie because of this, she needs to grow up
People are suggesting you say your brother can be the auntie but I would go a step further and see if he would play along for your sake
Well she can have an auntie if you or your brother marry a woman, but at this point you should just both marry men out of spite so she gets 4 uncles and no aunties.
>because me and my brother are the only siblings she expects me to take up the role as auntie because I’m trans and my brother is cis

Convince your brother to be the auntie, problem solved!
tell her that you're not gonna be either if her fantasy is more important than your feelings
Tell her to get over herself lol, lots of people don't have an auntie and uncle. She's invalidating you.
Tell her that that makes as much sense as having her call your brother auntie.
Tell her to call your bro auntie, because it makes just as much sense (no sense)
If you have a chance to do so in a way you're comfy, maybe tell her that she's not entitled to her fantasy if that fantasy interferes with another person's life? While fantasies & dreams aren't problematic in a vacuum, its def pretty poopy to insist on committing behaviour (& raising a kid to do the same) that has the effect of disregarding another person's existence. Hope things go well, good luck figuring out the situation :)
Shy she didn't ask your brother,  my guess is that she didn't see you fully as a man but as someone in between who identifies as man. Some ""allies"" have that conception on their heads, and get angry when confronted about it.
no. your brother can be auntie if she needs one of each lol
Ask your brother if he’d like to be ‘auntie’? Which may at the least get your family on board with telling her she’s being an idiot. Although if he’s on board, that would solve your problem in the most hilarious and annoying for your sister way possible.
I would ask my cis brother to take the auntie role and maybe then it would put into perspective how weird her request is lol
Your sister has options, but doesn't want to exercise them.  She needs to shift her perspective, and I'm sorry that your transition has not been enough for her to do that.

Both of my parents were only children.  I had multiple ""aunts and uncles"", and they were all specially chosen for the job.  Your sister could create a curated roster of aunties who all would be excited to have the role.
I only have aunties. Well technically I have an uncle but according to my mum he did some bad stuff that I'll hear about once I turn 16. I've never forgotten that she said that. If someone asked me to be... Well I don't have siblings but say be their niece when I'm their nephew, I'd just hate that. Why does she want that so bad? It doesn't matter at all. I don't think a kid would complain about 2 uncles. I don't complain about having multiple aunts.
There is also the possibility that you or your brother might marry someday and then she could have the kid call them their auntie... that is if you are into female identifying people and/or your brother is... I actually have been going through this from her side... sort of. My one of my husband's siblings is a Trans man and I have known him since he was 10 and identified as a girl. He has been transitioning since my daughter was about 2 so she has little memory of calling him ""aunt"" and has learned to call him uncle. It was more awkward for me, having known him as a her for so many years... but my kid is totally unfazed. I think your sister is maybe still harboring feelings of the loss of a sister and the concept of an auntie for her child is how she is holding on to those feelings. I haven't seen a lot of discussion about this but it is something I hope to talk more about... as a family member who supports and loves their Trans family member it can still be hard to in a sense loose the person you knew before... there is a grieving process that has to be gone through... I love my brother in law and I know that he is happier this way but I also miss the little girl I watched grow up... maybe your sister feels similarly. Maybe you should have a talk with your sister and ask her what she is feeling. Let her know how you feel and that like pronouns familial titles need to reflect our gender identity. Transitioning is a process for the Trans person for sure but it is also a process for the people who love them. I wish you luck.
I say tell her that her kid will have two uncles or else she (your sister) will only have one sibling
Tell her to ask your brother if he can be auntie instead.
Ask her if she'd ask your brother to be the auntie then. If not ask her why you're different.
People know they’re supposed to be supportive but don’t want to actually BE supportive smh
This, tell her she's not entitled to you or to call you anything. She doesn't ""deserve"" to call you anything but what you tell her to call you. 

You correct her everytime she says it. ""Uncle, Uncle, I'm their Uncle""

""Why would I go through all this to be a man, for you to think I wanna be called auntie?"" Wtf?
Massive entitlement
I mean people can be happy and proud about a lot of stuff, even if it's not hard or challenging to achieve, I don't see a problem with that. However being proud of something doesn't entitle you to anything.
Wanted to say this but didnt want it to come off the wrong way.
Why would this be more effective than just saying you’re not an auntie?
Lmao this. Dunno why a baby is having a baby
Right? I’m reminded of the quip I saw “the waitress thinks you have dementia, Dad, I have DD’s” 😄
I was thinking of the trans guy who’s family hadn’t seen him in a while and told him that he’d have to wear a dress to his siblings wedding. Little did they know, a few years of testosterone, and the OP of that story had bulked out, grown body hair and just generally looked like a big hairy cis man. He wore the dress. His parents then got butthurt bc he “made them look stupid “ 

Sometimes people gotta learn the hard way
It's the only way some people will listen. It's fairly harmless to ops sister other than being annoying and will make her think twice. She doesn't view gender identity and pronouns the same way a trans person does. If it works it works
so, what you want is to dictate what people should believe?  sounds familiar ;-)

No problem, anytime
Uncle Joey from Full House^
Can confirm, I only have two aunts but I call roughly 6 people “auntie” and 5 of them aren’t related to me (I call one of my aunts her name)
Chinese-American here. Pretty much all of my parents' friends from college or their early 20s are my aunties and uncles. No shame in that at all!
yeah i had my aunt patty not blood related at all but her and her clan were my moms chosen family.
THIS RIGHT HERE! One of my best female friends had a baby and she said that I'm uncle Charlie! So you definitely don't need to be related. If your sister wants an auntie that badly tell her to make her best friend into auntie. Trying to push this on you is incredibly disrespectful and feels like she does not actually support you as much as she says she does.
Absolutely this! My grandma had this guy she spent a lot of time with, not sure if they were in some kind of relationship or just good friends, but it always seemed very close. She always called him ""uncle [last name]"" in front of us kids, so that's who he was (to a point that when my father told me that he had passed, by saying ""grandpa [first name] passed"", it took me half a minute to realise what he meant). Seems to generally be a thing in some places that children are taught that adults (blood related or not) can be referred to as auntie or unkle
two of my moms best friends, one of them sadly passed, we’re always called our aunts. they’ve been in my sisters and my life since birth and have known my mom since around high school. one of the women, the one who passed, has 6 kids and all of them were and are like family to us. so yeah OP’s sister def could have that.
this is great lol, perfectly brings out the transphobia that his sister probably has deep down inside
Plus op's brother doesn't need to be reaffirmed about his gender the same way trans people do
Exactly! If the sister really isn't secretly biased, it really shouldn't matter which of her brothers gets called this. If she insists on it for OP specifically, that's sus af
Get the other brother in on it if he's willing 😆
This !! Best advice ever !!
haha yes 🤣🤣
Parents seem to think they have that for some reason. They dont, they are insignificant in the grand scheme
You're right: it's not a problem as long as it does not interfere with other people's life. But pride and entitlement are often linked, and problems start with entitlement.

I, personally, am never proud of something that does not require at least a little bit of skill or effort to be done. If one is proud of breathing every 5sec, I guess it must be a very satisfying life, but I can only guess ;)
I have no problem coming off the wrong way! Lol
It only works if the person is supportive and it's being employed as a subtle, ""Hey, you said the wrong thing,"" in place of correcting them. Even if that's how you are using it, it should be agreed upon by both parties that it's okay.

If someone isn't supportive, or fakes their support, they'll only be annoyed and angered and take away what I said previously.

From the sound of the post their sister is faking support. The only lesson they'll take away is that properly gendering and naming someone is a privilege. It's not a privilege it's right. If we want others to respect that right we have to respect it too.
r/confidentlyincorrect
Thats not what this is though. Accepting your brother as a man and accepting your sister as a transphobe aren't comparable.
Exactly this! My kid has my wife's brother and sister as an auntie and uncle but also a friend of theirs that they grew up with thats her Funkle (the fun uncle). Having some faith in the kid is a bit important too though. My younger sister has always deadnamed me and ""uncled"" me extra since I came out and its been years. Her daughter and mine are super close though and she just told my niece one day that she has two moms and she just rolled with it and went back to playing. Little kids haven't learned to be assholes yet and watching the defeat in your siblings face when the kid won't subscribe to their transphobe BS is hilarious and super satisfying 🤣
😏
You don't owe anyone respect who isn't respecting you. I'm not getting into an argument about it anyway, just what I would do, peace ✌️

Gender is not up to a matter of belief. People are the gender they identify as. It’s that simple, that’s a fact, and any disagreement is built only on conservative delusion. It’s just as silly as saying the earth is flat. It’s rejecting outright fact.
Yeah see I went into your profile to see if you were a troll or something, and it's really just so many posts fetishizing us and pictures of your anus that I'm starting to think maybe you aren't worth arguing with.
[removed]
What’s make believe about it? Gender is psychological. This is the medical consensus. People are the gender they identify as, you could not disprove it with millions of dollars of funding.

1. Not a man
2. Genuinely, what are you trying to do here?"	ts4bij	trans	2122	0.94	2022-03-30 11:30:19
Parents found the skirt drawer	So, basically, I get home from my friends house at like 1:20 am. I don’t expect my parents to be awake, but my stepdad is, and immediately confronts me about some clothes he found under my bed (all skirts, thigh high socks, etc). Basically he makes me explain to him that I wear them (pretty obvious IMO) and wouldn’t admit that’s it’s super weird he cares about this. Not sure why I have to explain it to them, but I pass it off as just crossdressing, still embarrassing but luckily they’re not smart enough to realize I’m trans from it. Anyways, just wanted to vent a tad bit, not having the best day because of it 😅 how are y’all doin?	"I'm sorry to hear that this happened don't let it break you. stay strong! I hope your day gets better
SO IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A SKIRT AND THIGH HIGHS DRAWER

...interesting
This could potentially be a blessing in disguise! My girlfriend “caught me” twice: first she found some of my lingerie and later she discovered photos of myself in drag. Both times I pretended it was a crossdressing fetish, but it also forced me to open up to her. Ultimately I came out to her as trans, but I doubt I ever would have gotten there if those situations hadn’t forced my hand.
I'm so happy that you're safe! Take care of yourself and your stuff!
Fuck your dad. Sorrynotsorry
I had the same thing happen as a teenager. A few months later I was being obnoxious and digging through my my dads stuff and found his own stash of cross dressing cloths. Something about stones and glass houses...
I was always so paranoid of that I used to hide all my stuff in a dead pc tower
My mum found my lingerie the other day 😳
that kinda shit can be so traumatic, im sorry that happened OP. im still scarred from when my parents confronted me after finding my myspace page in high school 😂
My first question is why are they rummaging through your clothes? That would irritate me if my family did that
That was an opportunity to come out! Hope it works out. Did they keep your stuff?
As a parent, this makes me so sad. As if you don’t have enough to deal with navigating the waters as a young person. Does wearing a skirt or thigh high socks change who you are at your core? Are you a kind, generous, forgiving person who has convictions? If the answer is yes, then you are a parent’s dream.
That sucks that things work out like that. It's most unfortunate. I remember asking my mom to buy me a purse when I was 10, surprisingly she did. And at 15 I asked her to buy me a pair of heels while we were shopping because I was too embarrassed to buy them myself at the register, and she did. I say these things because my hope is that someday, when you're ready, you'll have the courage to just tell them this is who you are and nothing can change that regardless if they ""approve"" or not. You do not need anyone's approval to be who you are. While it would be very comforting and relieve you of anxiety to have your parent's ""approval"", you simply don't need it to be you. No one can change who you are, so don't pretend to be someone you're not. Like I said, this is all when YOU are ready, not when you think they'll be ready to hear what you have to say. I hope this helps you in some way, even if it's only a little. 😘
Hugs to you.  I'm nearly fifty and my parents have both passed.  I remember being in high school when my mom found my pantyhose, womens jeans and bra tucked away under the bed.  Interesting discussion. And then a girlfriend in college did the same.  And later my wife when I finally came out and decided to transition.  

It does get better.  Is it safe for you to use this at all as an opportunity to have a frank discussion with your parents about your needs? Would they be supportive given time?
I'm a cosplayer so I always just kept my stuff in plain sight and no one questioned anything.
I was in the exact same position as you and played it off as crossdressing, only to regret not just coming out when my mom found my clothes. Took me 2 years to work up the courage to tell her it was more than just crossdressing.

Idk if you feel ready/safe to come out, but if you're on the fence about it I'd say just rip the bandaid off now while it's still fresh.

Also, if they were cool with you crossdressing then I'm willing to bet they'll be okay with you being trans.
That’s an invasion of your privacy. Remember this.
SNEAKY TRANS SOUNDS
Geesh fuck that. You gotta get out as soon as you can hun
I’m sorry to hear that, I hope that your situation improves. No offence, but your dad sounds like a knobhead
I got a skirt in my clothes cupboard where it wont be obvious that they are there😋😝
Hugs 🤗
I know this is a serious post and I definitely feel for you sis, plus I totally panicked after my mom outed me to my dad, but I need to know.. is the format supposed to be like “mom found the piss jar” (just for my own mental health)
My personal history would be screaming don't get in the car with folks going anywhere.  That trip changed my life very much badliest.  Be careful bcs some folks do some messed up things to ""save their kid"".  Probably nothing, but my own shadows, but I wouldn't wish them on an enemy.  TC
""Not smart enough to realize I'm trans from it."" What?
I still need to think of a good hiding spot for my clothes when I return for the summer... my parents love to search.
You just described my childhood.
Why the fuck parents think it's okay to search their kids rooms. This ain't prison
Hey you do you bby💚 find out where you belong. PLS never regret anything that makes you smile (something doesn't hurt anyone obviously) and in this case that is harmless. I'm so sorry for that harassment. 

Continue on your journey of self discovery & self love. I'm here for you💚💚💚😇

 I'm sure you look lovely in those clothes. Much love pumpkin 😻 😘
Cosplay/ Halloween/ it’s a dare/ my friends dared me to do it or something along the lines of that can be good excuses if it comes up again
When I was still in the closet and this happened to me. They asked: “Why do you have women’s underwear?” And without skipping a beat I went “ Because I’m a pervert.” And then I just thought “Oh shi-“
That happened to me too... altough my mom knew right away what was up... that was not a fun way to come out.
[deleted]
I'm so sorry that they even care in the first place, I also cant even imagine what its like to have parents who go through my things, I forget how privileged I am when it comes to that. Hopefully you have or will meet friends who can help you and be supportive.
this is the “mum found the piss drawer” of being trans..

anyway hope ur doing ok sweetie, can’t of been fun, also hope you at least had some cute skirts in there, much love
lol I remember when I was a kid and I used to dream of the day I was an adult, so I could buy woman's clothes.
I hope everything works out ok. I got caught crossdressing as a teenager by my mom. She never let me forget it. She knows that my wife has put me in chastity and diapers and is very amused by it. But I’ve never gotten over how she belittled me when I was young
i couldn't find a bigger oof even if i played roblox
I made my mum buy me a binder in February (she had no idea what it did) and I wear it a few times a week and my dad realised I was wearing something A MONTH later and both of them still can't figure out that I'm trans for better or worse :')
at least you didn't get kicked out of your room, all your electronics taken away, and almost kicked out of the house

(thats what happened to me when they found my crossdressing clothes)
mine found the piss drawer ☹
... soooooo curious... they're ok if you cross dress,  but not if your trans? That's weird
I haven't got much male clothing yet.  My sister was asking me why I was wearing boxers.  I told her it's none of her business and told her to fuck off.  (can't stand her anyways) So then she comes in a couple days later to our room and goes hey do you like these shorts?  (they're boxer briefs with some sort of pattern on them)  I'm like those are underwear.  She goes no I wear them as shorts at camp something you wouldn't know about.  Like who tf wears boxer briefs as shorts?!
So when I first read that title, I thought it was about a person who draws skirts onto public restroom signs. I don’t know why. 

Anyway, I’m sorry your dad was a git about it. I don’t understand why anyone cares. Did he think you were secretly a cam girl? Like, that’s the only reason a parent should care what clothing their minor is wearing — if they think it’s related to prostitution.
One of the most liberating moments I’ve had on this path to self-realization was Contrapoints saying, “these aren’t women’s clothes...they’re my clothes.”

Whether your clothes are women’s clothes or not doesn’t even matter, they’re yours. That’s your identity to choose. 

With all due respect, and in the words of Richard Pryor, your parents (stepdad especially) “can have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.”

Good vibes, Op. You’re a total badass.
What kind of a retard interrogates their stepchild about something as innocuous as clothing? Sorry that happened.
That happened to me but after I came out to them and they didn’t accept me
Stay strong? Your parents will never be convinced because you are mentally ill and need to be treated!
When I was younger I had a message written out for anyone who went through my stuff. Something like, ""you're the weird one for going through my stuff, enjoy what you see."" 
Right next to the several pages of b/w yaoi. (Folded up) What an uproar when my bitch step mom found that lmao 

People who snoop through other ppls stuff. Yuck.
I once would keep a decoy ‘porn and drugs’ box in front of the ‘skirts and dresses stolen from Walmart’ box never had the horror of someone finding either one though 😖
(888) 932-6360
I decided to grow my hair out a teny tiny little bit, and my parents threw a fit, I just want it a bit longer than normal, not even lower than my neck
Thank you (´ω｀)
Hid it in a lava lamp box How'd they find it smh ✋😓
Nah, I just need a whole drawer for that sort of thing, I like my fem clothing separated 🤣
Bahahaha, all the awards I don't have to give
I just got my first thing of thigh highs today, feeling nice tho-
I have one but it's because I have work and casual wear seperated.
for me it's an under bed skirt world lol. i think everyone here hes one of those gender affirming stash
I personally like to ""store"" them on plastics bags and hide them in other clothes or literally inside blankets.
I’m just not sure if I want to tell my parents at all about this. They’re super pushy and don’t take my concerns seriously, so I’m not inclined to believe they’ll react well to me being trans.
Did that affect your relationship at all?
Is she still your girlfriend ?
Thanks!!! You too!!!
Dw I felt the same way !
Damn did you talk to him about that?
That's a good idea.  If I had a PC at home I would do that s I plan to have a dual monitor set up.  The dead PC would ""run the other monitor""  no one in my family would know the difference since they're really stupid when it comes to tech.
If only I had one, not a bad idea
Omg I absolutely love your username 🤣 and I’m just glad I don’t have anything dirty or explicitly trans! That could’ve gone much worse. Hope your parents are accepting
Luckily I’m very low key with social media, so my parents will never find out
I would love to know but it was very late and I had work early this morning... I did not even find the time to ask between them lecturing me
I know, it was just super awkward and sudden and I’m not sure I want to be open with my parents since I don’t have any place to go I things go badly. And no, thankfully they didn’t take anything, unless they do it while I’m at work
I wish I could say I was a good kid, but that’s not really the case. I acted out really badly though middle school and high school, and haven’t really repaired my relationship with my parents since then either. It’s just difficult for me to talk to ppl who ignore my anxiety and start yelling/arguing when I criticize them at all.
It’s nice to hear some encouragement, thank you ☺️
I’ll have to see about that. But i can’t repress myself any longer, I don’t have the energy for it
Not quite open with my desire to cosplay yet, I wish I had your confidence!
I’m thinking about this but I need to make plans first, just to be safe. Thank you for telling me this though, I definitely don’t want to repress myself any longer.
I will. If they continue like this I will leave.
This was my entire life at home growing up. Nothing but a long, continuous invasion of privacy.
(´ω｀)
Thank you, I will try to soon
He seemed like less of a knobhead before last night, ngl 😅
Here’s hoping you have less nosy parents than me
Yes it was based on that 🤣 I don’t know why but it’s the first thing that came to my mind when I woke up this morning lmao
I haven’t hid my being trans terribly well... I just don’t think they’re intuitive enough to notice that sort of thing.
Try behind a drawer or shelf that doesn’t move normally
I had a few too many pairs of socks and skirts for that unfortunately
Damn.... glad I didn’t word it like that 🤣 that dysphoria do be hittin tho, ngl
Damn how did she know? Were there obvious signs?
Didn’t think about it like that but yes I did 🤣
Of course, even a Japanese schoolgirl outfit or two, just to be safe
Hm? Is this a helpline?
Lava lamp box?  Definitely looking for drugs😜
Lol I hide mine in my carry case for my Warhammer Figures, since they have absolutely no reason to touch it
I know what you are talking about! I used to have a similar drawer just with all my girl stuff. Then in time it became 2 drawers, then the whole dresser, then my closet too, and now I no longer own any of my old boy clothes! But I can’t imagine how mortified I would have been if my parents saw it, let alone confronted me about it!
Congrats!!! Enjoy em!!
Perhaps not now, but you might want to tell them eventually, and this could make it easier because it won’t be as big of a surprise. You know them best, and situations like this can be revealing on what their views are or how they’ll react. You might be able to slowly open up over time by talking about it with them more. Coming out is YOUR decision and you don’t need to tell them anything if you don’t want to, but try to stay positive because even low moments like this can have a positive result in the end!
It did for a while. The first instance, she felt really shocked and weirded out, and we had to talk through it a lot (plus she thought the lingerie belonged to another girl and that I was cheating, so there were trust issues as well). I felt like it was a dark cloud hanging over us for a while but it eventually evaporated and we rarely discussed it. The second time was less of a shock but it forced me to open up to her more and explain what I was going through. Both times I revealed a little more about myself, which allowed me to start wearing leggings around her, using nail polish, and shaving my body hair. By the time I came out to her as trans, she kind of was expecting it by then and she was super supportive!
Yes, and she’s totally supportive of my transition!
I'll forever feel that about anyone that's so disgusting. This took me back to my teenage years and what an awful feeling having to be confronted like that.
He was a born-again Christian so he was filled with so much shame that he could never talk about it. He was stuck on me invading his privacy and disrespecting him as the man of the house (mind you my mom brought in 90% of the income.)
So frustrating, what is there even to lecture you about? Deflecting from his invasive behavior to project his toxic shit :( I hope you feel safe one day soon to be open in your identity to anyone you wish to share it with. You deserve to feel safe as you be♥️
erring on the side of caution is always a good move, I'm glad they're seemingly cool with the 'crossdressing' cover. May your luck hold up until you're able to live openly!
If my mum took women's clothes off of me I'd lose it since I buy them myself I'm assuming you do too
Acting out in middle school and high school is par for the course! Did your parents ever want to know the underlying reason for acting out?? At those ages until you’re about 25 you REQUIRE parental intervention and guidance to keep your actions (mental health?) in check. Do my kids hate me sometimes?? Of course. It’s expected. If they do something inherently wrong I will call them out on their shit. That’s my job. But they always know that behind the complete bitch I can be, is a parent who will ALWAYS support them, guide them and love them, and never shame them for the individuals they are.
You are most welcome young lady ☺
I'm not saying this is a perfect solution, but if they have problems maybe you can ask to see a gender therapist? It helps to sometimes have an ally on your side advocating for you, and the therapist might also help explain options to you and provide access to other providers depending on where and when you to further explore options. 

Good luck.  I'm sorry you have to navigate this.  It's hard, but it does get better.
Just something to mull over, i know you got a lot on your mind...

what if you used this event as an opportunity ""test the waters"" if you will, and talk to your parents and say you wanted to be a cosplayer; you were just to embarrassed to bring it up to them and you froze when they asked you about it. 

Best case scenario, it's an easy step for them to understand, it allows you some space and understanding from your parents when you need to ""try out an outfit"" perhaps? hopefully, this would alleviate some tension until you can move out?

Worst case scenario might be that they call your bluff, and you out yourself to them. I am 33 now, but I remember those ""can you come into the living room for a minute? we need to talk about something"" talks. oh, lord they were the worst. I do not envy where you are right now. As such, though, I recognize that if you did try to use the cosplay angle, I would want to make sure you are in a safe spot to do so if that conversation goes poorly. Parents who have a tendency to parent in an authoritarian way can often discipline fiercely. I hope your parents are more understanding than this.
I... hmm. That might not be a good idea depending on your situation. Trust me, living with shit parents is marginally better than being homeless. I’d recommend you maintain a support network just in case, though.
We all have “those” days.. ahaha
Rereading it now I think it made sense.  I thought the clothes made you trans, like physically changed you, which was kind of confusing.  Obviously you mean they weren't smart enough to realize you were trans because of the clothing.  Carry on.
Queeeeeeeen
Hopefully
That reminds me that my mom took my weed and gave to her not-boyfriend so he could smoke it :(
Stg... just so uncomfortable :/ kinda wish they’d just left it alone and assumed I was crossdressing themselves but I need to spell everything out for them...
Thank you, I’ll see about telling them after I make sure I have a place to stay if it goes badly
That’s pretty cool. I know that a lot of the times it’s hard to maintain previous relationships after coming out as trans, especially if your partner is straight.
Wow that’s good don’t see a lot of those stories ending well!
Yeah... my parents are pretty bad with the way they confront me. They basically ignore my anxiety and ruin my day when they do it.
Damn that sounds like some deep repression. Hopefully you don’t live there still?
Yh, hearing that annoyed me. What is there to lecture about? And why did their dad question them about the clothes, none of his business.
Thank you!!
Yeah, same
Thank you for this
That is something I need to look into, thank you for bringing that up!
Lol np I describe things in a weird way 🤣
Had an Aunt angrily tell me she had confiscated some of my weed (about a joints worth) when I stayed with them as a teen. Like, come on, this was (is) one of my favorite aunts. I would have totally shared. 

Edit: she was totally right to be mad, we were on a trip across state lines, and I didn’t tell her I had weed...
“Ugh, Mom and Dad, obviously I need that stuff in order to do Femboy Fridays! You don’t know about Femboy Fridays? Everyone does Femboy Fridays now, I can’t believe you haven’t heard of it.”
Well the only good thing is that it does create some context for when you do come out. My parent never had a clue I had been dressing since I was 7. So they were a little caught off guard when I came out. But this also could be an opening for you since you have to explain yourself to them anyways, might as well get it over with rather than having to explain again that you’re trans and what that means. But that of course would be only if you are comfortable and ready to! Otherwise it’s not worth it!
Good answer. Have a plan in case things go south.
Your parents are the ones with the problem. Don't let them make you feel anxious about who you are. Good luck! 💙
I’m 36 with my own family but that repression regressed my own progress about 20 years before I could face I might not be CIS. He’s long dead but his shame haunted me for a long time. It’s part of the reason I am anti-theist.
I'm going to buy a really cute outfit on Friday only thing that annoys me is my mum won't let me go out in girlmode
Also if you can't speak to your parents directly about it then you could try composing a letter and leaving it for them. And if they continue to give you a hard time then maybe it's time to leave home. 

Trust me, repressing this is the worst possible outcome.
I didn't exactly tell my mom either... but it's my personal opinion that I'm an adult and she shouldn't go through my room, even if her lying, thieving, _not_ -boyfriend tells her he smelled weed in my room.

On the awesome side though, I thought she'd found it all- which would've been like $10ish of unpacked buds and one joint, but then I found the joint and a small bud that I'd put in a plastic bag the last time I smoked.

She confiscated my pipe though, so I can't exactly smoke that unless I get another one or learn how to roll joint...
So u hate Christians?
I’m sorry to hear that, is there any way you could sneak out of the house in girlmode though? I’ve changed at someone else’s before I went out too, maybe you could try that?
My wife won’t let me out either until she can divorce me.
Make a water bottle bong
Get a rolling machine. Little tiny gadget, weed goes between the rollers, paper in top, filter at one end, lick and stick, BOOM perfect every time. Cost you about 3 bucks. The finer you grind the more perf your doob will be. Old hippie here, I know whence I speak ❤️
Anti-theists hate the sin, not the sinners
Anttheists:People who don't believe in God/gods but would murrder them and topple their thrones if they showed up. As for other humans, we good. Humans aren't what were against.
Yeah I guess I'm home alone a lot so there's nothing stopping me
She's a bitch do what you want who cares what she thinks
i'll prob try that tbh
Oh makes sense, thanks
I wish you luck!

Look at this bullshit		"i don't understand, what is this?
They can make you register, but they can't stop you from dodging a draft.

Edit: Do as you wish. I'm not taking any chances with the military. I'm leaving if there's a draft.
If the US ever actually started drafting people, trans people would be the least of their worries, they would not know or care if you dodged the draft
I would just say that I’m severely suicidal. Why draft someone who can’t be trusted around a gun?


Also, old enough to get shot. Not old enough to make decisions about your body. Fuck this country.
Wait what is this in the USA? Why am I forced to sign up for the draft if this country won’t let me live the way I want. I have no interest in the military or a draft.
fine I’ll just girlboss my way through the military
I fucking hate the phrase “identifies as a gender”. Like,  yeah of course I identify as that gender, cause that’s what I fucking am. It’s always used to basically imply that we chose this later in life.
The whole selective service is a vestigial load of crap. It doesn't serve any practical purpose, the government already knows who all the fighting-age ""males"" are, this is just a jingoist social ritual designed to remind you of your obligation to the state. Registering doesn't make you suddenly subject to some hypothetical draft, because there is no draft and if they ever do have one again they WON'T use Selective Service rolls to fill it. The last time we had a draft, it was the source of only 10% of draftees, and would be even less today.

That said, this nonsense justifying the claim that the executive cannot simply choose to change the definition of who they will require to register is misleading. The whole reason we are even still required to register is because in 1980, JIMMY CARTER brought it back with Presidential Proclamation 4771 and set the very terms cited on this page, including the language of ""male citizens...born on or after January 1, 1960..."" This language is NOT in the 1917 law (obviously). This page is lying.

There is probably a good reason that the executive shouldn't change the definitions, mainly that the next admin could just change them back. But UNLESS congress acts, this discretion rests squarely with the president.

And if you ask me, we should either require everyone to register, or abolish the system.
Not them invalidating trans women by saying trans men aren't required. Hell invalidates both sides smh. I'm so done with all this
Does an amendment to a birth certificate not mean 'hey the old one is wrong, ignore it and read this one'? There is absolutely no reason to go off of a no longer legally valid document for the sole purpose of drafts
jokes on them, I’m too mentally unstable to be drafted
Considering the amount of SA and violence that goes on in the military, I think I'll pass. Fleeing the country sounds more pleasant.
They can draft me all they want, I refuse to kill or assist in killing for the United States
Selective service is dumb anyways.
Ladies chill, having served already I can guarantee the military does not want us in their ranks with all of the additional surgeries, medications and needs specific to us.

Worse that can happen is you go, and get disqualified early in the process. If you make it to boot camp it would be a miracle at all.
What the hell is this?! I hope someone here gets that reference lol. But seriously, WHAT?! If gender is really what matters here then you’re just practically saying women don’t matter on any plane of reality what so ever!
Tbh I don’t think selective service is enforced. I did it because I was afraid I’d be arrested at the time if I didn’t but I know plenty of people who had no idea they had to do it/ just didn’t do it.
Dont worry, they don't pick us
Just a reminder that the draft is literal slavery and needs to be abolished.
I remember after I finished everything, I called to have myself removed from the draft. They told me they couldn't and when I pressed, they said the government doesn't recognize transgender people and until they do, mtf are stuck on the draft and can be drafted.
i'll never risk my life to fight for a damn oil company. they'd have to throw me in jail cause i'd never go
I always thought that was ridiculous. But euphoria moment, I found out I was automatically registered for the selective service when I legally changed my gender to male! I'm not worried though, I'd be able to use HRT and my mental health diagnoses to disqualify me if I somehow do get drafted. Also for context, in my state (Illinois) if you're listed as a male between the ages of 18 and either 25 or 30 (I can't remember lol) you're automatically registered when you go to get a drivers license or state ID, so it's got me wondering if a trans woman would be taken off the registry if she changes her gender on her ID, since I was registered when I changed mine.
I would never die for the people running this shit show country. They need to be thrown out there on the front lines and fight it out themselves if they wanna fight.
Is this recent? I changed my name/gender marker 1.5 yrs ago and received my selective service card shortly after
The idea of an only male draft is already archaic, you can tell in the Q&A they don't love it either
I had to do this a bit ago. ITS THE FUCKING WORST. Not only do I have to register in the first place, the entire website genders you male, and when you finish registering it outright says CONGRATULATIONS MR. <LASTNAME>. Fuck the selective service.
Y'all, this legal requirement is very, very old. The Selective Service Act was passed in *1917*, long before transness was even remotely on the public radar.

The reason it hasn't been changed is because this is not just a trans issue; it is also a cisgender issue. The law basically defines men as those AMAB and says that we are all eligible for conscription. AFABs are exempt because sexism was still no big back then.
Yeah, that's fucky.  Draft sucks period and definitely sucks for men but it feels invalidating as a trans woman to not be seen as a woman by the US military in such an instance.  Fuck 'em.
as a trans man i will never ever compare my experiences to trans woman because they have it so much worse than us and this is just more proof
How do you know if you did or didn't register for SD I don't want to so I want to make sure I haven't
good thing im mentally ill
I’ll spend time in jail before I fight a war for this hellscape.
Never understood why ciswomen didn't have to register for the draft.  Women are plenty capable of service.
I’m so glad to live in Canada right now, it may not be the best, but holy shit it’s much better than the us
i would literally prefer to just be banned
Yeah, discovered this bullshit with my (ftm) girlfriend (mtf). We were so frustrated about it. But I guess it makes sense cuz the draft is bullshit anyways even when it comes to cis people (I do not like the military). I mean if she ever gets drafted I’ll just pull a mulan and go in her place
Indeed it's afucking bulshit🤦🤦
Honestly why do we even have a mandatoryish registration? Our military is powerful enough as is, and a lot of people do NOT want to server.
drafts are stupid, patriotism is stupid, being expected to serve for your country is stupid, especially a shit hole like the us
Fuck the SS
Might be required to register, but would most likely be ineligible for service if hrt dependent; intersex conditions are already disqualifying for service. Of course if the fascists have control during a draft, common sense might go out the window…
I'm brazilian and we are also required to register. However, I cannot be drafted because the military goes against my personal beliefs. On top of that, trans people have the choice of going or not during a draft.
So...I'm confused.  Do they want us to fight their wars, or be tortured in conversion camps?  Both?  I can't work out if our bodies hold any value to them.
I had to sign up for it. I talked to a recruiter in HS out of curiosity and the moment I told them I had severe allergies and asthma they couldn’t show me the door fast enough. Not sure if that’s changed in 20 years, but if you aren’t young or in peak shape, they don’t want you.
theyre gonna have to spend all that time proving how i was born just for me to tell them i have asthma
i got my draft card in the mail 2 days ago and threw it away immediately. before my birthday they sent me a letter telling me i was gonna be in the draft and i threw it away as well. the us military is a joke and shouldnt be funded as much as it is
Jokes on them, I'm physically incapable of doing literally any job in the military >:3
What's funny is that Trump [tried to undo Obama allowing Trans soldiers](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/26/16034366/trump-transgender-military-ban) until Biden [straight up reversed it](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/) back.  I'm morally opposed to a draft myself and can only see it happening in some *dire* circumstance, but damn... these comments man...
America! Fuck no!
I’m dodging anyways lmfao
Seriously how tf can trans women like us have to register but not trans men… they are against us for who we are what the actual fuck!!
And to think of all the lost souls lost in combat who never got a chance to be openly trans. Terrible.
Wait I’m confused. Are they saying they would draft trans women and not trans men
I'm just gonna bring up that the Government can force me to go and fight and die for a war I don't necessarily agree with but I can't legally drink.

The draft is complete bullshit.
lol i signed up for the selective service under “sexistbootlickers@gmail.com”
With this info, what’s bizarre to me is I was automatically registered for selective service upon changing my DL (in certain states it’s automatic to register males once you get it). Why are MtF women not removed automatically in such states? :/
My brain shut down halfway through reading that.
I would rather die than sign up for the US draft
Who wants to join me and break a federal law as an act of civil disobedience. Any other almost 18 year old Americans here?
The US military just fought a two front conflict without using the draft. I think you'll be okay, and not registering isn't worth the risk. Which is low, but higher than the risk of being drafted. If a AMAB applies for a state college they are automatically registered. 

As far as pushing to change the law to say trans females shouldn't have to register, I think it would just be changed to say EVERYONE has to register. 

If it came down to a draft things would be so fucked up, our cis women would be busy on nine month project making the next generation of soldiers.
The selective service System is a bunch of trash anyway.
They're trying so hard to justify their transphobia
You'd think that they'd not want trans women to serve. They don't have the advantage of testosterone, it's the same as the sports debate. HRT/Orchie stop testosterone and the physical advantages it gives (muscle and the like, not trying to say that women are weaker per se but technically...). Wouldn't they rather have trans men who in a lot of cases actively gym it up so they can look more masculine. I'm not sexist or anything more looking at it through the eyes of the us army (who probably is).
Ngl I thought trans people couldn’t be in the military due to the medication and stuff, similar to me not being allowed because asthma
""Born"" lol
I'm to young to die I'm 19 🥺
I still find it werid that the US has a draft... What is this 1952? McCarthy Era ""Reds under the bed""?


Dumb question, America never got over the McCarthy Era ""socialism is bad, down with Communists!""
sigh... apparently double standards will always find a was in somehow
I don't mind going to the military but I think it should apply to everyone or be equal in some way. I know everyone would feel differently but i grew up with military people in my life.
I could piss off a bunch of people but why not just open it up and make it mandatory for all genders? Equal rights right? I mean women want to be treated equally except when it comes to the possibility they could get “drafted” into military service? Okie dokie then.. and if you were born male, as per the statement it says males born so it would be applicable given you can’t possibly get any gender reassignment before being born.. yet anyway.. and my guess is that would open up a whole new can or worms if it were possible and/or allowed.
This particular exclusion of trans women isn't transphobic actually. The reason why cis women have not been drafted into the military in almost all societies in history isn't their identity or society's perception of what a woman is. It's their uterus, plain and simple. If people who can get impregnated all get drafted in a war, the society can't recover from heavy military losses. Few birth givers can't sustain a society, no matter how many sperm givers there are. Few sperm givers however can with enough birth givers. It sounds disgusting and it is, but that's always been the reasoning behind not drafting cis women, for thousands of years. Cis women and trans women simply aren't the same category regarding their breedability. However, since most trans men are either infertile because of T or would most likely refuse to get impregnated anyway, their exclusion from drafts definitely seems transphobic.
If it makes you feel better OP I’m 25 and never signed up fuck the fed 😘
Why is ""born"" in quotes bro. That's so stupid and unnecessary. (second bullet)
Well, since most states seem to want to qualify being trans as ""a mental disorder"" then you're too unwell to be drafted.
There are grandparents alive today who were born after the last time the USA invoked the military draft. If there’s ever a war again where the USA needs to draft soldiers, it will either be because China Red-Dawned us, or because we’re evac’ing people from fallout zones, or because there was a rapid and debilitating worldwide pandemic, or because zombies. Or … if Congress gets completely gerrymandered into warhawk Republican control and they decide to [redacted] the entire USA.

Military conscription is an artifact of the era of human history when boots on ground taking territory was a viable technique. World War I, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam occupations proved to USA military brass that those aren’t real world military tactics any longer. 

Now the USA bases their military superiority on a model of something like 8-to-1 logistics-to-field MOSes, and every one of those is highly specialized and trained. 

The era of putting conscript grunts through boot and dropping them in forward ops is gone. The chances of selective service ever being invoked again is single digits.
Humans are such a fucked up civilization
Yeah it is bullshit that those that assigned female at birth still don't have to register for Selective Service, Congress should hurry up and fix that.
we need to go get our own county. a country just for us where this shit doesn't happen
Yep I got so mad at it I joined the army (no seriously I got super pissed at this and my solution to avoid a draft was to already be in. Also 2019 so it kinda was a trans ban in military, suck it trump im joining anyway)
The constitution of the United States requires 6 years of service from every man as service to our country.

A person's motivation for volunteering is unique to each individual.   You can choose the branch or you chose peace corps.

The United States is not unique in this requirement; nor is the USA unique in requiring said service of the AMAB individuals only.

Not to be confused with the DRAFT which was enacted by congress long after the original constitution was enacted.  Congress controls the  Draft, much the same as they control just who can be drafted.  They chose to allow those AFAB to serve in combat positions.  

The ""terms of service"" are established by individual branches dependant on their needs, hence my original enlistment obligated me to 4 years of active duty and 2 years of so-called inactive duty.  Earning me coverage under the original ""GI"" bill to pay for college or trade school; it also earned me a seat in Hospitalmen Corps school.

At that time there where all sorts of combinations to satisfy the required "" 6 years""  and avoiding the draft which could have put me in any branch of the service dependant on the needs of the government - except the U S Coast Guard which at that time was not under the CNO nor considered for draftees assignment.

By law you are still required to register with the draft board, so as to ensure they have a ready pool of candidates should congress determine there is a need to reactivate the system to ensure this country can properly defend itself from all powers foreign or domestic.
What's bullshit about it?
Actually I don't think this is necessarily bad. I think it's in an effort to prevent people from changing their gender to avoid military service. Which ultimately protects the trans community (by excluding those that are only trans on paper i.e. no dysphoria, questioning, fear etc, the people that would go that's ok if we didn't exist anymore) and protects the system by saying you can transition however it's not going to be used as an excuse.
You may not like it, but I am so glad to being a US Vet and getting my HRT and gender-affirming care for free

Does it suck? Sure, not denying that

\*\*EDIT\*\* Lookit these people getting upset that either A-I had a good experience with my time in the military, or B-I'm getting free HRT courtesy of my prior military service. Sorry that I managed to get some college and gender-affirming care for something I did right out of high school in the 90s because I had nothing else to do and knew I would not have been alive if not for said military service
I've been registered for the Draft for 40 years now, and I've never been called up nor has anyone else in that time. The US  has been in a constant state of war, military intervention, police action (call it what you like) throughout my entire life.

The letter above spells out the reasoning and what needs to happen to change it.  Sticking with policy is how the military works.

If you want change, VOTE!
lol I got the letter 5 years ago and didn't register, they can fuck themselves. If there's a draft and I get drafted I'm dodging, or telling them I'm suicidal/homicidal/have a chronic condition if I somehow wind up in the physical.

edit: forgot the easiest way to get out. Just tell them you'd frag your commanding officer then yourself the moment they hand you a live rifle. They won't be able to get you out fast enough.
What's the problem?
That’s false. I’m an FTM army veteran. After I got out of the military, I transitioned and then started college. In order to receive any financial aid, I had to register for the draft. Even though I am prior service and was born female.
Yes, that's bullshit. Selective services does violate a certain rule, after all.
I had to get a letter from the government saying I'm not qualified for the draft before I could get a student loan. It was odd, but I will say the process went much smoother than I thought it would.
What if we just list all the chromosomes so gender doesn't matter.

But it would also display that you have a genetic disability if you got extra or missing some chromosomes. Hmm.

What if we just do not list up gender and anything related to that then.
I kept reading “OPM” as one punch man
Wait, what the fuck am I supposed to do to get the letter of exemption if I already changed my birth certificate, though? It says male now, but it didn't when I was born, and I'm too old to actually register for the draft now either iirc.
Would this still apply if you get your birth certificate changed.
Military drafts make no sense. Surely anyone who gets drafted would have much more reason to fight against the military they were just forcibly drafted into than they would to fight against basically anyone else.
Yeah I got registered for the selective service a few months ago, the fact that it’s so heavily advertised towards men was a very dysphoria inducing experience for me

And it doesn’t help that the way they treat trans people is basically saying “actually the military doesn’t recognize you as your gender even if you change all your papers”
This is just gross and of course it’s the U.S be safe out there ladies
Haha the government is stupid if they think I'll fight for this country
You may also register as a conscientious objector citing philosophical opposition to serving in the military. Historically those objectors were assigned non-lethal roles like desk jobs or logistics. No guarantees though. Objectors have also been forced into human experiments and other dangerous work. If there's a draft, I'm moving.
What country is this?
The thing was like “Protect your country” I’m like “what if I want to watch the American upper class burn for their crimes against humanity they’ve committed under the American Empire.
Oh, yeah, I had to do that recently…..sadly-
Instructions unclear, got my dick stuck in a rifle
Tbh I registered for the draft at 22 after legally changing everything to male and mostly did it as a fuck you to my home state of Arkansas and a feel masculine dude boost since all my friends had to do it at 18. I know that if they called me up I’d A refuse to serve and B they’d see I’m trans male and immediately be like lol get out of here. I’d still show up though just to make them go through the whole thing. *ultimate trick they accept you anyways welcome to the military fucker ;)
Wow.
Absolute bullshit, males and females should be in the draft. Not just males
[Draft Dodger Rag by Phil Ochs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T9MHFldX1E)
Are you still required to be on it even after you’ve legally changed your name and gender marker on all your docs including birth certificates and SS?
Be me: dodge the draft
In my home country it's the other way around: can't get drafted if you're mtf but will get drafted if you'd ftm (but you can tell them you are ftm and they'll leave you alone - but if you want to do your required 6 months of service you still can).

But my question here is: how would they know you're trans? They just ask you to register if you're mtf, there's no way they can know, right?
The only thing that you can do is call your congressional representative. But I don’t see this changing anytime soon. Republicans, both congressional and senatorial, aren’t going to pass some thing that affirms people’s gender identity. 

Also, I don’t want to minimize how you’re feeling, but I don’t think it’s the most pressing thing for Congress to handle regarding trans people. There are so many other issues impacting trans Americans that Congress should probably be handling first. As of right now, we don’t have a draft, and so this issue probably isn’t even on the mind of most of Congress. If and when the MSSA gets revised it will hopefully be to repeal it, but more than likely it will be to revise it so that all Americans, regardless of gender, register.

Again, your frustration is valid and I don’t want to minimize it. If you feel strongly enough, please call your representative and/or senator.
if u go on feminizing HRT don’t some of the side effects make you ineligible for service and stuff
Great in the event that we get attacked and I’m forced to fight they’ll get the overweight, non-athletic, musician, never fired a gun, doesn’t want to kill people, soldier they deserve
I know a cis woman who got a letter about signing up for the draft just cause she had a more masculine name.
at least my autism makes me unfit for military service
Australian here just wanting to know how hard it would be to adopt my bestie if things get worse for her in the US!
You mean more bullshit than having a draft in the US anyway?

Realistically they are unlikely to draft trans people and probably include it so as to not provide a relatively easy way out for people attempting to dodge a draft.

In the rare case that the US has a draft and someone realises they are trans near to or after they are drafted this might be meaningful but as it is its kind of water under the bridge.
I’m honestly more annnoyes at the fact that women still don’t have to register I acctully think this is sexual percicution it’s litterally systematic sexism. Oh and wtf America you fascist ****.(I don’t blame all of America just most of the curry or congresss and the shitty sout

Edit: this may be unpopular and I can see the counter argument so feel free to tell me if I’m wrong I shall keep an open mine
Imagine in the future conflict when the battalion of transfemmes shows up on the battlefield. Boot camp will just be a bunch of Mulan references, and due to DoD transition-care policies, they'll just have field packs of estrogen ""in case you get separated from the squad in the field and are awaiting evac.""
That's targeting how is that legal
papa johns checkout tab
What’s that
If you are like me and have certain mental illnesses, you are good to go. Major Depression is a really common one and an immediate d-qual.
what the fuck
Looks like this is something that got overlooked when updating laws and US Code. The government has their hands tied with the ""born"" and ""male"" language in the original law. They are most likely unable to waive the policy because they won't do anything that won't stand in court. Even if this came to pass and a trans person was called to serve, the military would probably give you a pass when you showed up, as they can make the actual yes or no decision.

EDIT: Also, I can't imagine the military attempting a draft again. The war in Iraq was so deeply unpopular, across all party lines. That, combined with the lessons of the Vietnam debacle were enough for them to put that one on the shelf for a long time to come IMO. They'll just keep bribing economically disadvantaged high school seniors into joining voluntarily...
I have never heard of something like this, where did this become mandatory? Im 18 and never heard anything about a draft
But gender and sex are different. I don’t see how this is factually incorrect.
i can understand the reasoning because someone could in principle legally change their gender without actually changing what they identify as and use that to get out of the draft
but at the same time that doesn’t justify the trans people hurt by this
imo nobody should be drafted anyways and the solution to this and plenty of other problems is to abolish the sss entirely
SEXISM
This is the [Selective Service System](https://www.usa.gov/selective-service). The government agency that replaced the military draft in the 1970's after the Vietnam conflict and compels all AMAB persons - citizens and residents - in the US to register for potential military service in the event of total mobilisation in time of war once said person reaches the age of 18 and expires at the age of 25. It is compulsory and a US citizen CAN be punished for failing to register. 

I am not sure if getting the gender marker changed can nullify that requirement, but I don't think it matters to the US military. If they decide they need warm bodies to fill the ranks, they will get warm bodies to fill the ranks.

It used to be that claiming you are gay was enough to disqualify from the service, but that avenue was closed after the passage of DADA (Don't Ask Don't Tell) 

I had to register, but this was before I came out as trans at 30.
[deleted]
It's the US draft - you have to sign up for it as an AMAB citizen of the US so you can get a draft number (even though we are a volunteer army now)

They don't require AFAB (see for reference the idiocy around the failure to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in the 80s), and the DoD bars intersex people from being in the military at all.

Remember, the US may seem progressive, but that's because we regularly ignore the rules and settle it in court. /half-joking
Facts
I hear New Zealand is nice this time of year.
I'm just glad I don't qualify. A recruiter talked to me a few years ago for some reason and told me I wasn't eligible because I have ptsd and suicidal depression. So I think thats a good thing?
If the USA keeps getting transphobic I plans to flee to Germany
Or I show up and they refuse me bc of mental health issues, the fact that I need meds for various things, and migraines. Other than that they want me to join the military for other reasons(I’m “smart” on paper, strong, again on paper, but what paper doesn’t show is that im not super coordinated)
Anti-depressants seem like a free enough way to dodge, haha.
They cant stop you from saying things that would result in you being dismissed.
They can't really make you register tho. At least, I haven't seen it enforced. Regardless, I'd never fight a war for this shitass country lmao
Draft dodging is a virtue.
I’m leaving cus I don’t want to fight for a fucking curry or government. Though personally women should have to register for the draft as well I feel like. To me it feels like systemic percicution I know that might be an unpopular opinion and I can understand the couneeargument but still.

Also feel free to tell me I’m wrong I will keep an open mind
If there was a war there’s no way I would not dodge I’m in Canada so it could be different but the only options in being in a war are death or PTSD for the rest of your life
I'm applying to schools in Canada after the end of spring quarter at community college.

I don't know how I'll pay for housing (I have a dog and dorms scare me) or food but I don't want to be here after January 2025. I don't want to be here when the Nazis enact the Final Solution.
If you go to the psych ward, are you exempt? I'm just curious, cause I'm AFAB
Chuch
technically they can’t make you do either
Yeah but they still know if you registered or not and it’s a crime to not register. I’m not worried about being drafted though because they’d probably change the rules if they needed to use the draft because trans people would probably just call the military’s bluff.
A lot of people would be unfit for service for a variety of reasons. Mental health being one of them. 

Right there with ya on the hypocrisy and reduction of agency though.
Yeah this is in the states
I don't know if this is still the case, but I had to sign up in order to receive financial aid in college.

It's *not* at all likely it will occur, but it's something to consider.

Honestly, this country would probably be experiencing a lot of awful stuff on the inside and out before a draft.

My plan has always been to leave if there were a draft, but I'm strongly considering moving that up depending on what policies come down the pipeline in the next 5-10 years.
There is no active draft in the United States. You don't have to worry about being drafted and you will likely never have to worry about it. It's an old legislation from 1917 that was just never removed. The US is a volunteer only military and unless the very existence of the country is under threat, you will never see a draft.  


While I empathize with people over this, it's such a non-problem to care about.
Yass Queen your way into Moscow oorah
I have thought exactly this every time ""identifies"" is used for us, or even by many of us. It's a word that needs to go the same way as ""tolerance""; a necessary stepping stone, but nearly archaic and wrong at this point. I don't identify, I am.
Yep. Well done.
Funnily enough, they don't even follow the rules posted. They auto registered me as a trans man a few months after I had my gender marker legally changed. 

Even though every ""get your loans forgiven!!!"" recruiter I've responded to with ""I'm a trans guy, that gonna be a problem?"" has immediately unsubscribed me without another word.
I changed my gender marker to male and they registered me for the draft automatically a few months later.

They don't even follow their own rules lmao.
Also jokes on them, if u have meds u need to take every so often afaik u literally cant be drafted for boots on the ground across the world.
Have you ever heard the song Alice’s Restaurant?? Classic how to get out of the draft ;-)
no but I can check it out.
It was a good song and Publishing date checks out.
agreed
it’s more that they’re saying afab people, no matter what, are weak
Pretty much how they feel.
I'm going to be honest, the US plans to legalize all people having to register soon enough.
Not to be rude to men either! This also sucks for them, sorry if I upset anyone, everyone here is awesome!!! and doesn’t deserve to get hurt by this.
Its saying that males are better soldiers than females. Which has always been the case. 

The policy in the post is in place in order to prevent people from trying to claim that they're trans to avoid a draft. If the US ever implements a draft then there will absolutely be people who try to dodge it by lying about being trans. That's not a statement on the validity of trans people, it's a statement about human nature.
Yup, the draft in and of itself is the problem. If they can’t find enough people willing to fight their war then they shouldn’t be fucking in a war.
Mhmmm made me hate the government more and more
And really, since trans people are like 1ish% of people anyway, they'd probably pull your number - take one good look and say ""nah, nevermind"" and send you on your way.
Mhm, it’s mandatory for trans women but not trans men
That's what I'm getting out of it.
I need explanation
PS, if you are a government official reading this for some reason, bring it! Let's retry Schenk v United States.
This except I think selective service should go away and NOBODY should have to register. But I won't get that wish, so EVERYONE should have to register.
That’s what it was during trumps presidency
Old enough to fight in wars for rich people murdering minorities not old enough to get hormones in the states soon
America doesn't have a draft, it's a volunteer military. It just requires that you sign up for the selective service, so if there is ever legislation to enact a draft they have a list of people they can start picking.   


It's still fucked, but it's a bit incorrect to represent it as an active draft that they're using.
The draft is modern day slavery. 

Any AMAB can be ripped from their families, lives, and friends, to go fight and die in a country half way around the world that they want no part in.
The problem is it never will in places where it is mandatory that everyone serve. The rich and powerful either get a cakewalk and a lot of status or find a way out of it. Look at the royal family and those of them that basically were required to serve and look at what dangers there careers truly entailed it is the same for the rich and powerful in the states and pretty much anywhere. Universal service would just create another way for the rich and powerful to abuse us and say they had to do it when they definitely didn’t.
Because they're quoting the language used in the law
they should get rid of the fucking draft altogether.
There's lots of crap they should hurry and fix.. but it's congress.. so we know that's not gonna happen.
Trans women have to register for the draft but trans men don’t in the United states
In normal countries, you can get hrt and surgeries for free without having to be a vet.
Had a friend once flash her tits at a bunch of bigoty churchy types at a festival, she liked letting them know their taxes paid for her homegrown knockers.
Just wait until potus is from the other party again.. 😒
One of the things Biden ran on was trans equality yet he was the one that implemented this , the system is broken, we need a new one
We are literally a minority. We have been told “oh ahhh vote blue” and look where it’s getting us in Red states. No where. I assure you the VAST majority of red states have trans populations trying to vote for their rights but it’s not working. Voting never works for actual change. Americans didn’t vote out Britain, Iraqis couldn’t vote out the Americans. Russian citizens didn’t vote for a war in Ukraine. Ukrainians can’t vote Russia out of their country. It’s just takes a history book to know that voting is simply an illusion of choice for anyone who strays from the norm or is less powerful.
That’s literally from the sss website , I face imprisonment and large fines if I don’t register , for u the worst u prob would face is not getting financial aid
No exemptions unfortunately I called them and that’s what they said
Yes unfortunately
Those that are too combative towards military authority can end up in military prison before they get out of basic training. Those that are in the military have the fact that even failing to report a conspiracy to usurp or override lawful military authority can be punished by death or life in prison if serving a nation has abolished the death penalty hanging over their heads so it is too risky to even talk about doing anything to that effect unless it gets too bad so most draftees have the sense to just keep their heads down and hope they survive to the end of their service.
USA
Also did it bc at the time it wasn’t clear if our state was going to use that against us. It was advised by my queer group activist adults to not give my state any reason to come after me. Register so they’ll forget about you was the idea. Because heaven forbid they come back in 15 yrs and say your a trans “man” he/she draft dodger and revoke whatever legal identity the state had given you. 2015 Arkansas at its best. Doubt it’s better now but I’ve been in Oregon since 2018
Unfortunately not
In the United States draft has been mandatory for men since the 50s I think, and now they’re forcing trans women to sign up too
Changing gender marker has no affect on SSS registration. It’s still compulsory unfortunately.
It's done so that men don't claim that they're women to get out of serving which seems like bullshit. I mean men have served for thousands of years, if we're supposed to be an equal society then perhaps we should have both men and women serving regardless of whether you're born male or female.
What country is this?

Edit: Nvm, I just saw this is the US
Why do the USA still have a draft? It's like \*the\* country that should not have one. Its position is very defendable, its military is bigger than the next few countries combined, they have enough nuclear capability to glass the Earth and probably some other celestial body, too, and even when they want to fight wars abroad, they know for a fact that drafted soldiers are close to worthless in modern warfare.
thats crazy... then again the military has always been one of the least safe spaces for minorities.
also i never registered but they registered me anyway
You mean trans meant aren’t required I assume is what you meant. Also fuck that. I’m a trans man. Doesn’t matter either way. I’m registered for the draft too. Shouldn’t matter a man is a man and a woman is a women. Everyone should have to sign up. End of story. That would be equality. How it’s handled now is not.
[deleted]
ouchie. My bones.
They can't*force* you to sign up ...they just make life a bit more annoying if you don't.
Is New Zealand a better option than Australia? Or are they about the same because I've thought about moving to Australia if things get too bad
I heard they don't allow autistic people to move there, so no, it does not seem like a nice place to be. If they don't like my kind then I won't go there.
It's about as corrupt as America too!
Feel like this would disqualify like 90% of the people *in* the military.
>suicidal depression

wait, that makes you not qulified?
When there's a war they drop a lot of the restrictions and use formerly unqualified people as cannon fodder.

They would suspend Don't Ask Don't Tell when recruitment numbers were low, then root out any gay people they didn't like when things got better.
If you move here, I'll make cookies.
This isn't an instance of transphobia. It's an instance of gender discrimination that predates much of the developments in trans discourse. This is a very old feature of our legal system. The system requires that everyone AMAB must register for the draft. When it was instituted it was not controversial. But that was quite some time ago.
It would be good to go to Canada, very friendly there
Dont its not much better here 💀
""getting transphobic""? The time to pack your bags was months ago. I'm from a rather conservative rural part of Germany and this is a fucking utopia compared to the shitshow going on in the US. The US is looking more and more like Nazi Germany with every day that goes by
Consider Cuba. Much more friendly.
I've been working toward that goal since about the 2nd week of the pandemic. 

It isn't a trivial thing to do, but if you can line up a job first it makes it a lot easier.
A warm body.
They can't force you to register, but it is a requirement if you plan on becoming a citizen, they will ask for proof that you register when you try doing that.
While they can't ""force"" you [Texas](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&app=9&p_dir=P&p_rloc=197458&p_tloc=&p_ploc=1&pg=4&p_tac=&ti=37&pt=1&ch=15&rl=49) has found a clever way to coerce people into registering.
What do you mean by curry?
I already have complex ptsd, but I'd imagine dodging a draft to be rather traumatic as well.

Not nearly as bad as seeing people die, but certainly something that would stick with you regardless of the reason you'd leave.
As a conscientious objector, I'd call that bluff for sure.  Lemme push paperwork and peel potatoes for 4 years.  The federal government can pay me for it, and then pay for my surgeries.
___
Edit, as there are non-american eyes in this thread, the [SSS's text](https://www.sss.gov/conscientious-objectors/#:~:text=The%20person%20who%20is%20opposed,duties%20that%20include%20using%20weapons.) is included below.

**Service as a Conscientious Objector**  
Two types of service are available to conscientious objectors, and the type assigned is determined by the individual’s specific beliefs. The person who is opposed to any form of military service will be assigned to alternative service – described below. The person whose beliefs allow him to serve in the military but in a noncombatant capacity will serve in the Armed Forces but will not be assigned training or duties that include using weapons.

**Alternative Service**  
Conscientious objectors opposed to serving in the military will be placed in the Selective Service Alternative Service Program. This program attempts to match COs with local employers. Many types of jobs are available, however the job must be deemed to make a meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health, safety, and interest. Examples of alternative service are jobs in:

conservation  
caring for the very young or very old  
education  
health care  

Length of service in the program will equal the amount of time a man would have served in the military, usually 24 months.""
Already existing is a crime, fuck em. Im 25 and never signed up.
If the draft was ever activated again, we would have to be in very bad shape miltiarily (us miltary is virtually unstoppable). If we were in bad shape, unfortunately, the US would quickly drop those standards. This is just a sad reality of war. If you want a reminder of how the US treats undesirables they draft, look no further than how African Americans were treated during Vietnam. (Spoiler alert, they were treated like cannon fauder)

It's pretty fucked. If you've ever watched fury. It really drives home how much ""meat"" was thrown into the grinder of war.
Bro no way fuck that bs
Yeah, I’m going to imagine that if there ever was an active draft again you’d probably have bigger problems to worry about.
Was the ‘very existence’ of the country threatened during Vietnam
Don't count your chickens just yet! uncle Sam's gotta protect those micro processors....
Yup and to further this, the only way a draft would happen now is if WW3 started. Even then we’re so overwhelmingly powerful compared to everyone else that it may not be necessary. That is, of course, depending on how hard China would fight
Still!! Like, it doesn’t matter what the true definition is, this is just so shitty
I mean i guess this is technically less discriminatory, but it's still practically worse for everyone. Like, it's not discriminatory if you're oppressing everbody equally!
I agree with that, the world is already broken and messed up in some ways
What about world war 2 or the civil war? Both were battles against tyranny. Should the US have done nothing in those situations?
Weeeeeiiiird
Tbf I’m more ok with that than being forced to. I’m not an American so it doesn’t bother me I was just interested
If I had to do that I wouldn't
Got it, soo you ""volunteer"" for this ""not draft"" incase we reinstate the draft.... When was that again.... Oh yeah 2002
Selective Service is unlikely to be abolished especially during heightened tensions with Russian and China, and if they did abolish Selective Service in the event of a major war that would have pushed the USA into reinstating the draft they would just reintroduce the Selective Service act so we might as well push for the Selective Service to made more equal.
That is definitely true.

Yeah duh if they didn’t do it that way you would just have everyone saying they’re female to get out of the draft. Not sure why everyone here is so mad about this it’s not like you’re ever getting drafted anyways. And if you really wanted to Dodge it there’s better ways to do so
I mean, you're not wrong
I won't lie and say I don't take pride in knowing that these Red Hats are paying for this experience
did you even read the website you linked? it litterally says:

> Changes to the MSSA involving Selective Service registration requires Congressional action. It cannot be changed through Presidential Proclamation or Executive Order. As such, the registration requirement remains based on the assigned gender at birth.

given this, how do you suggest Biden change it? Bonus points if you reference who controls house of representatives.
I stand by what I said.
Well if they're going to force you into military service only to imprison you or have you killed, then surely its just a waste of resources.
Holy shit!? I thought this was going to be some eastern Europe or SE Asian dictatorship 😬
I wonder why i have no memory of any of this. What happens if you just, dont?
Doing more research on this and checking my own emails and stuff. Ive literally done none of these “required” things nor has anyone in school or home ever talked about it. We sure this is worth worrying about?
drat and double drat.

Oh well. I'm old farts so I'm long past the age of getting drafted...but my younger trans femme siblings...I worry for you all...💗💗
We haven’t used it since the Vietnam war (1964 - ‘74). The military is an “all volunteer” force. The draft is for just in case.
My understanding is that Congress just never bothered removing it. Actually calling for a draft is political suicide regardless of party and they haven’t even enforced the registration requirement for decades so it would be a logistical nightmare
Because there’s no harm in having a backup plan. Especially since, historically speaking, all nations fall eventually
While everyone's experience can obviously differ, and I do recognize that the US military has been historically bigoted towards LGBT+, my experience as a trans woman in then navy has been one of the more accepting and safest spaces. Granted this is from a commissioned experience, not an enlisted.  


I will however phrase that the Marines and Army are not safe spaces for any minorities though. Infantry focused branches tend to attract extreme toxic masculinity.
If your a resident of the US, you kind of have to…

You can go to jail for five years and be fined <$250,000 USD if you don’t.

Also you need to register to be eligible for FASFA grants for higher education.

You are already registered in some states if you possess a drivers license. 

Also take into consideration there has not been a draft since Vietnam (‘64 - ‘73)
Got flashbacks to that Russian who got his friend to jump on his shin from the top of the stares
About the same, although I would say New Zealand gets the edge as far as trans issues go. I’m an Australian and I can say that while we do get lots of assholes, the general attitude amongst the populace to trans people is more indifferent than seething.

That said you’d probably have an easier time immigrating to New Zealand, Australian residency isn’t that easy to get unfortunately,
NZ is super friendly to trans, hrt is covered by national medicine as are some gender affirming surgeries like bottom/top surgery.
Welcome to Australia...
Everything here can kill you in varying degrees of slow and painful. Please remember to always check your shoes, your bed, your toilet, your barbecue, your kitchen cupboards and pretty much anywhere else you have that's semi dark and a good place for critters to hide
I've lived in both places for a good chunk of my life and I can tell you this. Trans acception is far better in NZ than it is in Australia speaking from personal experiences, although it's slightly harder to go on hormones in NZ. Also no one is really forced to do anything in NZ but be a good citizen. Plus no animal in NZ can kill you, there's no snakes, only one poisonous spider and either way it doesn't have enough venom to kill, and no natural predators other than humans. And over in Australia pretty much everything can kill or harm you. I'd probably consider immigrating to NZ rather than Australia as it will be easier with NZ laws. Either way you will be fine 😄.
Huh... that's surprising...*goes to google*

Oh...I see. That sucks. It looks like it is almost an entirely financial decision but that does not make it any less shitty.
theres a bit more nuance to it than that and youre likely to run into the same hurdle immigrating nearly anywhere else, if your autism affects your life to an extent that would have a heavy cost on the countrys economy to accommodate theyre less likely to accept citizenship, its still super fucky theres no denying that but financially i understand it
Just going based off of what I was told. It mightve been bad info
Recruiter said technically because it, ""makes me a danger to others""
so it’s an instance of transphobia
Canadian government has been looking like US government 12 years behind so maybe not as good as you'd think
Celeste
How likely are the fascists to take over there? Honestly asking because I hope things look better elsewhere. Because desantis might be the end.
How so? For me it wasn't too bad, but I am just starting out, like I'm waiting for some test results to get some E right now
If DeSantis makes it into the whitehouse it's gonna get significantly worse, significantly faster.
Hm?
Currupt
Having served with objectors it's not nearly this rosey for them 😬
In most states, having a driver’s license automatically signs you up. In every other state, you need to check a box which signs you up in order to file your FAFSA
This was a thing when I was in high school and yeah I was like what in the world. I would show up and you would immediately not want me given I am trans and have a boat load of health issues besides. The point of this if they ever institute a draft they can say you agreed to serve so now your breaking the law. Fun fact though for a while the penalty for not signing up for selective service was not getting to vote so my progenitor does not vote to this as he refused to sign up on grounds of seeing what Vietnam did to his brother. I don’t blame either my uncle his brother found dead under mysterious circumstances supposedly suicide but it was obviously murder. So again he saw the system  failing him so he redoubled his refusal. All that said look into the penalty for not registering I am pretty it is something along those lines. Though in my opinion having a penalty for not registering is coercion and invalidates the whole we gave you a choice thing.
There’s plenty of countries with mandatory service. The US simply has you sign up for the draft, which will almost certainly not be used any time soon. After Vietnam it’s likely the draft won’t be enacted unless we were in imminent danger, to the point that a lot of people would probably already willingly serve.
During Vietnam the draft had never been removed prior to begin with. That's not a relevant example.

Vietnam being fought is literally what created the political scenario for the draft to be banned and the US to switch to a volunteer only force. You can **not be drafted by the United States military**. It is literally illegal for them to do so. Congress has to pass legislation in order for a draft to take place, which will never happen.
The Vietnam war is why the US returned to a volunteer-only military, it was so deeply unpopular with people of a draftable age that Congress did not expand the draft law and it is unlikely to  reintroducte the draft unless the existence of the USA was under threat while the Vietnam war (And possibly the Iraq war) is still within living memory.
Taiwan is more important than micro processors. But no there wouldn't be a draft for that either. It would just be a naval war for starters, so draft wouldn't help. And you would need Congress to actually agree on a draft, which wouldn't happen.
oh for sure, it’s super shitty! i was just adding that you pointed out only how this affects the women in this sub without acknowledging how it affects the men here
I mean, most people eligible to be conscripted in those wars volunteered.
The point still stands. If the country cannot motivate its citizens to volunteer to fight and die for this war they shouldn’t fight it.
That’s disingenuous. The US should make do with the volunteers they have. That’s not nothing.
Gotcha , wish I wasn’t American , I grew up in Austria but was adoptive by an American couple
I registered before coming out again so I didnt even think about it at the time. Still stupid af that in America they are trying to ban our care and tell us to serve them
The last draft was in 73. You’re probably thinking of the reservists which were called up.
The last draft was in 1973, 2002 was when they called on the reserve forces, otherwise known as volunteers.

There's no semantics to be played here. There is no draft in the United States. There is the selective service act which creates a list of people to call on in the event legislation is passed that enacts a draft.

You will never be drafted by the United States military, it is legally a volunteer only force. They are physically not fucking allowed to draft you unless congress specifically passes legislation to enact one.
The last draft was in 1973 during the Vietnam War. the closest thing to the draft since than was National Guard members being called up for active duty during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
They have the largest military in the world and Russia and the US clearly aren’t deserving of militaries at all.
Bruh wtf is wrong with u
I would be surprised if a bill changing that hasnt come across his deck and he other ignored or trashed that
Draftees are more likely to be willing to stick out the unknown risks of serving in the military than the certain risk of being put to death or sent to a military prison, so in the eyes of the military the wastage would be within acceptable limits, likely being outnumbered by wastage by other non-combat sources such as disease (Occupational and viral), accidents, and stress reaction.
I’m theory they can send u prison and fine u, I got a notice in the mail saying I had to or else they would
Yeah but, even in a ""just in case"" way, what case?? Mainland invasion? How on Earth? Can't happen, if that happens someone has sunk the entire US fleet and is powerful enough as to not fear nuclear retaliation, it's fantasy.
All volunteer as in groomed and financially troubled kids or young teens who have no direction in life that are taken advantage of by the military
> The military is an all volunteer force

that's an extremely generous way of putting it; i was under the impression that many of the people there were pressured into it by their financial situation
I don't know anyone who would fight for this country anymore, pretty sure most of us would just let it burn at this point... They can draft all they want they already made enemies out of most of us...
there are significant penalties if you are caught and don't register. registration is required to qualify for some federal programs and benefits.

""If required to register with Selective Service, failure to register is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 and/or 5 years imprisonment. Also, a person who knowingly counsels, aids, or abets another to fail to comply with the registration requirement is subject to the same penalties.""

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/02/failing-register-draft-women-court-consequences-men/3205425002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/02/failing-register-draft-women-court-consequences-men/3205425002/) 

""... fail to register for the draft by then can no longer do so – forever closing the door to government benefits like student aid, a government job or even U.S. citizenship...

...Forty states and the District of Columbia link Selective Service to a driver's license. But some of those allow men to opt out of registration, and about a quarter of Americans in their early 20s don't have a driver's license.  
Thirty-one states have legislation mirroring federal laws on student aid and employment, applying those bans to state-funded student aid programs and state employment.

Some states go even further:   
  
► In eight states, men are not allowed men to register at a state college or university – even without financial aid – if they aren't registered for Selective Service. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and Tennessee.   
  
► In Ohio, men who live in the state but don't register for Selective Service must pay out-of-state tuition rates.  
  
► In Alaska, men who fail to register for the draft can't receive an annual dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which gave Alaska residents $1,600 from state oil revenue in 2018.""
My heart sings to hear things have changed that much. I served as a naval flight officer during the early nineties.  I cannot conceive of a more toxic male environment, outside of Marine infantry.  I remember our squadron skipper standing there at quarters to announce don’t ask don’t tell’s inauguration and telling us that it was clear that the service was better off without “those people”

Don’t even get me started on the hostility to women in general— this was just before the integration of women into tactical squadrons.  “Split tails” “cracks in the airframe”.  I heard it all. Also Tailhook. 

I guess I wasn’t as closeted as I thought— my squadron mates would do lovely things like shove gay porn under my door.  I did appreciate the big book of sports they gave me at my hail and farewell so I could “learn to hang out with guys”. That was actually kinda funny, I admit. 

Drove me out of the Navy but not aviation. I fly for a major US carrier these days, but stay stealth. Just another woman pilot.  They didn’t take the sky from me.
Isn't there an age limit to sign up anyways?
No stop no no ew yuck. Whyd you have to remind me of that???
NO!! WHY THE FUCK?!
Yep i remember that one. Poor fuckers
Sounds good, I'll definitely consider it
From what I read if you have at least 4 years of military service you can apply for a position in the Australian military to be able to move there (but you'd of course have to be okay with being in the military) i have thought about it a good deal myself

Edit: 
It seems it's at least 5 years and you can only have been out for a maximum of 3
Also the flora and fauna in NZ aren't trying to actively kill you.
Sounds great I'll definitely consider it if things go to sh*t
I hear the waiting lists for surgeries are years long tho
and dont go to sydney
Oh it's not *that* bad, spiders aren't an issue, sure it'll hurt but antivenom means that as long as you're more than 3 hours from a hospital, and you're bitten by a red back, then you're in trouble. But if you're living in general suburbia it's fine.

Plus, at least in Melbourne, like, I'd say it held the most livable city title for years for a reason.
More like an instance of complete ignorance of the existence of transness. But I'm not going to die on this hill. People are acting like this is some new, scary thing, not the one hundred year old law it is. That's my point.
It’s more of a way station than a final destination
Seriously?
Pretty unlikely cuz this country is so slow and that goes for the right and left wing
Our equivalent to the Republican party (AfD) has like 10% of votes, meaning they are in parliament... But none of the other parties want to work with them, so they're not exactly in a position of power. Best they can currently do is try to delay.

In addition to just the general pack of popularity, we've also changed how our government works after WW2, specifically to prevent people like Hitler from gaining power in the future. For now, the AfD is being monitored for potentially being unconstitutional. So if, say, the leader of the AfD were to encite a mob to storm the parliament and hurt MPs, the party would be banned.
Doctor 1: doesnt believe me
Doctor 2: asked me if i want antidepressents so i stop thinking about it lmao
Doc 3: its against his religion 

..... need i say more?
I don't trust the military. Never have, and never will. I'm leaving if a draft ever happened. I don't think the US would be a good place to live by that point anyway.

You do you.

❤️✌️
Very true, but in this scenario my choices are pretty much 'dodge the draft' or 'don't dodge the draft'.

I mean, I wrote that post but I'd bet a literal finger that we won't have another draft.
Prior Air Force maintenance here. We had someone who decided they just didn’t want to work anymore so stated they then objected. They ended up being a chaplain’s assistant assistant (double assistant intended) for a few months before being kicked out.
Shit. I’m in AZ, have a DL and am literally doing my FAFSA rn. The draft really is to get the poor huh
""you would immediately not want me given I am trans and have a boat load of health issues""

I hate to be that girl but that is WHY they would want you. In their mind you are the meat shield for their ""more valuable soldier."" It's disgusting. And apparently dishonorable discharge is so much worse than a felony. You literally lose a bunch of civilian rights like right to bear arms.

Oh my goodness! No no no! That was not my intention I’m so sorry! My communication skills are awful! 😂😣
The civil war was wildly unpopular in the north, they genuinely needed the draft to support the war effort. And if we hadn’t who knows where america would be now.
I made the same point to the other commenter, the civil war was a wildly unpopular war not just for the north but the south as well. Most common people didn’t see it as their war. So the draft was put in place to make up for that. Now I ask, what would’ve been the outcome if the north hadn’t succeeded or as much as they did in the conflict? We are actively dealing with tons of issues in America that can be directly connected to how the north handled the post civil war south. I think it’s just be safe to say that america would’ve been worse without it in place.
10 million drafted soldiers for ww2, 2/3s of those that fought in ww2, it would be disingenuous to say that the draft serves no purpose. Sure more would’ve enlisted on their own given enough time to make the decision, but would enough have made the decision for us to wage the war on 2 fronts as effectively as we did? Would the war have taken longer without that manpower? Would the Allie’s have won without the manpower?
I know it's stupid I wish we were all happy this community is like a family to me and I don't want to lose it now
I mean I remember when an American citizen litterally crossed into Canada to avoid going to Iraq... It was such a big deal here a band even a song about it. IIRC he got a less than honourable discharge
It does not matter if Russia and China are a legitimate threat or not, the Warhawks in Congres would use the heightened tensions to kill support for any bill to abolish Selective Service and as I stated before if such a war did back they would very likely reintroduce the Selective Service act if it was abolished.

It is China that has the largest military though two of its branches are currently lacking in capability when compared to the USA, China also has a much larger conscription base than the USA. The U.S. Military has gotten smaller than it was before the war in Iraq and so have the militaries of many of their allies.

I don't think any of the parties directly mentioned are really deserving of their militaries yet I also think that sexism is unacceptable.
that person is just a troll. report, ignore, and move on.
Cool, cuz i wanna die for the country that wants me dead anyways 🙄
WW3, I guess.
That’s the military complex for you :/
Ya, like end of the world shit. They would lower the enlistment standards and up their bonuses, activate all their reservists and national guardsmen, recall anyone who recently got out, throw money at anyone who is about to get out, and hardcore recruit new people before they even touched the draft. The draft is a “oh shit we are fighting the end of the world and need all hands on deck RIGHT NOW” option anymore.
Just in case the government decides to wage a war that is both going very poorly and is very unpopular i.e. they decide to invade China or some shit. Like, if the war comes to the homeland people are going to willingly sign up. The draft is only for ""Oops, we fucked up good.""
That's not necessarily true. I am in the military as a trans person, and I love it. Feel free to ama.
They’re also just plain manipulated into it by recruiters. I’d recommend Second Thoughts video on YouTube about this if you want to learn more.
You are completely correct, didn’t think about that. It’s early
This. I feel like there’s a bit of a bubble in some spaces where people 1. Think a draft will never happen and 2. Think you don’t really need to register
40
We all suffer together 🥰
Honestly, probably a better option than going to the Ukrainian meat grinder
Aren't they already?
Just be warned, its VERY hard to get a visa to NZ. They have very low limits.
the wait list for affirming surgery is like half a decade or more and while the populace is generally indifferent, the trans health system is spotty. where its good its great, where its bad its terrible. HRT being covered is great tho, what i want, sublingual pills, is not covered fully so while i dont know yet how much it will be, it will be probably costly. super hard to actually get to live here permanently tho so start the process early cause when shit hits fan we will probably close up.
I mean, because it's a tourist hotbed and over rated and full of pick pockets or some other reason.... I live far away From hot Britain so.... Please enlighten me, not like I'd ever go to Hot Britain.... My complexion it'd be a death sentence for me. (Pale and Ginger)
Three words friend, Funnel Web Spider
it’s absolutely dystopian here. Ontario has been slowly losing universal healthcare
I mean, they recently had the whole “Do you have a mental health issue? Try Assisted Suicide!” thing going on
Yeah, it took me over a decade to get HRT, even in Canada. Lots of ""lost"" paperwork. Finally got it when I found a doctor who was themselves non-binary. I was on the edge of suicide before they prescribed it, like, literally had a plan for the following weekend if they had said no or jerked me around too. Now I'm the happiest I've ever been.
Well I certainly am sorry that you had such a bad experience but in all honesty it was the exact opposite for me so it is kinda hard for me to see the bad parts, like I certainly know that the healthcare system is not very pro trans but as I said I have yet to make a negative experience with any medical professionals considering the trans topic, but I can definitely understand your viewpoint. I also hope I didn't offend you in any way.
I grew up in rural Bavaria and actually moved out to Frankfurt because I probably would've had a similar experience as you if I'd tried transitioning in Bavaria. 
If you're anywhere close to Frankfurt, I got some recommendations, just hmu :)
Oh, I’d leave too lol, I’d seek asylum in canada or something
Yes it is

it’s nbd :)
According to a quick google search only 2% of the unions military was draftees
Who knows my dude? I didn’t say it serves no purpose, just that the purpose doesn’t justify taking away someone’s autonomy. I would fight to keep that autonomy, but not for a cause I don’t believe in.
We ain’t losing when u play a board game and someone gets mad they are losing they will try to cheat and try to flip the board we are strong and our strength is what helps me know I’m not going anywhere, we are stronger then others hate, always have been always will be.
Yeaah; draft isn't for self-defense; it's to round up any political groups that are against a big war, then send them poorly trained and underequipped to soak up bullets for the ""true believers"" that follow in the second wave.

America knows both firsthand and from observation what kind of soldiers draftees are, more often than not. And they wouldn't let them near anything worth using, they'd be fodder. Because for every draftee that wants to be a hero for their country, there's 10 more weighing the consequences of fragging their CO for ordering a suicidal maneuver.
It is almost never prosecuted. I think a lot of people don't register out of absence of mind or lack of knowledge of it tbh.

I used to work for a federally funded disability program. This has real consequences for people with disabilities or needing services later. That is the stuff that really hurts folks down the road, and it is not like you can register after you age out. you aren't able to at that time. I've also been asked for that document specifically multiple times when trying to just get a driver's license or some other randomly mundane thing, and only because I'm AMAB.

The constitutionality is up to date as the only reason SCOTUS let it stand was because women were not able to be in combat roles. That has since changed.
Was talking more about Donald but sure
Ah, it was for draft dodging. Now I get it, but still, brutal.
Facts
Yes but not in my area
Wdym by ""limits?""
the rest of the country isnt much better but thats where some of the most dangerous species are, such as a spider that can kill you in a matter of minutes and is exclusive to the region
Just don't live in NSW /j
But okay that's an understandable worry, but even there, there hasn't been a death from one in several years I think.
Thats nice to hear and im sorry for the shit and thoughts u had to go through
How would u offend me with any of that ?
I moved from bavaria aswell 👀 but nowhere near frankfurt

With an additional 6% being paid in by those who were drafted.
Yeah
Yeah the trans community is stronger than ever
Yeah it wasn't pretty lol
Start planning now. You can just up and leave one day. It typically takes years of paperwork and planning. 

It also takes a lot of money in most circumstances, if you are able, start saving, and I'd be ready to move it offshore quickly if things look bad. 

Of course, I'm unemployed and broke.  Unless I find a job soon, I'm SOL. (Junior Software Dev or Technical Support Engineer if I must, plz hire me)
Since its a relatively small country and they have a fuck ton of people who want to move there, they don't give out as many visas as most countries. So getting one is tough, they won't just let anyone who wants to come over.
Got it
Fair enough.... I have massive fear of Spiders so
I have no idea actually, I'm just really scared of any kind of confrontation so I'm usually really careful.
If you haven't yet, try to find queer/trans groups in your area; people there should be able to recommend accepting therapists/doctors near you. Alternatively, I bet queer organizations like Transmann e.V. can also help you out if you reach out to them!
[removed]
Being non-binary, I can dodge it
Hehe, samee, I've lived here my whole life and I hate spiders. Daddy Long Legs are fine, but all others are kill-on-sight for me. I've had a few spiders try to get me while in bed, and all that. Really gave me a fear of them too, but it's not enough to merit not living here, I love this place.

(It might help that I'm not too far of a drive from one of the hospitals around, too, means even in a worst case scenario, I'm not gonna die from a spider)
I shouldnt be allowed on the internet if i would get offendet by u saying that u didnt have the same problems as me 💀

Naw, I mean seriously the larger higher-risk issue with Australians is actually skin cancer, just because of how the sun is and how strong the UV is here (and it's okay, I kinda figured, I'm very used to the jokes about how dangerous it is here). Plus, we're not as bad as the US but I think there's still a slightly higher than normal heart disease risk? But we've still got a good average life expectancy too. And I know skin cancer is easy if it just gets treated/cut out asap, but yeah.

My grandma just did a new level of transphobia to me and I'm just perplexed at the lengths cis people will go to offend us	"For anyone's that does not speak a latin language (i speak Portuguese) most words are gendered and so are names, many times the same name can be used for the binary genders that way (not all names have an opposite version) like ""Gabriel"" and ""Gabriela""

Well my chosen name is Yasmin and it is a very feminine name that doesn't have a masculine version as far as I know. My grandma just called me ""Yasmeu"" essentially a masculinized version of my name and it kinda shocked me, where the fuck did she take that from? I asked her to try again and she repeated Yasmeu, she tried to make some excuse to explain her reasoning but I wasn't taking her shit so i just said ""that's not my name"" and disregarded everything else. 

I've never seen something like this, I'm just very confused why cis people go to such lengths to try and insult us?"	"Just tell her that you'll pray for her. The uno reverse card! Old people don't like to be out done on virtue signaling!
Best guess? They want to harm us because our existence makes them uncomfortable. Like a passive-aggressive retaliation to you living.
Just say ok grandpa in Portuguese and walk away
Because they think what we are doing is wrong and try to correct us with what they were raised to be right. I can't put the rest into words but basically they think we are the misguided ones.
Is there a case that she got confused (maybe she thought that the proper gender was M and tried to fit the name in that way)? I know the chances are slim. Anyways you responded in the best possible way! 
She bothered to offend you. I know many grandmas that will go to extreme lengths to just have it their way. 
Does Portuguese have only two genders in the language?
Isso... não foi uma piada... tem sim casos que as pessoas brincam com isso, e tem pessoas trans que não ligam, mas se ela só mandou essa, sem nem tentar brincar é meio chato, talvez você poderia transformar em uma brincadeira, mas não acho que foi o objetivo pra começo de conversa... só ignore, infelizmente ainda é sua vó😪
Its like the one person in work refuses to use my name and calls me browen and not Bronwyn
Good on you for taking no shit from her.

""Yasmeu"" é foda...
Portuguese speaker here to say that, despite liking both to speak and to study our language, this aspect of it sucks ass.
Yasmim é um nome lindo, só pode ser de uma mulher linda! Beijos e muita força :)
That's why I picked a name with no masc version lol
If this happens again just tell her that you'll pray for her to become a better, more accepting person
Old people have massive issues with LGBTQ+. It was never spoken about in their lives, and probably illegal. They cannot and will not accept. ❤❤❤
My wife is Brazilian and her grandmother who only speaks Portuguese is her absolute hugest supporter and the only one who's never even actually misgendered her or myself when I came out. I'm so sorry not all grandma's are as supportive. But good on you for not taking her transphobic bullplop.
WOW! Not cool grandma, not cool!
Foda isso, Yasmin. Espero que tu se sinta melhor.
They just can’t help themselves. I’m happy you stood your ground.
The transphobic father of one of my best friends invented has always heard me being called Adrián so he invented a deadname for me and calls me Adriana (which honestly doesn't even trigger my dysphoria, i just find it funny)
Why all people can't live with each other in peace?
I don't know, but Yasmin is a beautiful name
I do, in fact, speak a Latin language.

(By that I mean I am literally learning Latin)
>My grandma just called me ""Yasmeu"" essentially a masculinized version of my name

Maybe call her the masculine version of her name? Or call her the masculine version of something close to her name and keep on doing it till she calls you the right name
seeing things like this makes me so sad :/

(and btw are you Brazilian???)
Ugh people suck, I’m so sorry she did that to you…
I'd just stop associating w her. That's what I did with my family, best decision I've ever made
I'm gonna take a stance from the opposite view point here, just for sake of argument. Please bear with me.

first: However old your grandmother is, realize that she has that many years of habit built around gendered language.

second: As other people have said, she may just be from a time she never dealt with these things before.

With those in mind, It's going to largely be based on intent. Is your Grandmother intentionally trying to trigger your negative feelings? Is she trying to insult you? OR is she trying to accept you through decades of conditioning?

I know it hurts, and I know society is slow to adapt. But the question is: Are they trying?
I used to go to school with people like that, the best thing I found was to rally people around me and start relentlessly insulting them for being fucking idiots. I take it with a family member that'd be much more difficult.

Grandma don’t play that gender shit nonsense
Jesus nunca disse ""amai vós os outros, a menos que sejam trans"" 

Pode dizer que você sabe que Jesus ama ela, ainda que ela esteja se esforçando machucar seu próprio sangue
It’s so confusing why people do this. I know of 4 family members of mine that have changed their name, but aren’t trans. Yet when I change my name because I’m trans, my parents come up with excuses as to why they don’t want to use it. People are just so annoying and stubborn.
If I’m ever in a position like this (though I doubt it), my plan is to just ignore said person till they get the idea.
You could also tell her to go fuck herself. So what if she's old? That doesn't excuse people from being assholes.
Yes!!
LOL if I know Portuguese grandma's, this is an absolute winner
Goddamn 

CONFUSE THE TRANSPHOBES
Most likely. This is part of why I'm open and proud. If they want to be uncomfortable, I'll make sure they're uncomfortable.
YESS
Yes only two genders in the language. I don't think she mistaken anything or is confused, that name doesn't even exist as far as I know and it sounds ugly af, i can only assume she tried to masculinize it or make some word play that flew over my head, either i didn't even feel particularly offended, just shocked with the mental gymnastics to be transphobic lol
É, não sei se foi ou não piada ou se foi pra ofender, mas não dei bola, não no sentido de não falar nada, eu respondi incisivamente que esse não é meu nome e espero e fique por aí.
report them to hr
My name doesn't have a masc version, she just made it up, transphobes criativity has no bounds lol
Not all of them, my grandma accepted me immediately, she was better about it than some of my friends in their 20s
That’s definitely an over-generalization. My grandma was awesome in every way. She volunteered during the AIDS crisis and marched in Pride parades with her church. She was more understanding about my gender when I was 16 than my adult brother is now, almost ten years later. Age isn’t an excuse to be hateful.
Nah, there were people okay with LGBTQ+ people back then. They chose the hating something they don't understand path.
Not true. My father who is in his 70s I think, accepts me as a guy. He is an old guy. Then there is grandpa, grandma who also accepts me and my mom who is young (my family has a bad pasts with schools I would say and still has)
My grandmother was raised in segregated Alabama, would literally be ill at the sight of lgbt representation but she is one of my biggest allies now. It took a lot of time and conversations through my life but she has unlearned a lot of what she was taught and even sent me boxes of women's clothes to build up my closet when I came out as trans! Old folks are just regular folks from another time and totally can change
A lot of other replies point out that there are plenty of trans-accepting old folks and grandparents out there. Mine are some of them. But I would also like to gently point out that some older folks... Are also trans.

Trans =/= young. And it's unfortunate that many trans people die young, but there are older trans folks in all stages of their transitions all over the world, and it's a really unfortunate erasure to forget them in a broad generalization like this. I hope you reconsider.
This completely disregards older LGBTQ+ people and allies like my wife's grandmother. Overgeneralizations are hurtful, be better.
I agree my point was an over-generalisation. There are many wonderful and accepting older people out there. Apologies ❤❤❤
Idk if her intent was to offend or to make some word play with whatever, she often is reluctant to refer to me in the feminine, once I was all dolled up and the best she could say was ""you look like your sister"" (i hate my sister because she is also transphobic). Sometimes I can have good conversations with her about those things and sometimes she treats me as a woman fine but not long after forgets about it or whatever and it's back to make pronouns.

I really don't know what happened today, if it was just a mistake or confusion, i gave her an opportunity to correct herself and she doubled down so...
T. H. I. S. 

Trans people are literally so fucking cool, and I'm giga proud to be one. If anyone has a problem with that, they can sit on a cactus. I literally don't give a fuck—I'm fabulous.
Foda viu...
Also r/suddenlycaralho
Oh Jesus ._.
When my dad told my grandma, she ended up calling me and the excitement in her voice gave it away that my dad spilled the beans. She absolutely cannot wait for me to start transitioning and all that.
i agree but it’s when they refuse to change that sucks. my dad’s pretty stubborn (he’s also in his 70s for context) and pair that with constantly misgendering my partner and i and saying we’re both confused it’s frustrating and makes me want nothing to do with him. i’ve tried to talk it out with him several times and i even brought my therapist in as a mediator and he’s still never listened to me once, not really. it’s not that they can’t change, it’s that they refuse to.
Fuck yeah queen go off
Thank you for the most hilarious laugh I’ve had in quite some time!!!

I’m out (since May of 2021) and so proud of who I’ve become (my true self) and if anybody has a problem with that, they can (as you said - SIT ON A CACTUS)!!!!! I’m going to be my true self NO MATTER WHAT!!!
Right? I love being trans. I love the diverse life experience. I love reinventing myself exactly how I want to be with all the knowledge I have now. I love breaking stereotypes. I love the science and medicine of it all. I love boobs.

I sent my parents this selfie and they said i looked like a girl… I finally explained why and they responded super well!!		"you’re really pretty :D
That's amazing! And your absolutely beautiful!
Yay that's fantastic :) I'm super happy for you <3
happy to hear that!
Yay 🥳
You look beautiful and that is awesome!
Ursosupermegapretty.com xx
Yay!! Happy for you!! I recently came out to my parents and they’ve been very supportive and willing to learn. Glad to see this post :))
Again I see someone who looks cis on here.  There are so many people here doing amazing with their transitions.  I hope that I can do this good if/when I finally decide to present myself as female.  I saw the other comment about the eyebrows, and I want to say I’ve seen cis women with eyebrows like these, and they’re beautiful eyebrows.  Sure, thick eyebrows aren’t typically seen as feminine, but that’s because women with thick eyebrows typically pluck them enough to thin them out.  This look you have looks naturally beautiful, like you were born female, and it’s following unrealistic beauty standards like that which seems to make it harder for some to make themselves appear more female.  You’re beautiful, and don’t need to change a thing.
pretty 😊😍😊
Very, very pretty!!
Fit!
YES and you doooo, wow, I love your face :O seriously, and your eyebrows are so strong, and like... fierce??? oh I love them, do you have good brow muscles? you could get some serious expressions with them :o
Well done, i'm happy for you.  BTW, you look pretty.
Congrats on it going well!
I think they forgot the word GORGEOUS! 😆
You’re very pretty! :)
Good for you, girl! You're gorgeous!
You are a girl, and glad it sounds like they accept you for your true self!
As someone that just received the opposite, I’m SOOOOO happy for you. There are good people out there. Also cute selfie girl.
Man that’s great!
Woot!  You are so beautiful. You could the twin of my friend Karin.
Awesome news.
That's one way to come out <3  :)
Totally awesome!  You look fantastic, but I'm SOOO happy things went well.  I bet you are on cloud 9!
THATS AMAZING!!! Im so happy for you!!!!!
Oh that’s awesome! And you are really pretty
🤩🔥
is that a dimple i see? you look gorgeous 💚 and i’m happy for you! i’m glad they accept the real you
I see a Na tu ral woman (woman) - backup singers. They go everywhere with me. You are quite beautiful. Id kiss you on your neck just so you'd turn around to push me aw (WHAT???? Did i just go in for the kiss???  What a rascal.
you are gorgeous girl! get those brows done and you'll be a model!!
That’s amazing!! I’m so happy for you :D
😍😍 bless you
That is awesome... and you are super gorgeous 😍
Glad your parents took it well.  Do you think they already knew, or perhaps suspected you are Trans?
That’s fantastic hun. They should be proud of their new daughter
i thought you were cis!
Oh wow that's probably the easiest coming out story I ever heard. Also your beautiful
You are a girl babes
I agree.  And great point on the eyebrows.
yes.
The night is still young.
I do get my brows done. This is a weird backhanded compliment that was unwarranted.
That’s a weird thing to say. Like the eyebrows look fine. People have thick brows sometimes. It gives her a natural beauty look.
I have no idea what they're saying anyway! Your eyebrows look really good already, kinda envy you, mine aren't that good!"	r3jy1j	trans	2002	0.99	2021-11-27 18:45:09
My teacher thought I(ftm) was a guy	"For context, I’m a trans guy and got back to school after the lockdown, I cut my hair during lockdown and I also got a binder. So recently I had PE, me and three of my female friends were running late for class. When we finally arrived he told us that we were actually supposed to wait for him at a gate because of corona. We didn’t know that and he showed us where the class waited. He also explained that only 4-7 people could be in a single changing room (also because of corona). Then he told my three female friends to go to another changing room while I go into another changing room where some other guys would change. Then he recognized me and said “Oh wait sorry didn’t realize you weren’t a guy.” and told me to also change with my three female friends. One of the female friends who knew I was trans just gave me this smug look after she realized that he thought I was a guy. I didn’t come out to the teachers yet, but I’m so happy that I pass off as a guy!
(also sorry for bad English, it’s not my first language)"	"That's so great I'm really happy for you, you deserve to be recognized as who you want to be, and I wish you all the luck and love when coming out one day, and last thing your English isn't all that broken 💕❤
Remember this next time you feel disphoric or anxious going out in public. You pass well enough that someone who recognises you didn't realize.
as an ftm you already are a guy so the teacger just made a lucky guess bc you look so handsome
I love that for you. 🥰🥰
Awesome! But I’d recommend not wearing a binder during physical activity, it can hurt your chest. Binders can be dangerous, but worth it! Also I’d be so happy if that happened to me, but I’m not able to try and transition.
There were few times I was able to get away with looking cis, and it always sparks euphoria in me.
Same, 2 guys form like first grade came up to me and asked if I was ret*ar*ed I said “no” and then they asked if I was gay and I said “no” then they asked if I liked to kiss boys (seeing me as a guy) and I was like “no’ then they ran from me and laughed, not sure if I should take that as an insult or not lol
What ”they thought you are a guy”? No, they RECOGNIZED that you ARE A MAN.
Moments like these are so overwhelmingly uplifting to your self confidence, especially when you're not out 100%. Way to go brother!
He didn't THINK you were a guy, saying ""think"" makes it sound wrong. He KNEW you were a guy, and then changed his decision cause he was wrong.
Pssst

You ARE a guy 

❤️
happy for you
Yayy so happy for you~
Congratulations!
*sorry for bad English*

me: Wait.. what??? This is far from bad!
your teacher didn’t think you were a guy, he knew
Well your teacher thought you were a guy because you are one! Stand tall my friend! 🤘🏻
This think where teachers don't know their student and will gender them differently is so weird for me because our teachers know the students
Lets fucking goooooooooooo nice dude
POG U!

It is the best feeling in the world when this kind of stuff happens. I'm so happy for you!
congrats dude, that’s awesome
That is so exciting!! Thanks for sharing!

Also honey your English is far better than a lot of people who do have it as their first language.  You have nothing to worry about there either!
nice things happen sometimes, :)
Good job ! Next step is someone thinking you're a girl at first and then correcting themselves when they take a better look. Very satisfying.
Cheers to you. You have to celebrate the small victories. <3
i felt this all too well. i know the person who ""accidentally"" misgenders me probably feels bad about it, but they dont know that they're actually right
Congrats, gives you that little hope. I remember once in school we had an all female trip to a private school where female scientists etc. Where talking about their experiences and such to try help motivate girls or something. I decided to go because I don’t like school, I was wearing pants and had my hair cut at the time (we have a uniform so I was kinda just wearing a suit) me and a few friends got stuck in a pool of other girls looking for the toilet. A teacher stopped us said the female toilet was that way then asked if I needed the toilet. I nodded and he pointed me to the males. I wasn’t out at the time so I had to do the shameful “I’m a girl.” In front of loads of people, I hated it. I pass pretty well too.
That's the best kind of feeling - it's always great to pass!

Once someone I knew didn't recognize me at all, but later they came up to me like ""I know that voice!!""

Never again will I use you in public, voice 😭
Yeah, I always have a sports bra on me. And also good luck on your end :)
Oh yeah voice dysphoria is a hell of a thing.

The only time I get misgendered now is on the phone. Up-side, my auditory processing disorder means I *never* want to use the phone, and my wife frequently pretends to me me on phone calls that are unavoidable 🤣
Thanks! :D
I have selective mutism anyway, so I often don't speak in public because I can't. It just sucks that the one time I was actually able to talk someone ruined it by giving me dysphoria 😅
Oof, sorry to hear that it gave you dysphoria! Selective mutism sounds useful for the voice dysphoria 😁
Idk if useful is the right word haha, but it is a nice break/excuse since I'm not expected to talk to strangers (if I'm with someone they just say I don't talk much) although the entire thing is anxiety inducing and gets me into troublesome situations so it's not better than talking 😅
Yeah, I was mostly being a bit sarcastic with that hah

I totally get that! Anxiety has always been a huge detriment to everything for me as well
Oh sorry I'm not good with sarcasm 😅

my post was immediately taken down on a Christian subreddit	"hi so im trans and Christian, and I genuinely wanted to talk to other Christians and explain my experiences. I spent several hours crafting this long post explaining why I am the way that i am, and different scriptures I think help support the existence of trans individuals. i read through the subreddit's rules twice before i posted this, and almost immediately it was taken down. people just don't want to hear it and they don't want to learn. my post was not even considered to be kept up by the mods. it felt almost like the word ""transgender"" is a ban word on a bot, and it immediately deletes any post with that word. I'm so sick of this mistreatment from a community im supposed to love and be getting support from. i spent hours carefully crafting this post to make sure i said everything i wanted to say, exaclty how i wanted to say it. making sure what i was saying was not offending and encouraging of questions and discussion from people who just genuinely didnt understand. i even linked resources i used to come to different conclusions. i tried so hard to be heard and listened to and im so incredibly disappointed right now. anyways, this is just a vent because im just so tired to not getting to voice my story and experiences as a trans christian. id be happy to post that post here though if you guys would be interested in hearing it. i probably wont, but the offer is there i guess. im just so sick of everything."	" That makes me so upset. 

I had a talk like this with my mom the other night and she effectively said “I don’t care who you are so long as you respect my religion around me” basically saying don’t bad mouth god and she went on to tell me she loves everyone and would never turn anyone away no matter what they may be. My grandmother was the exact same way, when she found out I was friends with a transgender person (before I came out) she told me “you be good to him (ftm guy) because this world is hurtful and I know you  well enough to treat him good” 

Christians are supposed to be like that. Like my mom and grandma, loving people, there are so many who really are that way but unfortunately they aren’t spoken very loudly.  

I’m sorry that happened to you :(
Check out r/TransChristianity

Edit: and check out this trans theologian’s work: [Austen Hartke](http://austenhartke.com/)
I don't know which subreddit it was, but yeah that sucks.

Check out r/OpenChristian, r/TransChristianity, and r/GayChristians, if you haven't already.

For the record, r/Christianity is a mixed bag in my experience and r/TrueChristian is super toxic.

Please know that you are loved and supported. As a fellow trans Christian, please also know that you are not alone.

Edit: Also, for what it is worth, I'd love to see what you wrote, if you still have it. I spend a lot of time here on Reddit advocating for trans inclusion in the church and supporting other LGBT+ Christians. So, I'd love to see any resources you might have!
No it’s ok. You’re are absolutely right to feel the way you do and if you’re religion is important to you, no one can suggest otherwise. Keep being yourself and follow your convictions regardless of what others think. Not Christian btw but everyone is entitled to their beliefs and to be free from discrimination. Maybe one day will live in such an open society :)
Reddit mods are a bunch of wannabe HOA presidents.
I’d be interested in reading your post. I’m trans and Christian and this has been an area of struggling for me.
Honestly, you don't need em anyway. There are better communities for you to be a part of, such as the Christian trans sub.

Unfortunately, like all major establishments, the bulk of Christianity will take issue with you. For religion, it's not just a science or logic thing or whatever, it's also a moral thing. You simply won't be getting many people to agree with you as long as you're trans. 

This is why we fight. Not because we want to, but because we are forced to. Sorry you're seeing this happen within your community. It's a cruel lesson to learn that we're hardly accepted anywhere.

Surround yourself with good people, rather than arguing with bigots. I promise it'll be a better use of your time.
The people your dealing with are so brainwashed. I'm former Christian conservative that left the religion and the party about the time trump was elected. The Christianity I grew up with is now considered socialism. I'm gen x and my generation just flat out gave up on trying to change things. You'll never get through to them or change their minds. It's terrible to say this but once the boomer generation and the later half of my generation retire shut up or pass on things will change for the better. Don't give up. Millennials and gen z are going to change the world. Sorry for punctuation I'm stoned.. but I really wanted to tell you from my personal experience that your voices will be heard. But trying to change someone's dumb ignorant opinion is futile.
here is a google doc i made of my post. it has everything word for word as the original porst that got taken down for anyone who wants to read it.

[google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qOyeY-aSQQk3i142VrLCuLL5k80lHehY3Xsm_FKFU0/edit?usp=sharing)
I'm sorry you have to keep dealing with this, I'm non-religious myself, so I can only imagine the disappointment and isolation you must feel. I don't like saying it, but the reputation isn't unearned, and is why a lot of us non-christian trans people do our best to avoid those spaces. That said, there's already a lot of posts here pointing you to the new subreddit, I think you'll find a lot of what you're looking for there, both for faithful and trans support. Best wishes to you in your journey!
I'm a trans Christian too and unfortunately most people who label themselves as Christian are honestly worse about handling faith than just about anyone. The more pious and in your face someone is with their Christianity, the less they act as Jesus teaches. Just a shitload of Bible-thumping and hate-spewing.

Jesus taught love, acceptance, and kindness to others, NOT using what should be good and constructive (religion) as a weapon to destroy the lives of innocents. Coming from a trans woman raised very, very close to the Bible Belt. The people on that sub are ""Christians,"" not real believers. If they were, they'd show at least the most basic decency and listen to you before the ban.

From one transgender Christian to another, you are seen and you are loved. Jesus sides with those who show acceptance and care, not those who continue to try and drive wedges between people and cause pain. Stay strong, friend. You have my respect for trying so hard to teach others we're not bad and for trying to bridge the gaps of understanding.
Also a Christian here, I just genuinely don't want anything to do with anyone of my religion that doesn't understand it or at least tries to... Everyone I met was offensive, disrespectful, uninterested and genuinely said I am an incarnation of a sin.

So for me I just follow my beliefs totally excluding myself from any church. The only person who is sorta religious and understands me is my boyfriend and that's it.
I’m sorry you faced this. It’s not right.

You deserve to have your beliefs and practice them free of bigotry.

I would remind you that Christianity is not a monolith, every individual community is going to be different. There are trans-celebrating Christian groups out there.

I wish I had some to offer, but my wife and I are Jewish atheists 😋
I’m a Christian as well sister! Sad to say, the same religious groups that are rejecting LGBT+ HUMAN BEINGS, are the same religious groups who would brutalize groups of color, and them tell them that Jesus loved them. Jesus DOES LOVE YOU, ME, AND ALL OF US! Hatred, alienation and rejection often clothes itself with a cross around its neck.
[deleted]
Yeah most ""Christians"" aren't actual Christians. They just take the title to make themselves seem better than they really are.
I'm sure there are many other trans Christians who are experiencing the same thing, it's disgusting how people are so quick to dismiss others.
The worst christians are the christians, a sentance I already hear. It mean that a lot of christians don't actually follow what the Holy Bible say, like love and respect your neightboor and things like that. God is love and love you my brother
Hey, I’m a graduate student studying the intersection of religion/spirituality and transgender identity! I just want to say that you are absolutely right that religious belief is stigmatized within the queer/trans community (of course queerness is also stigmatized within mainstream Christianity and other religions) and you aren’t alone in trying to think through this. I’d love to see the post you wrote and how you interpret scripture to affirm your trans self if you’re willing to share it via DM or direct me to another place where you’ve posted it!
I would love to talk to you of you want i am also Christian.

It's a shame that a good percentage of Christians must make Jesus wonder why he ever even bothered.
Former christian here, their support and acceptance will always be performative, always teetering on the edge and will fall off the cliff on the slightest offense. Never will a christian practice the teachings of the bible.  Their whole religion is built on man made lies.  How any reasonable rational, clear minded secure person could be a christian baffles me.
Definitely look into different types of churches. Some of the newer churches specifically state that they accept the LGBT community. That way u can have a community of ppl that accept you that you can talk to about things.
Sounds like one of the most stupid things done by your own community. I really don't get why people think you can't be lgbtq+ and christian or religious in general. Like yeah there are christians who want to treat lgbtq+ people badly but that doesn't mean all of them do. Hope you get the recognition you deserve, OP.
Im in the same boat as a trans Christian  since my Christianity is very different from a conservative fundamentalist's. I protest on campus with a trans flag with a cross on it and people think in trying to be deliberately inflammatory, I'm just trying to be genuine. If you want to talk about ideas between transgender and Christianity go ahead and message me since I mostly just explain myself to people who don't understand the concept.
I'm really sorry if this sounds harsh, but being a person outside of the norm doesn't usually mesh with religious communities. The post you made sounds like the internet equivalent of going to a community church event and trying to discuss trans issues with random people.

You can find plenty of Christian communities that specifically say they are LGBTQ positive, though, so seek those out, and don't give up!! I'm sure you'll find your people :)
as a satanist, here's some advice. if they don't respect you, get better friends.
Have you tried r/radicalchristianity ? I saw that it's a little more inclusive. If youswant to talk about queerness it might not get taken down there.
I was raised in the “church”. I saw the hypocrisy. Now I’m 40. I no longer go to church. I want to watch the “church” be brought to justice and then destroyed for the betterment of mankind.
I'm sorry to hear this, though I'm not surprised. I hope you can find what you need in that community.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V0u3nEsmJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V0u3nEsmJI)

pretty much sums it up
No shit.
Tbh, this is the reason I left the church I grew up in. I still believe most of the same things, but I just can't stand the majority of christian circles
I’m sorry this happened to you. It really irritates me how some Christians cherry pick verses from the bible to be really strict about, then totally let other verses go. I seriously doubt most people who believe trans people shouldn’t exist because of what the Bible says are strictly adhering to biblical advice about diet and dress. They’re just using the Bible as a front for their own hang ups and discomfort. Love to you from Michigan.
But to think about it… they are supposed to love you. 

You can see the difference between the espoused beliefs and their true behaviors
I gave up on Christianity when I was 11 at the hands of the Catholic Church.  You can probably guess why.  So I can only give my perspective as someone that wants nothing to do with religion.

My experience has been many Christians have an agenda that supersedes the true intent of their faith.  These people cannot be reasoned with.  They will force their dogma on everyone they can.  You don't have to look far to see this happening in the US.

If you are looking for Christians that will listen, you'll need to find another sub that's more open.  Or take your message to another support site.  I know they are trans Christian support sites and blogs out there.  You could also spin up a blog of your own and start promoting it on various social media.

The other possibility is to reconsider the message you want to convey.  Instead of trying to convince skeptics with words, convince them with actions.  Walk your talk, as they say.  People will notice and realize you aren't a threat.
Christian has almost become a 4 letter word.
This attitude, common among the religious, is one of the reasons I no longer call myself a Christian. 

If you are looking for a Christian church that accepts trans people, I was told that the Evengelical Lutheran Church in Canada has a program to minister to the unique needs of the trans person. But, I haven't experienced it first hand yet.
I mean, religions are reactionary in nature and it's no surprise that many christans are bigots who are against trans people. There's not much you can do, honestly 🤷🏻‍♀️
Religion is a fool's errand. I can promise you, the silly little scholars that wrote the bible would not be accepting of you. Just give up religion, the shit's stupid anyway.
This is part of a larger narrative of why I simply don't like religion in general.

A lot of people use religion as a ""get out of jail free"" card for their bigotry/ignorance/lack of moral fiber, anything they don't like is immediately disregarded and any arguments to the opposite are considered a personal attack by them.

I used to be confused as to why trans people support Christianity and its many sects, and I still am to a point.

Don't get me wrong, if someone is religious and trans, I wish you the best of luck and happiness, and I'll never attack you personally for it, I just don't get it. 

So yeah, I'm always up for hearing people's justifications for being trans AND Christian, because my opinion is that it's hard to justify, not impossible, just difficult. 

I've argued with trans Christians in the past due to my own short sightedness on the issue, and partly due to my own intense dislike for religion, and especially Christianity, because of people's propensity to use it as an excuse to do harm.
With all due respect, coming from an ex Christian, they can be so incredibly toxic and it’s likely that the majority is going to be bigoted
Sadly, this doesn't surprise me at all. With the greatest of respect to yourself, Christians have persecuted minorities for centuries. Until eventually their opinions become so unwelcome that they have to reform their own beliefs to reflect a more 'modern' perspective... It's happened throughout history since the birth of Christianity.

For what it's worth, I was a Christian too at one time. But I can't abide by their hypocrisy I'm afraid.
My grandma is Christian and that’s the only reason I haven’t come out. They’re all the same. She loves her grandchildren, but to hear her say “I love gays and transgender people! But as long as they’re not my grandchildren.” about a year before I actually made the decision (I changed my pronouns to he/him yesterday so I’m relatively new to the community, but I have 2 other FTM school friends I’m hanging out with) is just absolutely absurd. It’s not “disobeying god” if you don’t want to be who you are anymore. My family supports LGBTQ+, but the REASON I’m only coming out TO OTHER KIDS and NOT MY OWN FAMILY is because if grandma knew, she would be angry. She might not exactly HATE me, but she’ll definitely lose trust in me.
Yeah, sadly I'm not surprised. You may have better chances for a fruit bearing discussion on a sub that isn't labeled ""christian"" (or any other *phobic religion) but rather something more theological/ethical/philosophical, meaning people actually working with the scripture instead of only using religion as a power fix or for easy answers.

As an atheist myself I do find organized religion mostly embarrassing, not necessarily the people believing in whatever god(s) they want, but the organisations itself.
We just had some great coming-out from people inside the church here in the country and it's shocking that the church as the only employer has the right to take a dump on equality laws and replace them. If they do, I hope the current trend of people quitting their membership getting even faster (though it's possible it goes unnoticed as there are already more people quitting each day than the bureaucracy can handle).
I am really sorry to heard that but you are absolutely right. Christians are so post to be loving of all people and welcoming. 

I was raised Christian and my family and school friends were all Christian, I went to a Christian school btw. When I came out as trans, I could no longer goto my church and I lost all my friends that were religious. It took some time for my parents to come around but they are more of the ""love everyone"" Christians, they just didn't understand why I am trans. Unfortunately this is a somewhat common experience for lgbtq+ people in religious communities. I'm not saying its impossible to exist in a Christian community and be trans but it will most likely be difficult and full of experiences where people don't want to learn or listen.

I wish you good luck and I think you are very strong to be able to keep believing in Christianity through all of this.
I'm not trans but I grew up in the southern US with family dyed in the blood of the lamb and all that good stuff. Leaving all that behind has never been anything but a positive experience for me.
Please do post it here. I don’t think it’s fair to remove a post as Christians should be able to share their thoughts freely and decide for themselves what to integrate into their own perspectives.

I’m also genuinely curious about the verses in support of transgenderism as I’ve only read on the topic in relation to the demons (e.g., Baphomet).
U know the bible hates everyone whos not straight?
I’ve heard r/radicalChristianity is a welcoming sub? idk from experience
I'm sorry that happened. I would be happy to read it
As a fairly religious Christian & has a trans partner who is not Christian or even religious. I support him. Whether or not he believes. I do also ask that he respect me and my belief in Christ. I’m here to talk with OP. I was not put on this earth to judge so I try my best not to. So sorry to hear about those other people.
F\*\*\*ing Christians! Exactly why I hate them and their God of Abraham!
Ahh it's so sad reading this. Not because they are not accepting, why would you think otherwise, but because you're christian
Don’t be mad only creates bitterness I’m not on the whole religion train it’s a relationship with the father a lot of the Christian people and church won’t be excepting and myself I’m ok with that totally there right
Christian mom here with a trans teenager. It makes me so angry when people use my faith to judge and malign people they consider “other”. 

Whoever you are, you are sacred. Don’t let anyone take that from you.
I could see them blanket banning it because of a bunch of bigots constantly shitting on trans people, so if anything it might have been to protect against that.
Thank you for 6his post ,you are valid,and so is your opinion

Hi, I am non-religious so excuse me if I say anything ignorant.

I think that it’s just sort of a divisive topic within secular belief right now… There are many Christians that would love you and support, I hope you can find them. 

“Transgenderism” has kind of been under a relentless attack by Right/Conservative media, both alternative and mainstream, which has a very large Christian demographic naturally… so… unfortunately, the way transgenderism is portrayed there can bleed into parts of the Christian community. 

So, yeah, sorry your faith has been getting attacked… I hope it gets better.

No matter what you deserve to be heard and appreciated, I’m so sorry.
Your heart is in thevright place.  Im sorry this happened to you. I hooe my story helps. For context, Im a Transwoman and fiercely support and defend our community.  Ive stopped usage of Transwoman. Im a woman. I dont need the prefix.  My life became less stressful once that realization happened. 
I wish you peace and happiness.
You should post it here or in mtf or wherever. I’m sorry anyone made you feel shitty. 

For what it’s worth: I don’t think there is any basis to see anything sinful being trans in scripture. Sure, there’s a command to not have homosexual sex, but that’s not trans stuff. 

There’s that crack about not cross dressing, but I read that more as a direct command from YHWH to live in keeping with your gender identity. Det. 22:5.  The plain text reading of that is the Lord that God finds trans people staying in the closet to be abominable. Which is harsh, but it is a deeply upsetting thing to do. 

(Though even that passage I think is inapplicable since it’s more about worship service attire, but it’s the only thing on point about gender expression in the canonical books of the Bible.)
Dam that pisses me off!

I want to be trans, but my parents are Catholic and strict 

&#x200B;

dont know how i'll convince them that I really want to change my gender 

&#x200B;

I want to express myself in different ways!   

Im worried and scared af
Christian is a very broad term. For example you have American Christians who are borderline fundamentalist and then you have European Christians who are much more mellow, open minded and accepting. In America Christians are taught to fear God and to follow the Bible. In Europe Christians are taught to Love God as He Loves them and to certainly read the Bible should they want to, but also to take it with a pinch of salt, since y'know it's like 1500+ years old and been rewritten, mistranslated, edited and changed many times to fit certain viewpoints and politics over the centuries. I assure you that should you seek support in a European Christian group (Catholic or Protestant) you'd find the support you're looking for.
My wife is trans, my eldest kid is NB … and God told me several years ago to go to a particular church. That church (Episcopalian) is welcoming and inclusive of their lgbtqia members and some of our fiercest advocates come from that community. So Jesus followers are out there that will love you. But we both come from homeschooled, fundie backgrounds so I know exactly what you’re talking about … and it breaks my heart. I have the verse where Jesus tells people woe unto you if you keep my children from coming to me going round in my head … and I feel the USA churches are going to have a major reckoning in their future (not that that helps people now). Anyway. I don’t know you but I love you and so does God, and there are Christian communities out there that will love you and embrace how wonderful you are♥️
I’m so sorry. I’m a Catholic trans dude and working on becoming a theologian myself, and it’s super shitty of them to silence you like that :( 
I’d love to read what you wrote!❤️

Edit: typo
Please do post it here!
Assuming you still have access, post what you wrote here! We’ll be happy to give you the time of day no matter what their mods think. At least your efforts won’t go *completely* to waste that way
I had a similar experience on r/AITA, but its probably for the best since people dont listen anyways and most people would probably put an angry comment on your post the moment they see a ""woke word"" anywhere outside of a trans/lgbt safe space. I know it sucks that you spent all of that time and effort making a post just to have it autoremoved, but if it didnt get autoremoved the backlash from the people in the subbreddit might have been worse.
trans Christian here. i'm sorry that happened.. i understand how frustrating it is. my family is the same way. not only do they not respect my identity as a queer person, but when i try to explain to them *how* i can be both a Christian and queer, and that it's not a sin, they *refuse* to listen. they are more interested in keeping the status quo and believing the traditional interpretation that they've been taught rather than being *objective* and at least listening to the interpretation i've found that looks at the original language, wording and context rather than a flawed translation.

it's disheartening, but stay strong. there will be people who will listen, understand and accept you and the truth ❤
I would be happy to engage in conversation with you about your being transgendered and your Christian faith. I am also both Christian and transgendered. To me, they definitely go well together!
After all the shit I've been through with being trans, I stopped believing in god. But I do feel bad for what happened, I am interested to see the post though.
Sorry you had to go through this. It’s stuff like this that made it easier for me to leave religion behind. That being said this is not say you should do the same. I’m just some idiot on the internet, I’m not here to challenge your beliefs.
Can I see your post that you posted in the Christian post?
While I still consider myself spiritual, believe in God etc, I am no longer religious. I have had past experiences one was directly involved with my church, which I was becoming highly involved with at the time. I have family and friends that are or were in the restaurant industry and people that go to church or are very vocal about their Christianity on average (not all of them) are some of the meanest people to deal with and don't listen to ANY reasoning even from the bible. Its a horrible feeling to deal with and is difficult to find people to talk to about it.

If you ever want to chat I'll be happy to talk! I'm not trans but have trans friends and I feel everyone should be treated equally!
I’m trans and Christian too and I would love to see your post it would be helpful to me if you could send it to me
https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2020/12/12/little-known-history-transgender-saints
I admit it's something I've struggled with, as a fellow trans Christian. I'm just glad to know I'm not alone, tbh.

Also I'm curious if you posted it anywhere else? I'd really like to read what you wrote, if you've still got it
It's such a shame they would remove your post but if you could re-tailor it slightly it might be wonderful to have here!
Christians have always been more hateful than Christ. I’m sorry. :( You might want to try r/Episcopalian for some acceptance and support.
My episcopalian church is pro trans. We're an off shoot of catholcicism. Brick walls, stained glass, and varnished pews, a classical aesthetic with a modern orthopraxis. You might like it.
FYI, I provided a very sincere response to something, and because i mentioned im tg, someone went ballistic and im now banned permanently from Christianity.  You're not alone.

I also mentioned to someone in FTM that a binder might cause them to have muscular and or skeletal problems if they wear it too long, that's been well noted. Apparently one of my messages went to a FtM TERF person and she (or, rather, he - sorry) bitched to a mod and so I got banned from that as well.

I'm now withdrawing ever so slowly from everything in Reddit and from Life in general.
I would definitely love to read this post of yours. It sounds excellent. :3
So much for Christianity being about love.
It is sad to see this but not surprising. I also identify as a Trans follower of Christ. I recently had former pastor from a conservative church I stopped attending 2years ago try to contact me about my ""trans struggles"". Most Christians are more interested in pointing out the sins of others and fall well short of demonstrating the love of Christ.

Do you still have your post? I would love to see your points as I was going to look for ways to combat typical Christian ""biblical arguments"".
I'm also Christian, and can't stand Christian subs. They're almost exclusively owned by conservative extremists, and don't really believe we belong in Christian spaces.

I tend to stick exclusively to explicitly liberal or queer spaces, or spaces of my specific denomination.

As a side note, I totally want to read what you wrote!
O hun 🫂🫂 well I think everyone here wood love to here it even if thay won’t and it my reach uves avenchl with eney luck :)
Remember True Christianity is loving and accepting EVERYONE. NO MATTER WHAT.

Any ""Christians"" that hate anyone, for any reason, aren't Christians, they're cultists

A bit of an extreme example of being a true Christian is say a guy kills someone, and the parents of the murder victim forgiving them, sure they could despise them to their very core but we aren't here to judge others, we're hear to enjoy this beautiful planet
Have you ever you read the stuff in there before this? You’d get the same reaction if you said you’re a satanist.
It stuff like this that made me question a lot of things. Like why is a serial murder considered equal to acting outside of your assigned stereotypes? Or if the bible was fake what incentive would its writer have? Is there evidence for or against the beliefs I hold? The just what though about when going through something similar.I hope find loving friends and I hope things change for the better.
If you have it saved, I would absolutely love to hear it. I'm sorry that happened to you.
It was removed in 11 seconds, so yeah, I'm pretty sure posts with transgender in them are an instant removal
I understand. It's been one of the most painful things of my life to feel like I'm a part of two worlds but don't belong to any, or like these worlds conflict and that I'm inherently an enemy to both because of my nature. When I'm not ostracized, I feel like my acceptance is conditional upon not acknowledging or sharing my queer and Christian identity. With these struggles, its been hard for me to accept that I truly can belong to both and that they can exist as one inside my identity. I still struggle with this a lot. Thanks for sharing. Maybe it's just me, but it feels like it's just a slim and lonely intersection of queer and Christian. So thanks for sharing.

Also if you haven't posted it here already (I haven't checked) and if you still have that post, I would love to read it edit: (okay I found the post in the comments)
[removed]
Disclaimer: This is the super harsh reality of why your post was immediately taken down. Welcome to the fangs of righteousness. I do NOT hold any of these beliefs. Not at all. Zero zilch nadda goose egg. Mods, if you have a problem then please tell me to take my comment down instead of suddenly banning me.

""But AnotherGlum, God made you perfect. Just the way you are. Why would you destroy the body that God gave you? Are you doubting that he made you in his image? Are you saying that your omnipotent and all knowing Lord made a mistake? Young lady, you're possessed by a male demon and he's tricked into thinking you're a man. It's best that we call an exorcist to save your soul. We want to see you in Heaven as a beautiful angel.""

This quote made possible and paid for by your local pastor, priest, and minister. I was raised a southern baptist honey. I know ALL of their phrases, mentalities, and head games. I'm a cisgender gay and I was bitten HARD by xtianity when I came out at 15. I can't possibly imagine what would've happened if I had come out as transgender. Some xtians aren't as cutthroat as what I paraphrased above BUT even if they don't say these things, they're always thinking them. ""Now praise the Lord, for he has risen indeed."" And make it sincere or else face the fires of hell.
I use to be christian myself. I do believe in God but I don't believe in 99% of all the man made lies. Like some words that have been changed on the Bible. For example ""Church"". The original word was Congregation, not church! They are 2 different things. I study different religions all my life and still do.. it's like my side hobby and the more i study them all, the more i understand the jig saw puzzle of ""God"". I ended up being shia Muslim and also trans. I still look like the tipical American and i stay quite and keep my beliefs btw me and God. There's mentions on the Bible about eunuchs and even Jesus talked nice things about them. Muslim Caliphates through out history also had eunuchs working with other women in their palaces. Although they were not on hrt, they would be castrated young and All the male hormones won't affect them. All my years of being Christian i have never ever ever heard a mention about them which makes me wonder if people are being selective on what to teach and what not to teach. I live a tipical life and I'm not much religious to be honest but when I think of God I'm proud to say that i have more information in my brain about God (Allah) than most of these old coots. Just don't worry about it. Just believe for you and keep it all to you. Remember if there is a God which i believe there is, keep it for you and lock yourself in a room and pray by yourself like the bible says. Don't be like the others doing it for show. May you be blessed and ignore the wolf's in sheep clothes 🕊️
No hate like Christian love
Damn, Im sorry...
I am atheist, but I have some friends who are indeed  Christians and they, I think, understand that being trans is nothing wrong in their religion.
Have a nice day, stay strong and feel better
 - Rita
No books needed to find god, just your heart. There is no need for middle men. Just saying...
I’m a Christian and would love to read what you posted
...and when abrahamic believers use logic and realise that their God being is non-binary and pansexual, they are like 😲.
I'm also a transgender christian and I'm so sorry this is has happened to you. It's annoying too when people say we are cherry picking the bible just so that we can live how we want. If God doesn't make mistakes than being trans can't be one of them.
Total shot in the dark here... you think maybe the word ""transgender"" is banned because Christians are transphobic and might use the word for ill will? I personally dont trust Christians to be that smart but hey 🤷🏼‍♀️ why are people so quick to come to their own conclusions smh
I'm Trans. Definitely not Christian. Curious how that works with your beliefs
I'd really be interested in seeing the original post, sounds like you did a really good job on it, sorry you were treated that way.
Didn't that Jesus of Nazareth guy advocate loving others as you'd have them love you? He kept it simple and didn't propose a ton of rules and laws to exclude folks as if they were black Democrats in Texas who are only trying to vote. It's like a friend once said to me in support of our non-christian status, ""What's the point of being a christian if you don't get to smite someone""?? Look around, Hon', you'll find a christian congregation that will accept you with open arms. Banging your head against the crowd you've been having problems with will only frustrate you, not to mention give you one helluva headache.
You may feel more comfortable at r/TransChristianity
One of the reasons I became satanist is just how hateful they are. I never got as much hate from anyone as from those with crosses on their necks. Also of course they don't want to learn. If they had critical thinking skills they wouldn't even believe in the first place
I’m sorry that you had such a backlash on a Christian subreddit. Honestly, I feel like we should  be praying for those Christians whose hearts are so hardened they can’t even listen to a different view point.

I’m a trans Christian, and unfortunately most Christians I’ve tried to explain it to either don’t understand the Biblical arguments, or subscribe to backwards cultural beliefs about gender.

I had a well-meaning friend suggest that I “just get closer to God“.   
‘Deepening my relationship with Jesus is always a good thing, but it‘s not going to cure dysphoria. That’s like telling someone to pray their cancer away.
You may have to walk your path in terms of religion on your own til you find someone to listen to you. I have my own beliefs apart from tradition
I really doubt most of the people calling themselves ""Christian"" actually are. My thoughts are that Jesus was forgiving and accepting of all of humanity and all its foibles. These people that hate/reject/scorn because of what another person is do not follow Jesus' teachings. 

I'm not a scholar. These are just my beliefs.
A follower of Jesus Christ here and I love you. Jesus tells us to love one another unconditionally and not JUDGE! Jesus never once said anything against LGBTQ+. He said love one another as you love yourself. We are to love one another because Jesus loves us. Remember, there are a lot of people out there who call themselves ""Christian"" yet wouldn't know the teachings of Jesus if it bit them in the, well, you know. I stopped calling myself ""Christian"" yrs ago when the RT Wing hypocrite's highjacked my faith. You don't need other's to validate you, you validate yourself.
personally I'm an atheist and don't know any christian spaces, but I hope you can find a sub that's accepting <3
While I am not transgender, I do come from a very “conservative Christian” household. For reference they are evangelical. After going to high school and getting a lot more perspective on the world and everything, I began to question all the beliefs I had before. I actively fought my parents over things like gay rights, BLM, why the system america has favors the rich vs the poor ect. I never got through to them because their beliefs are more important to them then how other people feel. They do not have any empathy for people who are different then they are, and actively fight against them because(it’s not gods way). It’s very infuriating and heartbreaking to watch s community that is supposed to love and support people have no empathy for people who don’t fit their view of god’s will.

I’m very sorry that happened to you. And I would gladly listen to what u have to say
Damn, that is not very christian of them (assessed by a religion minor, church volunteer youth worker, ex-lutheran). I'd be interested in hearing what you wrote. I assure you, there are good christians out there, it sucks that so many of us get these interactions with the ones who judge unfairly. Much love to you.
If more Christians gave a fuck about their damn religion maybe I’d give them some respect, but as far as I’m concerned if they ain’t gonna follow their own rules and twist them to attack me they can go fuck themselves, the only Christians I respect are already good people, the religion has nothing to do with it so fuck the religion. And this ain’t got shit to do with the religion or the beliefs, god could be real, could not be, but I ain’t concerned with that, the people make the religion and the people can go fuck themselves
I’m so sorry for this): it’s sad that Some Christians are so closed minded. I’m also trans and believe in God. It’s been really hard though. I’ve struggled a lot with knowing if God loves and accepts me since I’m trans. I would love for you to post that post here (: I wish so called Christian’s would would be more open and loving. Just cuz they claim being a follower of God don’t mean it’s true. You will know them by their fruits. Not by what they claim. In my experience most people that claim to know God don’t show it with their actions. Just know you are loved by God! And just because your trans don’t mean you can’t have a friendship with God. ANYONE can be close to God if their heart is open to that. ❤️
Try, but don't retry to explain yourself to people who are committed to misunderstanding you. 

You didn't choose to be born with the gender identity that you have and the body that you are in, or to experience dysphoria. But they choose to be hateful and hide behind the name of Christ to justify their ignorance and hate. 

Don't waste your time on haters, life is beautiful, live it to the fullest.

❤️
That's so amazing to hear your family is accepting and loving like that. I can't say the same about my family. I have yet to medically transition because im still not out to my family. But this gives me a slimmer of hope that I'll find a family who is this loving if my own family rejects me.
This 100%. The worst Christians who are so judgmental, fearmongering and close-minded are the farthest from the spirit of Jesus’ teachings they could possibly be.
My sister just told me I was going to hell and couldn't explain why besides ""It feels like a sin""
I love your Mom and Gram's! 💕💕
Thank you! It just sucks that i have to find a specific christian community that will accept me. But i will definitely look into this!

Also, when I say r/Christianity is a mixed bag, I mean that there are a lot of queerphobic people there, but there are also LGBT+ affirming people too. At least one mod is trans!

Judging from your profile, I'm guessing that the sub you are talking about is r/Christians. I don't know much about it, but, judging from it's statement of faith, it is not the most inclusive subreddit. It seems to be focused on a rather specific version of Protestant Christianity, despite the name (which is not necessarily surprising).
thank you!! <3
Hopefully. I just really wanted to reach those who don't understand LGBT struggles. Hopefully I'll get the chance one day though.
I could pm it to you if you'd like?
I'm not christian and I'd still like to read the post.
yeah, i get that. thats the whole reason i wanted to make that post in the first place, was to just talk with them. i did want to try and change their views, i just wanted to talk to them and explain my experiences. but they didn't even give me a chance which i half expected. just surprised me that how quick it got taken down, almost like bots are scanning for lgbt posts in that subreddit to take them down whenever they appear. 

i hope there will be a time when im alive when things change for the better for us.
You express yourself so well! I hope you’ll find a place where Christians will listen to your testimony and open their hearts and minds to what you have to say.
Thank you, and best wishes to you as well!
Thank you so much. This means the world to me!
\*disenfranchised trans Christian hugs\*
Thank you! This means a lot. But I'm a trans man so probably not best to refer to me as sister lol, but i didn't specify in my post so I'm not offended, don't worry!
yeah i get where you're coming from. i also wasnt too surprised when it got taken down, more so surprised on how fast it was taken down. i wont let people like this ruin my faith though. the only validation i need is from God Himself. I can try to get people to understand and tolerate me and my experiences, but if they don't even want to listen there's nothing more i can do except to just pray about it tbh. still just needed to vent about it, and getting all this feedback and discussion in the comments of this post is just what i wanted. I never wanted to force them to change their views, i just wanted to talk to them. but sadly a lot of them just dont want to even listen to you.
I've posted the link to a Google doc that's has it somewhere in the comments under this post, I'm not at my computer right now to link it under this comment. If you're not able to find it, i will link it here when i get the chance!

This Christian meme sub is a new one! Thank you so much!
Cool thanks!
THIS is WHY I am NOT RELIGIOUS. If I were religious, I wouldn’t BE ABLE TO BE A BOY. I WANT to be a boy and HAVE made myself a boy. I do NOT WANT to be religious and I. AM. HOW. I. WANT. MYSELF. TO. BE. YOU CANNOT CHANGE HOW I AM. I AM HOW I AM. IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN, THAT IS OK. But you do NOT have the right to tell me WHO I AM. I am NOT A GIRL ANYMORE. Transgender people DO NOT DISOBEY GOD. A MAJORITY OF CHRISTIANS are disobeying god by NOT ACCEPTING US WHO WE ARE. (I don’t know the Bible but surely it’s not right to tell people who they are and not who they want to be?)
Got any quotes to support that?
Did you delete the quote you responded with? Because it seems you did. 

It's a bigoted quote though, and does support your sentiment, but I don't believe it mentions transgender stuff.

I literally said i was Christian and you still thought posting this comment was a good idea? I mean,, idk what you were going for with this comment but it was not helpful lol
Wow, it's almost like you accomplished absolutely nothing with this comment except showing me that the trans community can be just as toxic at invalidate an aspect of my identity and who i am! Thank you so much for your input on my religious views! Hope you have a blessed day <3
A lot of the scripture is explained significantly better in [this](https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people) link than i could ever hope to explain them. This helped me a lot in coming to terms with my own identity in my faith!
point of order: you are trans whether you transition or not. You are born trans, that's how it works. You don't want to be trans, you want to *transition*.
even in America christianity is pretty broad. i don't really practice/believe these days myself, but the (presbyterian) church I grew up with is super accepting

This means so much to me. My relationship with God and my faith is something very personal and dear to me, and to be cast out by the very people who are supposed to welcome me, and i welcome them, hurts so much. So this honestly means a lot. Thank you <3
I don’t know your family but you never know, yeah? It’s one of those “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” things and it’s all you can really do. It’s unfortunate how being happy in your own body can cost one a whole family connection at times, it shouldn’t be that way.
💯
That’s dumb. Don’t listen to her, if you believe in god then believe the way that feels right, nobody alive today could possibly be able to interpret a deity’s word ya know?
If im going to hell anyways aswell ill make this world my living little hell pit
Im sorry but thats actually hilarious-
Me too, I miss her a lot.
> i have to find a specific christian community that will accept me.

I mean... It does suck, but that kinda applies to almost everyone. Despite claiming to represent the almighty and all-pervading God, the vast majority of Christian sects aren't exactly all that inclusive of the different types of people in this world. Many churches don't allow POC, don't allow anyone LGBT+, don't allow anyone gender-nonconforming, don't allow unconventional clothing, accents, or ideas, etc. etc. etc. 

For another good and accepting one, try /r/radicalchristianity
Yeah. It does suck. The UMC church is having a messy split over LGBTQ inclusion. And it’s heartbreaking. God and the Bible are LGBTQ affirming; but not all church leaders are. It’s frustrating and heartbreaking.
r/openchristian is a more general Christian sub where there's room for sincere talk about all kinds of topics, including lgbt posts.

I'm also transgender and Christian, and I've found that sub to be very warm and, well ... open ;)
The Episcopal Church is also welcoming to trans people.
Should be a giant clue for you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
And in particular, if you're a ""true"" <religious denomination> then you're almost guaranteed to be a gatekeeping asshole with an opinionated interpretation of things who gets their rocks off by tricking others into giving you some validation.

Source: grew up in a ""true Christian"" church that taught it's members to self-isolate lest they be led astray by all the ""false"" Christians of the world or the devil's temptations of a worldly lifestyle.
Of course! God bless!
Hi, I’d like to read it too
Yeah that’s fine
I would also like to read it
Lol I’m so sorry!
Of course happy to help
Sadly yes. The bible was written in a time where it was looked down upon and came to popularity when that was even more the case. Although there is an argument to be made that the truth is human sexual concepts were barely a thing and extremely different to what we know it as now that would probably also throw a philosophical stick in trying to stay true to anything else within it. As well as strict concepts of gender also having come to fruition by that time in that part of the world where it was written. The truth is Christianity as a concept grew up with regressive social norms and matured by the blood of every culture who wouldn't immediately assimilate. Modern Christians just can't argue that the original beliefs weren't exclusionary and socially regressive, because they were. You'd have to argue through the abstract ideals the texts represent and argue for reformation as those during the enlightenment had to do. This is true for every religious movement. We have to have enlightenments not try to look to the past. Although doing this within a religious framework is damn near impossible. Its probably their problem anyway. I am incapable of thinking within the confines of non-secular morality due to not knowing what religion even was until I was like nine.
Sorry, I was venting... I grew up in a small town whose Christianity hated the entire LGBT community with all their hearts. I kind of grew to believe all Christianity was bad.
Yeah sorry not sorry,  I am anti theist. We can talk about this if you want. And don't generalize trans community here please
[deleted]
same thing lol
Cool thank you! I’ll read it when i get the chance.
yeah, although i know my family's opinions about it, they're super vocal but they do let their views known. my dad had an entire ""dont let college turn you guy"" conversation with me on my way to move into my college dorm room.
Yeah she's just ignorant and stupid. I felt more embarrassed for her than anything

I'm moving on without my old family and creating a new one from friends and people who aren't hateful bigots
Amen. I remember once (before I knew I was trans) I was at a teen church group. We were going through the bible and analyzing the possible meanings of each passage. I remember the group leader stressing how Jesus was sinless. I found this interesting, since I was also learning ethics in a DE class in school. I then went through the bible looking at every action Jesus did and compared them to each ethics theory I learned about (AND the 10 commandments). I ended up finding a few contradictions for every ethics theory I tested (and a few commandments). I then explained my findings to the teen group leader, with the proposition that instead of Jesus being sinless, he was just the closest thing that can exist on earth. The Group leader just yelled at me about how I was setting such a bad example and how my actions are just going to one day turn me away from god. I ended up leaving that group shortly after, for a completely unrelated reason.

&#x200B;

Basic point is, even if they say they are open to ideas, they often are only open to some ideas
not really- a big divide rn is between colonized and colonizing countries’ churches. colonized countries had homophobic and transphobic rhetoric imparted upon them by the west that is causing this.

lol you're totally fine!!
See this is all well and good, and I pretty much agree with you.

But I asked for quotes. The other person linked one and then seemingly deleted the comment. I read some of it in my notification, and it didn't say a single thing about transgender stuff.

Edit: the quote they liked is totally bigoted and shows off just why the Bible is immoral, btw. I just find it interesting it has nothing to do with trans stuff. I'm interested in finding anything that doesn't support trans stuff.
It's okay, i understand that, but it's important to know not everyone in a generalized group is the same. Just like we want people to stop assuming everything bad about the LGBT community, we can't assume everything bad about Christianity. I've seen both the bad side, and the really beautiful and positive side of Christianity, it exists :) they're just not as loud as the bad side, unfortunately
I'm an atheist too, i enjoy a good debate, but this really isn't the way to go about any of it. You're just being a prick to someone who clearly doesn't want to put up with someone like that right now.
I understand that not everyone has the same beliefs as i do, and this post was not about debating religion. It was simply a vent about something that didn't go like i planned. I don't care if someone doesn't believe in Christianity, but that doesn't mean it's okay to call my having the religious beliefs I do a sad thing. My post was not about debating religion, and my personal views are not up for debate. I don't call other people's beliefs sad, i respect you and your views. I only ask you do the same to me. 

I know i could've handled that comment better, and i apologize for harmful tone. It was just a really unnecessary comment that i didn't need at the time.
Good for you, I proud of you!!
>The Group leader just yelled at me about how I was setting such a bad example and how my actions are just going to one day turn me away from god.

It's a beautiful irony how those kinds of people drive people away from Christianity in droves.
That’s actually super interesting! Can you give an example of one of the contradictions with the 10 Commandments?
It sucks that some people will work so hard and look into things, come up with new (and in this case, more realistic) ideas, and then some will be too bigoted to even take those things into consideration
Yeah, it's the west. Definitely no homophobia and misogyny elsewhere... Jfc. Actually read the Bible one time.
I just got through reading the post. It was incredibly well thought out. Thanks for sharing it. I'm sorry that the sub it was posted on wasn't willing to engage with you thoughtfully. It is super frustrating. God bless!
Oh well trans as a concept was wildly different back then, only abrahamic religion I know that mentions it is old Judaism which had multiple genders.
I don't want to go good way about it, I am staying an opinion, and I'm also an anti theist.
This right her is the reason people are leaving the Church. ☝️☝️
So it has literally been like 6 years or so at this point, so **I DON'T REMEMBER EVERY DETAIL AND I MIGHT BE MISREMEMBERING SOMETHING, SO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE USING ME AS A SOURCE**. I remember finding something like 6-7 he could have been argued to have broken. Here are just a few from memory (without the actual chapters etc. because frankly, I don't want to go looking for them). Note, I will NOT be doing any follow-ups for the details of this.

&#x200B;

1. \----------------- removed since I do not want to argue over what is the right interpretation 

&#x200B;

2) You shall not make idols - The cross could be argued for this one. Thing is that Jesus was dead and it really is other people that broke this one, due to his actions. I did concede this one in my argument, but thought it was worth noting, since it is still honored today. -------Stuff from first one-------------- Mary is also worshiped in some religions, but there is nothing I found that points to Jesus having done actions to make this happen. Therefore, I conceded this as being someone else's sins as well.

&#x200B;

4) Remember the Sabbath day, To keep it holy - Jesus was accused several times of breaking the sabbath. This once again could be argued since keeping it holy is very subjective. I conceded this one, but wanted to note it since it points at another possible one he broke.

&#x200B;

5) Honour your father and your mother - He did a few actions as a kid that seemed to contradict this. I don't remember the details though. This was actually one of the reasons I started, since I found several cases of this one. He did some actions later on that contradicted this, but they were far more arguable. I remember finding something like 10-12 times he broke this one though.
This isn't the time to try to get someone to leave their religion. Don't take advantage of someone having a bad time to convert them to your way of thinking. It's toxic no matter who is doing the converting.
My Mom went to the National UMC conference. There is division in the U.S, sure; but the vote was swayed primarily by votes in colonized countries. We’re talking about a specific denomination under the Protestant umbrella, under the broader Christian umbrella. I’m an atheist with a good amount of religious trauma and happily shit on bad (read: most) aspects of Christianity- but I respect and understand the people who find community and purpose with it. It’s not hard.
Thank you, this means a lot! It hurt to spend so long on this only to not even be considered. So this means a lot to me! God bless!
Interesting, if you have any more information on the topic, like a quote or other resource, I'd be interested in seeing it.
Your ""anti theism"" lead you to being a prick to someone else for no reason. There are ways to voice opinions without completely disregarding the feelings of others. Especially on a post made specifically about those feelings.
Now, I enjoy some theological debate considerably more than the next person, but “actually, Jesus isn’t God” is kind of a big one to just casually start out with given that that’s opposed to the general fundamental tenets of…at least most Christianity. If someone doesn’t believe that he was God, then the rest of your argument kind of just follows from that, but if someone does, then you’re a bit dead in the water on a subjective point.
I don't care what they believe, I care that they are surprised that bigots exist when it's explicitly spelled out in their holy books.  
""*If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them*."" <--- it's literally in every Bible. All of them. It shouldn't be a shock to find out **some** people who think that's the word of the creator of the whole universe might not like you if you're a member of the LGBT family.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_and\_Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_and_Judaism)

What I was talking about. Sources should be cited.
My church was open to the idea he was the son of god, so that itself was not an issue. Don't want to debate over which is right.

Either way, I really don't want to argue about this, so I will likely at some point remove my original message anyways.
> ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them."" <--- it's literally in every Bible. All of them.

That's not in any Bible that was written before 1946 when all the different versions of the Bible were re-translated.

Prior to that it was ""Man shall not lie with young boys as he does with a woman, for it is an abomination.""
You're not being helpful, you're being a jerk.
Oh that's super neat, thank you!
Yeah I'm going to have to see your Bible. Did you get it at a Qanon conference or something?
If a black person posted online that they were surprised they couldn't find a more accepting chapter of the KKK I'd say the same thing. Face reality and you'll do better in life than if you hide from it.
Your welcome, this kinda stuff interests me so I tend to have more knowledge about the historical context of the beliefs rather than the beliefs themselves.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_and_homosexuality

>The first instance of the English word ""homosexuals"" used in a biblical translation was in the RSV New Testament published from 1946 until 1970, which simultaneously removed most ""fornication"" admonitions found in the prior ASV (1901) and KJV (1611) Bibles. Historically, the Vulgate contains the Latin stem ""fornicat"" within 92 verses representing sixteen centuries of Christian tradition on literally wording sexual admonishments, while verses now rebuking homosexuals were described in the Vulgate equivalent to ""male-prostitute male-concubines"". RSV set a modern trend in literally rebuking ""homosexuals"".

And/Or https://www.google.com/search?q=Bible+1946 and take your pick.
It really doesn't matter right now. Don't try to deconvert people in these situations.
I'm trying to get a podcast going with my homie, and he suggested an episode on if trans people and religion will ever get along. It's a very loaded question, so we decided we should be looking into this for what we can in the mean time. 

So yeah, I'm excited to look into these sources. The first one listed is particularly interesting.

What would be a good way to explain this to a mother who knows very little of being trans? Thanks<3 She means well.		"It's not so much a want as how you're built. You can force a left handed person to use their right hand but it'll never be natural or true to them.
Ask her how she knows her own gender. If it's something in her mind, tell her you have that too. If it's something not in her mind, ask her why she believes it got things right.
My mom asked the exact same question and we are still having a very long very detailed conversation. It'll never be an easy answer but tell her how you feel about this and tell her that it'll be OK and you'll be patient for HER. That will go a long way to full acceptance. Also mention that if she has anymore questions on it to just ask them as she thinks them. You'll also need to keep a very open mind as well. I hope it works out
My kid told me they couldn't picture themself as a grown woman. When they thought about their future, it was either as a man or nothing. That really helped me understand how they felt.
Your mother is so respectful about trying to ask questions wow
I did it by making the medical psychological case https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/
I would say “for the same reason you can’t just be a ‘handsome looking, well dressed man’. Because you’re not that, you would just be pretending. Just like I have been my whole life”
I give this mom a B+ she is doing way better than almost any other mom on here, if she is willing to learn than teach her and grow together
It's not only about how you look on the outside. You can feel that you're a woman inside, even if your body doesn't reflect that, so dressing up is like putting on a costume. It might look nice, but it's not a good representation of who you are!
""imagine every time you look at any part of your body you feel at least a bit disgusted. Hands, legs, belly, arms (not always), especially your face. To me it feels like my body just decided to cosplay a Minecraft character (cheek bones) and I can't really do that much about it. Of course when you see that every day you start to get sad.""
Also I'm reading the comments thank you, but I'm at work hard to respond. Thank you<333
Update: I've sent her like 6 texts explaining different concepts and using different examples from yall so thank you<3 also sent her the link to the gender dysphoria bible. She hasn't responded to me yet lol, but thanks again!!!
Hmm. My personal approach would be something along the lines of,

It’s not that I want to be a girl, it’s that I feel like and am  a girl. Being seen as a guy doesn’t feel right. I could be the handsomest, most well dress man in a room and still feel awkward because that’s not who I am. It’s like an itchy costume. It’s not what I want people to see me as, it’s not me and it doesn’t feel good to wear. I’d rather be the prettiest, most well dressed woman in the room. Lol. Because then people would see me for who I know I am. 

Again. This would be my personal way of describing things. Lol. I feel like really driving home that it’s not about looks, but how it feels to be seen as the wrong gender, is important. 

I think it’s great that you and your mom are working things out together. 😁 I hope it goes well!
""Why do you want to be a woman? Why not the complete opposite of a woman?""  


Really?
(Not saying the mom is doing anything wrong) but I HATE this question
I would say, it's because it feels right, and being a guy doesn't. I saw the top comment say you can't force a left handed person to be right handed. I can't speak to your personal experience, but since I started transitioning, I smile. A lot. Unprompted. That never used to happen. I was fairly handsome as a ""guy"", but I wasn't happy. I *couldnt* be happy. Now I still have depression, but I'm much happier then I ever could have been.
The trans experience is different for everyone, so not all explanations may feel like an accurate representation of how you feel. But here are some common responses to this sort of question:  


\- I didn't choose to be this way, it's simply who I am. You might as well ask me why I prefer being happy over being sad, or why I prefer having two arms instead of one. 

\- Being a woman just feels right. It makes me happy. 

\- Being a man just feels wrong. It makes me sad. 

\- Living in a male body feels wrong - I'm changing my body so that I can feel at home in my own skin. 

\- I already am a woman. I'm just trying to get other people to see the real me.

\- If I tried to be a ""handsome, well-dressed man"", I'd be living a lie; it'd be life of denial. 

\- I've already tried being a man, and I know that it's not for me. 

\- I couldn't be a ""handsome, well-dressed man"" even if I wanted to. I'd be a woman in a well-dressed and handsome man's body.
I would frame it that it's not that you want to be a woman but that you are currently a woman pretending to be a man. You just need the physical form to match who you are inside.
So first tell her that being trans is not ""wanting to be a girl/boy"", it is just being one (or both, but nevermind that for now). 

I found that an awesome way to explain this is the netflix TV series Altered Carbon, where people can change bodies due to having their identity stored digitally, but their personality and identity doesn't change. And if it's quite easy to understand that a woman who changes her body to a man's body (so she's a woman in a male body) is still a woman - she doesn't magically change into a man - then it might be easier to understand how someone can be trans. 

Anyway I made up an analogy: maybe you can tell her it's like telling someone tall to be dressing in clothes 4 sizes too small. It's not like they don't want to be a cute small petite person, it's just that they are not and any attempt to ignore that and try to fit into small places always causes pain. To feel comfortable in life everyone needs to wear clothes that fit (or bigger lol) just like everyone needs to function in life as their mental gender. Otherwise their life is just like forever suffocating in clothes that are too small.
My mom asked me a similar thing. I told her that even as a masculine woman, I still didn’t feel comfortable because I was being perceived as a woman even if I was masc
I think a good way to get this across is find something that she enjoys and is a personal preference that kind of differentiates her from the norm. Then ask if she would still have that preference if society were cruel and unfair to people with that preference, if she would just be happy doing what everyone else seems to be happy with.

Like, if she drives a mini cooper and is really proud of it. That's a slightly unusual car and it's her choice. What if people hated her for driving a mini cooper or constantly questioned her choice. What if people kept asking her ""why can't you just be happy driving a honda civic like everyone else? it's a perfectly good car!"" 

Or, imagine you've always wanted to have a cat, but all your life you've had dogs. People might say ""but you were born a dog person! Dogs are great, why would you want a cat when you've had a dog your whole life and loads of people are happy having a dog!"". Of course there's nothing wrong with having a dog but it's not what you want and it makes you deeply unhappy that you can't have a cat without people questioning you or getting angry at you because you were ""born a dog person"".
She needs to know trans people just don't shut out people because they ask the wrong questions, but because they're hostile and toxic and pose a serious threat to their mental and/or physical wellbeing. Obviously she's not got things right, but it seems like she's honest and willing to learn, so that's great. It's unfortunate demagogues are fearmongering about trans people cutting off toxic relationship, in order to scare parents to trans people into being defensive and not accepting (which is sure *not* to make things any better).
""Outside of biology is there anything within you that you can pin down as *why* you know you're a woman, and not a man, or something else? I can't tell you a specific reason I feel this way either, but trying to cram someone in a space they don't fit hurts, so I'm trying to make the space (my body) fit me""
Why don't you?
I would personally turn the question back around.  
""If you had two buttons, one instantly turns you into a handsome man and the other a beautiful woman, what would you press?""  
She'll probably answer ""woman"" and that leads to the follow up of ""Why?"" ...if not, you have another why for her to ponder.

""It just feels more me"" is probably the only conclusion one can draw.
""Why do you want to be left handed?! Why can't you just be right handed like everyone else?"" 

It's because that's how you were built.
Awe! She's so sweet! Can I adopt her? She doesn't have to know what to ask, just knowing that she really loves you even after coming out is enough. ❤️
My mom asked me the exact same thing like 4 days ago. I asked her if she ever felt like she wanted to be a man, and she basically said ""no, but there are things that are traditionally man things that I enjoy/do."" So I told her that even after being just a kind-of feminine man and doing those traditionally feminine things, there is still this longing feeling/a feeling like I'm not whole/etc.
that is a GOOD mother fuckin' mother
The same reason you don't want to be a handsome, well-dressed man. It isn't who you are. It isn't that I want to be a woman, it's that I want to be who I am rather than having to pretend to be something I am not.
feels more like home would've been my answer, probably
It took a bit to explain the concept to my mother. Lots of polite corrections and encouragement. Be polite and precise.
Its not about wanting to be female, you are female. You are a trans woman. that's not something you chose to be, that's what you are.
https://youtu.be/szf4hzQ5ztg

Make her watch that whole video
Maybe say to her that it is the same as for her. It's likely she knows she is a women, but not really why, there is no why. I don't know
That’s cute! I wish my parents talked like that
Being a well dressed man may not relieve your dysphoria or give you euphoria. If you are uncomfortable in your body, and would like to be recognized as woman, her alternative falls short.
Could ask her if she would want to be a handsome man. When she inevitably says no, you can say so imagine if you had to be a man from now on. How uncomfortable that would make you feel? 

Now imagine that discomfort and realise that's how I feel about being a guy and being a female would be more comfortable for me.
I can get behind her question a little bit. Two options, she really does care but doesn't really ""understand"" that we don't choose it, and genuinely is curious how/why trans has come into your life, we only realize and accept who we are and who we are not. OR (and my mom does this) is trying to guilt/manipulate you're decision or make you ""double check"" who you are:/

I always explain that it's visceral, like you feel it deep, deep inside, it's certain and strong and beyond language. I have a pole where there should be a hole. It just feels wrong. It feels like it belongs to someone else.

Cis people don't think about their genitals constantly. Many trans folks do, and it's always negative. Any time I might be happy, having a good time, and I shift in my clothes and feel something that I know shouldn't be there, it ruins my mood. I just want to be able to not think about it constantly. I think that would be really nice. I can't imagine what it's like to not hate your genitals, let alone be happy with them.
Say you dont “feel” like a boy, on the inside you’re a girl and on the outside you’re a boy
Ask her to please give a demonstration by being a male for a few days (not just cosmetically, but truly deep down in identity). When she says she can't (because that's not her gender), simply agree with her and point out that the same is true for you.
[This video](https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg) is such a powerful video that covers the concepts of identity, and the identity of being transgender in particular. It helped me a great deal in clarifying a lot of the things that I was thinking at the time, and it brings me to tears every time I watch it. I would definitely recommend watching through it and passing this on to your mother. Best of luck!
Rad. I am 39 and hope my mother takes it as well as yours. I think I'm just going to tell her that I am built for comfort, not speed.
You could always flip it and ask why she doesn't want to be a man? Why doesn't she wear men's clothing, have a man's haircut, etc. She wouldn't want to be a man, because she's a woman, just like you are. It's as simple as that. 

I'd also stress that it's okay if she doesn't understand you completely, so long as she respects that this is what you feel is best for you. Not everything needs a reason or explanation, sometimes it's better to just let it go and accept things as they are.
A really cool metaphor for me is that:
You have old shoes, that doesn't fit you very well, but you wear them every day, and then you discover those other shoes, which are exactly your size and comfortable af, and now you will not be able to come back to the old shoes the same
I understand her reasoning. For the longest time I thought I just wanted to be a fop, but I realized that, in actuality, I wanted to be a girl.

Explain that it’s less of what you want, and more of how you feel. That it’s not as much about appearing as a woman as it is being one. You don’t have to be well-dressed or handsome to be trans, you could look like crap, but what matters is that you’re a woman that looks like crap, not a man. Right? We aren’t trans based upon appearances, it’s how we think and feel.
I would also do a reverse undo card by asking “well, why don’t *you* want to be a handsome man?” 

It may put it in perspective for her
Because it’s what makes you happy?
Mm I had a friend answer for me before to someone who was being a bit of a jerk. She said that the world is a really cruel place and that it can be really hard for everybody but if for a moment you thought there was a chance you could be happier in this world why wouldn't you take it.

I wasn't particularly unhappy pre-transition. I didn't suffer from dysphoria like most do. But I wanted to live the way I wanted to and I felt I could be a lot happier this way and honestly, I am by more than I could ever imagine.
Ask her the same thing. Ask her why she doesn't want to be a handsome looking man in a suit, maybe with a nicely trimmed beard and some short, simple hairstyle. Its not who she is as a person, and trying to make her be something she isn't would make her uncomfortable. Could help her understand your perspective?
I know I'm late: but it isn't about wanting. When I wanted to be a famale, what I meant was that I wanted to be afab cis-woman. And that was when I below 10 y. o.

Now I undersatnd that ""I don't want to be a woman"", ""I am a woman!"", and I always was, I only want to pass as a woman - ergo I wanted to be cis.

Also you should describe her that you feel gender dysphoria, and tell her ""It means that I feel uncomfortable, because of me a woman, being in a wrong male body"".

&#x200B;

Good luck!... Honestly would want to know how it worked.
Wow, so supportive. I am jealous
sounds like your mother will love you no matter what you decide upon so it's just taking questions in stride and trying to explain them well, if you need to take your time to form a response and make sure that if you read it without knowing about being trans yourself that you would get it.
You could try and describe it as saying you can’t imagine growing up in your AGAB and that seeing masculine features on yourself makes you feel the same way she would feel if they suddenly appeared on her body or in her thoughts, that you feel the same way being called handsome or a man as she would if she was called handsome or a man. You could try and relate it to her in the sense of like hypotheticals.  Like to think how she, as a female, does not like those things the same way you, as a female, do not like those things.  Thats one thing i never understood about people who are the gender your transitioning to not accepting you, like they should know somewhat how you feel lol. But thats the best advise i’ve got so hope it helps! :) good luck tho!
My simplest explanation is that you're a PC born running MacOS.
I don’t have a good answer to what to say. I do think communicating it over text may be a difficult way to go about it. When you do figure out what you want to say, calling would be a good idea, things are a bit harder to misunderstand that way
The way I’d say it is: “That’s just who I am: a woman, not a man. I don’t see myself as a man and that’s how It is. The closer I am to becoming the person I see myself as, the happier I will be.”

Though, that’s me.
I wish my parents asked like that instead of being condescending about it. They say they don't understand but then don't listen when I explain
I wish to not be seen as a man it doesn’t fit who I am, I would much rather be seen as a women in our society. 

Left handed people don’t choose it, they just are. Changing to their right hand feels awkward and weird, but when they get to be who they are it’s less challenging
I'm in very similar situation. The way I can explain it is, at least for me, is it has nothing to do with how I look to others. The more feminine I am the more comfortable and more me I feel. The more I'm learning about myself the happier I am the higher my confidence is and no one's ignorance will change any of that
Perhaps try explaining that when you live ""as a man"" it feels more like a performance or pretend than something true to yourself. That when you present your womanhood to yourself and the world openly you feel better, euphoric. 

I myself am questioning right now, but this is an experience I somewhat relate to (maybe moreso than I currently think) and it's something I've heard a few other trans folk describe. It also just made sense to me even when I felt ""sure"" that I was cis.
Answer: I want to be as I feel inside and what gives me joy, and not a life time of misery just to appease others. Being a handsome boy is what others see me as but not as I see my self, and thats okay because as a boy I'm handsome, and as a girl I'm beautiful, but beneath it all I'm just me. Thats all I want to be.
It's lovely how she means well and is wanting to be understanding. Explain to her how you feel from the masculine perspective emotionally and physically - eg depressed sad and not myself, trapped etc. Know it's more than just clothing; that entire way of being is just not you.

 Then how you feel about transitioning to who you want to be eg happy free and feel so much better within yourself etc. Explain how much better you feel in clothes which match the internal self with the external self.

Finally this is not done in spite. Give gratitude to her for being understanding as she can be. Appreciate her wanting to understand and discuss more. Definitely reassure her regarding your relationship; she likely has some anxiety around that all of the above paragraph may/should help regarding that.
The same reason she doesn’t try to be a handsome well-dressed man, it isn’t natural
god, my mother asked the EXACT SAME QUESTION almost word for word. I think that they just have a super hard time grappling with the fact that this is not something they can understand really. To them, a rose is rose and a bird is a bird and you can never cross the two. It just breaks there world view a bit.
I would say “ it’s not really that I want to be a ( inserted gendered term here ), but more so that I just am one. It’s my innate sense of self.”
I’d say something along “I’ve tried, I have tried to be ‘normal’ and a boy but I can’t, it’s hurt too much, I don’t wanna be a girl for fun, I want to be a girl for my survival”
Your very lucky. That line about “my relationship with you is the most important thing to me” hits home with me. As I deal with being berated by my parents since being outed as trans. My mom doesn’t give a shit about our relationship and has already said we will never see each other again if I “look” like a girl someday 😭 but fuck her.
Maybe try repeating the question back to her?
Gender is the intersection of identity, desire and power. Tell her you’d much rather be her daughter than her son, being seen in this way brings you a joy and peace that is unrivaled by anything else. Let her know that being yourself makes you happy and I think this is new for both of you so give it time for both of you to adjust to this new normal. Xo
I'm sure this has already been said, but the absolute simplest way to explain this is ""mom, why do *you* want to be a woman instead of a well dressed man?""
The mom is trying and that’s good
Update again: she asked some more basic questions about wanting kids and a relationship. I'm not sure how understanding she is cause she always responds back by asking a way different question lol. BUT we just moved onto talking about if I believe in something after I die (which I dont) so this could take a turn for the worse hahaha!

Seriously thanks for so many replies this blew up way more than i thought. Love all of you so much <333
My mom is actually pretty similar, my best friend actually helped her understand the best when he said it is like wearing a bad Halloween costume every day while you slowly die inside of it.
I'd rather be an ugly girl than an handsome man
Counter point why she doesn't want to be a ""handsome, well dressed man"" herself. Usually the answer she come up will be roughly similar to you. Hold her hand and guide her toward finding the answer for herself.
 I would say, being a handsome man doesn't connect with anything in my brain those words can be used but I wouldn't know what they in relation to me, 

An example from my own life is I have some friends in there 40s and they keep saying I'll make a great dad/husband one day, for me those words don't connect with me in any way I don't hate the words I just don't understand the connection between me and the words they don't fit in the puzzle
Teach her about gender dysphoria. Let her read about it. It’ll go a long way without having to beat yourself up. She obviously has no clue and never understand until she reads about it . Ask her if she would go out wearing a man’s suit.
Probably not the most important thing but there are definitely still stupid questions when you're trying to learn. 

But more to the point I read this great thing years ago that was like ... When you say to cis people ""try to imagine if you were trans"" they tend to imagine themselves as the opposite gender to what they are now ... I.e. cis men think about if they were trans women ... Cis women think about if they were trans men ... And then have the response ... Oh well I can't imagine that at all in no universe would I be a man/woman etc ... *But* what they should really be doing is imagining themselves as their current gender (easy so far) but also trans ... Cis men should imagine themselves as trans men ... Cis women as trans women etc ... And then it's much easier to understand the concept of ""imagine your whole life being told you're a man when you know you're a woman"" or vice versa.
Could try explaining it to yours how I explained it to mine. The best way I could find a way to explain it is by making it relate to her.   Like think of something she really doesn't like / finds unattractive, and then slowly convert that into being about how you feel about yourself, in my case my mom seriously dislikes the visual looks of some foods, not that I remember what those foods were, so I used that relating to her feelings to get her to understand mine
Like when I explained this to anyone in my family. 
I looked for things from reading material to videos that would help explain things to my family.  And I would watch or read it with them so if they had any questions I was there to answer them. It's the easiest way to do it.  After every thing is done it still took them awhile to understand it. I moved around for years and when I got back they learned alot and accepted me for me being me.
Your welcome
Flip the question back on her: ""Why can't YOU just be a handsome well-dressed man? Wouldn't feel quite right, would it?""
What I answered my mom about that 
""I think I've always been (female) deep down. I thought that's it was no big deal and that I could leave like that (in my agab) perfectly fine, but every year it becomes more difficult, and I came to realise that it makes me deeply unhappy. So I've given been thinking a lot about it and I decided to try figuring out how to be happy.""
I had this conversation with my dad just yesterday, almost verbatim. LoL.
Slightly different circumstances,  I'm genderfluid leaning femme. 
My dad loves me and was sincere. Your mom asking this is true. She does want to be a part of your life.
I always flip the question. ""Well, why can't you be a handsome man?""  

The likely answer is ""Because I'm a woman.""  

Ask her how she knows, without using anatomy as a qualifier. Because that's where the disconnect is with a lot of cis people. They never question why they feel like their gender, and when you tell them to remove physical attributes, they start to kind of realize what's going on. I wish you all the luck, and I'm glad your mom is trying to learn, that's such a great thing 💜💜
Maybe:

That’s just not who I am. I feel terrible when I try to lie all of the time. Objectively, yeah it’d be better to me a handsome cis man in most societal settings.  Misogyny and transphobia are horrible, handsome men don’t experience those things. But it’s also probably objectively better for every cis woman who isn’t ever going to nurse again to remove their breasts and get a full hysterectomy. People don’t *need* them anymore, lots of deadly cancers can start there down the road, but women would feel bad about it removing them. Just like cis men hate the idea of losing their testicles, even if they don’t really “need” them anymore, and again a potential source of cancer. 

For your mom and in general, being trans and talking about trans things are really talking about feelings. They don’t really make any sense, feelings. But they do effect your life and wellbeing.  A lot of being trans is expressing and reconciling your feelings and your identity. 

Explaining why you’re trans is like saying why you feel sad. Or explaining what it is to be angry.  Fundamentally you can’t explain feelings. They’re a basic human thing. You can manage them or explore why you’re feeling that way, but you can’t really change or remove feelings or pick. No one would pick to be upset all of the time.

If something is making you feel bad, whether it’s being misgendered or something physical, then people should respect you and you should be allowed to start making physical changes. 

You shouldn’t be asked stuff like, “Well, why can’t you just be unhappy?”
Cis people are often asked ""Can't you imagine wanting to be \[different gender\]?"" and no, they don't, but I believe this question isn't being asked properly. It should be ""What if your gender wasn't taken seriously?"".

Your mum is a woman, she likes being a woman, she knows who she is, etc- what if she lived in a world that refused to see her as a woman despite her being one? No matter what she did, people would call her sir, tell her that she doesn't look like a woman, brush off her womanhood as unnatural, maybe even ask her why she can't just settle on being a feminie man.
“Why not be a good looking (agab here)”

Lets look at it this way. Say someone liked you to be dressed up a certain way. To them it’s perfect and it seems there is nothing wrong with it. To you it’s uncomfortable as hell and the only reason you are dressed this way is for another’s enjoyment. Like wearing heels 24/7. it might look good to others, but to you it’s nothing but pain (or just not wearing heels feels so much better).

Would you spend your entire life dressed up for another’s enjoyment if it meant you had to suffer every moment? Sure there are times of reprieve such as sitting on a couch when your feet are killing you, but you have to get up again sometimes. Would you, for the rest of your life, torment yourself simply because others find it appealing?
Send this to her, and you don’t have to credit me:

There is a clear and distinct difference between the male and female brains. The part of the brain which signals the hypothalamus to produce essential hormones (it’s called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, but that’s a pain to type out so we’ll just call it the BNOTST) is generally about twice the size in males than that seen in females. Tests have demonstrated that transgender women, despite being AMAB, have a female-aligning BNOTST. The opposite is true in trans men. The size of the BNOTST is unaffected by pubescent hormones and HRT. Another difference between the male and female brains is seen in the number and size of neurons in the hypothalamus. Again, transgender women always have female-aligned hypothalami, while the hypothalami of trans men always align with the cisgender male hypothalamus. These differences, again, are present regardless of transition status. Yet another sex-based difference in the brain is the size of the putamen (one of the many portions of the brain which assists in the movement of the limbs). In case you haven’t noticed the pattern yet, the size of the putamen always corresponds closely with gender identity. These differences help support the theory that gender identity is immutable, determined in the brain, and independent of sex. 

Evidence strongly suggests that the development of both biological sex and gender identity in the brain are caused by prenatal hormones. If a fetus receives testosterone early in pregnancy, it will develop testes and a penis. If the fetus receives estrogen during this period, it will develop ovaries, a uterus, and a vagina. Generally, these hormones will remain constant throughout the entirety of pregnancy, but not always. Through no fault of the parents, testosterone production can switch to estrogen production (and vice-versa) at some point between the times at which the sex organs and gender identity develop. When this occurs, the fetus’s brain develops incongruently with its body. This incongruence will remain for the unborn child’s entire life.
Try look at it from a different perspective. A lot of people tell me they can't imagine wanting to be the other sex, but try looking at it a different way. For your mother, she is a woman that is happy as who she is, but what if she was born a man? What if she was still the same woman, but just born male? How would she react? She can know she is female all she wants, but no one sees her that way and no one believes her, how would she feel?

It's not so much that you *want* to be a woman, it's that you are a woman who was born with the wrong sex. You don't want to be he opposite gender, you are the opposite gender, sadly your body didn't get that memo early on.
why not a well dressed young man um seems she doesnt get it at all like at all good luck trying to explain it all to her seems like she isnt hateful about it atleast tho
This is really sweet. Your mom's so open minded to learning, and that's saying a lot. All the best to you both ❤️
For the same reason she doesn’t want to just be a handsome well dressed man, just not who she is
First thing that came to mind was using clothing style as a metaphor. Turn it around with ""well, why do *you* dress like a suburban soccer mom? Why not a pastel goth?"" It's not exactly one to one, but the idea is similar. You express yourself as a woman, not as a man. Just like your mom expresses as a soccer mom rather than a pastel goth.

Soccer mom and pastel goth both being examples, of course.
If **being**... a handsome looking well dressed man... HAD WORKED, then you would not have Dysphoria.

And, you don't ""want"" *to be a female*; you **have always been female** \- you just hid it from everyone *because you were always told you were male and because you have a P*, and **so you never questioned what you were told by Mother and by Society.**

.

However, one's *gender IS NOT between one's legs*; it is between one's ears.  If a man's P is severed and amputated, he will still be a man; if a woman's breasts are cut off and her uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed - she is still a woman.

The very cleanest reference to that (which you **should** read about) is about **Dr. John Money and the Reimer Twins:**

[https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case](https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case)

That should cleanly demonstrate part of the best answer for your Mother's question to you.

Google ""PubMed Gender Identity and Hormones"" for Medical-Science references to that one's Gender Identity appears to be fixed during fetal development, as a direct consequence of the testosterone/estrogen balance within a specific critical window of fetal development.  Afterwards, one's gender identity appears to be fixed and is highly likely not to ever change.
my goto is from sam collins, “it’s like being trapped in a roomy box that has everything you need, but slowly over time someone start dropping cockroaches into the box. it’s only a few at first which is fine, but slowly over time you’re up to your neck in them.”
""Want"" is the wrong word. I want to go on a walk. I want cake for dessert. I want to be an astronaut when I grow up. But I am kind and compassionate. I am artistic. I am your child.

You're asking why I want to be a woman. I don't want to be, I am a woman.

(If the conversation switches to anatomy, which it might, and likely what she is hung up over, I suggest the following)

Just pretend for a moment. Suspend your disbelief, like you do when you watch a movie. Pretend that what parts each person is born with has nothing to do with them being a man or a woman. Hell, pretend that people don't even have genitals. So in this make believe world, where you don't have any parts, you're still a woman. All of what you are, that makes you still be a woman, is what I am.

Sex and gender are distinctly different things. Yes, most commonly people with one type are one gender, and people with a different type are another gender, but not always. There's nothing wrong, I'm just different.
Just reply to her as if u took as a laugh n joke.... reply talking about ur heart doesn't feel good hiding how u truly feel n it feels good to dress female
You don't want to be a man in the same way she does not want to be a man.

This is the type of relationship I had with my grandma.  She would ask whatever questions, and I could just answer.  All she was concerned with is my happiness in the end.  I think these conversations changed her for the better and I knew I always had her support.  We could be completely honest to each other.  10/10 best grandma.  It kind of seems like your mom is like that.  If I'm right I'd reinforce this as being beneficial to your relationship and not negative.
Aww your mom is so sweet. 
If it was me, I would tell her that it's my social responsibility to myself and the public to present and represent who I am authentically. for me that means presenting physically/emotionally as a woman on the outside to showcase how I feel on the inside. 

Hope this helps maybe! I am nonbinary and two spirit so I resonate with both genders and the spectrum.:)
I would try to explain that being as your birth gender causes you distress and discomfort, and that being called female terms and being feminine makes you feel euphoric.
""I am a female. I want my outward appearance to more accurately reflect my inner self.""
This is actually so cute oh my god I'm so glad you have someone like her who's willing to learn for you in your life
Well tell her you dont want to be a handsome well dressed man since that would be faking you’re identity.   

Instead you wanna a beautiful well dressed woman, since that is who you are.   You don’t have to be well dressed though.
My dad asked a similar question when I first came out and brought up the potential for medical transition (which I've been doing for almost 16 months now.) He wondered why I wanted to physically transition and to look female (as we were discussing medications and possible surgeries.) He wondered what the difference was between him being insecure about his crooked nose, and me being insecure about my face/body/etc.; obviously, the topic of dysphoria came out of that, and I was able to help educate him on my situation. It's never an easy thing to talk about with someone who isn't a professional, or isn't trans themselves, but your mum seems to be ready to listen, and to HEAR you, and to be educated. I'm happy to see you have that. Much love ❤
That's so sweet
""same reason you can't, I'm not a man""
It’s not a want. It just is.
Personally when being asked that I just told em that it just wasnt who I was. Offcourse it was more complicated then that.
You can read here, there will be many explanations about mostly all about gender dysphoria, https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en that may help you to elaborate an answer, you mom mean god, she need to learn thou, use that resource it may help both.  Tip… give her time, mine needed a complete year and now she is like the best Suporter, she is great ! And drive the talk for the rest of my family to accept me, but her initial reaction was not good at all. So give her time .
SHE SEEMS SO NICE OMG 😭😭
What I answered my mom about that 
""I think I've always been (female) deep down. I thought that's it was no big deal and that I could leave like that (in my agab) perfectly fine, but every year it becomes more difficult, and I came to realise that it makes me deeply unhappy. So I've given been thinking a lot about it and I decided to try figuring out how to be happy.""
You didn't choose
It's that or being permanently depressed
My answer would be: You are mistaken. Because I don't want to be a masked woman ""as a well-styled man"". Because I've always been a woman inside.
I’m just glad youre accepted either way - should’ve seen my mothers reaction lol.
I’m sat here depressed and wishing I wasnt alive.
Idk mum why don’t you be a handsome well dressed man:)
I'd say that I don't 'want' to be a female, I want to be myself,  and I happen to be a female. I have 2 options, change my body so I can be me, or change me so I can match my body. Brain surgery seems riskier to me and I don't want to be someone else so that leaves one path to happiness. 

Assuming this is true for you.
""would you want to be a handsome looking well dressed man? The way that feels for you is probably how it feels for me""
Because at the end of the day it's not about looking nice or conforming to gender roles.

For example as a trans guy if I ever look too much like a girl my brain throws a fit. It becomes depressed it dissociates from my body as it can't handle being in a body it doesn't want to be in.

It's your mind. My mind truly believes I'm a demi-guy and to be any other way hurts me.
Your mom loves you, just explain everything to her, dysphorya and how your brain just cant be ij a male bodey...
Tell her that you don't **want** to be a woman, you **are** and there's nothing that can change that.
I would say, “Mom, deez nuts.”
A good response is that: being transgender is usually caused when the physical structure of the brain doesn’t match the genitalia. Just less sciency
That, and I would say OP can't be a ""well-dressed good looking man"" for all the same reasons her mom can't and wouldn't want to be one either.
This is a grand way of explaining it
At least that's something I won't be killed over anymore. God sure does hate some weirdly specific things.
I feel this, being a leftie.
And to take that analogy further, once they're used to writing with their right hand, it'll likely be better than if they were to use their left, but the maximum potential is still likely lower
I wish your mum was as open to things as most trans peoples ' parents.
I see this a lot... I'm a left handed person who was forced to use their right hand(apparently, left hand=devil) and I've been doing it so long its become natural... Still left footed, and even with more daily use right isn't much stronger, but I can't right with left at all.

Bad analogy imo

More like trying to walk on your hands... Not supposed to work that way, gives you pain and makes life hard, no reason for it.
And then your “mom” does some introspection and you get the trans COMBO.
That doesn't work in my experience. 
They'll throw you the ""I don't *feel* like my gender, gender isn't real, I am what I have in my pants"" bullshit and then continue to misgender you.
Yes I told her not to be afraid to ask questions. I'm 27 so in the end I'm doing this only for her benefit so I'm being patient. Thanks for responding (:
Ooo I like that one thank you<3
Yea that's exactly what it was like for me when I was figuring things out. Couldn't picture myself growing older as my assigned gender, if I tried I would just draw a blank. I could think about specific actions or events that I wanted to experience but I couldn't really see the whole picture, couldn't imagine myself in the third person perspective actually doing those things. 

Now when I think about myself in the future I can picture the entire scene and clearly see my place in it, and it brings me a lot of joy to think about my future selves and to occasionally daydream about what I'll turn out like as I grow older.
Its really nice to see parents like this, searching for understanding in something they dont know out of love.

This is what a parent should be.
https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/





This doubles down in one of the points of that text, note too that the bible pushes medical transition which depending on the case might not be necessary
Exactly! That's how I describe it to my friends and family- my body in it's current state is like wearing a costume I can't take off. It's just a lengthy and expensive process to unzip it.
My go-to analogy for the dysphoria from facial hair is “imagine how it would feel if you woke up tomorrow and found that you had toenails growing out of your face.”
The gender dysphoria bible is such a helpful resource; I'm sure she was just taking the time to understand what you sent her, based on her initial question. I'm so happy you have such a wonderful parent that is willing to learn about something they didn't previously understand. Admitting that you lack knowledge and putting in the work to fix it is a difficult thing to do!
OP: there are no stupid questions

OP's mom: challenge accepted

(glad it sounds like she's tryna understand tho, no disrespect, it's just an annoying line of questioning)
[deleted]
She just said that because I've shut her out for the last 10 plus years of my life already because of my shitty upbringing. We're on ""good"" terms but she knows she has to try, because she's making up for my early years. Which is nice I suppose lol :)
Sooo good!! Thanks for the reference!👍
Yeah I explained a lot of it like that. The last thing I said was I don't want to be a girl, I NEED to be a girl to ever be happy with myself and who i am.
That's what I tell most people, but i think she's willing to learn so I wanted to go in more depth for her :D
Yeah I kinda used that as I came out to her. I said I was never truly happy until I started taking steps to transition. I think it's helps, because (most) parents want their kid to be happy.
Yeah even I have trouble with need/want. I can barely describe my own feelings to myself lol!!
Lmao!! I like that one :D
It's funny my mom was never religious until after I started transitioning. Every time she brings it up I bring up every other religion, and explain why just one being true is Ludacris. I also make up religions and love to talk to her about Satanism, I don't believe either, but it can be fun to see her reaction to them making sense. 

She was really awkward about relationships and her potential grandkids. Which is funny because I'm still 10 years younger than her when she had me. Alot can happen in that time, so I always bring up the fact that I have some frozen. I'm bi so it's possible that may come in handy, otherwise I just might adopt. I'm not a fan of the genetics I inherited tbh.

I hope your long discussion has a loving outcome, nevermind the past. Your future will be bright 🌞 💞
I'm doing all through through text as I've been moved out of state for 7 years now so it's mostly on her to follow up with questions. I think she'll get there though. Thanks for answering and I'm glad they're accepting :)<3
Ask mom to show you how?
I was a well-dressed good-looking ""woman"" for a while and it gave me some awful confusing dysphoria. Confusing to the point that I didn't recognize it as dysphoria until years later. I'd never want to feel that awful again.
Yes. Right. Definitely. Who doesn't remember in the 10 commandments where it says: ""trans people are definitely their AGAB""? Or how about any of the *numerous times* the new testament attacks trans folks? What? You mean *there aren't any*? What's that? *Church leaders are usually insane and half are okay with sexual assault*? Huh. yes. ""God"" sure hates weirdly specific things.
Leftie trans gang
and that lefties are more prone to injuring themselves because the world isnt built for them just like the world isnt built for trans people which means we have higher toaster bath parties and such.
I've observed a phenomenon of this type occurring in reality. I've seen one person coming out causing a cascading effect where other people close to them who might have otherwise never thought about it start to question and some come out causing a further cascade in their circles of people.
That's when you ask when they last inspected a stranger's bits before gendering them.
I feel it. I'm 34 and answering every question my mom has. I already have my understanding I'm just hoping I can illuminate my understanding for her.
Exactly. Just a blank. But I somehow saw my future personality, even though I couldn't see my physical form. Than I just tried to see my future self as a male... And it just didn't feel right... Like yeah, ""there is a man with a beard, etc... but that's not me!"". Than I pictured myself as a woman... aaaaaa-and my egg cracked.

&#x200B;

I know that this story isn't publicaly usable, but I am very happy to see that I wasn't alone with that one.
Yeah she's had a lot of time to change and I'm glad she has as I left home at 15 years old because of how bad it was. So good on her, cause things were a lot different back then lol.
Thanks. I'm honestly pretty ok. But hugs are always appreciated
Did she understand it?
As I wrote, I think you can want to be cis - cuz you would be priviled. But as you're not cis girl nor cis boy, you want to play the part of cis boy (cuz toxic masculine society told us to), but it doesn't feel right...

My point is; yes I want to be born as a cis, right body, person. But I'm not. So there's no other option than facing and fighting against my dysphoria!
This is what I told my Aunt when she went off the rails. ""Do you want to be man?"" I asked. ""HELL NO."" She responded.

""Same Aunty, SAME.""
Not necessarily related but the worst dysphoria for me always came when someone would give me a gendered compliment and inadvertently misgendered me. Any compliments about my physique or what a ""bright young man"" I was always made me feel so literally isolated and alone.
Or how they'll use Leviticus to attack LGBTQ people on the one hand but say that Jesus made the Old Testament irrelevant when you point out all the other abominations unto the Lord in the same chapter.
I didnt read the first parts and thought you were forming some form of Revolutionary Trans Alliance
We are most sinister.
Lol how many of us do we think are actually conservative? A poll would be interesting indeed
ngl i feel like this is why people thought being gay would turn others gay. like they thought it was a disease because they were not involved, just looking in on the phenomena. they werent questioning it themselves and because it spread, it was therefore considered a disease.
That's called Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria /s
Happened to me, my sibling started iding as enby a few years later. My one parent we're both sure is an egg. Happens ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
What if they can't fathom the existence of passing trans people?
*hugs* I still suffer from pretty bad depression so I understand. But we'll get better eventually<3
She's only sent 1 text back, but nothing bad just asking more questions. I think she'll get it eventually <3
I'm just itching to know what she said when you told her.
[deleted]
Honestly same. I hate when that happens but I’m not out yet so it’s expected tbh lmfaooo
Being called a handsome young man never made me feel anything. Id take the compliment but not understand why people gave them if it meant nothing. Was i supposed to feel something when someone complimented me that way? Now I know why I didn't
Yes I agree! I still love makeup and occasionally will wear a dress or a skirt, but that's only at home or around people who get it. I've learned my lesson that misgendering still hurts even if I know why it's going on.
“Well, you don’t understand, Leviticus only applies to you because I think you’re weird.”
Leftie *Leftist Trans Gang
Yeah. Every day gets a little better
That’s good. Shame you have to explain this stuff, I wish there was more media representation of trans people, it can really help with explaining something. But, she sounds willing to learn and that’s very nice to see. Godspeed.
Well, you're not supposed to scratch it, it'll only make it worse.
She was able to rationalize it as ""Waking up everyday in a man body, and being disappointed about that.""

I was like... ""Really? That's all it took for you to figure it out on your own?"" Even though, secretly, that was a statement I'd never thought to say but describes the feeling perfectly.
That’s when I quote Matthew 5:17 where their Jesus says “I have not come to destroy the law or the prophets but to fulfill it.”
Then also quote Deuteronomy 4:2: “The word of the LORD is absolute. You are not to add to it or take away from it.”

Then tell them they should stop eating blood, pork, and stop mixing fabrics, and other additional laws from the Old Testament that they’re clearly violating.
I laughed too hard at that.
That's when you're laughed off in the saddest, most obvious form of deflection that exists. Partially because they know they'll get away with it.
Abusers aren't bound by some sort of rational consistency. They have no qualms harboring conflicting views because they let their feelings inform their rationalizations. Everything they believe is a justification for their ego no more, no less.
Then I call them hypocrites and tell them Jesus told them not to judge me because they too will be judged. And walk off before they can have another say.
Yeah they use their religious views as a “get out of hell free” card and  an excuse for their sanctimonious and pompous demeanor, and then under the same breath, complain about Liberals doing the same thing."	t48ai4	trans	1715	0.99	2022-03-01 13:47:52
Can someone explain to me a way i can hide the bump with skirts? Im fully tucked but you can still see a bump :( i love tight skirts but dont want people seeing my stuff		"Have you tried body shapers? They're like... binders, but for women and are meant to redistribute fat to give more curves in wanted places instead of unwanted places
Shapewear is the name of the game. It'll help inflate your curves too, which is a welcome added bonus in my case. You can get some pretty cheap off Amazon.
Getting a good pair of underwear with padding in front.
Have a look at leolines on Etsy. They're fantastic
No fucking idea, i have the same issue :(
If you find out let me know plssss
Shareware?
Look for shapewear that has ""tummy control  panel "" as well
Maybe get like a long tank top and cut the arm holes off and use it as sort of a modest panel? To kinda provide a little buffer between your wand and the world if that makes sense. 

I would like to say I know cis girls w that bump from their Fupa. Not super uncommon. Anyways you're GORGEOUS and stay safe!
Black skirts might help as well. Brigther collors tend to make things more visible (if you know what I mean)
It kinda just looks like your stomach? In fact, I just saw [a post](https://twitter.com/mewvore/status/1593326775282573316?s=46&t=74VtVK_OGHFuMFM79GnAtg) about the skirt tummy bump the other day.
/honestly it just kinda looks like the pouch around the lower part of the waist afab people tend to get ESPECIALLY  when they bloat during menstruation)
Thought it was a tummy bump tbh
it kinda just looks like a part of your tummy tbh, i didnt realize what you were talking abt at first
Honestly just looks like the bit of belly that all women have, an extra bit of tissue to protect the uterus
First you look so cute. I pretty much wear skirts instead* of pants if I’m able to depending* on place or temperature but I unfortunately can’t get the tighter ones. There shouldn’t be a spanx? Type of underwear. I’ve seen them go into leggings too.
I’m gonna be totally honest with you, I genuinely thought your bump was a lower belly pouch lmao which is actually extremely hot. If you weren’t posting in a trans sub I wouldn’t even know you were trans
Girl that’s just your fupa!! But if it bothers you too much still try some shapewear :)
Just came on here to 🥰🥰🥰
Looks cute i like the bump
My cis daughter is a type 1 diabetic and uses shapewear to help hide her insulin pump and keep everything in place. She naturally has a prominent pubic bone “fat pad” genetically which looks like that (all the women in our fam do), so the shapewear makes it not quite as prominent for tighter clothing. (You’re adorable, BTW!  I envy your style!)
Tomboy X and Carman liu make underwear that keeps things flat. Fairly inexpensive for what it provides.
To me it just looks like your uterus bump, it’s pretty common on cis girls. You look amazing, lovely!
Body shapers are probably your best bet. They add a bit of padding and flatten out the area so that the ""bump"" is both smaller and blends in so that it's way less noticeable overall.
butt lifter panties
This probably won’t help but maybe it will give you a lol: I skimmed the title and saw the picture and assumed this was my pregnancy subreddit
Hormones did damn good on you, your face is very pretty :)
Shareware is basically an old fashioned type bit torrent
A simple trick is to wear pleated skirts. You can get cute/sexy pleated miniskirts that do a good job of disguising the bulge. And then you can get by just wearing boy shorts underneath, which I think is more comfortable than tucking. 💖
Try a good pair of tucking underwear.
I have very little experience wearing skirts because I'm a dude (nevermind pencil skirts like yours), but have you tried maybe bringing your pelvis out a little less when you stand? I've noticed people with AMAB junk tend to stand with their pelvis a little bit forward compared with the rest of their body. 

Also, I think the pattern, though lovely, might not be helping. Perhaps the bump is hardly noticeable with solid textiles?
Shapewear?
Have you tried telling people it’s a gun? /j
Maybe try a gaff and some shareware?

But it looks like a girlie lower tum tum so you are probably fine tbh.
Tucking with a good pair of gaff panties will help, as will  layering up. The suggestions of Spanx/body shapers are also good.
What you mean, I didn't notice up until you mentioned it.
Your so gorgeous 🥰
I find it easier with spandex. I get a ton of tight biker shorts,yoga spandex shorts to wear over panties that help squish stuff away xP
Tuck and use control knickers. 👍
Plenty of woman who look just like you miss have no “bump” but it still seems they do. I promise you look great
I use a competition swimsuit with the legs rolled up. They're very compressing and smooth everything out well
That looks like a pretty natural bump to me. I doubt most people would think anything of it.
I have a pair of bikini bottoms that do a good job of hiding the bulge. I’ve never been able to tuck but they do a great job of minimising the bulge
I have a pair of underwear that ""simulates"" the look of a vagina, helps me tuck and if I am wearing something tighter fitting, it makes it look like I don't have a buldge just showing for everyone to see.
If you at all love fanny packs I do recommend them, as a larger person when presenting as female that wanted to hide a FUPA/hanging belly with an assortment of tight clothing, I have a wide range of fanny packs to help me feel more comfortable in my outfit, plus make my arms more available when I’m out at a club/bar by not having to keep track of a purse. My favorite varieties were leather packs with a fringe around the bottom of them, lots of affordable options on Amazon for easy shopping.
There's a way to hide it with medical tape o tight panties but the first one is hard to explain without been explicit
didn’t see what sub this was posted on and was so confused why someone was hiding their baby bump.. but shapewear should help op!!
Wear a fanny pack? By the way you look amazing!
is it not just your pubis??? i think that’s what it’s called! but everyone has a little area of fat there under the tummy! that’s what it looks like, if not just your stomach like other people are saying!
Unclockable tuck kits or a gaff panty. Either work really well. ☺️
I've never been able to figure it out. Sucks so many outfits are completely out of range for me until I can afford surgery :(
If you can't afford shapewear, which is my main suggestion, try out more voluminous skirts! Tighter and more skin-forming clothes are naturally going to show these kinds of things, where a skirt with more material can be extremely concealing.

&#x200B;

Even when I'm looking at mini-skirts, I look for layered options, or things with some kind of belt/buckle to help obscure that region! Accessories will draw the eye, so adding something in the waist area could also help!
Don’t have anything to add advice-wise but you look amazing in that skirt!
Omg you look amazing. I am unsure about the problem but CUTIE!
Size doesn’t matter for tucking, consistency does. i was rockin’ a good 10-11 inches before surgery. Tucked just fine, not at first, but eventually stayed tamed. Just wear jeans with it tucked as best as you can, and eventually it’ll shape backwards. It’s actually something they ask if you do before surgery cause it changes the approach for the surgery as well. It’s yet another patience thing.
I’m actually one of those people that believes in “respect the bulge” but I’m also non binary and don’t have dysphoria with my bits.
Spanx are your friend. Also, I just thought it would help you to know that this is a problem cis women have as well.
Tucking would help I think
I'm transmasc so be aware that I don't have experience with this, but I've heard that there's tucking underwear which is pretty good.
Are you tucking up, or behind? I tuck behind and push my external ovaries into me when I wear anything and I never have a bump, even in skintight denim or polyblends.
It looks like a tummy bump
Seeing your bump wouldn't bother me in fact it might peak my curiosity
lol. tuck tighter.
Just don’t wear tight skirts
Bump? Are you pregnant
I like and use koalaswim.com
Unclockable.com
Have you tried compression shorts too
Loose, pleated skirts? Those'll camouflage quite a bit of bits.
theres usually a bit of fat there to protect the uterus on cis girls so ure all good <3
If you can't hide it using other methods mentioned, textured skirts are your friend. Pleats, lace on top, etc
Linda..
Shapewear absolutely but also having both horizontal and vertical lines in the print isn't doing you any favours in your attempt to hide your bump, despite it being a rly cute skirt. Plainer + darker prints will do that more effectively!!:)
Also, if interest to you is that cis women have bee pouches (there’s definitely a better term for this but that’s what I call them) that are also in that approximate location. So if anyone asks what it is, just say it’s where you keep your bees. I assure you they won’t ask again
While wear panties I sometimes just pull my boy parts up and if I need to then I will wear to pair of underwear to keep it hidden. Just can't wait to have them remove to be the fullest person I desired to be
Duck Tape
Dancers belts, i think is what theyre called, work!
Hip thrust to expand your front thigh muscles?
Okay so, I'm incontinent and hiding my protection has been a science I've been working on for a long time.its a similar issue and my gosh shapewear is a lifesaver
Yes can see the bump  but dam, that's a great look.  
I have a few Carmen Liu underwear and can vouch they are great though a little pricey.
No suggestions unfortunately but you look damn good though!
You are so cute and pretty!
Tuck better, u shouldn't be able to see anything when tucked
 I'm a thick girl but fr wearing s/m or like stretchy underwear two sizes smaller you pull your undies a lil forward so you can push the balls up then lay you're stuff flat then pull the undies up from the back Dm me if you need more help ☺️
gods, you are so beautiful!
Shapewear may be your only choice. But you could try a bikini bottom,  that's helped me but I'm not quite as endowed as you.
I've heard of something called Tuck Tape. You might try looking into it. I follow someone on YouTube that used it so they could wear swimwear.
Gorgeous
One of my mantras when I'm out and about is ""suck your pussy in girl!"" A lot of it can be helped with posture/body position. Tilt your hips back, stick your ass out :)
I wear a gaff under a padded girdle.
i wear compression shorts, it’s very rare to notice a bump in even leggings if you “tuck” them
I'm a fat afab trans guy and I gotta be absolutely honest your ""bump"" looks like mine. Just got a little extra weight to the area, it looks natural imo. Nothing to be embarrassed about. No one would guess it was anything else. You look fine, hun.
that just looks like your stomach baldging out a bit so i dont think you need to worry to much
One of my BFFs swears by [these tucking briefs](https://tomboyx.com/search?type=product%2Cpage&q=Tucking*) because they’re comfy and she says they hide her “business” in skinny jeans lol

Lmk if this is helpful!
What. A. Hotty
wear pleated skirts
I hope you find something that works for you. But remember it doesn't have to be perfectly flat. Just look up ""fat pumpum"" and you'll see what I mean. 😂
✂️
Idk, I think like a binder you can press it down with some material
Have you tried something as simple as adding a girdle?
Well, maybe one can still see your front bump is because your package is really large… a good thing, but maybe not in this case. I personally would not mind😋. By the way do you enjoy WWII War Birds? P51’s, etc? I love them and why I was in the aerospace industry✈️
If tucking doesn’t work, you could try a skater skirt. But otherwise, you look great. I wish I could have a hug (not gay, but I am like Olaf in that I love hugs ⛄️)
In my experience they do wonders for my butt, but nothing for helping me tuck. The only cheap option is tape or the two one size smaller panties
I use naught but a homemade gaff or 2 pairs of panties, never have any bumps or slippage.
Why do you hate my bank account.

Thanks for the recommendation.
Second this.  Leolines is where it's at.
love leolines wearing them rn
Maybe using some sort of those high waisted compression pants?? Ik they're used for like tummy tucking in but they could possible be good for that too?? Also if it helps many women have a little bump on their lower stummoach for reproductive organs so it also can pass as that :))
Whats that?
Ahhh I'm back in the 00's 😌
Yes. I’m AFAB and that’s a totally normal place for folks to have a little extra cushion. If you don’t like it, shapewear, but just know that’s not going to be a “tell”.
I was gonna say, I’m afab and the only women I know that don’t have that have like no body fat. I wouldn’t think anything of it if I saw OP’s.
Yeah I'm afab and that looks pretty typical for a cis woman so I think you're good OP! Otherwise, shapewear could be a good option too. You can find pretty good ones online.
Though they do have sales occasionally
Carmen Liu Lingerie is epic. Tucks it all away and comfortable enough to be worn for a whole day. I wear their underwear exclusively having tried everything else. Thursday at work last week I hit 15,000 steps without any trouble!
BIG gun
Yes though in that skirt, you want to be thinking of the game of cricket a lot.
Wait you already are sorry
lol. duck fighter.
Yes they're twins 😌
As a ex dancer I used my dance belt in the beginning of my transition. But they often make your crotch look exactly like her picture. It bunches your junk together.
Although you do look very nice and confident
please please PLEASE don’t use tape that will cause so much pain. there’s much better alternatives.
I mean, that's great, but some of us are more unfortunately endowed, and it's not really an option.
LMAO
HAHAHAHAHA, I love this community! 🥲
LOL
LeoLines is the way to go!   


The tuck is sooo much easier and do not have to add layer upon layer to hide things.  


Pretty much All I have left in my closet.
Software that you try for free and pay for if you like it and want to continue using it. Doom was released this way, as was PC-Talk (widely considered the progenitor of this method of software distribution).

Sha**p**ew**ear** is undergarments like Spanx.
I think he means shapewear
I don’t know if it works for that I’m trans masc, but they are like a compresión shorts or body suits to get a more firm figure I think
Sharewear would be a little strange unless you like who you share with!
really? ive never seen it on any of the afabs in my life… just assumed i was like chubby or something, so that makes me feel better
Oh yeah! That is great! I love them, they are wonderful! I used Carmen Liu and tomboy X since last September and they were my daily drivers. I never had issues at work, at theme parks, or during martial arts (though I used some yoga shorts on top of them to make sure there were no issues when I was rolling around with others. EnFemme makes a great thong for swimming too. I would put it on first then my one piece and never had issues.
yep almost every tucking trick i try doesn't work for me cause ... well, there's just too much their to squish flat

even after all the shrinkage ...
hey give me back my icon
Lmfao I’m dead.
Looool winzip
Damn, that brought back memories. Used to chat with John Romero and the Carmac Brothers way back when. They sent me a game on 2x720k floppy disks. Instant addiction.
Apparently they give pretty decent results, some others were talking about it in the thread. Its black Friday soon too...
It's not always noticeable and will be smaller on some people, some will be able to mostly make it completely flat, but yeah, there's a slight layer of fatty tissue in front of the uterus to keep it protected. A lot of people use some kind of control panel undergarments as well
Well, i got nicely surprise by a brand BeautyTrans they make some nice pantie for tucking. If it can help !

They are tight tho, can leave some mark on your hips to keep everything in place. But i got used to it. And it is viable for a entire day imo.
no you give it back you stealer 😤"	yzfeqc	trans	1635	0.98	2022-11-19 16:12:02
I think our new babysitter may be trans, and their mother/sister may not be supportive. I would like to be supportive without being nosy.	"We recently hired a new babysitter who was introduced to me as a girl, Dana (name changed for privacy). Their mother has referred to them as ""she/her"" and ""daughter"". However, my 4yo daughter told me that Dana said they were a boy.

Dana wears their hair short, and based on Facebook pics, they dress in a way I'd consider neutral to boyish. But of course, those things don't make a person trans. I'd have no reason to think they were, if my daughter hadn't said something to that effect.

But we are talking about a 4 year old here. We are a trans-positive family, and I've laid some groundwork to explaining these issues to my daughter, but it hasn't been a big topic of conversation because there aren't any trans people in our immediate life, and there is a lot that's still beyond her understanding at this age. Bottom line, she doesn't know anything about being in/out, the issues around pronouns, the history of stigma etc. She has a vague sense that boy/girl isn't the whole story, and that's really it.

But unless my daughter is making things up because Dana looks a little different (which is definitely possible!), or misunderstood something (also very possible), it seems like Dana was comfortable telling my daughter that they are a boy, which is not how they were introduced to me, or discussed in my presence.

Now. It's possible that Dana's mother is assuming things about me and using she/her pronouns for that reason. We live in Arkansas, and around here it's a safe bet that people you meet are conservative, Southern Baptists, with all that typically entails.

It's ALSO possible that Dana's mother is a conservative Southerner, and doesn't acknowledge Dana as a boy.

It's ALSO possible that my 4yo is just not a great communicator yet because she's 4, and Dana is a girl who just happens to prefer short hair and baggy hoodies.

So. If Dana came out to my daughter, and Dana's mother is not supportive, I would very much like for our house to be a place where Dana feels supported, and safe being their self. Places like that are hard to come by around here. But Dana has only been spoken about as a girl in my presence, and I feel that it's insensitive and not my business to just ask someone if they are trans based on something a 4yo said. But Dana is only 14, growing up in an environment (maybe in a family) that only acknowledges very narrow views around gender and sexuality, and at the very least they don't conform to female gender norms. I would love to be a safe harbor, if I can, and I would really appreciate advice on how to do that with sensitivity, respect, and tact."	"Please don't listen to the comments saying to ask her pronouns, this is a very bad position for her to be in. It essentially forces her to lie or come out. 

A better way would be to mention your own pronouns, wear an ally pin, mention an LGBT friend, etc. 

please don't put her on the spot. I cant even imagine how scary that would be.
I also think a well placed flag or two can go a LONG way! 

A lot of trans people (myself included) tend to do quick assessments of the world around us to view environments and people as ""safe"" or ""not safe"". 

I know when I see a store that has a rainbow flag in the window (or a trans flag, or that one flag with both the rainbow and the trans triangle thingy), I immediately think ""safe"" and feel much more comfortable there. While that might be an extreme generalization and it is always possible that places only use flags to seem ""woke"" or ""with the times"", it's usually been a pretty good indicator for what I can expect.

If you had, say, a rainbow/trans/inclusive flag on your fridge, that could be something to show that you are a trans-positive space and could help Dana feel more comfortable. It's subtle, and probably isn't something that will directly answer your questions, but it could go a long way in helping a young person feel a bit more accepted in an unfamiliar environment. :)
Trans parent of a trans kid here. Skip the pronoun thing. That’s gonna read as ham handed and confrontational in a conservative area. Plus, you run the risk of your kid repeating it in unsafe areas. Seeding your house with safe markers is better. Maybe pick up some books on gender issues that you can leave lying out, definitely grab some pride flags (there’s an actual ally flag), casually add some rainbows to your decor.

Once you’ve made your house a beacon of safety, that gives the babysitter room to come to you on their own terms. 

One thing you haven’t considered is that she’s just a standard issue lesbian. 

So, go w/ the progress pride flag (including intersex ppl if you can manage it) or the ally flag, or a suspicious amount of rainbows.
i don’t think it’s a good idea to ask them their pronouns, it forces them to choose between coming out and going into the closet and they don’t necessarily know if you have good intention or are just being nosy. i think if you just let them know that your daughter told you that they’re a boy, and it they would prefer that you use a different name and/or the use of different pronouns that your house is a safe place for that, but i wouldn’t ask them looking for an answer, just tell them that they can let you know if they want. they might want to be a little more comfortable before opening that part of themself to you. when i was around this age and was coming to terms with being nb, a child asked me if a was a boy or a girl and i said neither. it made me feel really affirmed, but i wouldnt have felt good defining myself to adults. it’s lovely to see someone being so thoughtful about trans youth, good luck!
Great suggestions from the others, but to address the ""4-year-old"" angle: when I got a short, masculine haircut, the first thing my then 4-year-old said was literally, ""Mommy is not a girl anymore! You can't be the princess when we play from now on, you'll be the king."" Kids at that age have a rather absolute way of thinking about gender.
Why don't you tell them just that? Your child said that they identify as a boy, and you are not sure if that's true, but if it is you support them. Then you can ask if they are comfortable discussing these things with you.
Please DO NOT ask pronouns

Asking them about their pronouns straight up, can be very scary, especially in a conservative area. I come from a conservative middle eastern family, when I cut my hair short the amount of backlash I got was a lot to say the least.
An outward display of acceptance in the community in general is a great way to foster conversations. I have trans, and other pride flags and a hrc flags in my living room. There's no question my house is a safe space. But it's drastic because I'm dramatic and trans AF, so makes sense. But any type of display of acceptance will be picked up. With a teen, they'll internalize and you may have to bump to have a meaningful conversation
Hey man I also live in arkansas and I wanna say you're doing lovely being so kind to the trans community down here! 

I'd say just casually approach the convo with Dana! ""My daughter said you told her that you were a boy. That's completely fine, I just wanted to ask you if she was misunderstanding or if you are a boy, and if you are, would you like to be called by a different name and pronouns? I can only use them in private if you would prefer that as well."" 

That type of thing, yk? Hope all goes well! Best of luck<3

Edit: I also wanna add other ways of approaching the situation so you have some ideas! 

You could also simply put up some support markers around the house (pride flags, or maybe some decor with pride flags subtely painted on them - I have a teeny tiny trans pride flag (about 1"" x1"" )that I painted on a binder back in school. 

You could tell them that if they aren't comfortable answering your questions they absolutely do not have to and you'll continue to call them by the name and pronouns you were given. 

Anything you can do to make them feel safe and if they don't want to come out and tell you yet - or ever - that's okay! But if you provide them a clearly safe space, they might feel comfortable to come to you on their own terms and you can be that source of support for them. 

Arkansas is a really tough place to be if you're queer, so safety is usually our #1 concern
I also love in Arkansas ;-;
Glad to see there’s some supportive people out here
I think it’s great that you want to provide a safe space for a young person - trans or not! 

It’s not appropriate for you to ask them if they are trans or their pronouns, but you can help to indicate that they are in a safe space to share those things about themself by modelling it yourself. It might be useful to say to them, next time you see them, “oh by the way, I use X/Y pronouns”. Sharing your own makes it easier for someone else to if they might feel vulnerable doing so otherwise, but you shouldn’t ask anyone their pronouns outright - as you point out, there might be very good reason for them not to share them where you are.
I ran away when I was 14 from severely abusive family, I'm also trans Female. My whole family and all my friends left me. I wish I had one person in my life real time that was protrans then and still to this point at 43. All my friends and family told me to kill myself instead of transitioning 😭
You could ask Dana what their preferred pronouns are and use them consistently.
Just hang a few small flags in your house out of sight of i guess strangers who dont stay in your house all the time but very noticable to people who work or live there.

Look for a progress flag somewhere.

Its indirect but if the babysitter is trans it's an indirect way of saying your LGBTQ+ friendly and they might come out themselves. Its less scary then coming out considering it is Arkansas and you are an adult. It's hard to convince adults to respect you as you are but kids hardly care if you give them lite context. If an adult comes to a young trans kid and asks them their pronouns they might shut down.

Just like indirectly put out flags. Its like when you nod to someone at the bus stop.
Why be judgemental just tell em your there if they need you.
Simple, slap a good o'l trans rights flag in the house somewhere and let them come to you.
I'd say when ""Dana"" is around you should mention some trans people, or people who have come out as trans (even if it's fake stories) and say how you're super happy for them, and glad that they could be themselves. Be open a/b talking a/b all types of people that you think relate to them, and speak positive a/b them. Eventually this ""Dana"" will open up to you if they feel comfortable enough or if they are, in fact, trans.
Next time you see Dana, maybe try something like “hey, I forgot to mention when introducing myself, my pronouns are ___. What are yours?” Offering yours first allows Dana to see that you’re a supportive, trans-positive person.
I just wanted you to know you are 100% the sweetest person for being that considerate.
Honestly, I would feel safe if there was a rainbow pride flag in your house.
Don’t ask Dana outright. Being put on the spot is scary. Maybe put a pride flag in an easily seen spot so they know your supportive. Even then, it may take Dana some time to come to you about it. Building up the courage to tell someone takes time.
aren’t there kids books about being trans? I assume there’s a possibility that dana reads to your child, and that would be a very effective way to signal “this is a trans-affirming household” without raising any of their suspicions that you might know something (which could potentially make them super anxious if they aren’t ready to come out to you yet, even knowing that your household is supportive. for example, my family is super trans-affirming, and I still had a panic attack when my sister texted me asking about my gender stuff. even knowing full well she’d be fine with it, I simply wasn’t ready for her to know)
Maybe you can just leave a mag or a little book about being trans, just one, at a place where they can see it. I think it can be reassuring. I'm baby sitter and I didn't say anything to parents because I was anxious about their possible reaction. And I think that find something like this would make me less anxious. People who have this type of books in their house and who are transphobic are rare.
I think a lot of the advice here is good but I would also suggest to just generally be supportive and kind. Like, maybe try to have Dana over some other times when she isn’t babysitting? Like, maybe for dinner or just to do some stuff with your family on occasion. 

Just…be around and be kind and supportive. If something goes down with her family, whether it’s because she turns out to be trans or anything else, knowing she has other people to turn to will go a long way.
Having been in her situation, DON'T ask them anything at all. We appreciate the sentiment of wanting to provide a safe and welcoming environment to someone who might not have many of those, but it will just make this kid feel really awkward no matter what. Stick a trans flag magnet on your refrigerator to make it clear that it's a supportive household and let it be.
Get the applicable flag, which sounds like the Straight Ally flag for you, and put it where they’ll see it when they babysit.
Go ahead and ask them their pronouns, it's the most honest and respectful thing you can do in this situation
Woah, the empathy and sensitivity on display here is great, you did a great job reading the situation. Thanks for being a good ally. I would recommend just asking for their pronouns, being asked about it (in a way that doesn’t make it a big deal) is far better than being misgendered imo, especially if it leads to acknowledgement and support
I think it's best to ask there pronouns and say it's a safe place here and what they say back should give you your answer
If you don’t want to ask directly consider putting up a bowl with pronoun tags and/or stickers for people to write their name on. 

Maybe that’s enough to subtly show you’re supportive. 

Or if you want to be a bit more straight forward just say something like „Oh btw we never asked, what are your preferred pronouns?“

Or if you really want to go for it, just ask. Most of the time I’d prefer just being asked over awkwardly tiptoeing around the elephant in the room.
If you want to ask and are worried about coming off as confrontational or nosy, start by not addressing them by their name in case they have a chosen one you don't know and dislike this name.

Say something like ""hey I have a question, my daughter said something that made me think you might not be cis. If that' the case I want to ask what your pronouns are and what we should call you while you're here.""

It lets them know you're supportive and gives them the option of coming out, while also showing that you understand it may just be a ""for here"" thing because discretion around their family may be necessary. And avoids anything like flat out saying ""are you trans?"" Which feels a lot scarier to be asked.
direct confrontation is not always the best way to go. especially for someone who (seems to be) in the closet. making your home feel like a safe place is one way for them to relax a little and they might come to you, and you can get your answers there. 

asking people for their pronouns is good in some situations, such as first meeting, but if you already have established this and you ask out of nowhere that essentially boils down to ""hey, i have clocked you as trans and i feel entitled to this information"" even if this is not your intention, it is natural for trans people to feel unsafe in that sort of situation. 

its great that you are looking to be a safe place for dana! genuinely i am sure that they will appreciate the effort and comfort of your support. like other people said, maybe some pride stuff around the house, casually mentioning queer people (in a way that does not 100% center their queerness either, that way it communicates to them that this kind of discussion is okay) etc, if they want to come out to you when they feel safe, they will! it will be so much more comfortable for them to be able to tell you on their own terms than if they feel they are being backed into a corner to answer the big ""are you trans"" question, even if its not quite stated that way
If you approach them to confirm what your child said I would make it clear that if they're not safe to be out at home then you can switch pronouns in the presence of her mother so they know your home is a safe space, of course you'd have to make sure your 4 year old doesn't go telling anyone. and I dont know much about childcare but there's probably an age appropriate way to explain that its a matter of safety, not a lie and not technically misgendering in this case.

They might deny it because they're not ready to be out and if that's the case I wouldn't press it and just continue to show your support and make it known you're a safe person to talk to about it.
Just a moment to say thank you OP. It's awesome that you came here to ask these questions. It not only shows you are looking out for your babysitter it shows us there are allies out there really looking out for us and our safety. A bunch of people around here have already given some great advice. My take is let them come to you. Heck placing a trans positive fridge magnet on the fridge goes a long way to making a place feel safer.

I've had a few allies ask my pronouns where there was risk of being overheard by folk who gave me pause. It can be nerve wracking especially for young folk to be put on the spot. If the concern is your kid outting them to their parents that can be potentially difficult. You can leave them a letter saying "" We won't mention it unless you bring it up as we don't want to put you on the spot but we just wanted you to know that our daughter has been calling you a boy. We just wanted to check in and make sure that this is okay because we are worried this might be potentially risky around your parents. Your safety is very important to us so if there is anything you need let us know. ""
I think the best way is to just show you’re an ally of the community and maybe just spark up small talk with Dana and get a little closer so maybe they’ll eventually be comfortable talking about stuff like that, assuming Dana is trans
Interesting conundrum. Four year olds are not usually at the point where they understand the complexities of gender. As they will call most men with long hair women. But you may be onto something. Confronting them about it is not the way to go, if I was still closeted I would be terrified if my employer asked me about anything close to that, even in the nicest possible way. Perhaps placing some subtle trans-potitive stuff around your house where they are likely to be would be a good idea.
I’m confused about why people are saying it’s bad to just straight up ask pronouns. Could anyone explain this? When people ask me this, I automatically feel like they are a safe person
Get a tiny little something trans colored and put it in the house in a normal place

Repeat with new trans item each time they come over

Congratulations, your house now looks super trans and super cool

Fuck, what was the question?
I’d add that you can blatantly show her that your house is a safe environment by talking to someone about another trans person on the phone. Of course, make sure she’s somewhat close so you make sure she’ll listen to what you’re saying. And then you throw some “omg, yeah, of course I know Hanna, she’s just come out as trans to me, she looks so happy to have discovered herself! It’s she/her her pronouns, right? I hope I’m not making a mess here!” and this kind of stuff. I mean, you can even make up stuff if you want xd. I personally wouldn’t feel so comfortable in a house suddenly packed with subtle flags and stuff. It’d be very weird to say the least! But I’d be thrilled to hear my “boss” being openly trans-positive :), even if I were only an ally or a lesbian or whatever xd
I grew up in rural Nevada where transphobia is rampant and couldn't come out until I moved to the city. if it wouldn't be bad enough for a trans adult living out there, imagine being a trans youth undergoing puberty, social changes, and dealing with peer groups. (that is to say, growing up trans with zero resources and adults who don't care about anything but church and work is absolute hell.) keep it simple and discreet by putting up a pride flag (trans, progress, etc) and let Dana come out on their own terms. you can also (lightly!) bring up trans issues and get into political topics, and ask them what they think about certain things (""what do you think of climate change?"") to gauge how comfortable they are with sharing their views. but ultimately, it's best to let teenagers come to you because, well, they're teenagers. when you make them feel like they have choices and autonomy to a degree by asking them about themselves (again, asking them about their views and sharing some of your own), they will warm up to you better. best of luck
Buy a couple of trans/LGBTQIA+ pins or magnets and just have them casually placed in common places! That way its clear but you arent forcing her to either lie or come out!
Be open with your own stuff, and eventually they may trust you not to narc them out. Don’t force the issue. It can have long-term negative consequences if the kid has cruel parents.
My babysitters started wearing pronoun pins and built a good relationship by asking me my opinions on baby clothes and hair pins. They have an amab child and said they didn’t want him getting hot as he grows up so they want to get him used to pulling his hair back. After a bit they asked me if I was trans, or born intersex and just prefer they/them since I wouldn’t know what organs would work. This was when I was in middle school lol
pride fridge magnet! don't confront, just make sure your space is welcoming
Bless you for trying to be a safe place in that part of the country, considering I'm looking to try to move out of my transphobic parents' house (I'm mtn) hearing about what you're doing really helps me keep hope I can get out of this spot.
Don't ask her anything directly, that would be putting them on the spot, instead show your allyship.

Put an ally flag magnet on your fridge, acknowledge they/them can be used as singular pronouns, suspicious amount of pride stuff, cassually talk about an LGBTQ+ friend, just be sure they feels safe in your house
Ask for pronouns and try to keep it secret between the both of you.
People, especially people who always might be a little on edge around people who might not accept them will usually pick up on little hints. I’d give some small hints or if you do want to just straight up talk to them, maybe bring up that your daughter said something and say that they don’t have to say anything but just know that you’re accepting if they do need someone to be there for them and all that.
Before my wife was out publicly, one of her best friends picked up on the signs that she was trans and he started making it very obvious that he was an ally. He never asked her directly, but it made her comfortable to come out to him when she was ready.

Basically, rather than putting someone on the spot, make it known that you're safe and supportive. I think a lot of queer people in general would appreciate this approach.
As a trans man who worked in childcare before I came out: it’s very frequent that young kids struggle with understanding gender vs sex. If the babysitter looks like a boy (so to speak), it’s still very much possible that they’re a girl and your child is just associating traditionally masculine things (short hair, “boy” clothes, etc.) with being a boy as that’s an age appropriate understanding of gender identity.

Also, personally, I may have been a little uncomfortable being asked about my gender identity by most of the parents I worked for. Be kind and supportive about it at home and around her, but there’s probably an even greater chance that your sitter is just a tomboy.
Why don’t you buy your daughter some books about trans and other LGBTQ issues? Having books with LGBTQ characters and storyline’s available for Dana to see in your daughters room/to read to her is a great sign of allyship- with the added bonus of supporting the discussions you are already have been having with your daughter. 

Some suggestions to get you started:
Prince and Knight
The Hips on the drag queen go swish swish swish
Super-me
Jacob’s new dress
My shadow is pink
A is for activist
Peanut goes for the gold
This. If someone isn't in a safe space to come out to their family, it's not fair to assume they're comfortable coming out to you. They would be put in a position of either coming out or misgendering themselves.
I really hope OP sees this, if I were still closeted and this happened to me it'd be rather scary to me, and I know a lot of other people who would too
Yeah, I'm happy to know people who are supportive of trans people, but I haven't come out to anyone besides my doctor because I feel like I can't trust that word won't get out that I'm trans. In this situation just subtly being an ally is enough. If they feel safe coming out they'll come out.
Yes, this!  The best thing to do is to present yourself as an ally and safe person to potentially come out to.  A little progress flag in the home goes a long way.
Adding on to this! Not the same situation but when I was in uni seeing an LGBT ally sticker on a professor’s office instantly made me feel safer much more than if they’d asked me for pronouns before I came out.

Thank you for being such an amazing person OP!!
Absolutely this.

It's also entirely possible that Dana was AMAB and has transitioned to female and happens to have an accepting mother, but your daughter misunderstood some part of that and only caught the AMAB.

Accept what you are given, be open to it changing in any direction, and don't push for more than Dana is comfortable volunteering.

If you're truly raising your daughter in a trans-inclusive household, I think it'll be fairly apparent to Dana pretty quickly. If he/she/they feel the need or desire to come out, they will.
Given the nature of Arkansas, the babysitter probably won't feel safe discussing it with someone she barely knows if she is trans.
Thank you very much for clearing this up for me, and thanks to everyone who upvoted to make sure I'd see it. This is the exact kind of learning I am trying to do at this point in my life. I'm going to buy some fridge magnets, and maybe a sticker for the large water jug I carry with me everywhere. Dana is sure to see one of them at some point, and if they feel comfortable initiating a conversation, they can. And while I will occasionally deal with Dana's mother, she will only be around my house for pickup/drop off, so it's very unlikely she'd even see them. So the chances of me forcing an uncomfortable situation are virtually zero. Again, it's fully possible that the mother is supportive, and our conversations simply haven't veered close enough to these issues for me to get a sense of her feelings on them.
I wish ppl outside of this post could see this response
Correct me if im wrong

Is it possible for OP to put everything on the table without directly asking dana and possibly traumatizing her? For example, ""Dana (baby name) has said that you are a boy. I understand you were introduced to me as a girl. Im not putting you on the spot. You dont have to disclose anything that you're not comfortable. I just would like to say that you are 100% safe within this household and however you would like to be addressed inside it will happen."" 

Im just thinking this so that there's not the weird stepping on eggshells. I may be wrong snd i hope this response doesnt offend anyone
This post mentions ""Dana"" possibly being a transmasc, you shouldn't use she/her pronouns for them but rather they/them

I agree though, I would freeze and mute if someone in a conservative place asked me for my pronouns
This is the way to go. Display allyship and provide a space for them to comment if they so desire.
I’ve been hurt by peoples “curiously” and well meaning invitations to “talk” to them so many times that I am now in a lot of therapy to just deconstruct all the anxiety-driven answers I gave and how to clean them up and how helpless it made me feel. And on the spot. To this day I freak out to come out because it feels like everyone’s talking about me. They’re not.

They just didn’t care what being on the spot feels like, didn’t care who else just asked or would ask in a second — and it hurt when I told people, and they didn’t honor it, or didn’t come to the rescue when sexist things were said or my pronouns were disrespected or my gender presentation was even made fun of. 

That’s all my baggage to say, the road to Hell is really already well paved by all the people before and after you with similar good intentions.

*it’s hard to be a good person. You have to account for all the good people before you who meant well but understood a bit less*

I would name drop to heck all the queer celebrities you know and make a safe space for them to introduce their ideas. It’s much more exciting to come out on your own, or name drop your hints, and find out someone is a safe space…

…than to be told someone is a safe space, but because they didn’t take care of the energy in telling you that (“formally informing you”), and feel like it’s indeed safe but not entirely safe emotionally because what if they don’t know what to do? What if they still need clear answers? Still have deadlines? Still want to know? 

Ten years later people are starting to apologize to me for inviting me to tell them my pronouns multiple redundant times in our friendship. They’ve noticed it pushed us apart. I couldn’t see them again without anticipating another question. 

I came out to a few people as my true gender, and they betrayed me with nagging me to come out to my family while being not even a little bit able to help with my family.
Agreed, the acceptable alternative is to give your pronouns, especially if cis. This subtle but important message tells those who are not cis that you are supportive. If they're comfortable, they'll approach.
Just nonchalantly be hanging a 72"" trans flag in your living room as they show up to babysit lmao
> or that one flag with both the rainbow and the trans triangle thingy

As a heads up, I believe the accepted name is the ""Progress Pride"" flag.
Making a young person feel more comfortable is literally my only goal. I don't need my questions answered. It isn't about me.
Lol standard issue lesbian 😂 yes sir, I got this lesbian factory direct
A suspicious amount of rainbows is my goal aesthetic
I can confirm this. A 5 year old in my family always questions if I’m a boy or girl because I have short nails, don’t wear makeup, shave my legs, etc.

But they tend to ask a lot more questions when you explain the them what androgynous is. It’s likely if the kid got curious about why the babysitter doesn’t dress feminine, the kid would have asked. Since they know about trans people, they may have asked about that and babysitter may have felt comfortable. 

I would say the best bet is to put a progress flag up so they know they’re at least safe there.
I’m cis (woman), so I hope it’s okay for me to add my two cents... I had short hair as a kid. Tons of people assumed I was a boy or just asked me. Parents, kids, relatives... and I’m sure that lots people that didn’t ask just told others I was a boy. Kids are intuitive, but that also means they pick up quickly on social “norms”, and see short hair and assume boy. Your advice is very appreciated!! Thanks for the insight.
Yes! This is why I'm a little nervous about this! Bc my daughter was so abundantly clear about what she was told, but that literally tells me nothing solid😅
This sounds like a good way of doing it. I've always liked the open, honest, and compassionate approach.
This.
Open nonjudgemental talk is always the best.
Even when she does not reply honest to the question because she is scared, she'll know that you are a safe place if she once want to talk honest to a real person about that.
Also something like a pride flag sticking somewhere is also a nice symbol. I have one sticking in a bonsai pot on my dinning table :)
If it's really that terrible at where you live, you might be the only person she knows of who is defiently supportive. In her age for me this would have been a real game changer.
Also what pronouns they’d like you to use
Maybe the move is to preface by saying that they're supportive and then ask about pronouns?
It's a shame my wife and I are planning to move next year, bc we've slowly started packing things away, including a massive rainbow painting my wife made. It wasn't necessarily made as a statement of any kind, just a color experiment, but it's not the kind of thing you'd see on the wall of an unsupportive home.
> I'm dramatic and trans AF

This is a good idea
That's what I was thinking. Unless something sketchy happens or whatever, just treat people like people. No need to go off redecorating the house to look ""inclusive"" or putting pressure on the kid. Just don't be a dick and if they want to bring it up, they will.
Arkansas is legislatively one of the most transphobic states. Trying to force someone to come out there is not friendly.
Second this!! Going back and offering your pronouns offers them the opportunity to A) see you are supportive in case they/their mother were nervous to share with you, B) their mother is not supportive, or C) give you and them an opportunity to thing about gender and gender presentation with your 4yo.
Putting someone on the spot asking them to lie or come out in a highly transphobic state isn't that nice.
This! I'm not sure why people are saying don't ask Dana what pronouns are preferred. You can ask preferred pronouns in any context and with anyone. It's not rude or invasive and it shows that you care about Dana's comfort and wellbeing in your home. Honestly, it would give Dana the chance to tell you what they prefer you use. Use whatever pronouns Dana tells you without question. You can also ask Dana if it's safe to use those pronouns around their family or if they prefer you refer to them differently when the family may be present. By doing this, you open up your home as a safe space.
Wish this had more upvotes, bc this is the one. Subtle, non-intrusive, but clear. And in a spot where a babysitter is virtually guaranteed to see it, but their possibly unsupportive parent probably never will.
the amount of people saying to ask for their pronouns is awful. it's a bad idea all around
Even then i think Dana could feel very uneasy and uncomfortable. Especially since it seems they live in a conservative area.

Best bet is to not bring it up, indirectly show support by having flags in your house etc.
If that were to happen to me, I'd feel really uncomfortable.

I know you're coming from a caring place, and I appreciate that. But that'd be too much for me to handle if it were me in that sitiation.

It would make me feel like I was clocked. Even if it were done with the best of intentions, I'd feel uneasy, and probably think about it all day (""did they know I'm trans? Am I *that* obviously trans? What do they want from me?""). It'd drive me crazy.
That's the kind of subtlety I'd appreciate. I need giant flashing signs or I am crippled with uncertainty. 

In all seriousness a big flag would probably make me more comfortable than a small flag. If I was uncertain and scared a small flag might be like, ""oh I guess they might be an ally, maybe"" a bigger flag feels like a larger level of support and acceptance. That isn't exactly logical but yeah, bigger flag would work for me haha.
Sounds like a good idea lmao
Ooh! Thanks for letting me know!
Can confirm, my little brother did that when I got my hair cut short. He used he/him and my mom asked why and he went “because (my name) has short hair so he’s a boy.” At the time I didn’t know I was trans but I did try to help him understand that short hair doesn’t equal immediate boy.
Saying ""if you want us to use different pronouns, let us know"" is better than ""what pronouns should we use"" because it doesn't put the person on the spot, forcing them to lie or come out.
The only thing that makes it any less scary is if you appear to be trustable, and just hinting that your supportive. It can be incredibly dangerous to come out in conservative areas, the only thing that can make someone comfortable enough to come out is if they trust you enough and believe that you won't cause harm to them even if you don't support queer people, if they believe that they can come out without the risk of you outing them, that's as safe as it will get. People can say that they're supportive as much as they want, it changes nothing. When it comes to lgbtqia+ issues there is an incredible amount of people who say that they're supportive but are really not, they just say it to improve what they look like to outsiders, my father is like that, so is my ex-best friend, neither are in my life anymore.
It's not me wanting to hurt myself, I was posting that my entire family told me to kill myself rather than transition into a female. That makes me incredibly sad but I would never take my own life ok.
Asking pronouns after sharing your own is a highly trans-friendly thing to do here. Definitely not read as “forcing” someone to come out. I guess it’s different in the US?
In a personal situation I think not. You can talk one on one with people
Okay thank you! I just had the thought :)
Im queer so on one hand i totally understand this. I spent my earlier years clocking everything i did.

On the other hand im an uncle and i think thats where it came from lol. I always try to be a safe space for those kids or any kids rather cause they dont have a dad like OP nor did I
Ahahha I agree. Little flag could just mean “oh this is a freebie you got somewhere and put up to show passive support”… big flag means “damn you went out of your way to acquire this and feel that it is worthy of taking up significant space in your home”

It's extremely uncommon in conservative areas.
I wouldn’t want to be put in that situation even if it’s one-on-one and someone I know really well. I will come out when I’m ready to come out.
The bot is trying to be helpful, good bot.
Uncommon doesn’t mean it’s wrong or right. It’s not exactly ‘common’ to use a pronoun-oriented introduction here, but it is trans-inclusive and welcoming. 

It’s also worth noting that the World Wide Web is accessible outside of the USA, and conservative areas look different in different places.
Alabama, USA here, but in a college town with a large mix of political ideologies. If someone asked me my pronouns, I honestly don’t know how I would respond. It either forces me to lie (which makes me feel bad and like I’m “not trans enough”) or to come out to a person I don’t want to be out to. Or to come out in a way that makes me super uncomfortable. I will come out to someone when I am ready and in a way that makes me comfortable. I would rather people assume I’m whatever gender they want until I’m far enough along my transition to be comfortable being out of the closet.
My conservative areas comment was referencing your ""I guess it’s different in the US"" comment, and referencing areas similar to where OP is located. When you ask a closeted person their pronouns in an area that is hostile to trans people, they may not feel safe actually sharing their pronouns, and be forced to lie due to safety concerns. Yes, the web is available outside the USA, but in person interactions are quite different, and can have more negative outcomes. You can look at the anti trans laws introduced and passed to see why someone wouldn't feel safe in that state coming out to people.

i wish I was born as female	"idek why , im so disappointed that I am male.
i dont feel like im in the wrong body most of the time, i just cant explain it"	"I'd have avoided a lot of trauma if I'd been born a girl.

On the bright side, I'm also avoiding a lot of traum by transitioning now.
Welcome
I don't have the same feeling, as I like my genitals, but I'm SUPER excited to look and feel like a woman
Gender dysphoria varies per individual (Feeling like you’re in the wrong body.) Some get it a lot, some hardly ever. It wouldn’t make you any less trans to not feel like you’re in the wrong body most of the time. I had the same issue as an egg, and denied being trans so long because of it. I didn’t necessarily hate my male self a lot, but what finally ended the questioning was realizing how much happier being a woman would make me. Now that I’ve made the choice, I only regret having not done it sooner.

I’m not sure if you’re questioning, but cis people don’t tend to emphasize their disappointment of being their birth gender. You most definitely would be trans based on this post haha!
""Born in the wrong body"" is just a phrase used by trans people to explain their feelings to cis people.
Usually its not like that
You're able to do some exploring, and with enough exploration, I'm sure you'll find the truth and what's comfortable for you. But yes, that's a feeling of being trans. You're welcome here like everyone else who's having the same experience.
I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong body however if I was born as a cis female I feel like my experiences would have been so different and much better
I wish I had a male body :/
That sounds pretty close to how I felt.  For about a year I simply identified as “not a man.”  After about a year of that I came to the realization that I am a woman.  That said, my dysphoria has never been super intense, and I’m very gender non-conforming.  Right on the edge of “non-binary.”  I’m on feminizing hormones and I definitely need them… but I’m never getting bottom surgery because I don’t feel like I need it.

Just… live in the body you want as the gender you are, Imo.  Don’t overthink it and don’t push yourself into things you don’t want or let other people push you into them.  take your time.  Experiment.
I wish I could change bodies with you. Same situation, almost
I still don’t know if I’m trans bcos at times I enjoy my life and the joys of being a gay male. But if there was a button that would turn me into a woman permanently, and everything would be okay, I think I would press the button, but I’m not entirely sure if I would get bored and want to go back
Likewise lol
Definitely sounds like you are
Same
Insert obi wan Kenobi ""that's why I'm here"" meme. I feel the same way.
me too, I like having [male genitalia] but I would also be quite happy not having such, and then there's the added bonus of estrogen and such
I feel the same, but in the opposite way. I have a lot of physical dysphoria and while the changes im getting on T make me feel more like my body is my own, i sometimes think ill always feel like a stranger in my own body bc it will never be male.

I hope you can find ways to make your body feel more like your own, more like a home. I know being trans comes with a lot of pain, and that it is often even worse for trans women. Still, there is more than one way to be a woman. Hopefully you can find the way thats right for you.
Same omg
if you’re a girl then you’re a girl, if you’re a man then you’re a man, if you’re neither then you’re neither, it’s still you and i know that a lot of trans people here will support you
This happens. In truth, you’re a girl. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Hang in there. Trust people on here who affirm who you are. There’s a lot more of us out there than you think. 
If you ever get to the point where you wonder if this is true, PM me. I’ll be here for you.
yea it basically feels like this is the body that i was always destined to have, just with a different configuration. my doctor described it perfectly to me by saying i simply have an endocrine disorder, which is exactly how i feel.
Give this a read.

I always felt like I just didn't fit anywhere, or wasn't good at being a person in a way no one else seemed to struggle with. It was pretty cathartic to see that stuff already put into words by others going through it.
Sometimes I wish the same
I understand what you’re feeling, take your time and explore your emotions. Think about what you would be called if you were a girl, if you feel happy being called a girl, explore trans reddit and see if you feel what we are feeling. (It sounds like you do) also Hey happy new years
I wish so much every night that I would wake up being female. I even thought about cutting it off
Welcome to the club!
ok,i ve seen i little bit of your history on reddit, and i think you should go to see an expert, becouse i think having someone who knows what they re talking about would be beneficial to you! take care -Emilia
I totally feel the same exact way, it’s truly good to know I’m not alone, which is why I’m embracing my femininity, i’m embracing who I’m truly suppose to me..
If I could give some advice: labels are so intimidating, and don't really matter in the end. If you want to wear a dress, makeup, stereotypically ""female"" things, try it out in the comfort of your home and see how it feels! You don't even need to tell anyone. If you think you want to experiment with different pronouns, find a trusted friend and ask them to use a new set of pronouns when you're alone to see how it feels. No on on the internet can tell you ""you're trans"" or ""you're not trans"". It's a deeply personal experience and every individual  will interpret it differently. I think it's more productive to experiment with physical things and see how it makes you feel than to stay up all night torturing yourself with the question ""am I trans or not"". You could be trans, or non-binary, or you could just be a cis guy who really likes things that society has deemed only for women. Only you can figure that out for yourself. Be safe, be kind to yourself, and surround yourself with people who love and accept you for who you are
I grew up a male feeling I was born in the wrong body and I to this day hate who I am I constantly have to cry inside because of this awful pain I was born into do I understand that feeling you have I tried to hide my feelings like such but always come back to being saddened by not being female I feel I should of talked to a professional but never had the money don’t be me sweetheart talk to someone and sort this out sweetie hugs and kisses sweetie 💋⚧
same except all of us trans girls are born girls but just don't look like girls but we are powerful.
You mean Cisgender 😒
Honestly maybe you were? Genitals don’t equate gender, lots of people are misgendered at birth.

Same, screw you gentics, you made me almost blind, a guy and sad. In conclusion genes can fuck off
15yo M diagnosed with OCD here and I don’t think I have trans ocd anymore. In my dreams I can’t tell if I’m picturing myself as a woman or a man because I’ve never really paid much attention. Is this a sign of something? Im on an hrt waitlist right now.
You should read [the gender dysphoria bible](genderdysphoria.fyi)
Yeah
You and me both
Sounds like you were born in the wrong body
Could you be Genderfluid? It's just an assumption. Here's the definition. 

**Genderfluid - Someone who is genderfluid is a person whose identity (the gender they identify with most) is not fixed. It can change over time or from day to day. Fluid is a form of gender identity or gender expression, rather than a sexual orientation.**

source - [https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-is-fluid#:\~:text=Someone%20who%20is%20fluid%20%2D%2D,rather%20than%20a%20sexual%20orientation](https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-is-fluid#:~:text=Someone%20who%20is%20fluid%20%2D%2D,rather%20than%20a%20sexual%20orientation).

Hope it helps. If not, then I'm sorry.
Its because of the outdated concepts of masculine and feminine, aka gender. Under masculine and feminine traits are ascribed to each ie aggressive etc masculine nuturing etc feminine. These are outdated because as we now know men and women are equal, with the exception of how we look and a few minor biochemical reactions, however we all gravitate to one side or the other whether born into the ""right"" body or not. Society has not evolved to catch up with this reality yet, so to be male u must be ""masculine"" and to be female u must be ""feminine"", which is false there is no masculine or feminine only individual personality traits that are exactly that, individual, rather than gender specific.
Same here, but 180 degrees.
I wish I was born as female and able-bodied
mm
I wish I was born as male
Sam
I feel the same, because i wish i was born a boy but this stupid female body is still my body. I always thought that i had to think i was born in the wrong body to be trans but idek anymore
I get it.  I think a lot of it is that in many cultures, certainly in the US, it is okay to be a tomboy but there is really no kind or encouraging term for feminine boys;  that represents a mindset that works to make us shut our mouths and live with the belief it is some illness. ‘Nancy boy’ and ‘sissy’ are not analogous to ‘tomboy’ and ‘gamine.’ The latter two connote freedom, power, and aspiration whereas the first two are about derision.  

For myself, I feel there would be no need for me to use the language ‘identify as’ were I just allowed to be and had never felt the pressure to hide or learned shame for simply having the nature I do and wanting to live within my integrity.

So, for me, I look at girls and women and they represent a free expression of what I grew up feeling compelled to repress. I can’t transition medically right now. What I CAN do is lean into my transness with love and pride.

I’ve written more about this [here](https://medium.com/prismnpen/a-puff-sleeved-saffron-dress-the-stuckness-d0c6abca3cc0)

i wish i wasn’t born female but didn’t have a dick so i have no reproduction organs
same i wish i was a girl i could be so hot :(
I wish I was born a female too but I don’t think I feel like I am in the wrong body but idk tbh !! I don’t necessarily hate anything about me but I was/am really considering hrt.
you trans
That’s a really good perspective to have.  Thanks for giving me that.  I feel a little better about where I’m at now.
hearing what my spouse went through growing up afab made me think “maybe if i’d been born female i wouldn’t have been able to handle that shit as a kid (because i wholeheartedly believe *every* girl/woman on this rock has at least one experience like my spouse’s many experiences), and i cracked now because i’m ready.”
Genitals are nice, but I'd give them up if I could give birth.
Okay literally same except I really really like people thinking im a dude
Awww same, appreciate seeing this perspective mixed in here. I often get the “angst from not having enough dysphoria, dysphoria”
I like my genitals, but lately they’ve just been a nuisance and I’m seriously considering taking the plunge now
may i ask, what is the choice you speak of?
>>I’m not sure if you’re questioning, but cis people don’t tend to emphasize their disappointment of being their birth gender.

But what if I do emphasize how much a lot disappointment I have on being a male?

>>but what finally ended the questioning was realizing **how much happier being a woman would make me**.

I would like to know that answer myself too.
okay, i still just feel like being a female would be more “right”
For sure. It's an oversimplification we need to make so people can kind of understand what being trans is like.
Same 🥺
Ur unwanted dysphoria mounds for my shame stick. even trade

That’s a big one for me, I don’t care that much about my genitals, but not being able to give birth makes me really sad
This!
It’s all about being in a wonderful dress and owning it, isn’t it. I feel you.
You have betrayed me for the last time! Foolish genitalia! I wish. My therapist still doesn't want to let us transition.
i assume they're talking about transitioning
The choice (well not so much a choice as it became a need) to transition :)
I would say those are pretty guaranteed indications of being trans. Welcome! Lol
Well I think what they meant was GAAB since gender and sex are almost always assigned together in our society when a child is born. Being trans could be wanting to socially transition, physically transition, or both to whatever extent you'd feel best at. Hugs!
Yup. That’s being trans :) welcome
Yeah that is usually how it is

Its how I feel
I shall gift you my flesh mounds for 2 whole pennies
If that where possible, within a heartbeat

This isn’t spoken about enough.
I had a massive cry last night about this… at NYE… in front of everyone… 😑
Haha, thx 😆
Well, let’s not jump to conclusions, but yes
That's the same thing as ""Born in the wrong body""...
Its not jumping to conclusions to establish that OP is trans. Trans identity is defined more through how you feel than how you act. There is a reason why genders like nonbinary, genderfluid, bi-gender -and so on- fall under the definition of being trans. People need to stop acting as if its controversial to tell a person that comes out and says ""I would do anything to change my gender"" that they are trans.

If you have emotions like that, they dont just go away magically. Whether you go through a transition or not is not the defining factor. I would argue that the main definition of a trans person is less about identifying as another gender, and more about feeling ""wrong"" or different to your assigned gender.

Being trans is being an individual, being cis simply means you feel comfortable with the gender you've been assigned, thats my two cents.
It’s pure semantics. But the reality of semantics is that they reflect our lived experiences. It’s less that I knew the gender binary was bullshit, I was just too stressed to stop and smell the estradiol.

Do I feel like I was “born in the wrong body?” Well, that’s a deeper philosophical question. I don’t know. I’ve never been born into another one, and I transitioned too late to get femme hips.

So, complicated. Best skip it.
Agree wholeheartedly 💕
What is the difference between ""born in the wrong body"" and ""feel like being a female""? Your assertion is that the first one is not the case but the second one is. That's why I'm confused.
I need advice don't really know who to talk to but I'll post it here and see what happens. I am 27 I'll be 28 this year and ive lived my whole life as a CIS Male. I played football had gfs and all but when I hit 18 my urge for fuck a guy was too much for me and I ended up cheating on my gf in my 20s. She found out and was destroyed but decided to stay for w.e reason but  me being gay put too much of a strain on the relationship either that or she was using me. I say that because she would use that as an excuse as to why she didnt wanna be with me anymore but stayed years after finding out. When our relationship ended ended I tried to date another female but ended up cheating on her because I needed some money (don't judge we all have done things we aren't proud of). That relationship ended and I'm with a trans girl now who hasn't started transitioning yet. My position is mainly bottom blame that on my first 🥴🥲🤪🤣 but I sometimes wanna put on panties. The confusion with me is it doesn't stop there I'm really interested to see what I look like and how I feel fully fem minus the sex I know I love dick. My problem is I don't know how to necessarily bring it up because she is trans and has stated multiple times she isn't T4T. But I don't know if i am that idea itself makes me sad asf because I'm 27 and I feel like I don't know who I am sometimes. As a kid my dad wasn't with any of the gay stuff and one time I got caught doing something and he beat me for hours so all gay thoughts were super suppressed until I hit adulthood. The question is do a say something how do I say it and do you think that would classify me as trans? Really need some guidance lmk thank you in advance.
Because saying stuff like ""born in the wrong body"" suggests that you shouldn't just feel wrong, but rather that you are wrong. I wouldn't want my girlfriend to be any other way than she is, so what she's trans? When you say stuff like ""born in the wrong body"" you're letting the issues accrued by society affect trans people, their self-perception as well as societies perception of trans people negatively. We feel wrong, we wished things were different, but feeling wrong and being wrong are two different things.
Hopefully some day in the future every trans person will know what it feels like to sit back and think to yourself ""Damn, I'm so happy about my journey and I wouldn't trade this body for any other one whatsoever"".
Your body is always right, and the only reason why you didn't get to halt hormones, intervene when you needed to, or feel inadequate for any other physical reason, know that people and their ideologies stood between you and that. Perhaps if we were born a hundred years ago and the science didn't exist, then I could agree that the statement would ring true in many cases. But today, you should be able to prosper and feel at home in your body and it's a damn shame the world hasn't caught on yet.
What I am saying is that if you really parse out what it means to feel like one was born in the wrong body you come to a lot of messy lexical ambiguities and frankly weird metaphysical questions like what is self and what is the true form of self

Lana Wachowski already made that movie 

It’s best not to say that because a lot of people say it’s a reductive take on the trans experience and it’s so narrow and old fashioned it ignores modern trans realities of people transitioning at the proper ages and having bodies that are more correct for them. 

In short, our idea of gender changed so much this question doesn’t make sense to a lot of people
That's garbage. It relies on the idea that you chose to be ""born in the wrong body"". If you didn't then that doesn't make you ""wrong"". If any trans people are taking it as ""oh no my body is wrong"" then that is the most shallow interpretation possible and they really need to think harder about things.

Anyway, I didn't ask why you shouldn't say it. I asked what the difference is. Literally. You're attacking a straw man.
This is literally nonsense. You literally don't need to do any of this, but if you feel like going on an existential rabbit hole then it only has to come as far as ""I think that self is not the same as body"" and it makes sense again. If you want to go further, go ahead, but none of this is necessary as much as just you sharing where it takes you.

> It’s best not to say that

It's best not to tell people how to discuss their own experiences.

> our idea of gender changed so much this question doesn’t make sense

The question makes complete sense. You just have to derail instead of answering it.
""I didn't ask why you shouldn't say it, I asked what the difference is""

Are you under the impression that shallow statements dont cause harm? A big reason why trans people get attacked is because we employ this cheap shallow language that the cis population repeats ad hominem. You can be mad all you want, doesn't change the fact that people out there ARE shallow, and you asked what the difference is between the two?
One way of phrasing it is actively hurting the perception of trans people and the other one isn't. Is that not difference enough for you? Not all people go through life thinking or buried in introspection, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Attacking a strawman? Where is this aggression coming from? Nobody is attacking anything.
For you the phrase might be fine. I won’t deny you that. But what I will say as a generalization of the trans experience it sucks and it’s outdated.  

The point of the derail is to just flatly state what’s true. The problem just that the term is old and ingrained in our culture. Just explaining it will stop people from asking the same questions and we can get on to more interesting things like If someone needs support or not
See, you're avoiding the question again. This time by going into assumptions about my thinking & using them to try to make me seem like I'm trying to be aggressive or whatever. Also assuming that I didn't get your point the first time. I get it, but it's a distraction from a simple question.

> Attacking a strawman? Where is this aggression coming from? Nobody is attacking anything.

It's a common phrase, it doesn't actually imply aggression. It's just what people call it when other people do what I just explained. :)

If you don't want to answer the question, then you could just not answer it.
I don't use it, but my belief is similar. I believe that gender is part of your soul, sex is party of their body, and people should stop conflating them. It's basically the same as ""born in the wrong body"", though.

Anyway, we are on a tangent. You agree that you have derailed. I already have heard everything you've said time and time again. Now, I ask again...

> What is the difference between ""born in the wrong body"" and ""feel like being a female""?

If they were born female then they wouldn't ""feel like being a female"". They're the same thing. I agree that ""wrong"" is not the best word choice, but something like ""feel like I was born in a body that doesn't match my gender"" is the same intention of someone saying ""born in the wrong body"".

It's not like they're trying to point the finger at their body and go ""you're wrong!"" after all. The interpretation of ""wrong"" that you're mapping the meaning to only works when intent is involved. There was no intent to choose a specific body, so it is nonsense.
Your question was ""what is the difference between them"" and I told you ""One is harmful to the perception of trans people and the other one isn't"" I don't see how that is avoiding the question.

Also, your overall demeanour is challenging and aggressive, not just the strawman part.
Ah I see now why you keep repeating yourself, you're having a conversation with multiple people at once and can't tell the difference lmao.

But yeah, you keep saying shit like ""thats garbage"" and ""thats nonsense"" when people are just having level-headed conversations and formulating their opinions.

So to try and end this dumb interrogation once and for all.

The term ""born in the wrong body"" is problematic for one main reason, just like tai has been saying. It is an outdated term. By that I mean, yes, it used to be relevant but only because it caters to transphobic views just enough to grant your point of view some legitimacy in the eyes of those people. Mainly because it functions under the impression that the binary genders are the only two expressions. ""Born in the wrong body"" suggests that what boils down a person's individuality is when one is confined to either of two types of biological sexes and is used because gender critical cis folk are only willing to accept things as far as they can hope to frame it according to a cisnormative narrative. ""born in the wrong body"" therefore acts as a lazy or roundabout way to gain acceptance among people without actually correcting their view on gender expression or trans identity, its a shortcut to sympathy that gives people a way of associating trans people to being mentally ill cis people, and ascertains that cisnormative worldview instead of challenging it which we should be doing as a community.

Historically we have had to surrender ourselves at the mercy of transphobic ""science"" and gain acceptance through twisting the truth, because the average person does not comprehend the genus science or intricacies of genetic biology that exists at the core of trans acceptance today. Same way gays had to take the route of the ""gay gene"" back in the day. Cis people are only willing to throw you a bone as long as you cater to a narrow cisnormative worldview. Bottom line is, we don't need to do that anymore, and in fact, it is harmful to the understanding and further learning of not just cis people but trans people as well to keep using language like that. We know better than to boil down others or ourselves to a cisnormative take on what defines a man or a woman, and the term is simply toxic on more levels than one and should be discouraged from use.

I know there's two of you.

> But yeah, you keep saying shit like ""thats garbage"" and ""thats nonsense"" when people are just having level-headed conversations and formulating their opinions.

I just don't like people trying to distract from answering a simple question. I know there's two of you but both of you are doing it.

> The term ""born in the wrong body"" is problematic for one main reason

I didn't ask why it is problematic. I already understand that it is. I asked specifically what was the difference between the two phrases that I quoted. That's it.

All this extra fluff y'all keep adding to avoid answering a simple question is the garbage.

my brother refuses to use my preferred pronouns (he/him) and his reasoning is that im not a biological male. i tried to explain how that can come off as transphobic but he doesnt care. how can i explain it in a way thatll make him actually think about it? preferably in norwegian please		"“This isn’t about you, what you think, or what you believe. Either accept this and respect my wishes or don’t speak to me.”

Leave no room for a debate.
Ignoring is the best (nonviolent) route. Just don't respond if he deadnames or misgenders you. (I say nonviolent because I'd put my brother in a headlock lol)
""come off as transphobic"" it just *is* transphobic lol
there’s a lot of misgender him back but i don’t rlly think that’s the best way to go about it, you’d be fighting fire with fire and it typically gets u nowhere or even makes it worse. also it doesn’t “come off” as transphobic it literally is transphobic. id try explaining it clearly and maybe in a way he can relate to
He's your brother not some forensic scientist trying to get a crude profile based on nothing but chromosomes. 

Sex is more complex than a lot of people  think and biological sex is kind of a spectrum https://www.pinkmantaray.com/resources/sexed, but it’s also not really relavant to wether you should respect what someone wants to be called.
Airhorn you brother everytime he not uses you preferred pronouns and name
Du kan si at det spiller ikke noe rolle om han er enig med deg eller ikke. Hvis han respekterer deg som familie så burde han også respektere at det sårer deg når han ikke refererer til deg slik du ønsker. Spill litt på empati. Få han til å føle at det han gjør er skadelig for deg.

Et tanke-eksperiment jeg liker å bruke for å forklare ting er dette:

Se for deg at vi er langt inn i fremtiden hvor vi kan flytte hjernen fra en kropp til en annen. Mens du sov tok noen å byttet kroppen din med en av motsatt kjønn. Ville du da plutselig blitt det kjønnet? Ville du levd livet videre slik? Eller ville du følt det var feil og helst ha tilbake kroppen din? For oss transpersoner kan det føles som om hjernen og kroppen ikke er i samsvar og det er ubehagelig og noe mange av oss gjerne vil korrigere, enten det er sosialt eller gjennom hormoner eller kirurgi.

Kan også anbefale deg r/transnord. Der er det en del skandinaviske folk å spørre :)
If it were me, I’d just be really annoying back by playing dumb any time he uses my dead name or the wrong pronouns. Example:

Him: “Hey, [deadname], could you pass the salt?”

You: *No response*

Him: “[deadname], hello? I said pass the salt.”

You: “Huh? Who’s [deadname]? Are you feeling ok?”

Him: “Very funny, now pass the salt.”

You: “Sure, I’ll pass the salt if you tell me who [deadname] is - she someone you know or...?”

Him: “You’re [deadname]...”

You: “...are you sure you’re not sick? You’re acting really weird. Is there a number I can call [deadname] on, do you need to talk to her? Is she like your ex or something? Ooh, is she a ghost? Are you in a ghost mystery right now?”

Him: whatever... *gets his own damn salt*

Just keep doing this as persistently as he misgenders you. If he’s going to be rude, you can at least make it fun to be rude right back!

But seriously, sorry you have to deal with an uncooperative family member. I wish it were as easy as “please be polite to me and refer to me in the way I want to be referred to so that we can remain friends” but some people just want to be difficult.
He's disrespecting you. Only communicate with him on the condition that he uses your pronouns.
When I get misgendered or deadnamed I reply by saying ""who?"" Or ""excuse me"" then if it isn't corrected I refuse to respond again. It's really fun at work when it happens because they all fumble through it one way or the other lol
Hi OP, how are you?
As a partner of lovely mtf I had such encounters for the past few years.
Some of which are my family members. 

At first, I tried to explain to them kindly that the way they behave and talk about my wife is transphobic but to no avail. 
After a while, I realized that they won't invite us to family gatherings or holidays. I asked my mother about it and she said that it's because of my wife being trans. She added that I am very welcome but without my wife.
At this point, I lost it. I called her transphobic and I told her that if she won't accept my wife, she won't have me either. 
On that call with her, her sister called me homophobic because I hate them for hating my wife. Yeah, she has no idea how homophobia and transphobia work. 
The day after the call, I texted my aunt the meaning of the words above, and her response was ""we love you no matter what"".  We haven't spoken since then.

In your situation,  you tried explaining and it didn't work. The important thing here is: how important is this relationship with him right now?
If I was in your shoes,  I would go to a more aggressive approach. He calls your dead name? Ignore, he gets mad and asks you why won't you respond? Simply say, it's not my name, not my pronounce. Correct yourself or don't bother. 


Regardless of all of the above, you are valid. We can't control things that aren't in our hands. We sure can demand the respect we deserve or distance ourselves from those who refuse to respect us.
ask him if he cares more about you or about being pedantic, and take his answer, whatever it is, to heart.
Just say ""do me a solid and call me he or else I'll take it as a personal insult and refuse to interact with you. I'm not asking you to consider me biologically male, I'm asking you to call me what I want you to call me. I'm certain you can handle that.""
You should try misgendering him back, Cis peeps hate it too and it might get the point across. Don't stop until he does.

You could also just say something like ""this is who I am and if you can't respect it I will not allow you in my life."" ( I don't know Norwegian, sorry )
That's literally what the Nazis said about us, too. Is your brother a Nazi?
You can't. If he loved you had make the effort. Bigots, even family, almost never change. Let him go and move on, h9wever much it hurts.
This was already said here but basically ignoring. If my parents don’t use the right pronouns for me (she/her) or deadname me, they aren’t referring to me at all because they aren’t using my name or my correct pronouns. I just act like I notice nothing and as if they’re talking to someone else. This is probably a good idea with your brother.

I personally have a hard time explaining stuff in the emotional state that being misgendered puts me in and generally I don’t make things better when convincing, but I recognize that a lot of people are different than me in this regard. Judging by your post and something you said in another comment he doesn’t seem to care about being transphobic at all. A couple ways to approach this could be challenging his ideas of sex and gender. You could explain the dichotomy between the two, you could talk to him about the complexities within biological sex. And you of course don’t have to do either of these at all. 

What you should do kinda depends on where you’re at and if you’re willing to give up the energy to argue with transphobes. I hope whatever you choose to do goes well.
It doesn't come off as transphobic it is transphobic.
as others said, ignore him until he gets it right.

and maybe misgender him if you're feeling cheeky.
Call him a Swede or the nuclear option: Danish
I’m so sorry you have to go through this. That is transphobic. I’m your new brother, bro. 

My advice would be to appeal emotionally, talk about how it makes you feel when he misgenders or deadnames you. And out of respect for you and your feelings he should change if he cares about hurting you. 

How old is he? Is he older or younger?
If he can't respect your identity as a family member don't expect to have him in your life and make that clear that you won't just allow verbal abuse and if he really loved and cared for you his actions would show that.
Refer to him as a Swede and claim he is not ""biologically"" Norwegian.
According to the Golden Rule, your brother is asking that you refer to him as she/her/sister. Be sure to introduce her that way until she gets it right.
Misgender him until he says something to you about it. He might get it then. Be aggressive and don’t let people push you around.
Maybe an airhorn next to his ear?

Otherwise I'd just stop responding to his misgendering. If he misgenders you in front of someone else, say quietly to them ""I'm sorry, there's something wrong with him. He still doesn't get that I'm not a girl""
It doesn't ""come off"" transphobic, it is transphobic. Your brother is, at the very least, acting transphobic.

I don't know how to explain things to people who have already made up their minds on things like this. I would just try to ignore him until he realizes he fucked up yalls relationship or you can leave. I'm sorry, and I hope someone here can give you advice to actually help the situation.
I'm reading a book called ""Trans Like Me"" or maybe it's called ""Trans conversations for everyone like me"" that perfectly covers why ""biological male"" isn't really a relevant term for barring someone from gender affirming care. The base rundown is that the word ""biological"" is too big of an umbrella term. It just means something to do with biology. Like you wouldn't say an XXX (chromosomes) woman isn't a woman just because she doesn't have perfect XX chromosomes. Or an XXY man. So on and so forth, and for other things too. I would recommend reading the book, or giving it to him, it's given me a lot of words to explain my existence and thoughts.

ETA: if you want me to send you some clips from the pages addressing this just DM me and I can send over some photos
Jeg bare snakker Norsk lit men jeg lærer! Jeg vil si det på Engelsk.

I would suggest just only responding when he’s doing it right. Say if he misgenders you, be like “Hvem er henne? Is she a friend of yours?” Or if he calls you by your deadname, just don’t react until he uses your real name.

Du er en mann og han er transfobisk (jeg vet ikke om det er slik du sier det)
Det er ikke bare at det kan opfattes som transfobisk, det er transfobisk. Det dærre ""biologisk mann"" tullet handler bare om at han er transfobisk.
That doesn't ""come off"" as transphobic, it *is* transphobic
I used to be like your brother spouting bs about biology. A trans girl I met one day calmly explained everything to me, and I actually changed my mind.

Determining gender in biology isn't as straight-forward as people think, like looking at chromosomes or genitalia. It's an amalgam of characteristics, both mental and physical. Someone's genitalia might not match their chromosomes, someone's mind might not match their genitalia.

The most important way to determine gender is the mental aspect, because the human body is inconsistent and unreliable, the mind is too, but its rational, and can express its feelings clearly. Listening to a brain is better than listening to some mechanical processes that can't even talk
Insist that since all fetuses start out as female, he's actually a girl. Call him sis and shoot down all his arguments.
Norse mythology, the thing Norway is most famous for, has Loki, a Genderfluid god. If your brother isn’t accepting of you, he isn’t accepting of his own history. 
Source: I’m half-Norwegian, and hyperfixated on Norse mythology for a while.
One thing that worked with me is use the wrong pronouns for them and see how they react. Use it as a teaching lesson
start calling him by the wrong pronouns
Start misgendering him back 😈
My brother had trouble thinking of me differently.  Especially my name change.

I just explained to him that my brain was one thing and my body was another.

But it still took him a long time to start calling me Sunny.
He's getting better and better.  His issue was just force of habit tho.  He's known me as one name for 28 years.

I don't know if this helps.  But even just telling your brother that he hurt your feelings and that your name and pronouns are very important to you, may help him get it.
If it was me I’d start a simple war, simple xx
He knows it's transphobic, he's a transphobe, and you can't explain that away.


Don't acknowledge him unless he refers to you correctly.
Honestly hes probably a lost cause. Cut him off. Dont need him
Respect gets respect, call him a nickname he hates until he changes
His reasoning realky gets my alarm bells ringing. I usually only know this from religious fundamentalists, TERFs, fascists and other alt-right people. Do you know of any interests your brother has, that could fit that? If he's not super deep into that shit, there's maybe hope he'll change.

On the other hand, that's only an observation on one thing he thinks, so maybe i'm wrong there. But it is transphobic for sure.

If that's his thing, i could recommend some YouTube channels, that go into these themes and are fun to watch (it's actually made like a show, not like a boring lecture)
I think Contra Points and Philosoohy Tube could be good in this situation.

If he's just unwilling to educate himself, i think your only good option is to find ways to ignore him and deal with the situation (not accept it, but find ways to get hurt less), when you can't.

I know that sucks, but trying to fight unwinable fights can burn you out quickly.
get a air horn or something that makes a lot of noise then use it every time he deadnames you or misgenders you
As someone with an older brother who completely disrespects me and calls me his sister, ignore ignore ignore.
In my opinion from my experiences with being trans there isn’t really anything you can say that will make them change their mind or begin to, all you can do is hope the more you become yourself and show it to others that they will question their opinions on their own.
There is no reasoning here, he is being obtuse, he is just doing this on purpose because he doesn't want to believe or accept what you are doing. In other words he is an insensitive jerk. 

You will just have to ignore him.
You can find a nice document about trans and what the family should do on the webside for FRI called ""Mannen, Kvinnen og Meg"" You can also just google that and find it in Friosloviken. It's a good read and explains very well what trans is and how it works in Norway. Print it or send it to him. Tell him it's very important to you that he understands it. If he's not willing to educate himself for his brother's well being, then he's not worth keeping around.
Around how old are you, like do you live with him and is it possible to tell him you will cut ties?
If he doesn't care that he's being transphobic then there's not really anything you can say that could change his mind. But what you could do is just how him that that personally hurts you and how he's being extremely rude to family
To anyone downvoting this, kindly catch my fists
I would talk about how gender is more complicated than anatomy. For an example: what matters when it comes to money isn't the physical paper, but instead the value that we as a society attach to it. When it comes to gender, what matters is not the physical anatomy, but what society says that person's role should be. There isn't anything innate about our biology or anatomy that dictates what pronouns to use or what clothes to wear, for that you have to look at where you fit inside your culture's understanding of gender.
Ask him to read the Gender Dysphoria Bible, I'm using that to make everyone understand me
I've heard of this strategy, get an air horn and everytime he misgenders u, use the airhorn😌👌
You cant force someone to think about something or to view things from a different perspective. I'm sorry that you had that interaction with your brother, it hurts when those closest to us don't understand. Ignorance can be fixed with empathy and teaching. But not willful ignorance. If they don't want to learn then they wont. Assert your identity, do not waiver and know that in time and experience you'll be able to see which situations can be mended through education and which ones cant. I've been in transition for almost 8 years, I've had all of the conversations with family and friends and coworkers and strangers and neighbors and and and..... including the science and the feelings and the emotion. Stay strong in your understanding of who you are and understand that their willful misunderstanding is in no way a reflection of you.   
\-Sidenote, as a transperson you don't need to be the teacher. you can live your life. its not your responsibility to teach the masses and sublimate your anger or frustration because no one around you cant google the information they ask. Sometimes a ""Fuck it, your on your own"" is just as effective as explaining chromosomes, phenotypes and androgen insensitivity to a brick wall.
When people consistently refuse to use my preferred name and pronouns, I have actually started to just do the same thing. When they say something about it I simply say, ""Oh. I thought we were doing that thing you like to do where you use opposite pronoun... You know, for funsies. "" Passive aggressive, I know. I'm a pangender beyotch and I'm tired of taking shit. Sue me. ;) Much love. Hang in there.
Start calling him a girl. Go out of your way to refer to them as Sister, She/Her do it in front of friends and family, be sure to do it as belittling as possible. Maybe he'll get a clue.
Oh i did both. Whenever she misgendered me id use he/him when referring to her and whenever she desdnamed me id misname her
would he call a woman with swyer syndrome (xy cis female) by he/him? would he call a man with de la chapelle syndrome (xx cis male) she/her? if his problem is those pesky chromosomes then maybe he needs to read up and realize the world and human biology is more complicated than he thinks.

also, sorry i don't speak norwegian lol
I would just use the wrong pronouns with him and misgender him whenever possible. Once he develops empathy’s for how you feel the behavior will stop.
airhorn him every time he deadnames you or misgenders you, or ignore him completely if he does so as well. either way, he'll hopefully learn.
Hit him with a brick
Du kunne kanskje snakke med han om hvordan ""biologisk kjønn"" er egentlig en samling av mange ting - kromosomer, hormoner, osv. Hva ville han tenke om han fant ut at han hadde xx eller xxy kromosomer? Her er en god tråd om biologisk kjønn som du kunne kanskje få nytt av: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/vnzzm4 

Du kan også si at om han forstår eller ei har ingenting å si. Du er en person og du krever respekt. 

Jeg håper han endrer sine meninger om deg. Andre folk har anbefalte å ignorere han, og det er kanskje den beste måte å takle denne situasjonen. Lykke til
He knows. Your brother knows it's transphobic and disrespectful. He just doesn't think it's that big of a deal.
Make him start seeing you as the guy you are and not his ""sister"". You may already be doing these kind of things, but start getting him to see you as his brother with actions and stay close with him. We got to hope he will grow and see you as who you are. Not who he thinks you are. I've read the comments and since you two are young then there is room for the guy to grow. Be his role model for the Pride folks. Hell, I know back when I was a minor. I didn't understand anything about transgender people. Eventually when I got out of the house. I was able to get away from those ""traditional"" viewpoints. Could be a while for him to catch on, but I have faith that if you be patient with him. He will break away from that. Anyways, I wouldn't suggest misgendering, actual violence, angry remarks, or breaking away from him. Patience and understanding. I bet the guy will be happy he has a brother eventually.
Explain that when his binary gender-conditioned brain subconsciously decides if it’s  looking at a man or woman, it doesn’t look at the person’s crotch or they naturally ask them to take their pants down so they can see what their genitals are, they actually instead look at the secondary sex characteristics of the person holistically along with even just their gender presentation through clothing, hairstyle, hand gestures, walking, vocabulary and any usage of makeup
The best way I have found for this kind of thing is first don’t respond to your deadname/incorrect pronouns second talk to them about it. And when you do so what does being biologically one gender or the other really mean? Does it mean you have the secondary sex characteristics of that specific gender, does it mean having the genitalia of the gender in question? If it’s the first thing  then guess what on hrt you get the secondary sex characteristics of the gender you are going through therapy for, making you biologically male if it’s the second that’s for one thing stupid but if he insists surgeries exist for that kind of thing. I guess the point is cal him out and destroy his dumb and transphobic arguments even if bottom surgery doesn’t interest you personally it still kills that argument. If he is worth your time he’ll learn to respect your identity, if he can’t then he’s not worth your time or energy
Explain suicide rates for trans people who aren't accepted as themselves, it worked on my parents maybe it'll work on him, sometimes you have to be blunt about it
It isn't coming off as transphobic... It literally is transphobic. The only thing that makes someone a male or female is hormones. This biological argument comes from uneducated fuckheads that don't understand how basic biology works
You don't need to explain anything to anyone , he is in his own right to be ignorant and not acknowledge your biological sex on a cerebral level beacuse he has free biological autonomy to do it , so the best thing you can do is just not talking to him until he sees you as the person you are , not the false personality he affiliates psychologically to the body that is being the container of your true self.
sadly usually you just can’t explain away transphobia.. the best thing you can do, in my opinion, is give it time and work on self acceptance of the situaiton.
A slap in the face is understood in every language.
I don't think it should really be about transphobia. 

I mean, it is don't get me wrong. But it's more just ignorance. I saw his age in one of your comments, he's young. 

I think a great way to curb this is to have an honest Convo with him. It really should have to do with the respect he has for his brother, if he doesn't have any than ok. There is your answer. 

I think the best way to do this with minimal conflict is to not respond at all of he calls you something you don't appreciate. Tell him it's difficult for you to listen to him when he's speaking to you disrespectfully, and that you treat him with respect so you expect the same. 

Sending good vibes man. I couldn't imagine how much it would hurt for my brother to refuse to call me by my name or he/him. It'll get better.
Male does not equal man. Show him the dictionary definitions of sex and gender. They're very different - one is about your physical body, and the other is not. He's getting them mixed up and combining them. Also, ask him what he has to lose by using your preferred pronouns. Ask him if he values minor convenience over your well-being and happiness. Hopefully that can help to put things into perspective?
Ask him if there was a machine that magically turned you male in every way (chromosomes, dick, sperm, etc) would he immediately respect it? If not, it's just a stubbornness thing. Tell him he doesn't care about biology, just feelings. If he says yeah, start taking some male features away. What if you turned male but your chromosomes were different (there are cis people with ""opposite chromosomes btw. It's why the Olympics doesn't do chromosome tests anymore). What if you were male but had no balls, no Adam's apple, etc. Small things are picked off. It's probably not about biology lol
do it back to him
Tell him everyone is a female in the womb until hormones dictates what way we go.
Du kan spørre han om han noensine har blitt terget på skolen eller lignende med å bli kalt en jente (jeg vil gjette at det har skjed med han eller noen han skjenner fra barneskolen) , og så spørre hvorfor det var så irriterende/ frustrerende å bli referert til som en jente.
Så kan du forklare det til han at det er sånn du føler det hver gang noen sier Henne istedenfor Han, for uansett hva du var født som, så er Henne ikke deg

Jeg vet ikke om dette hjelper men lykke til

Love you and wishes you that your brother grows up
Either ignoring or trying to explain that it doesn’t matter what he thinks bc you know who you are and that he can either respect that or remain ignorant, you can also give him examples by asking how he would feel if you misgendered him by calling him she/her (note that this is petty and could cause problems) I’m Swedish so best I can do is ”antingen respekterar du mig eller så kan du fortsätta att vara ignorant och inte längre vara i mitt liv, hur skulle du känna dig om jag kallade dig tjej och insisterade med alla att använda hon/hen pronomen även om du säger nej om och om igen?”
It doesn't just come off as transphobic, it IS transphobic.

I'd ask something like, ""Should a child whos been adopted call their parents mom and dad even though they aren't their biological child?"" or ""If someone gets married and changes their last name should you refer to them by their maiden name?"" or ""No one is born with clothes so should we call clothed people naked?"" All of those things can change at some point in a person's life, so we change our words to conform to that change. Just as we don't call flowers seeds or pickles cucumbers.

**You** changed, so the words describing **you** must change.
Just start using she/her for him, if he tells you to stop then tell him you’ll stop when he uses he/him on you. If he asks why you’re using she/her on him then just shrug your shoulders or flip him off or say “I’ll stop when you use he/him for me” you don’t have to do this, but it usually works
Explain to him that gender is entirely a social construct, so it matters not if you were assigned your gender by the government, or if you self identify. Also, unless he’s done hormone, chromosome, and ultrasound tests, he can’t be sure he’s biologically male either. The categories of male and female are made up of multiple physical characteristics, which is why intersex people exist. Does your brother believe that intersex people don’t get to have pronouns because they are neither male nor female? Seems convoluted and stupid. 
Alternatively, you could start using she/her pronouns for him, and when he gets uncomfortable and asks you to use his preferred pronouns, tell him you will when he does the same for you.
Well I don't really like suggesting this but fighting fire with fire might work. You don't want to be transphobic and misgender him. I'm not usually a fan of bandying this around but it's a sore point and might just make him see how he is being inconsiderate and unreasonable. Say because he's acting like a Karen, and so as long as he misgenders you, you'll be calling him by the inconsiderate tw@t type he is identifying with. Can't imagine he would enjoy being referred to as a Karen. So don't answer when he misgenders you, basically ignore him until to addresses you correctly. And if he tries to be sly and slip in mean misgendering comments say ""OK Karen"".

P.S This approach is a bit sexist - Karen when misused paints women in a bad light, the use of Karen should be very specific. But when you're dealing with someone who won't acknowledge nuance, this might get it through to him that he's being inconsiderate in a stereotypical Karen way.
I'm a pain to deal with so I would remember this moment and the moment he wants to be something I would remind him that he isn't. 
I'd take every chance to remind him of the sad reality that he lives in.
Lots of people have told me not to hold grudges, but I never listened.
Pronouns,  gender and sex are all separate things.

Any one can an should use whatever pronouns they want.
“You wouldn’t like if I treated you like you were a woman, now would you? It’s supposed to be the obvious, you telling me you can’t do the obvious? And what is so hard about using he/him anyway, will your tongue fall off if you say it?”
like other people have said, either tell him that he *has* to use your preferred pronouns, or you break bonds. if he keeps acting like that, he doesn't deserve you. you shouldn't be surrounded with people like this.

also, hello from your country neighbor, sweden :)
Tell him in Norwegian FUUUUUUUUCK YOU. This thing where he won't accept your pronouns because of ""biology"" is Ben Shapiro's argument, and it's garbage. 

My friend, YOU get to choose what you like and who you are and what makes you happy, not anyone else.
If you don’t need him, don’t talk to him.
😡😡😡

This “biOLoGiCaL” garbage is nonsense. 

See isn’t one thing, it’s a minimum of like 6 things, and none of them are binaries, all continuums, and they don’t all necessarily line up.

At a minimum your brain isn’t “biologically female”, and our brains are the most important part of US???
""biological"" males imply the existence of nuclear, atomic, guerrilla and other types of males
You just have to convince him you’re no different than a “biological male” no sweat, the transphobia falls apart once you start to explore the questions 😃
There might be some folks on /r/transnord who can help in Norwegian! Good luck bro ❤️

Edit: you are a biological male cause you're a dude who has a body. lol. I know people mean ""anatomical,"" but that phrase is such a pet peeve. sorry you're dealing with this.
just like one of my sisters, but i use she/her, i feel you :'(
Use she/her on him every time he does?
If transphobic doesn't go, maybe being uncomfortabe does?
Call him by she/her pronouns
Just totally ignore him. Cut him off totally until he addresses you properly. Once he finally addresses you properly, misgender him for a while so he gets it.
broren din er veldig kjekk
Stab him
Fuck him in the ass to assert dominance and show him who's the true alpha male.
[removed]
Start using she/her pronouns for him and see how he likes it.
Do it back. When he tells you to stop tell him no because he is a biological asshat.
Bigots gonna bigot.
How do you say, ""Fuck you. Either respect my pronouns or I go shopping for a new brother"" in Norweigan?
Challenge it. What does it mean to be ""a biological male""? Is it having a penis and testicles, and hair all over your body? Cuz if so, you can point out that everyone has hair all over, if a woman stops shaving, she'll have hair on her crotch, on her legs, and face. That's just normal. And not every man has a penis. If someone had testicular cancer, and had to get his balls removed, is he less of a man because he doesnt have testicles? Subsequently, if someone had a birth defect where they had more than 2 testicles, are they more ""man"" than everyone else? What if they were born intersex, and their gentiles just didnt develop properly, and they dont really have a penis? And they're still born a male. Are they less of a man because of a complication in the womb? Is the issue breasts? Because everyone has breasts, and afab people can get breast reductions if they really wanna. Just because you have a flat crotch doesnt necessarily mean you're less than of a man.

Sorry I dont know Norwegian lol but I hope you're able to translate that to him
I'm sorry I don't speak Norwegian and I'm not sure how this concept translates because I know gendered language can vary depending on the language. I'm not sure if anyone has suggested this yet but 'biology' aside (I quote biology because actually biological sex is so much more complex than just vagina or penis) have you tried introducing to him the concept of Gender and how this is separate from biological sex. 

Gender by the Oxford definition is 'considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones'. If he wants to go the factual route then his reasoning is not logically sound because you are identifying with he/him based on feeling more aligned with (I'm assuming here) the male gender socially. Gender and sex are two different things. Again not sure how well this translates to the Norwegian language but hopefully that gives you some sort of way to explain it to him that might make him rethink!
Som tidligere ""bror"", *nå søster*, så kan jeg gi ett par råd. Brødre generelt har en... tendens til å prøve å unngå å vise at de bryr seg #toxicmasculinity 🙄, så dette ender ofte opp med å bli terging/småplaging. Litt ironisk siden brødre, spesielt storebrødre like ofte har stort beskyttelsesinnstikt 🤷‍♀️

Kan også si fra erfaring med mine venner og meg selv at direkte kommunikasjon er alltid best om det er viktig, så gjør det enkelt!

Eks: ""Hei har du to sek? Helt alvorlig, det er ikke greit du bruker kvinnelige pronomen for meg, gi deg ok? Kall meg mann, dude, bro, whatever.""

Cluet er litt å ha klar tone, men ikke nødvendigvis alvorlig eller sur. Det er en beskjed, ikke en forklaring liksom? En **stor del** av mannlig kommunikasjon består ofte av slike beskjeder. Det... funket aldri for meg siden jeg holder basically ikke kjeft 😅

Ut ifra hvordan tidligere samtaler med han har vært så kan du legge til at det er dårlig gjort, eve. kall han noe uskyldig som ""tulling"", ""idiot"".
Choose your own name for him based on your opinion, just like theirs is. I call my mom ""asshole mom"" now because it's my choice what to call them and it doesn't matter what they think about it. Just as they treated me.
Hey, so sorry that your going through this. You could also argue that you are ‘biologically male’. Humans have a very unique way in which we develop sexual compared to other animals. How we develop sexually entirely depends on a series of chain reactions caused by hormones. It’s incredibly simple and common place for these hormonal chain reactions to vary causing people to have a different gender than the sex they appear to have to the outside world. It’s also why some people can be born presenting female and then at puberty slowly grow a penis. I’m not saying that this is what should and should not define gender, just that when people saying it’s biologically not possible to have a different gender than your sex is entirely untrue.
There aren't many great ways to deal with something like this.  In my house where they had some trouble I kept saying a response ""No I'm a silly lady"" and basically stuck my tongue out or made a stupid face at them every time.

And I pointed out that in public people only referred to me as she/her... so when you're the only one calling me a dude... you're the one who looks like the idiot.

Those two things pulled my step son over who was having quiet a bit of trouble.  He stumbles some but he desires to refer to me the right way now.
Gi han ressursa på transtematikk!! Det e ofte mer enkelt å oversiktlig enn å måtta forklare alt sjøl, anbefale å finn videoa på youtube han kan sjå om det det finns mange gode transyoutubera både ftm å mtf<3 Jammidodger å Noahfinnce e lavterskel transyoutubera å ikkje så teoriheavy som f.eks Philosophy Tube eller Contrapoints. Å så har PKI å FRI masse bra på nettsidan sine ofc!!
Personally I'd misgender him back, reasoning being that he clearly has no balls (as in he's not a ""biological"" male, and that he's a fucking bitch). But I'm petty. I'd ask what does biology have to do with human cultural roles, and when the response is ""gender is based off of sex/,is sex"", ask that they consider that the scientific concept of sex was named by the culture with two genders, attempting to create a binary. In actuality there are 5 observable sexes, which are forcibly assigned into either male or female as infants via permanent genitalia modification. He sounds like the pseudo-intellectual, so I say hit them where it hurts, insult their intelligence by showing them the actual facts. If someone values or tries to act like they value intelligence, that's the easiest tool against them.
In my case, I’d probably punch him in the face. In someone else’s case I’d recommend just continuing to stand your ground and insist or end up ignoring him until he gets it right. Try asking him exactly *what* the issue is with calling you by your pronouns. Why does it bother him so much? Why does he care? Wouldn’t he want you to be happy?
Act like most of the brothers I know and just punch him hard every time he does it.
I would just be rude to him back and frequently chose not to recognize him.  If he doesn't want a good realtionship with his brother, then let him have a nad one.
Your sister sounds like an asshole
Every time, and I mean every time, he gets it wrong.  You just kick him in the nuts with steel toe boots.  Keep this up long enough and you can start using she/her for him as he won't be a biological male either.

^ If you love someone, you'll accept them as they are, not try to change them to fit your fantasy of who they should be, that goes for familial love just as well as romantic love
thank you, i will try my besttt
Sibling vibes lol.
Yeah, I've fully almost gotten into a fist fight with my brother. But he's had moments where he's defended me while still not respecting me, he beat up these two guys in his grade we went to elementary with, they were outing me to anyone they could until he got to them. It also helps that he's ""the only son"" who always wanted a little brother. If he's ever made any comments like that, about wanting a brother bring it up to him. Just remember you don't need his validation either, family is fickle, no matter how many people try to tell you it's forever that usually not the case, especially for trans people. You are the most important person in your own life, just like everyone else is in theirs. You deserve happiness and to be respected, if you can't get through to him then limit all interaction with him to when it's absolutely necessary, I didn't talk to my own brother for probably two years except for at dinner and when we happened to share the same space for a minute. You don't have to interact with people who don't respect you, it's not a law to converse with people who start conversations with you. You can always just walk away.
Based anti transphobia action
^ this is good advice
I just misgendered and misnamed my cis sis everytime she did it to me
I’d lead pipe my brother if he did that
I know a passive agressive way. Use the wrong pronouns with them, and use the same reasoning as they're using.
yes i know, but there isnt really a clear way of explaining since he said he didnt care if it was transphobic
totally completely agree with this -- misgendering a cis person as retaliation is signaling that, yes, it is okay to misgender someone to prove a point -- and that's not fair, or productive,, ultimately. generally in life i wouldn't suggest disrespecting someone in order to gain respect yourself.

bottom line OP, your brother is probably not going to support you, at least not now. if this matters to you, and you've made it clear that it matters to you,, and he won't even *try*, i mean maybe distance yourself from the relationship if it would feel better to you. idk how easy that will be when/if you're under the same roof though
The original Gandhi saying was : “An Eye for an Eye makes the whole world blind”
Yes to all of that! Biological sex isn’t one thing, it’s at least six different things, and all of the mercanu s, not binaries. And they don’t all necessarily line up. And even if none of that was true, it doesn’t change that he’s being an ass
OK I love this one.
But that won’t educate him, it’ll only make him more distasteful towards trans people. That’s not the move.
takk!! jeg skal prøve å bruke det eksperimentet når det passer!
the problem isnt really with deadnaming since a lot of people for some reason view my chosen name as androgynous even if it isnt. but thank you either way!
I agree but you could also call him a rat or something. Something he doesn't wants to be called, to be more specific, probably he will look confused or even annoyed, than say something like ""what? I thought we'd call each other things we don't like."" Do that every time he dead names you, or uses the wrong pronounce.
 
DO THE EXACT SAME as he does, this shows him how you feel being called something you don't wanna be called, hope that makes sence.
ill try!
hi! thank you. my relationship with him is pretty important but not THAT important. i value my family very highly but i will try my best!!!
😧

Sooooooo you’re homophonic for pointing out that they’re transphobic. Suuuure. That makes perfect sense. 🙄
idk, its kinda hard since we dont talk that much either way. but when it gets brought up again ill try
You can also just stop responding when he misgenders or deadnames you. If it goes on your response can be ""oh, that's not me so I didn't answer.""
thank you,,, but i cant really just stop talking to him or cut him out of my life. hes my older brother and im a minor. he probably wont move out in a few years. but i will try misgendering him back. thank you for the tip!
Misgendering them back is a terrible idea. It just validates the idea of doing so to prove a point.
no hes not, he just has very.. i guess ""traditional""(transphobic) views?
i have tried explaining how sex and gender are different but he just flat out said ""i dont care, if you were born male youre a he in my eyes"" (-translated to the best of my ability)
OMG yes ""not using my preferred pronouns is so fucking danish of you jeez, where did my norwegian brother go?""
thank you for the advice. he is 17 and older than me
I don't think misgendering back is the answer, since it'll be as fighting fire with fire.
tusen takk!!!
yesss ialso love norse mythology
im sorry but i cant just cut him off we live in the same house plus we are both minors
i know close to nothing about his interests, the only thing i really knoe that he loves is soccer. but thank you for the advice!!!
im 13, my parents are divorced so i see him for 2 weeks then 2 weeks without him. cant really cut ties
i tried to telling him that :/
its kinda hard to ignore him, im a minor and we live in the same house with our mom
thats a bit extreme dont you think
what the fuck?
:/
im sorry i just dont feel comfortable at all when he says she/her and they/them when referring to me. im sorry but if you feel like this then you should not be on this subreddit. are you only here to hate others? if you want you can message me and tell me how you in a calm manner, just so i can see where youre coming from
Ya think?
Exactly all this. I'm the older brother and my brother is super duper sweet and accepting (huge age gap, he's a cool kid) but I know if he ever decided to be a jackass I'd just sit on him. And big brother energy is real, if he ever came out as anything other than cishet I know I'd level anyone who'd mess with him.
just here to say, just because theyre related by blood doesnt mean theyre family, if they refuse to accept you are who you are, they dont deserve to be considered such
Is the situation with your brother a “no one bullies my family except me” thing?
I’ve tried doing this to my mom, who then has the gall to act like I’m being terrible. 

Yeah dude. That’s the point. YOU’RE BEING TERRIBLE 😡🤦🏻‍♀️
THIS IS THE SOLUTION!

how old is ur brother? and i’m not saying don’t stand up for urself or anything just personally i think a different way could be better.
U might find something here.

Tell him that you’re trans and what he’s saying is hateful towards you specifically. That he might not care about other trans people, but ask him if he cares about you. Maybe that will invoke some introspective thought.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world. Just so you know, the correct spelling is [Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi).
It’s pretty effective 😅
Some ppl don’t learn without pain 🤷🏻‍♀️ Sure education is important but Op tries/tried that already and apparently it’s not working
Fikk du noen fremgang med broren din? Håper han kan respektere deg for den du er etterhvert :)
Look, family is a lot, especially for us ABC Mafia members. 
Despite that, if they care, some tough love might do the trick. And also, you don't have to be obnoxious about it. Keep calm, be polite even, but don't let them get to you. It's easy to say hard to do, but this actually saved my mental health. 

Good luck my dude!!
Yeah, and at that point, I stopped trying to explain
If you don't talk much then I would just distance myself from him if i were you. You've already tried to talk to him about this and he has said he doesn't care if he is transphobic. Other than trying to talk to him again about how it makes you feel and if he loves you unconditionally as a brother he will respect your wishes there isn't much more you can do. If you already are not that close I don't really see the point
yesss,,, i will try
That's also a good one.
You mean.... Misgendering HER back ;D
Its sad that people in Norway are still like that sometimes. Luckily for us most of the country is pretty progressive!
His traditional values are shit. To hell with his worthless values. Push back. Hard. Do not put up with his bullshit.
Hopefully he grows up a bit, I wouldn’t advise misgendering him back as some comments here suggest though. That will make him upset, but I don’t think it’ll make him want to try to understand. 

If he doesn’t accept you, that’s hard, but you will find people who love and accept you for who you are. 17 is young, he has time to mature yet, he’s probably more worried about what other people will think of him if he’s accepting.
Vær så god, Frøy!
Start working out so you can fight him. If he wont respect you of his own volition, then you need to teach him. Freedom is never willfully given by oppressors
If giving him a dictionary to learn what a pronoun is doesn't help, it's gonna be difficult.
Well, it may be difficult but but not impossible. Are you seeing a counselor? If you are, bring him for a session. I’ve brought people in with me before. It’s helped them to understand what I’m going through and it helps the counselor to understand what I’m dealing with at home.
Yeah. But the point gets across🤡
Was just trying to be funny sorry
What I was trying to help don't look at me like I'm some redneck weirdo
Okk here is a better one show him who's the bigger man and stop Caring about what he says, hes just stuck in is 2016 Steven crowder phase
Hell yeah, I'm the younger, we've had our ups and downs but my parents went away for a weekend and he invited me into his room to do dabs, we talked for an hour about just everything, I told him some of the things about my gender that I haven't even told my twin sister, about how it felt to go through highschool with them getting everything from our parents and me being the trans one. It really helped, and even if we keep fighting about the little stuff I know that big picture he's always had my back. Siblings are weird, I mean I've literally had my best friend since birth just because were twins. That relationship can either be one of the most important, or mean nothing at all, it's about how you talk to each other and find common ground.
Totally out of context, but…

*Sit on me, daddy…*
I hope this happens with me and my younger brother (except I’m his older sister) he’s 2 now so hopefully he doesn’t grow up to be an asshole like our parents
Exactly! Family is who you choose, the nuclear family and separation we have now didn't always exist. The phrase ""it takes a village"" was literal, people living in communities together would watch out for everyone, as long as you did the same. Seek out your family if your biological doesn't fit, there are people out there who will love you unconditionally as yourself, you just have to find them.
Basically the whole family lol, even my parents. They will not accept any shit from anyone unless it's them. It's kinda nice but hurts a lot too.
The high ground is for people with much more patience than i. If your being rude at best ill be walking on the curb while you walk on the road
The key is to not misname them with offensive language cause then theyll get mad not self-conscious. You don't want them to be mad just understand. So you have to choose a nickname that isnt offensive but bothers them. See swarly from how i met your mother
She wasnt but after a few months she got the point. She still doesnt approve but she keeps it to herself and her friends so i dont care
hes 17, turning 18 soon
Why is there a Gandhi bot here?
Pavlo, I love it
har ikke funnet tid til det enda
yes! its just sad that i have to live with someone who cant respect proper grammar :(
i will try. thank you
so basically 6 feet tall 17 year old football player vs 5'3 13 year old artist? idk if that would work :/
For sure, siblings are weird. My fiancée is the oldest of four and the youngest two are accepting/indifferent while the middle one has been nothing but a dick. But I know if it ever came down to it, they're still all ride or die. Same with me and my brother or my cousin who is essentially another little brother since we were raised together. Sometimes you wanna kill em but you still love em.
I wouldn't even go with the name half, just the pronouns. ""Tell your brother to come eat dinner""
""She says she'll be right down!""
That sounds like good advice.
Oof. Your brother is young and stupid. Hopefully he grows out of that behavior but you really have to let him know that this is a life or death situation. Either he starts respecting you like he should or he's going to lose you. You don't deserve that kind of disrespect. 

Family isn't blood. I have what I call my 'Ohana'. They're people in my life who I consider family even though they're not related. Your Ohana is out there. Focus on them and do your best to ignore your brother's bullshit. Some stupid you just have to let alone and hope it fixes itself.
Lykke til når du får tid. Er trist at du overhode trenger å gjøre dette da. Er ikke rettferdig at transpersoner blir tvunget til å hele tiden måtte redegjøre for ens egen eksistens :/
Yeah, I'm so sorry."	vs25hw	trans	1444	0.98	2022-07-05 16:39:42
I know that i'm trans but i don't want to admit it	I'm 17 yo, and i think i may be transmasc. i don't really know how to explain, but i want to be a boy so much , but transitioning would be too hard so i try to convince myself that i'm not trans.i know that i could never look or feel like a cis male (i'm too short etc.) and it makes me really sad. I don't want to draw my family's attention to me i just wish I had been born a man and i don't know what to do	"I'm sorry you're going through this. For what it's worth I know some really cool shorter dudes, both cis and trans.
denial is some potent drug. for what's worth, many dudes are plenty short, I know quite a few who are shorter than I am and I'm 160cm.
i was in denial like yours for many years. it made me feel stressed and anxious and horribly confused. it’s best to not deny and let your egg crack
> i want to be a boy so much

Sounds like dysphoria. Being a boy may be the straightforward answer here. There are plenty of shorter guys out there and they live normal lives.

But of course, the decision on whether to transition is a very personal one. Nobody else can make that decision for you.
Just saying, you're 17, get on HRT quick and you'll have plenty of time to catch up on male puberty, which usually doesn't completely stop til around 25.
It sure sounds like you're trans, so denying it wont do much good. Try not to stress about the full picture of transitioning. It can be intimidating at first. Start small and work on accepting yourself for what you are. Get to the point where you no longer want to be a boy, but know that you already is one, and always has been. That's the first big step and one that brings great relief. Next is coming out, then possibly physical transition, depending on your needs. Small steps forward. Best of luck dude :) <3
Yoh dont need to transition to pass as a male or to be a male. Lots of trans guys dont transition and pass fine. Also lots cis guys are shot a lot of them in fact, its a common trait ti be short.
The shorter the king, the taller the crown 👑
Domics is only 5’3 and he’s a king. I met up with a famous YouTuber and her husband and he’s only 5’6. (Sorry if you use cm). My old boss was shorter than me and I know a lot of dudes who didn’t get past 5’6. Be the short king you are meant to be!
> I know that i'm trans but i don't want to admit it 

I think you just did
I feel this my brain keeps telling me I’m not, I do know I am a trans male. Also never say you are to short, short kings are awesome I’m 5’0”. Keep going ok you got this!
Look at formula one drivers! They’re all handsome short kings 😳😳
I know plenty of short people in the Marines. I know some who were AFAB and have or are considering transitioning. Big things can come in small packages ya know? 

Hugs
You can definitely pass even being short. There are plenty of cis men who are short. Also, if you start HRT soon you will get more results.

Do you desire been seen as a boy, having a deeper voice, facial hair, more body hair? HRT can bring those changes and help out with dysphoria. Good luck bro 💖
Elliot Page is 5'1 and valid as fuck. Boys can be any height!
There are lots of short dudes, Danny Devi to isn’t even 5’ and dantdm, Linustechtips, and a bunch of other popular YouTubers are actually quite short, but some are rather tall too, height doesn’t matter
Being short and transmasc myself, the most I ever get for it is my online friends jokingly calling me short. But they’d stop if I told them it actually made me feel off. I’d say go for it, experiment! I have far too large of a chest to pass as male without a binder and puffy clothes, but nothing that top surgery won’t fix (once I get the money for it) transitioning is rough. There’s going to be bumps and hurdles, but if this is who you really and truly believe you are, then by all means go for it. Nothing, and I mean nothing comes close to the sensation of euphoria when you finally feel comfortable. You’ve got this!
I’m transfemme but I was also in denial for a while. It sucks. Mine was because of my religion, so it may be different to yours.

My advice is you do you. Be true to yourself. You don’t need to transition if you don’t want to, you don’t need to do anything. Be yourself, whatever that means. You could be a guy, a girl, whatever you want, you’ll still be just as valid as yourself.
Hey do whatever makes you happy but just to give you my 2 cents I knew I was a girl at 17 , but buried that so deep that I thought it would never find me well now I'm 32 and just starting to transition so not saying you can't just deny it forever but it's hard. Hope you figure things out and nothing wrong with short guys .
Dude, short guys are cool as heck! And if you do decide to ever take hormones, then you might gain some height! If you think you’re trans and stuff, then I’d welcome you to the community with open arms!
One of my crushes is 5'4 (2 inches taller than me) and he, a cis man, is so cute and is still very manly. I'm sure it'd be the same for you friend!
I think I've got the same thing but AMAB in denial here. I've always considered myself at least male-leaning, but I think I might be a trans girl. Sadly, I have the lowest voice type possible for a male and I'm 178 cm (5'10). Worst part is, I'm 13! I'll probably be at least 185 cm (6'0), but probably more when I stop growing. I don't think I get too much dysphoria, so I just live as a guy, or a demiboy, but I wish I was a cis girl. I don't want to be a trans girl, I want to be a cis girl.
same, but MtF 

&#x200B;

looks like im not alone
Yoooo
Mood. 
I denied for a long time. 

For me... (I have a natural hour glass and health issues so working out to try and bulk up shoulders and stuff wouldn't help and I don't want to go on T for various reasons) even just acknowledging that I'm trans, and exploring what that means for me and finding what makes me happier in my body vs what makes me feel worse, did a lot. Even without doing anything to medically transition. 

Also like others have said, don't let height stop you. There are plenty short men, cis and trans alike.
Don't think about what box you fit in. Surround yourself with positive things and do what makes you comfortable. ♥️
I still don’t pass but I think I look pretty even if it’s not the most conventional way.  Do I want ffs? Sure. Generally I’m pretty ok with my appearance if someone isn’t pointing out the fact I don’t pass.

Edit: Point is, do what makes you happy! Screw what other people think.
I've been in your shoes, not even that long ago to be honest. But you should do some soul searching. I know it's against what your thinking right now but by taking the steps to transition, and becoming more comfortable with yourself I think you'll come to find it'll be well worth the effort, especially when you've reached the goal you set yourself out on. 

I know this is all really scary to navigate, but you've got this community behind you if you ever need some support.  ♥

Best of luck !!!
Yep. I'm pretty sure most of us went through a phase like this. I sure did.
Theres no height restrictions on being a man
thats admitting it
17 is still quite young! You have PLENTY of time to transition, and it's possible you could even gain more height from the transition as you go through male puberty! Don't think you don't have a chance! And there's nothing wrong with being a short guy either. Lotta great short dudes out there! 🙂
fwiw, a lot of cis men are short as well! height just whittles down to genetics, not your hormones, so some cis men are very short and some cis women are very tall. im sorry that youre going through this, and i hope you get to a point one day where you can accept and be yourself fully, whatever that may look like
Danny DeVito is 4’10” a very successful short guy. Don’t beat yourself up or you will stress yourself. Stress kills and the guy everybody wants to hang with. Good luck on your journey if you choose to accept the facts.
> I know that i'm trans but i don't want to admit it

I mean, bro... you kinda just did. <3
I'm going through exactly what you described except transfemme. It sucks and idk what to do either :/
Just be yourself, do what best for your mental health and be who you want to be. I hope you’re happy in the future Sir! :D

Anyways besides you who cares how tall you are, there’s no height requirement to be a man.
our situations sound very similar ): just remember that your life is your own, your family won’t always agree with what you do but hopefully they’re understanding enough to accept you for who you are. Transitioning definitely isn’t easy, but if it makes you more comfortable in your body then it’s worth a try. I’ve also tried to convince myself that I’m not trans, but often wishing you were born as the opposite sex isn’t a very cis like mindset haha. Just ask yourself if you’re truly ok with not transitioning and living how you are. Accepting ourselves is a long journey, just remember that you’re not alone. I wish you all the best, and I hope things get better for you soon
Tons of cis men are short. You can be who you want to be, who you really are, no matter what you look like. Follow your heart and be happy, because the misery of denying yourself will build, and I know that no one wants you to go through that. We’re here for you
Hey now, everyone loves a short king. As for passing as a man, hormones do work. The societal stuff is scary, won't lie. But I know that for me, denying that I'm trans didn't help me at all
if that's any consolation for you almost all my cis male friends are shorter than me and I'm not even that tall.
I get what you mean. I first remember thinking I was trans about 4 years ago, not long after I turned 15. I didn't want to be trans so I just tried not to think about it. That happened multiple times I've the next 4 years. It was only last year that I realized I wasn't doing myself any favors by trying to hide from it. It is a personal decision to decide what you want to do when you realize that you are trans, so I recommend you do as much self-reflection as you can. I still am not sure exactly if I want to fully transition or when, so I'm just taking it one step at a time.
Sounds like you're trans! Transfemme here but all the fear of transitioning, saying it's too hard(too hard to be yourself? Maybe it's worth the fight and the difficult path🤔). How you're expressing these things reminds me of my own tough mental games.

I tried to ""make it work"" as a gay man.... But it was still off. And after 32 years I stressed myself into such a state that I was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital... Now I'm much better. Therapy, self acceptance, trust the process and yourself, and time. 

Btw you're only 17!! You can totally still get taller!! Don't want to get your hopes up, but I knew a couple cis guys that shot up after highschool. Puberty doesn't really finish until around 25.... who knows what you and a doctor could do at this point in time!?! 
And I'm pretty sure every trans person wishes they could have started hrt sooner. So...

Take a breath. Talk to your therapist and your doctor. Learn your options. And there's nothing wrong with needing help loving yourself. 

And I personally find short guys to be really sexy, and I'm 6ft haha. Especially stocky/muscled short guys hehe and I'm sure after some testosterone and maybe a few rounds of weight lifting and you'll be feeling your masc self!
Well, if it helps, we've all been there. Being trans is hard. Telling your family is hard. But.

The truth is, this shit doesn't go away. I knew I was trans when I was 17 and I didn't do anything about it until I was 39. And there were damn good reasons. But nonetheless, I lost a lot of years that I could have been me. And those years are just gone now. In the end, I still had to come out to everyone. And everyone is more people when you're older. Also, I was lucky--I never got married--but a lot of trans people get married and have kids and then that's something that gets in the way.

So, I guess I'd think harder about transitioning. Because actually, what I didn't realize when I was 17 was that being me was just so much more fun.
I feel you here. I'm in the same situation.  I want to be a girl, wish I was born a girl, etc. Yet it would be too annoying to transition and my sibling coming out aswell would make it seem like I'm just copying for attention.  What I mean is, your not alone. Your valid whatever you do :)
""i know that i could never look or feel like a cis male (i'm too short etc.) and it makes me really sad""

There are short cis men. You're also 17, so you still have time to grow taller. That being said, you don't have to transition if you don't want to. And if you do want to transition, there are different ways to go about it. ANY change in your life to align it better with your inner experience, no matter how small, is a kind of transition. It's not all big changes, surgeries and hormones. Using the pronouns that fit when interacting with people? That's a kind of transition. Deliberate changes to how you act and present? That's a kind of transition. Telling people you're a man, actually? That's a kind of transition.

Transition is more complex and involved than flipping a switch from ""I'm gonna conform to my AGAB"" to ""OK, all male now"". And you can pick and choose in what way you want to go forward. You can change your mind about that stuff, too. A lot of people do. And you're very young, so you have more time to figure it out than some (many) of us.

At any rate, regardless of what you end up deciding or not deciding, good luck.
im transfemme but i feel the exact same way, i cant offer any advice cuz im stuck too but hey, at least ur not alone
I feel sorry for you - but you shouldn't give up so easily! If you feel that you are a man, you probably won't be able to suppress those feelings your whole life long. At least not without feeling miserable, I guess. And testosterone can do lots of great things! Maybe it will take some time but I've seen so many pics/videos of trans men by now who don't look like women in the slightest - neither their face nor their body. Your height might not change but you shouldn't worry too much about that. Like others here said, short guys exist. The drummer of a German rockband I really like is 158cm (5'2), he's an attractive guy and, as far as I know, he's cis. There are several famous (cis) guys I know who are 5'5, and I also see men in real life sometimes who are very short. That wouldn't automatically out you as trans or let you appear more feminine! Masculinity hasn't anything to do with height in my opinion. You should just be who you are! (Of course I don't know how save that will be for you, if the people around you will be accepting etc. But I think you shouldn't suppress your feelings just because you think you won't look masculine enough. Pretending to be a woman will very likely be a lot more painful on a permanent basis!)
My brain goes down the same train of thought way too often(except mtf context in my case). So I'd like to think I can somewhat relate to your pain.

I'm stuck in this weird stalemate where the thought of both ends of the binary give me imposter syndrome, but where enby still feels like a dishonest description of myself. But not as dishonest as agender/a-spec, which I labeled myself longer ago. But can I go back to pretending I'm cis? No, seems like the more I run, the more sure I become about being trans.

In moments of clarity, my only clues are my gender envy for people presenting as ""the opposite gender"", and the mysterious but good feeling I get anytime I present even slightly as said gender. I guess it's gender euphoria? Whatever it is, imo it's a better clue than dysphoria. Dysphoria is something that usually gets lost in the white noise of self-denial, and you don't have to be stereotypically ""dysphoric"" to be trans.
Bro, I don't know how to tell you this, but guys are short sometimes. It just happens...

And if you want to be a boy, the prevailing trans take on that is that you already were one to begin with, you were just assigned unaccordingly. I don't know about ""feeling"" like a cis-male, that might never happen, but with modern advances in medicine, you can certainly look like one.

And anyway, what does a cis-man ""feel like"" in the first place? Gender isn't real, y'know, we made it up to justify sexism. I strongly suspect that being a ""Cis-male"" or a ""trans-man"" doesn't feel like anything, or nothing new at any rate. So if you think that it might make you happier to be a man, trans or not, there's no reason not to be. No one can really make a solid case that you're so fundamentally different from a cis-man that it'll just never be the same. TERFs try, of course, but their logic is always flawed. Especially if you get on Testosterone, because at that point all the minor differences between male and female that all men seem to have in common will start to be reflected in you anyway, aside from the obvious sexual anatomy (*to an extent*. you should do some research on the effects of T, it's actually rather interesting). But really, how many people do you share that with anyway? No one who wouldn't make you unhappier for not understanding in the first place.

So, go for it! Be a man! No one has an actual reason why you ""can't"" or ""shouldn't."" So just do it.
i was in denial just like you for years- im 26 now and finally starting to transition because I finally felt ready and couldn’t deal with the dysphoria any longer. it’s a lot to deal with- a lot of thoughts and feelings and stress. you don’t have to transition if you don’t want to, or if you want to wait that is perfectly valid too. there is no age limit. plenty of short dudes, cis and trans alike, pass. :) i believe in you! ♡
one of my good friends is shorter than me and he is the most passing trans man i’ve ever met! (for reference i’m a 5’ 4” trans girl, he’s 5 foot) height doesn’t mean anything when it comes to being a man! i used to think it was easier to keep my desire to transition in, but once i got my own place and got supportive friends who had resources for me to transition i finally started! and it’s not as complicated as you think, hormones do so much for people
My (presumably) cis-male dad is 5'0"". Being short is not a disqualifying factor at all.
the shorter you are the easier it is to put this crown on you, king
You don't have to be ashamed of it, but if you're uncomfortable with it you don't have to admit it unless you want to
I lived like that for 7 years, but I’m mtf. For my experience denial won’t get you anywhere. Do what you feel is right for you, always. If you don’t think this is the moment to transition don’t, but pulling it off just because of fear isn’t the best approach, or at least that’s my experience, but rushing things if you’re not ready probably isn’t the best. Maybe try leaving hints or making small changed to see how people react and see how you feel
Didn’t you just? 

Flip a coin heads your trans tails your not, 

And if it’s a result you dislike congrats you know your answer 

Sorry your struggling
Cis men are all different. I hope you can become free and be the man you want to be.
You don’t need to be tall to be manly, my monkey for a manager can tell you that
If it helps you any, this is exactly how I felt growing up and in my young adult years, I always thought it could never be possible for me, I met someone when I was 20 who was extremely supportive of my feelings and wishes, I however have not been with them for over a year and I'm now 8 months on estrogen. Surround yourself with people who support you for your true self and sooner then you expect you'll have the courage for yourself to do the things you need to and take action. Good luck with your journey 😊
You'll eventually work through this and figure out what's best for you. Just keep in mind it's about what you need, not what your family needs, and that often the most worth doing things are incredibly difficult. Also short kings are still kings.
Denial definitely isn't fun, I was full of self doubt and wasn't able to fully accept who I was untill I could see myself living a life where I was proud and that helped me gain confidence just knowing who I was. But I also am going to say this hoping it helps but you don't have to transition you can just do what ever is comfortable for you. You can still be trans and not transition it is all about feeling better about yourself. There is also no rush just make sure you are comfortable with what you do in life and who you are, that's all that matters.
Hey there! Transfem here, and I wanted to say that having the courage to reach out and ask for advice is really impressive. Although I can’t 1-to-1 relate to the transmasc experience, the trans experience in general is very similar. If there’s some advice I could give to possibly help you find clarity, it’d be this: In 30 years, when you’re living away from your family and possibly with one of your own, do you imagine yourself as your assigned gender or as transmasc? Would you have a happier life if you were transmasc?

It’s really easy to get caught up in the what-if’s and short term issues, but if it’s safe to do so, it might be worthwhile to just experiment with dressing more masculine, use makeup for faux facial hair, or even using a packer if that’s of interest to you.

Above all, you are valid. I think you could benefit from exploring your gender and just seeing what feels right to you, and hopefully that will grant some insight. If you do end up identifying as transmasc, I wouldn’t worry too much about not passing due to height and other factors as plenty of short kings exist and HRT (if you wanted that) would help a bunch.

Good luck brother 😉, rooting for you!
I am sorry to say, but this isn't gonna go away. Or at least it didn't for me.


Just because something can't be perfect doesn't mean it's not better than the alternative.
4 words, 2 names, Peter dinklage, Danny devito
I’m transitioning and hardly want to admit it. We can do this together!!!
Hey! Short, feminine appearing transmasc here! I used to be in the same boat as you, too small, too feminine, transitioning isn't feasible because of family and situation right now, etc. etc. I'm here to tell you that you are not alone. Hell, I still haven't started transitioning medically. If you have people that you can confide in and support you, perhaps try slowly transitioning socially. It'll take baby steps to one day get where you want to be, but it'll be so worth it in the end. I'm cheering you on!

PS: since you specifically mentioned height, I'm only 152 cm (4'11), and I was pretty insecure about it, but then I met one of my best friends, a cis guy whose only just a bit taller than me, 159 cm. If your goal with transitioning in the future is to pass as cis, you'll definitely make it, no matter your height!
First off, I know plenty of short men, height is not a factor to masculinity. Secondly, if you really want to transition you should, just remember that no one is forcing you to transition, if you decide to transition you should do it in your own way. Third, if you do not want to draw your family's attention that's completely fine, most people don't want their attention either. Just remember that this decision is completely up to YOU, and no one else, no one else should have any impact on your decision or what you do.
I have literally seen 5’3” cis men with online dating. My amazing trans son changed clothes and hair to what he feels amazing in. His confidence is fantastic and he has glowed up. I can’t imagine him as a “she”. No hormones yet either. Anyone who doesn’t support him can buzz off or go through momma bear here. It was a gradual but quick process. Hair became shorter and shorter. Clothes were full on male tops and now pants. He came out to anyone who couldn’t figure it out in his time.
I feel that
This is more relatable than I’d like to admit
you can be trans and not transition!! many transmasc and fem individuals don’t medically transition. it’s your choice what to do with your journey. i almost didn’t transition medically myself, but i had too much voice dysphoria so i did it. it’s all up to you what you’d like to do with your body. no one else can decide your transition. i’m rooting for you anyway you’d do so.
I'm non-binary...or something. I was born male and I am 5'1"". But at the turn of the year I had an identity crisis about my gender and sexual orientation.

Some my family and friends know now. Some don't fully understand. And others don't know at all. I'm understand because even though I'm 33 I live with family. And wearing makeup and dressing more feminine has been a process where keep pushing the limits of what they deemed as normal. At the end of the day I really think I'm a post-genderist...and that makes me feel better because I don't feel the need to conform to anything. Gender roles and things associated with gender are all man-made anyway...so I kinda feel it shouldn't matter.

BUT. I do get it. Because sometimes I just wanna be a woman. I want to look like a regular woman and be perceived that way. But I kinda stick with being a dude or labeling myself as non-binary because it feels more realistic to me, as I don't see myself getting on hrt or having surgery...at least not that this point.

Just worry about being comfortable with yourself and trying out new things. When you find out what really makes you comfortable you might be end up being more brave in the face of  judgment. Like sometimes when I dress feminine and wear makeup, I have more confidence than when I was just trying to be a dude. I don't know why...but because of that it's easier to shrug off people who bring any negativity.

The hardest thing, to me, is/was wondering who will abandon me or who will i have to abandon if/when they know who I really am. But living in fear and feeling shitty trying to be a fake version of yourself becomes tiring.

It'll take time, but I think you'll be okay. Don't rush this process. And love yourself.
Hey, you got an entire life to figure that out. I haven't vibed with being a girl since puberty, but I didn't fully come out of my egg until I got 20. Experiment, see what you're comfortable with, and figure out where you stand.
I used to feel this way, I’m 29 now and just started transitioning and Ive been happily surprised with the options that are out there for trans people and how much I can change my body to feel I am no different than any other person born a male. Whatever you choose try not to do it out of fear and follow your vulnerable heart ❤️
I denied the fact that I am trans for 7 years. You can only ignore how much everything sucks for so long, and by the end of it, you just realise that you just wish you had started being yourself sooner.
I know this one cis guy named Tony who lives and exists as a stereotypical 1950s New Yorker (without the racism and sexism) and he's like 5'1. If people allow him to exist then I'm pretty sure a short king like yourself will be fine.
I'm 5'2 and my bestfriend who is cis is also 5'2. Our goal is to not become cis, our goal is to care for ourselves any means necessary. Whether thats stealth or by waiting to transition.

  
I know cis women who look like men and cis men who look like women. So I really dont know why people make us out to be such a strange ass thing. Just know you'll always pass more than  a ton of cis people out there.  


Regardless you'll figure it out. I'm sorry you are going through this though. I hope tomorrow is better for you.
You need a quality therapist. I wish I got one at your age.

I'm 33 and only just now started coming out as transfem. I wanted to fit in with the other boys so put myself through hell trying to be a ""bloke"" (I'm Australian). 

I started watching sports, became a superstar boxer, developed a reputation of the ""gentle giant"". I'm 6'5"", I have strength behind most folks capability. 2 weeks ago I moved someone's house all on my own. Furniture and all.

I'm 33, people have known me as the biggest and strongest for so long, it's now hard to let go of. The whole reason I went on this journey was for validation as ""one of the boys"".

If I started on HRT before finishing puberty I wouldn't have grown as much. I wouldn't be the hulking giant I am today. In reality, I am happiest when I'm on my own, painting my nails in my silky sleeping gown. No expectations, no crave to fit in, just me in my space.

You may not be trans, maybe you're non binary. You'll never know unless you explore this side of yourself.
Hey as a trans masc person who is also 17 I absolutely get this. Internalised self transphobia is absolutely normal. I have accepted my identity but I do continue to have similar thought. Sometimes I’ll just cry over knowing not being able to where a wedding dress, or wanting to wear “womens” clothes but not being able to because I know I’ll feel dysphoric. It’s hard but it does get easier. 
If you can get a binder I recommend doing so. T and surgery are long roads to leap on so you are allowed to take as much time as you like to figure your self out.
I know lots of short duders. You already admit here you are trans. Why is it too hard?
trans enby here daring a short 1.65~ cis guy and ngl short guys rock.

t4t relationships are always a great and lovely-like-no-other experience.

good luck on your journey. being trans does not have a static definition or look. you do you and that's what matters.
I seriously regret not coming out when I first realized I was trans. I feel like I wasted do much time pretending to be something that was ultimately unsustainable.
r/egg_irl


In all seriousness though, short guys are the best kind imo. I feel your struggle, just the other way around.
This is almost the same situation I was in at age 15. I'm 25 now. My advice is to accept it sooner rather than later and try to do something about it as soon as you can. Do not let insecurities stop you like they stopped me. There are short men who are cis, believe me. If you're transmasc, then you are - and it certainly is amazing. In terms of family, that's tricky but if you can safely start HRT/do other gender affirming things, do it now rather than later. You need to do what makes you happy, because later in life, you will regret it if you didn't. It's never too late though; I will take hormones soon after years of agony and severe body dysphoria and it's definitely so unbelievably worth it. You should be free to be the person you are and live your life authentically. Don't pretend to be someone you are not.
""Transistioning is too hard"" is an excuse a lot of people use to deny their trans identity. No one said it would be easy but it'll be worth it in the long run. Happiness holds the greatest value in life.
I was in the same situation when I was your age, I knew but I didn't want to accept it. I ended up coming out at 21 and wishing I had done so earlier because I am so much happier now. However, if you don't feel ready to do so, it doesn't matter, just do it when you feel like it's your time, I don't regret waiting, bc I don't know what it would have been like when I was 17, I think my parents would have been able to convince me that I am not trans, so coming out at 21 made me much stronger in my position and whatever my parents said didn't affect me as much.
Hey, don’t worry, there’s plenty of short kings in the world, my best friend is a guy and he’s like 5’3”, don’t worry about being too short
I'm really sorry but it won't work, you only loose years at trying to convince yourself without ever fullfil your objective.
Being trans sucks
I really really urge you to look up before and after transmasc pics. There are some shockingly amazing transformations and it might give you the confidence you need. 💜💙💜
Being too short doesn’t matter I literally know a 17 year old AMAB(assigned male at birth) guy who is like 5 foot 3
Hey! I know exactly how you feel. I was your age when I started to have these feelings / realizations about myself and my identity… and it’s scary lol

It’s totally normal to feel this way. Remember that you don’t have to dive in head first with this. Experiment with your identity for a while. If you don’t typically dress masc, start wearing more masc clothes. If you want to cut your hair short, go for it (hair grows back after all!) and the internet is great for… testing the waters before you jump to irl stuff too. See how you get on with using male pronouns, maybe even play around with some nb pronouns or even some neopronouns if that makes you comfortable! There’s absolutely no rush here and you’re still very young! 

Transitioning totally depends on what the individual wants to do. You don’t need to go on hormones or have surgery to be a valid trans person. You could go your whole life without having these treatments and you’d be just as much of a man as the folks who do.
I’m 4’11 quite possibly 4’10 and I am taller than the most hunkiest cis guy I know at work. Don’t let height define your gender.
I’m amab and I’m 5’1. I’ve never been mistaken for anything other than a cis guy, trust me, it’s not all about height :) you can be a awesome guy regardless
You don't have to transition to be trans. You can identify as a boy, and not change anything about yourself, including your wardrobe, hair, etc. It's all up to being comfortable with what you look like, the way your body looks, and and how you feel within it. Good luck, friend.
Best thing I can say is yes transition is hard and I was in your exact position (however mtf) and I can say that transitioning is yes extremely hard, but living with this constant dysphoria is harder and only gets worse. Pls consider this as my mental space after accepting and coming out has improved so much💕💕 good luck
Don't stop growing until 21-23. Not much more growth from there, but start at 18, could gain some height
I'm sorry you're going through this but for what it's worth, my brother and I are only 5"" and 5""1' respectively.
I was in your shoes back when I was 16, couldn’t face the fact I’m trans until 18 and I got mental health care for other stuff. You may not want to face it but you’ll eventually have to, try writing or seeking out health care if you need that to be able to face this fact- it won’t just ‘go away’ if you ignore it.
Short kings are the best!
Dude I feel you but please try not to be in denial. For what it’s worth me and my friends liturally once joked about how terrible it would be for me to be trans (pre me coming out) because I have the most masculine build ever 💪(•3•). but cracking the egg helps a little so I would highly recommend
Facts, the coolest dude I know is cis and is like 4’9
If I'm not wrong, Kevin Hart is 160 too.
I did same lol denial is pretty comman but once the egg cracks you feels good that you accept yourself
I’m gonna cry im 26
Oh great. 7 more years of this shit :/
It’s easier to make smaller drivers fit in cars
from a 6'1 trans girl that had a shitty voice,, voice training goes a long, long way (do it while ur as young as possible as well!!), and fuck height standards. theres so many taller cis girls and taller cis female celebrities,, and who cares if ur taller, be the tall queen you are!!
Before I came out I was so scared that my family’s entire view of me would change. I just wanted to be myself but male. It took actually coming out to realise that while there was a change they had to make it didn’t affect who I was to them.

Just because puberty naturally stops by then doesn't mean you can't extend it, that's literally the point of HRT. You're good Friendo, I promise!
some people grow and shrink depending on the type of hrt regardless of starting point due to muscle loss or growth.

muscle loss is from mtf hrt

muscle gain is from ftm hrt

But then even results may vary. But its pretty common so its more of a guarantee than some other things on hrt. Hrt is INSANE. Probably the best drugs (dont do drugs kids obvi)
We don't really stop physically developing till our 30s and even then hrt is fuckin nuts.
I'm just finishing up (26 this year), don't worry, the last 8 years of natural male puberty aren't bad, it's mostly just hair growth and getting stinkier.
I’m not short I’m ✨aerodynamic✨

Social transitioning is so annoying	Having to tell everyone is so awkward, then at some moment you'll be with a friend who you came out to and one that you didn't and will have to explain to him at the moment, ruining the mood, then there are the ones who have a hard time getting used to your new pronouns... Overall a pain in the ass for everyone.	"Yeah I didn't start my social transition until I had been on hrt for about a year It has been pretty ehh for me. I've gotten a fair about of support and congratulations but my manager is transphobic so dealing with her has been awful. But yeah It annoying having to update everything under deadname is pain but in the end its been nice being out, not looking forward to the legal shit tho my state is one of the worst for stuff like that apparently. Anyway best of luck with the your transition It can be awkward but it gets better 😉
Agreed
I find a lot of the role play and fantasy community are super welcoming (dnd, warhammer etc) probably cause we all dislike this world and enjoy dissociating from bs norms for atleast a little bit
Very true. I found it too annoying to deal with, so I'm in stealth mode 90% of the time when in public. Plus, my family doesn't respect my pronouns or being trans in general, so I get misgendered all the time (I'm working on moving on with my life sans most of my blood family.)
Hell yeah that shits annoying
Just don't tell people and let them figure it out
No more trans, return to egg >:3
There’s always my favorite method of social transitioning: fake your demise and move to a new city in a new country and start your life all over while under an obscure witness protection program! /s
What always strikes me are the people who have responded to me with needing time to process like us becoming who we are and finding happiness somehow inconveniences them. 

Informing people is certainly the biggest frustration...come to think of it...it might just be my only frustration with transitioning.
It's even better in your 40s when you've spent the last 10 years trying to settle in to ""the reality that you're too old to transition"", and the people who I went to hs with realize that whole thing wasn't just some teenage phase.
Protip: Just have no friends! If you have no social life you don’t need to socially transition ;D
Literally it’s so frustrating. I’m in Uni and after the first semester I officially started identifying as gender fluid and asking that people use my pronouns and name correctly. I stopped saying stuff lately though because it’s so much work to tell everyone :(
Agree x1000 I came out to a bunch of family and old friends at once on Facebook instead of seeing them in person eventually or something I’m just so awkward lol
This is why we should all just return to monke
Ugh right? This has been my existence for the past few months lmao. But it is still a relief compared to… *shudders* the closet
Truth
It's much easier to not have friends xD
I just don’t and bask in the sweet, sweet dissonance of confusion. Chaos is the way.
I get it. Today I said “sir” correcting my friend who called me man and I felt really rude, but stuff like that is necessary sometimes
Yeaaaaah. Maybe you've done this already but I found social media posts to be very helpful. Something in Facebook and IG seems to spread the word pretty well. But then, yes, peeps sucking at pronouns still sucks 😒
My parents are completely ignoring my pronouns (they/them) and preferred name. My sister and fiance use both of them around them but they act like nothing is happening. Though I do find it funny that my niece and nephew don't know who my sister and fiance is talking about when they dont use my legal name.
Its annoying but short lived fortunately. :-)
I'm lucky i have friends who accept me (MTF) and start using the correct pronouns and name ☺️ but it's also scary and can be annoying, luckily the more you do it the easier it gets
I know this all to well slowly coming out to everybody socially.  Luckily all my friends are very supportive and all are proud of me for chasing my dreams and finally seeing me truly ""happy"", which I am now I'm my correct gender
I'm sorry it's annoying, but it honestly really helps cis allies like myself.

i feel really really bad if I misgender people, regardless of how much they say it's okay afterwards, so it really helps if I just know people's pronouns.

again, I'm really sorry it's annoying, but it really helps
yup it's why I didn't bother with that much. no use coming out to for example classmates, i'll never see them again anyway
I still suck ass at correcting people. I was just at my cousin's 30 birthday party this weekend and got misgendered constantly (mainly because no one knew)
I'm resolution this year has been to get better at correcting people and I've yet to make a proper effort to. My cousin was the one who would end up explaining it to her friends (which I was totally OK with)
That's why I won't socially transition! At least not in this way. I really don't have anyone in my old life except immediate family that I want to keep around when I go to use, by which point I should be passing... Easy. I'll just be a girl, not a trans girl 😂
I'm not coming out except to those closest to me tbh. I don't have a large circle of friends and my employers don't need to know unless it becomes hugely evident but work uniforms help that. 

If everyone else can't tell I'm a lil gay, well, that's on them. Lol
Sometimes I forget that I didn't tell someone I was trans and mention it. People are shocked to learn I'm trans every time for some reason. I just don't care anymore
Agreed 
I just messaged a handful of people from my sports club yesterday. 
They all got the same message but I was so stressed to sense it in the classes, I haven't hidden who I am, always fem but now that I'm changing my name it was time to let it out.
I just noped out of all my social groups and moved to a new state so I wouldn't have to deal with that shit...
Regarding the friends situation, one thing I did that worked really well was literally running away from the table we were sitting at and shouting over my shoulder ""you tell him"" 😂

Ymmv
I didn't wanna deal with it so I just changed discord status/twitter location
And then you get a new job and you have to gauge if your co-workers are going to be cool or if you'll be safe or if you'll have to go back into the closet to earn a paycheck and not be at risk of homelessness.
My plan is to just not, normalise it not being a big deal
Yeah. I started socially transitioning at the start of last summer. I realized at Christmas that there were some people that I forgot to come out to.
ive changed my name so many times, much more online, but also in person. it has been more awkward in person every damn time! my identity has changed a bit, but I never had to worry about pronoun changes after i did it for the first time. im used to the process now, but i know what you mean when you say it's awkward.

transitioning in general is a tough, irritating, and sometimes awkward experience. at least we're not alone with these thoughts and feelings though :)
I still wish I could transion. Socially at least but in my native language singular they and gender neutrality are nonexistent and changing my name is considered rude.
yes. very awkward. but the more I do it the less I care about other people's awkwardness. Honestly, I'm so in my head all the time if someone is acting weird / awkward around me I just assume they are an awkward person and treat them as such. They usually warm up to me once we exchange words because I'm an awesome bitch.
I'm gonna preface this by saying, I realize my strategy for going about this isn't viable for everyone. 

I really started going in on my social transition last year when I was fed up with the job I had and my friend group at the time. So, I took a couple weeks to find a few different jobs, applied to each under my deadname, then brought up the fact I'm trans when they'd call or email to set up an interview. It became very easy to decide when only one interview used my chosen name. 

As far as my friends, I started at the start of last year. First, I only wanted to be referred to as my nickname (Sauce (it being non-binary was a total coincidence)). Then I came out as trans, and told my closest friends first. Then more of the group, and slowly but surely, the people who were going to become a problem showed themselves, so I hung out with them less and less. To the point that they stopped bothering to reach out at all. 

Now, I'm in a job I enjoy, making headway towards my lifelong career, have supportive friends that are keeping me going, and life is good :) Sorry for the ramble 😅😅
It is a fuckton of anxiety…
I hope people don’t make the same mistake I did… I forgot to tell my brother that I was trans. And I only just realized that when we arrived at the clinic for my first appointment. He thought it was a normal doctors appointment😂 we sat in the waiting room and the psychologist called me by my chosen name. I can laugh about it now, but I was mortified. Thankfully my brother took it in a stride and he hasn’t slipped up with name and pronouns since
I socially transitioned on the internet but not in real life mainly because I haven't started medically transitioning yet.
I'll take ""Other coping mechanisms that I was oblivious to"" for 500 Alex.
Also used to ""Jim is playing a female Elf"" so a bit easier to change up pronouns.
Of course DND is welcoming, the rules literally include trans and non binary people
There’s def still assholes there but for the most part they’re welcoming
It’s like I wrote this 😂 same story here!
Literally what I'm doing, but I've told the closest friends, then as we interact with each other, the other friends slowly figure it out, I call it the trans pyramid scheme
This is how I’m doing it for that vast majority of people I know. I really don’t feel the need to advertise my identity to every damned person i know.

If you know, you know. If you don’t, you’ll figure it out eventually. Not my problem tbh.
A coworker told me they other day they were starting their hormones, trying to pick a name, and had an info appointment for top surgery. I asked if they were going to make some kind of announcement at work/their plan for informing the team, and they don't plan to tell anyone really. I thought it was interesting and after reading this thread I can see why it was their choice!
Precisely what I'm doing... but to be fair I am cool with any probouns..pronouns....or... what would be super dope is to not be perceived at all...
Ditto, but like people aren't picking up on it and i feel like i'm starting to feel tired of having to be a boy socially at work
I believe I already went too deep to be returning @_@)
It’s frustrating sure, but I try to be patient. Cisgender people just really do not have the internal language to understand us.
Already done! (/s)
Ooo I reckon I’ve pretty much got that one covered
pfp checks out
So some dipshit can make an NFT out of me? Nah. Gonna keep on transin’ right along.
yes XD
I've been really, REALLY passive about it for now, I don't even correct people about it for now and just pretend I didn't noticed, I guess I have to start being more agressive about it soon
Some language with latin roots, yes? Here in Brazil it's the same, if we don't know what gender the person is, or when talking to a group we just use ""he/him"" too
Video games help really well also, problem is when ur xbox breaks and your only source of escaping reality and socializing with your friends is no longer viable it comes back tenfold😞
And then Jim finds out why she loves playing female elves so much
Whats your job? If you don't mind me asking
Finding out you're trans is like discovering forbidden eldritch knowledge. You can never unlearn it once you know.
No.
I dunno about you, but coke breaks really get me back into the game
<.<
.     >.>
Research assistant in a bio lab, why?
Repression is a helluva drug. Since starting to transition, I’ve remembered at least one occasion, many years ago, where my egg cracked open but I promptly crawled back inside and sealed the cracks.
Yeah in retrospect I can understand why I was able to repress in the past but there came a certain, uh, *moment* and after that I knew I wouldn't be able to repress ever again.
Idk how it got “do coke” from Xbox lmao
That's a cool job
I did that at least once a month for most of 2021. It was a fun year."	sn8kry	trans	1243	0.98	2022-02-08 02:33:06
Coming Out and Cutting Off	"On January 23rd, 2022, I came out to my parents. I had written them a letter a couple of weeks beforehand and put it in my room. I told my mother where to find it. I was at a friend's apartment, near my college.

I didn't speak to her for about another week. The first person I spoke to was my Grandmother, who lives with my parents. She wasn't happy. Neither was my Dad. There was a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, and a lot of pain that day, while I attempted to explain everything to them calmly. I've never been one to get angry.

The days went by, and things slowly calmed down. My Grandma, who had said she didn't want to talk anymore, began to call every day again (multiple times daily), and my Dad called occasionally. I even spoke to my Aunt, who wanted to be the ""mediator"" between me and my Mom.

And then. They asked me to go home. And I agreed.

I was treated with the worst weekend of my entire life.

&#x200B;

The ride home with my Mom was painful. We argued for a bit, invalidating my gender, saying she'd only ever love \*dead name\*. We ate and continued to argue. I never raised my voice. I wasn't raised to do that. The rest of the ride home was silent. I never looked at my phone, I just looked forward as the time ticked down. I didn't rest my eyes, nor did I ask to go to the bathroom despite my bladder screaming at me. I didn't want her berating me for not feeling up to go into the Women's restroom yet.

When we got home, I brought my stuff up to my room. My Grandma had asked to see my HRT, so I took 1 of both pills I take to her. My Mom found the rest and took it, calling me a liar and receptor for even trying to keep it. I went to bed shortly after.

When I got up, my Grandpa wanted to take me to his priest. It wasn't the worst experience in the world, he didn't yell, say I was going to hell, or even say it was a sin. He wanted to ""guide"" me through this. We ate, got home, and then, it was my Dad's turn.

He took me to my Grandfather and Uncle's graves. Both died before I was born. He told me about how proud his Grandfather was of him getting married, and how wanted to feel the same for me. I said he could. He said it wouldn't be the same. He said he wanted to continue his family's name and legacy. I said I could, with adoption. He said it wouldn't be the same. He then took me to see my Grandma. He hadn't told her and left it up to me. I didn't say anything.

We got home. My mom made dinner, and we ate. Afterward, my Grandma encouraged me to speak with my Mo, or she wouldn't speak to me. I wanted to keep her, so I did. It quickly went awry. She took my phone and began reading chat logs, seeing how I spoke to people, now my friends, at my college's PRIDE club. She had already thought I was brainwashed, and this cemented it in her mind. I knew I was trans before I met them, however.

My mom and dad began reacting horribly. They wanted legal action done against my friends, the club, the school, Plume (where I get my HRT). They threatened to get my close friend expelled and fired. Thye began posting things online calling them cultists indoctrinating their child and ""warning"" parents of the threat. My dad sent emails to the heads of the PRIDE club, threatening them if they ever spoke to me again.

My dad threatened to beat me. He said he didn't know if he'd be able to stop himself from killing me if he started.

Both wanted to attack any of my friends if they saw them.

and...

&#x200B;

My dad threatened to shoot my close friend.

&#x200B;

They continued reading chat messages. They were now getting to my high school friends, who I had come out to and who supported me. They started to insult and threaten them too.

My mom began to threaten not to take me back to my dorm. To not let me go back to classes. I had to say things I didn't mean in order to convince her to let me get out of that house.

I went to bed. My dad later told me that as he continued to read my messages, (which he now had access to on his computer because he asked for my Discord password) he wanted to enter my room and beat me while I was asleep.

When I finally got back to campus, my Mom forced me to take my box of feminine items in my dorm down to their car. And then, they left.

&#x200B;

It took me a while to respond to any of my friends. They were incredibly worried about me. I told them I was doing okay, and about everything that had occurred. 

I began formulating a plan of what to do.

My friends had already reported my dad to campus safety. The things I told them were just the icing on the cake.

They got me a prepaid phone. The one I had had Life360 on it, and I wasn't sure how much else they had access to.

I informed my Calculus professor, whose class I had an exam in on the day I planned to confront them. He allowed me to delay it.

I spoke to campus officers, lawyers, to about everyone I could without my parents knowing. They were watching me like a hawk, unfortunately.

During this time, my parents drained my bank account, which was jointly owned. They also informed me that they knew I had another prescription for my HRT filled, and they would be forcing me to pick it up and give it to them.

The plan was for me to confront them. A parent's weekend was coming up, wonderful timing. My friends notified the school of my plan. They would be prepared in case anything happened.

And the day came.

&#x200B;

I got up early, and got ready, watching Life360 as my parents drive down. Luckily, it went both ways. We met up briefly before classes began. I told them I loved them.

When classes were over, I went to our Student Union. Many people, students parents, faculty, security would be there. I'd be safe. My parents came to meet me.

I gave them an ultimatum. They either accept me, give me back my money, stop threatening me and my friends, or I cut them off. My mother gave me a counter ultimatum. There was one option in both that matched.

We continued to argue. I told them I didn't deserve the things they did. They said they had the right to do them. She asked for ""her"" phone. I handed it right to her. She said I was her son. I told her I was her daughter. She walked away.

My dad continued to speak with me for a bit. He said he didn't agree with her taking my phone, and that he didn't ""mean"" any of the threats he made. He was just angry. He asked me if visiting his father and brother's graves meant nothing to me. I said it did, but it didn't change who I was. I hugged him, and he left after my mother.

It has since been a day. I was able to spend the rest of that day with my friends, dressing up how I want, getting my HRT back, changing my passwords to accounts they had, and watching Queer Eye. I had never actually watched it before. It was nice.

&#x200B;

The strange thing is, I feel as though I should have a sense of grief. I will miss my family, I will miss my Grandma, and I will miss my Niece and Nephew. But I think I already accepted losing them as a possibility before I even came out. So, I expected it, and it's what I got. I already went through my grief.

From now on, my life will be harder. I won't be supported by my family, I will have to do my own financial aid for college, I will have to do everything on my own. And maybe I am not ready for it. But I will try. I will be the person my parents thought I couldn't be. I will go through life as myself, unapologetically. Because I have spent the past 18 years incapable of doing so, suppressing myself and my emotions, being the perfect little child, who does no wrong.

&#x200B;

My life will be harder. But it also shines so much brighter. And I cannot wait to keep living it."	"This sounds like an absolute horror show. Your parents could and should be charged for stealing your medication and for making threats of violence. I hope you are well.
It took a ton of strength to make those steps and you were right to defend yourself!
Thank you so much for posting this, and you know we are here for you. Reading this was almost therapeutic for me, as I can relate to most everything and it shows that even if everything goes wrong, its still possible to make it.
I realized my identity just over a month ago, at the end of my first semester in college. I realize my suppression had been preventing me from really connecting with people, and im still trying to figure out how to get friends who would accept me if I came out to them.
This kind of confrontation takes the strength that not many have. I am happy that you are currently safe, and I wish you luck on your journey. This story is the biggest thing I am personally afraid of happening and that is why I am waiting till I graduate. Hiding it is tough, but it is even more badass to live your life as yourself. When it comes to providing for yourself, depending on your major you could look around for some entry internships. Or look into possible scholarships to apply for. Depending on how high your tuition is will change the difficulty of the whole process. If you have more internships than is necessary for your tuition and any other administrative expenses you will get that money refunded to you. Good luck girl, we are all cheering for you.
Did they ever return the money they stole?
It's amazing how mature of a person you are! I wouldn't be so delicated as you were, personally.
They don't deserve you, they sound like disgusting human being frankly, and long term you will be better of without them. You are string, doing this. Be proud
Proud of you, keep it up 💜
Am I the only one who thinks you should run to the cops and tell them your parents threatened your friends life just because you're trans?
You are so brave.
I'm a stranger and this shouldn't mean anything to you
but I am proud of you for stepping up to your parents.

I wish you all the best and joy with your new won freedom:)
Resonated with a lot in your story. Shit birth family here as well. Stay strong! Remember you can make your family however you want! It doesn’t have to be your blood!
Exactly what I’m a afraid of when I go off to college and begin to transition.

Honestly you are so brave and you did the right thing by cutting out your family; if they want you back in their then they need to realize they have to make peace with who you are.

Good luck your are braver than I good lady.
Walk your own path, make your own family   


I don't have supportive family, me and my mum pretty much openly hate each other - unless someone is around then she tries to play nice ofc.  
Rest of family is abroad and I have no contact with them, I came out to them though.  
They don't understand it or accept it, but they do want me to be happy - therefore I told them one thing I must do is cut myself from the past, because I won't be able to heal from trauma.

I need love and support, I only started HRT lately and I just have a mindset of a teenage girl, who is beyond her wisdom for her age.

The way I counterpart loneliness and trauma from not so great family is building my own circle of friends, who treat me with respect for who I am.  
When I am surrounded by such people, I am able to be honest, emotional, more loving and I will grow as a person, that I am transitioning to.
I get the feelings what they did should be labeled abuse. None of that was ok, by any metric.
We cannot choose our gender or who we love, but we CAN choose who we call our ""family"". For some of us this is easier said than done, but Im glad you found the support and strength to be true to who you are.

Also, on a brighter note, Queer Eye is an excellent pick-me-up for any occasion.
Yeah. This is why I sent my parents a letter and then just never talked to them again.
I'm so incredibly sorry for you. And I know that this might happen to me too. So I'm cutting them off emotionally at the moment to feel stronger when that happens.
Thanks for sharing. I'm expecting the same of my parents in about a month, so your experience really hits home. You are better off and you have a bright future ahead of you. The best thing to do is to continue to be and become who you were meant to be. Get into a field that you love and live a life worth envying. It's their loss that they chose not to be part of that.

Lots of love sis. You are so awesome. <3
Dear god, I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. I don’t know if I would have had the resilience you did. Stay strong girl, you’ve gotten this far, nothing can stop you now.
Your parents sound like they would be great friends with mine. I was cut off last summer, tried to let my mom back in a few months ago, and ultimately went no contact. 

Mine didn’t have as much access to abuse me as yours did. I came out as a married adult, post college. But they still paid for my phone service. They got rid of that eight months ago. I still don’t have cell service. 

It’s hard, but I resonate with you saying you already mourned them, in a sense. 

Much love to you girl, you have a fantastic life ahead of you.
You seem like an amazingly composed and compassionate person. I wish I could give you a round of applause and a massive hug at the same time. Whoever you choose to be your friends and family from now on are so lucky to have you!
This is why Im not planning to have any discussion with my family Once I transit, I will just cut them of. Its better that way. Im sorry OP for what happened to you. Also you was very brave.
This post is written like someone is dissociating while writing it. That kind of experience is extremely traumatizing. I hope you’re okay. Please talk to a therapist as soon as you can. Your campus should have services available.
I'm proud of you. Abusive parents suck and you did the right thing here. Never go back, you worked hard to get here, to a place where you can be yourself.
That sounds like an absolute shitshow, i'm really sorry you had to go through that ☹️ but you have friends and an environment that loves and accepts you so that's a major plus. And you have us as well 😊 stay strong girl, and stay safe
I'm sorry these awful ideas got into your family's head. The things people will do when they're scared or angry, over something that doesn't warrant it. I don't know how you kept your cool. That must have been so hard. 

I hope you make out okay, I'll be thinking about you Sister. They didn't give you a choice, you tried.
this is horrifying but I'm so glad you're safe now. you're an incredibly strong young woman, you should be proud for coming out and proud for standing up against them. with support from people who actually accept you you'll grow even stronger and more wonderful. never forget that, never deny who you are
I am so sorry for all that you have had to go through and in the end all of this will make you stronger and now you can truly be your happy self the way you feel and the way you are.
As I was reading this I swear I had hand tremors from trying not to punch these parents ngl.
I know how you're feeling. I've definitely been in a very similar situation a long time ago and those very same events I've never forgotten. 10 years later on down the line with years hrt and many years of effort and dedication and I pass really well, I don't live in a dangerous environment anymore. I have so many friends willing to put others before themselves in this community. It did get easier and I hope that it does for you. The only advice I can really think of right now is to make things as easy as possible for yourself in future by having backup plans and backup plans for those backup plans because people who don't understand tend to find ways to hurt us / upend those plans sometimes without even meaning to.
For one, this is triggering, bot just ""possibly triggering"" seccond, why did you just like.. let your family take all of your stuff? From what i hear you are a grown woman in college so you shouldn't have any incentive to stay or to let them go through your private stuff on your phone or give your dad your discord password, third, IF YOUR DAD IS THREATENING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE!! Like what??
You are one of the strongest people, I wish I could hug you. *Hugs*
There is you and there is the *idea* of you. You are the former; your parents “loved” the latter.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this sweetie! I have difficult parents but nothing like this. Not even close. I just want to say how strong and brave you are little flower, and that while it is sad, you have a truly shining path ahead to realize your full potential as the beautiful woman you are. Much love from a fellow trans sister ❤️
Some people are horrible people. No one should have to experience what you just did. 

As I am also a parent, were one of my kids to leave me a letter… I would honestly feel bad for not making them feel safe to tell me in person. In person because I would want to hug them, tell them I loved them… right there,  right then. Let them know I would fight for them. 

Those people don’t deserve any more of your time. 

Small piece of advice just in case…

Take what you’ve written here. Add to it, add details, who was present what approximate time things happened… get and include case number from campus security. Get info for everyone you talked to. make sure you can tell the entire story. Because you may need to take legal action (saw that you were waiting for that ‘one more thing’ these people sound quite capable of continuing.
<hugs> ❤️
I'm sorry for your family of violent criminals. I hope they get what they deserve if you wish to report them and I'm sure your friends will be there to support you I stead of your family.
Don't feel sorry for leaving them, the things they've done to you could get you into jail in my country.
You are so brave and such a beautiful person. Sending you some 💕
As someone who also has unsupportive parents, and is going off to college in a year or so, this is heartbreaking to read. Scary, even. But seeing someone show so much bravery and stand up for herself in this way is so so powerful and im glad I took the time to read it. You are so strong, and I am sending you all the well wishes and good luck that I can. You're strong, beautiful, and we're all cheering you on!!
Welcome to your newfound freedom. I've been there before, and trust me: none of the upcoming challenges compare to the crippling weight of abusive parents. You'll be okay. You've got this.
Jesus Christ what a shit show. I'm 45 and horrified at this story. Life will be hard but way better than what they did to you. You are obviously a strong woman and many people including me couldn't have handled that as well as you did. Maybe one day they'll come around but it will be on your terms if you want to forgive them (you don't have to)you go girl!!! Also you should sue them for the trauma they caused
It’s been a pleasure getting to know you and watch you grow, and I’m so proud! - Max
You're a strong woman, you know that right? Not everyone could stand their ground like that in such a situation, yet you did, as you said life will be hard now, but finally you can start living it as yourself, much love!
Whew that sucks. But also, you sound like an absolute badass. I cannot imagine the strength it must have taken to go through all of this. That you still retain a positive outlook is amazing. Keep spinning, girl.

(Also, if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend seeing the Matrix).
I am very proud of you for standing up to yourself and basically everyone involved in helping you out! You all did great in such a stressful situation!
You're amazing. Always remember that the authentic you will always handle any situation better than the fake you they want you to be ever would.
Ngl, I think you should throw the book at them. This barbaric behavior needs to start hurting these people.
Yeah okay your family fucking sucks, I'm your new mom or dad or whatever the fuck you need lol you are an amazing human being and you are a valid trans person! Now go have a great rest of your day, you incredible young lassie and always know that this community (and I) will be here for you whenever you need!!
It does get brighter! I’m worse off financially, too, but I’ve been doing much better mentally/emotionally and it gets better! ❤️
You are going to do great. Keep that determination and remember most of the people you find and bring close will have your back more than family ever does. ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
wow... just wow. I'm so heartbroken for reading all of that. I want you to know that you have all of my support, love, affection and time if you want to talk anytime, even if you want a new friend. I'm not doing as bad as you but I too am planning to escape from home this september (that's when I will turn 18) and be myself, because at my place my parents think it's a phase and my mother is very strict about how I act when she's not looking.

I am really really REALLY sorry that you had to go through everything I've just read (and more things that you probably didn't write which I respect too) but I know deep inside it will be worth it, I know that you will be able to move forward and be who you aspire to be.

I just would love to hug you right now and to tell you that everything will be okay but as I think that we live quite far from each other I'll just send you this, hope for you to read it and say that I love you, that you're valid and that I'm sending a virtual hug.

Lots of love honey, take amazing care of yourself and stay strong, you're doing great and you will be happy. <3
You did so well! I’m very proud of you 💜👍
What a painful experience. Just wish I could hug you. I'm so sorry your family treated you to that abuse.
You are so incredibly strong and brave. I started reading this post and had to put it down several times before I could make it all the way through it. What you went through and what they did and said both infuriated me and made me incredibly sad all at once. I’m so sorry. I’m glad that you’re ok though. So your research like you said in response to one of the comments. Do your research and speak with lawyers or councilors, maybe even something like campus police. Find out exactly what your rights are and what they can/cannot do or force you to do. I’m not sure where you are located but I’m pretty sure if you’re 18 then they have no legal bearing over you at all. I’m not saying press charges or anything either, that’s something only you can decide on. I am saying though, to know your rights to protect yourself from them trying anything else. Please stay safe. I’m glad that you have a good supportive group of friends.
Wow thats alot sorry
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself, impressed with your resourcefulness and happy that you have friends who will support you.
You deserve all the best, and you have the patience of a saint for not getting angry with them.
I wish you the best of luck and happiness, going forward!
Well... I’m so sorry for you😭😭😭

You can be SUPER SUPER proud of yourself💜, for how you’re dealing with this difficult situation.

Hang in there, things will get better eventually...
Wow. I'm sorry girl. No one should have to deal with that kind of extremely transphobic parents. I thought my parents were acting really bad but here you're coming back from hell.

I understand very much about this kind of grief. After several months of arguing about me being trans, I decided to cut off with mine last week too. I will definitely miss them, especially the ones they were before I came out.

I'm 1000% with you.
I think the most frustrating parts of these stories for me is hearing all the abuse and then ending with “those rascals, I’m not gonna make them face repercussions for their actions but I’m not happy with what they’ve done”. Ik it’s family and all but people need to understand that things have consequences and legal ramifications, you can’t withhold someone’s medication from them legally and threatening someone with physically harm is a serious crime that shouldn’t be brushed off. I’m guilty of doing this as well with the whole “one more thing, that’ll be my breaking point” but then things calm down and the next thing doesn’t quite hit your breaking point so it slides and then accumulates and you end up with an abusive shit show. If my siblings wouldn’t be split up and sent to equally abusive “fathers” ide have my mother in prison for life with the amount of shit I have on her, so I understand there’s nuance but op if there isn’t anything truly stopping you, you should seek legal advice in one way or another or atleast get a restraining order
Damn I just have no word to describe this it just seems so out of this world for parents to act like this i know I shouldn't be saying that but and im sorry for what im about to say but ETF IS WRING WITH ARE THEY FUCKING INSANE ACTING LIKE FUCKING DRAMA QUEEN BITCH WTF . More seriously I hope your doing fine by yourself and now that you're free enjoy your oife and be yourself.
This is one of the only things that I read on the internet that actually gave me goosebumps and made me scared for op.
Omg.
You should not be missing that awful, awful family of yours! Such a horror show...

In fact, your ""parents"" should have been charged with prescription medication theft and child abuse!

Just want to wish you well, sweetie. You're a girl and that's what matters.
I know that they can. I've done a lot of research and stuff into what they could be charged with, and it's a fair amount.

I don't intend to do anything to them at the moment though, unless they force my hand. They could do that by trying to ruin my life more than they have by like suing me, or attempting to take the stuff in my room.

On a more lighthearted note, my friends and I had been talking about what they might be able to take from me if they tried, and I joke they may try to take my fridge they had gotten me.

The two things my Mom said she wanted were my phone and my fridge.

My fucking fridge. Not my $1000 laptop, or my Switch, or anything else I have.

My fridge.

It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh at it with my friends once it was over.
Thanks!

It hasn't been easy, but I have a lot of very good friends supporting me through this. I really owe it all to them.
Hey! I get that. I really didn't put myself out there for a very long time. My high school friend group is only there because I was friends with one guy since middle school, and then a friend of his came in, and then a friend or two of hers, etc.

I'd suggest seeing if your campus has a PRIDE club of some kind. You can get some great friends thereto are almost certain to accept you for yourself. It can be tough to put yourself out there as your authentic self though, and I get that. My first club meeting, I didn't even say my name, or talk to anyone.

But over time, you may begin to loosen up. Tell them your name, maybe even dress as yourself. The first time I went out in public as myself was with them, to a PRIDE event. It's exciting to be yourself, so, all I can say is to try. Go at your own pace of course, but don't let it go ignored.
Yeah, financial stuff is gonna be a bit hard. Luckily, someone in our group recently went through a tough time with parents, and he's supposedly done a bunch of research into financial aid and stuff, and is willing to help out.

I also intend to look into internships, or at least a job of some kind. While my living expenses for the semester are covered (housing by dorm, and food by meal plan) I still have to worry about paying for HRT and stuff.

Tuition is quite high for my college (50k-ish), though I currently have 2 main scholarships covering like 35k each semester as long as I keep a decent GPA. The rest is a bit of an issue, but I've been researching scholarships, and now especially intend to go into them.
That's possible, but remember what the cops have done in the US. I don't trust the police. A lawsuit is a better option...
They don't have a case to sue you with. They're textbook abusive, breaking several laws, and if you throw the book at them (or vice versa) you are going to win.
Are you a minor? Refuse. If you're a minor get emancipated. This is insane. Stop doing what they say, stop giving them passwords. Go change all your passwords right now. Stop giving them access to anything..just refuse. And do not go back. You need to get help through LGBT groups for young people. Their are groups that help out up to mid 20s.
Ah, yes, the most.... Actually, stealing your fridge would be a pain in the ass for you, I was going to make fun of it but honestly that would be one weird power move
Yeah time for new parents.
Don't sell yourself short - your friends are backing the strength they see in you.

This was a tough read, and you're in a tough situation. 

But you got this. Stay strong...
I'm lucky the college I go to has a PRIDE club...
Make sure you check prices against GoodRX and CostPlus Pharmacy if you're in the US (which is what I'm assuming) because they may help bring the cost of your HRT wayy down.
If you haven't already and you're in the US and 25 or under, talk to your school's financial aid department to start paperwork for financial independence. Just let them know you've been cut off. This will have them reassess your financial obligation and can result in a significant increase in financial aid.

Good luck. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
I know in my area they sheltered a trans masc from his family and friends who basically ganged up to kill him over nonsense. It's worth a shot
You're right.
In addition to this great advice…

You can call your HRT provider and ask if they are willing to move you to a more inexpensive option.  Most providers are acutely aware of the challenges that the cost of medications pose to patients, and they know a few tricks."	slqvog	trans	1208	0.99	2022-02-06 07:21:51
sometimes cis people ain't it	"\*a random girl complaining about creepy men or something about girl wear\*  
\*me continuing her complaints\*  
""welcome to being a girl""

do cis people think this is comforting? like, are they convinced a greeting to being a gender that ive always technically been is somehow a kindness, effectively shutting down my very real complaints. should i just start replying the same thing to people that do this?  


Edit: This was meant to be like a relatable one-off post but since it's gotten traction, I have to explain that I'm most certainly not misunderstanding, I'm not saying this in the most literal sense, and I'm not pushing a (and I quote) ""divide between trans and cis women""  


   This has been a continuing issue with the same handful of people, not every cis woman i know and not always in a demeaning way. My issue in the scenario here, that I didn't feel the need to explain in what was a one-off post, was that this was a repeated issue and when I brought up that I wasn't comfortable with these handful of people shutting down my very real complaints I got the very much personal equivalent of ""well you chose this life, deal with it""  


   And before people start telling me to ignore these people, I do, I very much try to, however due to my social situation and dynamic I HAVE to deal with them and these conversations."	"Also cis women also say this to cis girls growing up and having their first experiences in this direction.

It's generally a bullshit statement normalizing the suppression women are often facing from men
Why not ask them about their age and if they're younger ""I'm sorry I've been the girl for longer I should have welcomed you first"" if they're older ""So you had to go through this xy years more than me? You poor soul""
I don't think they're meaning to shut down your experiences or complaints. Whenever I've encountered it, it's always been said in solidarity, like ""yeah, this sucks, but we're in this together"".
NO SERIOUSLY

WE SHOULD NOT BE NORMALIZING CREEPY BEHAVIOR

WE SHOULD BE DE-NORMALIZING CREEPY BEHAVIOR

WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
I totally get you. This is totally a thing. It’s the same sort of tone as when you tell someone something bad happened to you and they’re like “yeah we’ve *all* been through that…” and give examples of how their pain is somehow worse -_- it’s always infuriating but especially when it comes down to your existence. I recommend learning a witty response you can use.
You didn't chose the woman life, the woman life chose you
Reminds me a lot when afab girls (least at the time) get their period and the mom goes ""You're becoming a woman now"". Like wait, hold on, is that supposed to be a good thing?? If this is womanhood then fuck go back
people completely missing the point in the comments 😔
It’s not literally welcoming you to the gender it’s more a reaction to you probably being surprised about some of this stuff. As a trans man who is transitioning a little bit late, I do have the urge to say this to trans woman sometimes. Woman have been complaining about creepy man harassing them since centuries and it feels a little bit frustrating how surprised some people are about it. I think you have heard about woman being harassed before you started transitioning and when you get surprised about it being *that* bad it just feels like you haven’t listened before it started happening to you. (Obviously I don’t know you personally this is just what generally happens). 
I personally think it’s easier to be a trans man than a trans woman, you now have to deal with not only being trans but also experience all the shit woman has to face (being terrified on the street at night etc.) 

Also before I came out I heard this a lot from older woman when I complained about stuff.
When I started Estrogen I began crying uncontrollably and the girls from my family said welcome to being a girl. This is something I admittedly haven't experienced pre-hrt. I have to say that I personally think your post comes across entitled, and this is exactly the kind of stuff that in general makes us drift further away from cis people. Instead of focusing on the fact that you've been a girl your entire life, you could focus on the fact that this person is actually acknowledging your gender. Also I'm not sure how she's shutting down your complaints. If anything she's agreeing with them, as she has experienced it too.   


Your title absolutely sucks too. Sorry. But srsly.
I don't think they say it with any malice, at least it doesn't sound like that to me. They're essentially saying ""welcome to the club"", basically saying ""I've dealt with this my whole life"".

It's the equivalent of the bo Burnham bit in the ''what's funny'' song: 

Humor is often linked to shared experience

Like, a guy gets up and says ""Have you noticed that public restrooms have really inefficient hand-dryers?""

Oh, my god! Yes, I have! Ha-ha-ha, really good point

They should fix that...

It's good to know that somebody

finally gets me
But this is something I’d say to a cis girl who is starting to experience hormones too, such as my baby sister when she got her period
So I don’t really think it’s personal, if anything they may be trying to treat you like they’d treat anyone else
I love when people use the defense ""cis women say it to cis women too""

Yeah, its dismissive then too. ""Welcome to my world/being a woman"" just comes off as kinda condescending and dismissive, even if you mean well.

Our society dismisses women's struggles, even when women are seeking solidarity from one another. 

Let's be real: is ""welcome to being *blank*"" something anyone wants to hear when they are distressed or even simply annoyed about something?
The last time a friend did this I half jokingly said I wonder how long it will be before the novelty of being welcomed ""to the world of women"" will wear off. She got the message.
I don’t think it’s meant to be comforting so much as it’s something afab people are told a lot growing up about everything ranging from hating bras to periods to SA and harassment, so I kinda get why they say it to trans women. It’s more meant to be a signifier they recognize you as a woman ie “welcome to the sisterhood, it sucks” than a genuine comfort. I do agree it’s tone deaf af though
The ""welcome to womanhood sweaty :)"" thing ALWAYS comes with an unspoken ""isn't this what you wanted when you *chose* to be a woman?"" It's transmisogynistic and regular misogynistic because it normalizes misogyny.
I respond to this with something like *""Welcome? I've been dealing with this shit for 20 years""*
Honestly I never thought of this like that but yeah it is kind of dismissive to the fight that people have… I’m sorry she kind of invalidated you like that… you are and always were a woman! 

I like to think she was trying to be inclusive but I could care less.
Cos women say this to other cis women as well. I think your making something out of nothing. We are used to the harassment from men, when we see someone complaining about it like its new, its just a reminder that its not and we all experience it.
Yup, shit like this is such a mood.
i don't think that :/ I'm sorry other cis people do though. idk if you'll just immediately block me because I'm cis, but if you need to rant about something I'm here to listen.
Apparently being like “why would anyone ENJOY being a girl and voluntarily stay that way for the rest of their life” is a Trans Thing but I genuinely cannot understand it. I look at cis girls and I’m like HOW are you okay with this. Blink twice if you need help
Gods I get this fucking constantly. It's not comforting to you, it's comforting to themselves that they have more girl points than us.
Tbh i always saw it as a validating thing ""you are a girl, this proves it""
sometimes I'm very sick of cis people. Literally had a couple approach me last night at a club and went from telling me how beautiful I am to misgendering me to trying to ask me to have a threesome with them within about 2 minutes.
I hear the ""welcome to the club/ welcome to being (insert title or something)"" phrase way too often and it bugs the hell out of me, but I realized why people did it. It's not so much for the person they're saying it to as it is for themselves, they say it as a form of self-validation and pride most of the time. Like ""yes, I know what you're going through and I am in fact better than you in that I've been doing it longer"", however they don't always mean it offensively. Though their intentions don't really make much of a difference considering we're not mind-readers and usually take it based on tone or our internal narrative
She is trying to shut down your sharing of your experiences because she thinks your experiences don't matter as much as yours. It's very gross and very common, not even just against trans people but in general
I’ve actually had this exact problem but here s the kicker the person saying it to me is my fucking wife and it just makes me so mad but I don’t know what to do or say to that what should I do
That's true that it a sucky thing to say, but it's also just a thing older woman say to younger afab girls that start going through puberty. I think it's meant to be endearing as if you where a maternal figure to the transgirl. But it just comes across as condescending because it implies that that transgirl is just now becoming a girl and not that she always was a girl.
This is the answer. I’ve been welcomed to so many things I’m already part of in life, and it’s not someone saying to me “you’re an outsider” it’s “I’m perpetuating the normalcy of this culture”.
You really can't compare this to similar comments given to young cis girls.

First of all, the context is entirely different. Cis girls might get this response from an *older woman* if they complain about misogyny. On the other hand, grown women complain to one another about misogyny *all the time*. If we join in commiserating with *peers* (or even sometimes younger women) and we're told ""welcome to being a woman"", it's othering and degrading in a way that doesn't apply when this is told to a younger cis woman.

Second, trans women will get comments like this even after we've been living full time for *years*. I've heard stories of trans women being told ""welcome to being a woman"" by younger girls who weren't even born when they started transitioning. In this case, there's sometimes an implication of ""stop complaining, you chose this"", which is pure transmisogyny.

Third, it assumes that we lived and experienced the world as cis men before transitioning, which is very often not the case. This ties in with the ""male socialization"" that's often used to imply that we had ""cis male privilege"" for so long, we have to be subordinate to cis women and accept poor treatment to repay our ""debt"" (pro tip: you will never be able to ""repay""). This is also transmisogyny.

TLDR: telling a trans woman ""welcome to being a woman"" is *not* comparable to saying the same thing to a young cis girl, it's generally transmisogyny disguised as solidarity, and it is not acceptable.
Yeah, I don't know why people don't realize ""welcome to *blank*"" is just kinda shitty and dismissive to begin with. How does that express solidarity or help the person?
THIS!! God this was one of the worst things about being raised female for half my life.
*write that down, write that down!*
if they said ""yeah this sucks, but we're in this together"" it would be solidarity perhaps but since they just say ""welcome to being a girl"" it really isnt
im putting this on my wall
*thank you!*   
the point is just going over peoples heads T\^T
I mean you said it yourself by saying you heard this from older women before, it isn't really about being surprised by anything (especially when she was joining in on the complaining).

Here's one easy lesson to learn from anyone who listens to people professionally: when people lament they don't want you to relate, they don't want your solutions they just want you to acknowledge their suffering. It sounds stupid but the best thing you can do is say something to the effect of ""that sounds horrible, i am sorry you are in this situation right now"". If its really bad offer them a hug on top of that.
It really makes people feel heard when you do that and it really isn't that hard to do.
i'm not going to CP what i wrote, but i urge you to read the rest of your thread.
you took my words WAY to literally
I already start crying uncontrollably sometimes.

Estrogen is gonna kick my ass isnt it?
Absolutely. 
I get why it feels different when a cis person is saying it to a trans person though. I agree it’s usually said in a dismissive way but I think it’s often meant as, “yeah, I can relate.”

But also this happens with any complaint. It’s basically saying welcome to the club, deal with it. It’s annoying. People just suck at empathy, cis or not
The only comment that was exactly what I was thinking. Sometimes I feel people really focus too much on everything having some micro aggressive undertone or malicious intent.
Nah

It's usually said in a derisive, condescending way

Fuck that
Many people use womanhood as a shared collective experience that every woman passing person experiences, whether you’re trans or cis. I know trans masc people who relate to the experiences of “womanhood” while not being women because they’ve gone thru stuff like harassment, pay gap, not being taken seriously, etc etc. 

When I started to present as a woman, i started experiencing stuff that i hadn’t ever before. does that mean i wasn’t a woman? no. does that mean i didn’t fully experience the concept of womanhood that is based a commonly shared experience? i would say so. 

also instead of getting mad at your friend, just try to explain why you don’t like what they’re saying and how it makes you feel. if we just keep saying “oh the cis people” that pushes our allies away. and we can’t have trans freedom without the support from our cis allies. 

at the end of the day we are all humans and should treat each other with a little humility and respect, if that means taking a step back and communicating your boundaries, that’s important. because unfortunately as a minority group and with trans**pbia, there are people who assume that all trans ppl act the way one person acts. yes i’ve encountered that. so pretend when u talk about being trans, unless u specify that these are only ur opinions, that person may think ur talking about all trans ppl. just my two cents

edit: this is directed at OP but i put it as a reply because i agree w the top comment
I think it’s the implication of exactly that. 
“I’ve dealt with this all my life.” 
It may be true that this person may or may not have experienced it for longer than the trans person, but that doesn’t really matter. 
It’s othering, and gives the connotation that the trans woman is ‘new to the club’ and essentially implies that they’re not really seen as having been a woman prior to coming out. 
It’s 100% a micro-aggression, whether the other person intends it to be or not. 
Intent is not greater than impact. 💛
Exactly, but it still sucks tho. Its something cis girls use to normalize all the shit we have to go though just because were girls. Its not personal at all, its just something weve heard from other women our entire life, so we say the same to the other girls without thinking about it. We just need to stop this bullshit.
I didn't want to defend the statement in that way.
I wanted to defend the person saying it, without thinking about it, because it has been normalized among women to say this.

It is a horrible statement no matter what.
It's validating the first 5 times. It's lost the novelty by the 50th and feels presumptuous to say after a while.
i am 100% not, and i would very much appreciate if this comment section would stop acting like this is okay behavior
i often find when people say this phrase, they either do it almost on impulse because apparently thats what older cis women say to younger woman (which is also very not okay and still dismissive) or its them saying *""yeah, i've been dealing with this for a while and figured out how to cope and deal with it. i wont be at all helping or sharing this info with you though because i have this outlandish idea that because you're older in age you know the things i did at that age but i also think you are a younger woman when compared to me""* or something like that
personally, regardless of the person i say exactly this ""hey, i doubt you meant that in a mean way, its just kinda belittling to me and i would appreciate if you didn't use that terminology towards me""  
but im not married or even a legal adult so take that with a pinch of salt
please 👏 read 👏 the 👏 full 👏 post 👏 before 👏 giving 👏 your 👏 thoughts
I have nothing really to add other than thanks for that comment as it hit on what I was feeling but was struggling to get the right words to it.
I really want to reply to this. I agree with almost all your points except one. The “You're a woman now deal with it” statement is quite normal and not just a thing that only applies to older women talking to younger cis women. I have an issue with the fact of how you insinuated like it's only a one-time thing cis women are told when it comes to talking about misogyny. No. 

As a person who grew up being told I was a cis woman and seen as one (I'm intersex). I've dealt with that statement in situations beyond that. Maybe it's because I'm a black poc. But I've seen other afab people be told that statement in areas that go outside of that box you laid out. A distinct situation I remember is when I got my menstrual cycle (I have both parts so I still have a cycle) and I was crying. I guess I was crying too loud in the bathroom and a teacher walked it and frustratedly asked me what my problem was. I explained I had my cycle and I was suffering from the pain even after taking pain meds. She looked at me like I was stupid and just told me “you're a woman just deal with it” then walked off kind of snickering. Another situation I remember distinctly was other girls telling me how I should try to look more feminine and act more feminine. When I did I got hit on by a teacher. I told my friend and she said “that's being a woman”. One of the few red flags that led to me ending the friendship. 

You may think cis women/afabs don't have to hear it in a condescending way as trans women, but we do it's just in a different perspective. They see it from us as “stepping out of our place” and see it from y'all as (excuse me for this) “a boy wanting to be a girl” it's still misogyny but it's just different in ways of again as you said how they think you've grown up. It's just all misogyny and internalized misogyny. It's just a lot.
""Welcome to... the Black Parade""

But yeah, for real, this phrase is ass.
Generally ""Welcome to being a girl"" is said among cis girls/women as well. I don't think cis girls think too much about how it can hit a trans girl wrong.

Examples: girl gets her cramps the first time and another girl who had them for years ""welcome to being a girl""
Girl gets whistled after by a creepy old man ""welcome to being a girl""
Etc.

It's a statement that basically says ""it can suck to be a girl but you'll have to deal with it growing up""

And you know what? No matter of cis or trans girl:
That statement is wrong!

Old guy whistles after you? Don't deal with it! Call him out on acting like a pervert!
""Girl clothes"" that serve the misogynistic idea of ""beauty knows no pain"" throw them out and wear comfortable clothes! You don't need to suffer to follow the beauty standards!

If the example of cramps hurt anyone, I'd like to add:
Wether having physical pain of cramps or having the mental pain of no cramps, no one is entitled to decide for you wether it ""isn't that bad"" or ""you don't even want that"" (I mean as AFAB I really can't imagine how anyone could want that but I respect it and won't invalidate your feelings concerning that)!
Oh don't get me wrong, I think they're saying it terribly. I'm just saying, I reckon they don't mean it like that.
yeahhh they don't really acknowledge our feelings lol
I'm not trans so I can't really relate to your experiencrs and feelings but when someone complains about things that I can heavily relate to one of my go to phrases is ""Welcome to my world"". It's always in a spirit of solidarity, like, I know this sucks but you are not alone in it and I know how you feel
Exactly this. I have lost the count of how many times cis girls said to me when I was complaining about things like dudes sending unsolicited pics of their penises on social networks or being cat-called on the street.
i guess it shows how normalised this is though. that people defend it and continue to perpetuate it.
How so?
Maybe, maybe not.  Hits everyone different.
I'm just shy of a year in and while I certainly feel emotional more often (both positively and negatively), I have yet to be able to have a proper cry.
YMMV. Personally, I'd describe it as before I ramped up to crying, and could for the most part hold in the tears. Now it's more like an instant trigger that just hits me like a thunderstrike.
I was a bit teary for a couple weeks starting, then again at my first dose increase. Mostly I gained the experience of being overwhelmed by joy.

Progesterone, on the other hand…

Personally I feel a lot more intensely now, but on average my mood is better and I experience the intensity as being alive.
I already cry a lot :(
Seconded. I understand that it can be used condescendingly, but frankly, the experience of growing up as a woman just about anywhere is such an exhausting and often traumatic experience. As someone who discovered their gender late, I hope for guidance but also fully expect to sort of have to ""earn my place"" a bit. It's kinda like when a new coworker complains about the codebase: ""welcome to the company!"" It's understanding, commiseration, not derision. That being said, these sorts of comments should definitely be followed with helpful conversation.
I'm sorry you've had to deal with it being said derisively or condescendingly. I've never had it said like that to me.
Derisive, condescending way targeted at the way the female role in society is messed up sometimes?
I realize trans women don't like it, I just think maybe we should be a little bit less agressive towards everyone who is ignorant. Most people have no idea what dysphoria feels like, how it works, how it affects our daily life. 

>It’s othering, and gives the connotation that the trans woman is ‘new to the club’ and essentially implies that they’re not really seen as having been a woman prior to coming out.

I understand that, but idk personally I don't feel like that. I don't really consider my egg self to have been a woman. Wether or not my brain was is a different thing, but I don't really fit the ""I always knew something was wrong"" stereotype. I always had dysphoria that I thought was normal, but I never ""knew"". I wouldn't be hurt by a cis woman telling me ""welcome to the club"", because even if I believed in the ""I've always been a woman"" idea, I am new to the experience of being treated, and living my life as one.

I get that everyone's experience is different, and of course anyone who is hurt by that is valid and should be respected. Unless someone is openly transphobic, I just think maybe we should be a *little* less quick to assume they're saying it out of malice.
Oh I see what you’re saying about how we shouldn’t normalize everything because it’s not always normal, which is a good point
You know what else is annoying? When people start presenting as a woman and then realize how much harassment women get. How are you so unaware? 

Im just saying its not worth going into a spiral over that comment because it's said in passing all the time, its meant to be a ""we know and understand"" not a belittling thing.
As far as I can see, that's not what people are saying. ""Cis women do this to other cis women too"" being said in the comments here doesn't mean it's okay, it means it isn't meant in a transphobic way. There's a difference. The issue is about internalized misogyny,  not about transphobia. I feel like the fact that women with internalized misogyny (and/or don't want to hear your feelings and are just complaining) say that to other cis women completely negates the idea that it'd being said to you out of transphobia. It's literally the way cis people interact among themselves. That doesn't mean it's not a shitty way to interact.
I appreciate the mature response thank you
G note
WHEN I WAS
You're right, they don't. OP is most likely misunderstanding someone's good intentions.
When it's said by cis women to trans women, it's often an indirect way of invalidating them, as if the person saying it has ""been a girl longer"" and that the transwoman is question ""just got here"". 

Regardless of when that transwoman transitioned, the truth is way more complicated than that. 

I lived as a woman for 35 years before transitioning to male, I experienced a lot - misogyny, catcalling, sexual harrassment, I could go on - but I would never say ""welcome to being a girl"" even though I know very well what it's like. I might say ""Oh god, tell me about it"" or ""I'm so sorry you had that happen to you too"".

There probably IS a way to say that phrase and not have it come off as invalidating, but every time I've heard it said, it's come off as more of a slap in the face.
That sucks and it shouldn't be your ""go to phrase"". If you said that to me I would not think that it is the spirit of solidarity, I would think that you are minimizing my struggles and also making my struggles all about yourself.
originally when i replied i hadn't read all of this comment, only ""It’s not literally welcoming you to the gender it’s more a reaction to you probably being surprised about some of this stuff.""  
but now that i read it all the way through i realized this person is purely using his comment as a boast and a brag rather than any contribution. to elaborate further so there is no confusion about this.  


""a reaction to you probably being surprised about some of this stuff"" no, this is blatantly wrong and ignoring the fact that i was CONTINUING what these people would be talking about.  


""it feels a little bit frustrating how surprised some people are about it"" acting as if i didnt hear about it all the time and again ignoring my previous statement  


""it just feels like you haven’t listened before it started happening to you."" this whole thing is ignoring that i was continuing an ongoing conversation. and this specific bit just express's that this commenter has no clue what the issue is, essentially saying 'if you had even cared and not been so selfish you wouldve already known' which i did know, i dealt with it before even transitioning and it got worse after, its not like i brushed it aside before transitioning and acting as if i was is just a horrible stat of mind.  


"" I personally think it’s easier to be a trans man than a trans woman"" ah this age old comment. usually i hear this being argued AGAINT by transmasc but this just makes me think this is either a troll or someone who couldnt give a rats ass about the actual experience.  


this commenter so obviously disregards anything i had actually said and goes on to explain either irrelevancies, completely wrong assumptions, stupid rationalizations, and absolute disrespect to ANY trans person.  
FYI, just because cis people say it to cis people does NOT mean its okay.
indeed. contrast with me, who just recently sobbed uncontrollably to a show for like half of the episodes (Angel Beats!, for those wondering). for a while I didn't notice anything different and then all of a sudden I'd get hit like a truck by emotions a a a 😅
>Personally I feel a lot more intensely now, but on average my mood is better and I experience the intensity as being alive.

How much of that do you think is hormone-based, and how much would you attribute to the euphoria of being seen as *you*?

I know there are studies on differences in range and amplitude of emotions by gender. Just curious as to your take on what's due to what
And that’s totally fair and valid. Your experiences with gender, your expression, and the interactions you have with others are not in any way less important. 

I think the point OP and also myself are trying to make, is that to a lot of trans people, it does feel invalidating, othering, and trans-misogynistic. 
I don’t think OP was trying to start a debate on whether or not their feelings of being invalidated were legitimate or not, and telling other trans people their feelings of hurt by what a cis person said to them isn’t as bad as they say, based off of how you personally feel, is not very kind.
I think you're projecting a lot here. Your comment has very little to do with what I actually communicated. Have a nice day.
do you read as a one-time hobby or not at all?
i'm not, this has happened several times and when i say its demeaning i get the equivalent of ""you chose this life"" but more personally attributed
That's what I meant by saying that I can't relate. I supposed there was something deeper to the phrase.
I agree with you that here the phrase was not a good way to go and that OP would surely have preferred kind of an open door to a comment that can be more applicable in a sarcastic way of venting about work.

I also want to think there is a way to make it not sound invalidating but I guess you are right and there is a time, a place and a way for it and that wasn't it
Although I can understand why you would take it that way, I would not say it to you out of the blue. I use it with people I know and who know me ; and I have to say that the delivery makes a lot in terms of how it's percived. And ofc if despite of that you still took it as me minimizing your struggles instead of an attempt to share a load we both bear, I would explain that to you and apologize
It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and angry because your core needs of being understood and empathized with aren't being met, is that right?

 I should've clarified, what I meant to ask is, how did the commenter take the words too literally?
Early mood changes were nearly immediate—onset within a few days. Could still be related to actually starting to transition giving me hope for my future—I’m not sure how I’d separate that. But mental changes hit hard and fast.

It took me a while to convince myself to leave boymode—I did that around the time strangers started gendering me correctly consistently (or not gendering me at all—plausible deniability, suckers!). It took around a year again between that and actually seeing myself in the mirror mostly reliably.

Being seen as me was a huge confidence boost. Seeing myself as me I’m still processing—it’s a miracle I never thought I’d see! But I can’t deny my life started to change for the better a while before cis people in my life noticed anything physically they couldn’t attribute to weight loss and shaving.
>I don’t think OP was trying to start a debate on whether or not their feelings of being invalidated were legitimate or not,

Not what I was doing either. As I said, even if I don't feel that way, people who do should be respected and not treated like that. What I was trying to say is: don't immediately assume someone is trying to intentionally hurt you. That's all
Going to insults when you don't like someone's opinion of something is childish.
Yeah no, I feel you man. There are totally ways that the phrase can be said empathically, its just unfortunate that most of the time it's not.
i am not even going to touch on why i dislike that first part but otherwise, i got that, and i quickly realized he didnt take my post literally, he did the opposite and misconstrued my original message to a point of explaining that 'i dont get it, i didnt care until it affected me' and that really angers me to know someone would even think to say that.
it was a question
Ah, I see, so you believe he’s intentionally changing the meaning of your post in a negative way, rather than a misunderstanding?
Lmao no it wasn't"	wcmqsg	trans	1199	0.93	2022-07-31 11:39:56
I fell for a trans guy help	"I (male 18) met him(trans female to male 19) at the intoduction week at my uni, and i fell for him and he is so cute and I dont know how to tell him, and now I'm questioning my own sexuality. And I dont know what now.

The story:
So we went on a date and it was one of the best nights I have ever had. We talked so much about stuf we are both really into. We had some burgers and some drinks and after that we just walked around the city. We had such a great time. And eventually we were talking about relationships and he mentioned that he wasn't really looking for someone right now but if anyone interesting were to land on his path that he would date. 

An hour or so after that after we talked about the heavy side of the surgical and hormonal transition he was planning.

And an hour or 2 after that I heavily hinted that I was into him and he explained that he really liked me but wasn't really ready for a relationship at that time, mostly because he wanted to wait for the hormonal therapy to take effect (he is starting in a month or 4 to 6).

He did say that he wanted to have a lot more of these kinds of nights with me and we plan on having another meeting/date/idk what this evening was, very soon

Even tho I got kind of friend zoned I feel realy good. I completely understand and agree with his decision.

I got myself a great new friend today with whom I can discuss anything. And that kind of makes up for the disappointment. 

Thank you all for your kind words, and even tho I myself am not trans you welcomed me, encouraged me and helped me decide what is best, thank you reddit and the kind people here.

Thanks for helping me find my way in my own emotions"	"Just ask him out and don’t worry about anything else!! Hell either be interested or he won’t. You can’t do anything about that, just like you can’t do anything about who you’re attracted to in the first place. No one can figure out what your sexuality is but you, but also keep in mind your experiences and your feelings are more important than any label you choose. Good luck 💜
Sexuality can change, and there’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of regarding your attraction to him. You might , having explored this side of yourself , conclude that you’re bisexual, or even gay since you’re both men. It doesn’t matter that he is a trans man; how would you proceed into a potential relationship with any other person?
I've always found it strange when people question their sexuality like this. It's like saying, ""but what if it turns out I like playing soccer?"" Great, then you get to have fun playing soccer! And hopefully you can get to have fun with this person!

Like, I know stress about this sort of thing comes from being absorbed in toxic masculinity to the point where you are uncomfortable at the idea of being gay, and anxiety at the idea of being perceived as gay, but it's important to realise that these feelings are coming from outside of you. They're not you, or at least they don't have to be you.

It's also worth making sure that you dont really, subconsciously see this person as their assumed birth gender. If you do, you're not really seeing this person, but a false idea of this person.
Tell him! And have fun... ❤️
Don't get hung up on labels. Whatever label you've chosen for your sexuality, it's just a word that can never fully describe your rich inner life. You're attracted to this person, so ask them out.
There is only one sexuality, and it's called ""you're into whoever you're into.""

Go get him tiger :)
[removed]
Ask him out my guy! If you don't have the courage to then hang with him and get to know him.
I see you're going on a date tonight -- good luck!
Just for good measure, if you do turn out to be into guys too, us bisexuals will happily adopt you into our midst ^ - ^
This is so damn cute
Ah, young love..
what i do is ""hey, your hot, bye"" don't use that, it doesn't *usually* work
This is so gay and I love it 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
Just go with it~
Go with your gut feeling better explore and know for sure 👍👍👍
This post is adorable! It warms my heart. I hope you two have a great time :)
Love is Love-- if you 'click' together on a level beyond mere appearance, gender, original equipment...that's the basis for a long term relationship, *especially through transition and all the challenges of life.*
this happened to me too, im a girl now
Well, if ya like him ya like him. Uni is a place for not only education but for self-discovery and building friendships and relationships. I came into college cis and now I’m a girl so hey, welcome to Uni.
Take the leap and ask him out. Trust me sometimes people don’t know they’re being hit on. Me and my irl friend (both ftm) we’re being hit on by two girls at a water park and we didn’t even know it till afterwards. Good luck.
Just be yourself, don't worry about what people think. The bad ones will leave the good ones will stay ❤
Don't worry about what label you give your sexuality, it does not define you or your relationships. After coming out as transgender people started applying different labels to my relationships based on how I now present my gender, even though the people I love or am attracted to have not changed.
Proud of you! The most important answer to any question is love. And there is no shame in how you feel.
Sexuality is just a label love who you love and be happy that’s the no1 goal
Go for it.  This is your chance to be happy . What the hell.
This just warms my heart. Good luck tonight! 💖💖
Follow your heart. The parts will sort themselves out.
You should ask him out. I read some of the comments. I hope the dinner went well. You should so do an update on this post
i hope everything goes well dude! best of luck
go with it, really, why not?
Poggers, I'm dating a trans guy too, we've been going strong a few years at this point.  Good luck on your dinner date, I hope it goes well
!remindme 2 days
You don't have to lable, hope he likes you back tho!
Don't be afraid to ask him out! You can do this!
!remindme 2 days
Trans men best men!
whenever i read such post i instantly become a traditional balkan granny and say the exact same lines in greek my grandma says. i wish you luck and the best.
awww dude!! i see ur goin on a date, just go for it and be yourself. you got this! everything is going to end up fine and regardless of what your sexuality is you’re still you and that’s what matters. good luck!! <3
!remindme 2 days
Awe this is so cute ! I saw you asked him out and I hope you guys have a great time 💜
This is so cute to me. I just hate when people get all caught-up in this notion of ""sexuality"". If you think someone is cute, and you think it'll work out, then go for it. It doesn't matter what you label yourself as, or what other people label you as. Just go for what makes you happy
Forget about sexuality, for get gender, GOD FOR IT!!!
Assuming you've only been attracted to women before, you might be bi or pan and just not have known it before.

If you two hit it off well, that's awesome! Date him if you both want it then! But just remember that as you say here, he wants to medically and surgically transition. If you're not comfortable with that, either work on yourself, or don't go with him. The worst thing you can do to a trans person is to guilt them into not transitioning when that's what they need for their own wellbeing.

Remember that when trans men go on hormones, they can get really masculine traits. Testosterone is a very strong hormone and trans men much more often ""pass"" than trans women because of that. So ye, if you can't see yourself dating him after he starts his transition, you should probably stick to just a deep friendship :)

But if you see yourself dating him even after he has transitioned, then all the power to ya, and I hope you two will hit it off <3
Sexuality is not solid. I myself have been through the waves a lot,  and although I'm aro currently,  I know there's always potential.
I’m gonna tell it like this:

This doesn’t make you gay. Hell, this doesn’t make you *anything.* You shouldn’t worry about labels because if you do, you’ll just get wrapped up in trying to apply this, or make sure about that, or worry over something else…

Just toss it all out of your head. All that matters is, you found someone that you like. That’s it. Done. 

As someone explained to me when I was experiencing and questioning similar: Hot is Hot. Who cares about the rest? If you’re attracted to them, that’s it! That’s all that matters. So go out there and do your thing, and don’t worry about the labels. 

For what’s it’s worth, I hope things work out. ✨
Don't worry about labels. Labels are never wholly accurate anyway and often used by people to put them in little boxes. Screw that!. Save yourself any anxiety and energy worrying  about whether you are gay, straight, bi, pan, demi, etc. Just be you. You are attracted to this individual, cool.
congrats on your date be sure to share how it went :)
That’s gay ngl
To be fair this doesn’t mean that you are lesbian, it just means that you are in love with a guy, don’t be scared of people judging you
We don’t choose who we are attracted to. Don’t make a big thing of it, especially to him. In my experience, it’s difficult to put anybody in a “homosexual” or “heterosexual” box. 

Tell him you like him, good luck!
I just did and we are having dinner tonight. I'm shaking ty so much
!remindme 2 days
I would tell them and see where it goes. Hope for the best
Thank you for you reply, especially the second part. But what do you mean with the third part (sorry English isn't my first language)
I mean if you've lived your life one way the entire time and things suddenly change it can be a lot.
I dont know how, I'm really bad at this sort of thing
I just did fot this evening. I'm so excited
I have been attracted to women my whole life until a few moths ago I felt something for a friend of mine and now this so I kind of don't know it anymore but someone up above gave me the recommendation to ditch the labels and dat whoever I like, so I think il stick to that
Came here you say this.
I'm going out with him tonight I just dont know if I can tell him
Thank you, I'm really excited
Haha im the guy OP talked about and that’s basically what he did

worked out in the end tho
Thank you for the encouragement, this is a really welcoming community
I did feel that click
I’m not OP, but i’ll give an update as the post is about me. It went well and he (OP) is the absolute sweetest. It took me a bit of time but we’re currently dating
!remindme 2 day
I'm not uncomfortable with it at all. I already see him as a guy who has boobs when he can't wear his binder. And an our conversations I learned how Incedably important this transition is for him so I wouldn't even dare to disrupt that. Its just that he is really unsure of starting a relationship when his hormonal therapy starts just in a couple of months. And he is afraid that could change things. 
But we do have 2 more dates planned so il see where the ship lands.
I edited the original post
Why would op be lesbian? They're male.
Be sure to come back and tell us how it goes!
I hope you two have a great time!!
AWWW THATS SO CUTE!

Just remember, He's a guy. Bro guy stuff is what he's probably into.

You can always ask too.
Good luck!
Awesome! Hope it goes well for you!
I hope dinner goes well! Wishing you the best dude
That’s so cute
Pretty sure what they mean with the third part is that if you see him as a woman (conciously or subconciously) you’re not really attracted to who he really is.
How about, 'hi there, I think you are really cute, how would you feel about a date?'
Let me know how you make out  good luck
Just work towards being good friends now.  Good life partners are **friends first,** comrades or cohorts in arms in life's challenges second, sexual partners third or lower. 

Be upfront and honest, and honor their needs and requests as they should hopefully do the same.
Congrats. That’s awesome. 👍

The story:
So we went on a date and it was one of the best nights I have ever had. We talked so much about stuf we are both really into. We had some burgers and some drinks and after that we just walked around the city. We had such a great time. And eventually we were talking about relationships and he mentioned that he wasn't really looking for someone right now but if anyone interesting were to land on his path that he would date. 

An hour or so after that after we talked about the heavy side of the surgical and hormonal transition he was planning.

And an hour or 2 after that I heavily hinted that I was into him and he explained that he really liked me but wasn't really ready for a relationship at that time, mostly because he wanted to wait for the hormonal therapy to take effect (he is starting in a month or 4 to 6).

He did say that he wanted to have a lot more of these kinds of nights with me and we plan on having another meeting/date/idk what this evening was, very soon

Even tho I got kind of friend zoned I feel realy good. I completely understand and agree with his decision.

I got myself a great new friend today with whom I can discuss anything. And that kind of makes up for the disappointment. 

Thank you all for your kind words, and even tho I myself am not trans you welcomed me, encouraged me and helped me decide what is best, thank you reddit and the kind people here.

Thanks for helping me find my way in my own emotions
For real. Very exciting.
Oh now I get it, I do see him as a guy. Thank you for the clarification
We kind of are friends now and I asked him if he wanted to have dinner tonight and he said yes so.... il see what happens
I think you could have worded it better lol
Thank you
I really hope so he is the best, kindest and most understanding person I have ever met. And I could see myself spending the rest of my life with someone like that, doesn't matter what gender
Someday is here, I’m currently OP’s boyfriend haha

I came out to my stepmom???	"I'm still really kinda confused on how she picked up on the situation so fast but let me explain what happened.

I went over to my dad's place was chilling with my little sisters and dying eggs for easter. I decided I was gonna hit at me being trans so I made a trans flag easter egg and a lgbt flag egg too. 

What I didn't know is my stepmom knows a lot about the lgbt community and instantly asked me if it was the trans flag. So I said yeah I was lowkey panicking cuz I didn't expect her to recognize it. 

Fast foward three or four days ahead now and she asked to talk to me one on one. ""I don't want to assume anything but if you want to tell me something you can."" So I asked her to say what was her guess and it was straight up you're trans or you're gay. I responded with both and then she was really supportive and kind. Every single other time I told someone I broke down in tears even to my closest friends, but this time I smiled the whole time. This world needs more people like my stepmom."	"Deadly,that is what you need supportive ppl in your life,well done
Congratulations she sounds quite supportive
Can your stepmom be my stepmom too? She sounds very nice
My heart is so warm :3 Thank you for sharing, darling 💖
I’m so happy for you right now I can’t even describe it. It can be life-saving to have someone to talk freely to, even if it’s just one person, so I’m excited and glad for you and there should be more people like your stepmom, she sounds awesome
💜♥️💜
Okay, who’s cutting onions?
I'm happy for you... You are really lucky to have such a person in your life.
I wish mine was like this your lucky the world needs more people like your step mum
Well that's amazing and incredibly wholesome <3
Your stepmother sounds hella amazing. Congratulations for coming out 😃
thats so epic
That is amazing!!
Your stepmom is amazing! Make sure you don't loose her, as she is now *trans*parent.
YoooOOOOo can she be my step mom?? she sounds so supportive I already love her!
I'm happy she accepted u :D
Never underestimate the mindset of a loving older person.
Congratulations! <3
Welp you may not have cried, but I'm crying.
I love this! New stepmom goals for me.
Everyone has one person or companion that is there for you.  You may not have them forever but the time you have is great.  I’m glad you have someone like that have a great life.
🥺🥺 that's so sweet, a bait and switch with love! 💞 I'm so happy your mom is jumping to be a pillar of support for you babygirl, it doesn't sound like baby steps but a *leap* in the right direction 😎
That’s amazing!! Glad you have someone like that in your life :)
This is so beautiful🥰 I feel so lit up hearing about this experience. Thank you for your share and congrats on speaking your truth🏳️‍🌈💙💗🤍🏳️‍🌈
That sounds so sweet, I'm so happy that you have someone like her💖💖
That is amazing. Also being gay and trans is valid, you’re often expected to be one or the other but you’re valid :)
That's awesome I'm glad your Stepmom is so cool.
Let her know she made a lot of people smile today , Thank you for that heart warming post .
PSA: Your parents aren't always oblivious 🖤 sometimes they're amazing
Thank you, you're the reason I smiled today :)
Thank you so much <3 
She really is.
She's so nice, she does more for me than my own parents....
Unrelated but yooo same flair!!
Thank youuuu. 
I'm crying from happiness cuz u said darling. T-T
She's a great support for me now, thank you for the kind words. <3
Ik I am, I wish everyone could have someone like her. :)
Aww, I hope even if your step mom isn't a great support you have someone to talk too, and hey maybe she will get more supportive over time. <3
Thank you, it's so nice getting support from her and others now. :) <3
Omg that's actually amazing. Thanks for the laugh :)
Excellent comment.
I wish I could give everyone a step mom like her. She's the best.
Thank you :)
I'm sorry T-T <3
Awww, I love you <3
I'm so glad that I have her support now. I was honestly getting tired of trying opening up to people for support. I really hope everyone else can have a great support like my step mom.
Thank you so much, yeah ig she is leaping lol.
Thank you so much <3
Thank you <3
It's amazing I have support from her, and from amazing people like you.
Thank you so much for the kind words. They mean a lot. <3
She really is, thanks. :)
I will when I see her next, she'll probably be so happy I even shared this story. <3
I mean it was just suprising to me, I don't live with her, and that was like my fourth day seeing her again after almost 3 years. I wasn't out to myself back then either so when the first thing I hinted at made her recognize I was scared but now I'm happy and feel so much love from her.
Then they aren’t your parents, if they treat you bad then they aren’t parents. They’re just biological family, and you don’t have to love your family.
Anytime darling! Trans girls need more petnames in their lives :3
Maybe
It definitely goes a long way. I am very happy for you.
Don't be, it is great to read that people have a more accepting or good experience. It is what I want for everyone and a beautiful thing to see.
Happy for you :)
No need to thank me. Thank you for sharing your happy story with us all it really brightens my day to read stories like yours.
Damn that's so true lmao, she's legit the only parent who I say ""I love you"" to.
How tf do I upvote a message twice, I want to give u a hug.

[especially cute girls! :3]"	mm4zc8	trans	1154	0.99	2021-04-07 15:43:50
I’m starting to realize the outcome of me being trans	"I’m 17 (MtF she/her) and realized I was trans 2 years ago and came out to my parents about it a year ago. They were extremely resistant about the idea but thankfully my mom came around and generally accepts me. My dad on the other hand is a closed book to the fullest. I don’t want to explain more than I have to but he is extremely transphobic and homophobic towards me as a result. 

I talked to them a bit about wanting to medically transition and while my mom was open to the idea my dad was furious. They both got into a heated discussion about it and eventually they decided to decline me the care I needed. My mom just abandoned me there for my dad because she felt it was the right thing to do for the general good of the family. I understand her sentiment but I just feel so betrayed because of it. 

Everyday I resent them more and more for how they treat me from not using my name, misgendering, and turning blind eyes to every scenario possible. I’m almost 18 and about to set out on my own but as I’m starting to get my stuff together I realize more and more that why I’m doing and what I need to do is something that they would never approve of. I seek my independence from their unforgiving behavior and am starting to realize the consequences it will create. They always yapped to me about family and doing what’s right but from what I seen of them they only look out for themselves. 

Now that I’m looking out for myself and my identity they are becoming increasingly more hostile towards my abandonment of their beliefs and I know it. They wish for nothing but what they want but I won’t let it happen. I deserve to create agency for my identity and my life as who I am in my own way. This abandonment will leave me without a family, inheiretence, money, or relationships but that’s a sacrifice i’m willing to take. They never supported me and I know they never will but I know that I have to do this for myself. I have to do it for her."	"Right on.  You’re the one who lives your life, not them.
This is a powerful ode to liberation. What you have recognized  I believe is a gift. Not that many of us find the ability or good fortune to be able to stand in complete naked, transparent, and unflinching solidarity with our true self for all around us to see. 

The relationships around us reshuffle as we become aware of the true meaning of love and we recognize who loves us and who doesn't. Because to truly love is love without ulterior motives, to love one not for what they do or how they fit into our lives, or what they do for us, but for who they are. 

This seems simple, but when we are not being our own authentic self, we are unable to recognize all the relationships in our lives founded on falsity, or all the ways convince ourselves that we are loved even by those who really don't love us at all. We are a bit like the King of Rohan with our eyes covered in cataracts and evil voices of ""loved ones"" whispering in our ears what we feel and who we are.

When I cane out as trans, already most of the family relationships I had had melted away. Shortly after, I lost the last one. Don't get ne wrong, I did some of the pushing away. Being trans is kind of a superpower. 

It snapped into sharp focus the idea of the dark side of love that this person dwelled on in the way the hay treated me for so many years! I saw them for who they are! 

I like this song by Palace Brothers ""No More Worhorse Blues"". The workhorse is the perfectl metaphor for the person who lives their life for others until they change their mind and realize they must live their own life and throws off the yoke of their work to be ""a grazing horse...a racing horse...your favorite horse!"" Everyone's musical taste is different and although the musical zeitgeist of the early 90s raw indy voice and guitar may not be to your liking, I hope you can hear the lyrics. I will post this elsewhere.

 I hope you forge ahead becoming you, strong and lovely and super powerful. You are loved and will be loved. You have the unique gift of recognizing how truly alone most of us really are. Love is real when you feel it from here.
If you have known this for two years. I don't imagine that this will ever go away. She will never leave you, as she is you. 
Take care, be careful this is a long hard road. Keep an eye on education as you move through this as it is a powerful tool to give you the resources to be successful with everything even your transition. 
I wish you a peaceful transition.
Unfortunately, this is a reality many of us face. It's difficult, but we get through it, and we build families of choice along the way. That said, I will give you a bit of practical advice as I've been where you are before. 

1. You're about to turn 18. It is important to prioritize your transition, but it is also important to prioritize your next steps into adulthood. Are you planning on going to college? Do you have somewhere safe to live and some money saved up? The freedom you will experience when you leave your parents' house will be wonderful, but you'll also need to prioritize your safety and wellbeing (insurance, housing, a phone, etc.). I know many people who made the decision to not totally disown their parents until they were completely financially independent. It did not keep them from being out to their friends and colleagues at college, and it kept them safe until they could provide for themselves 100%.
2. Some parents come around. Some never do. I am completely no contact with my father. There will come a point where you may have to say ""I cannot accept this type of treatment and therefore, I will not spend time around you unless your behavior changes."" For me, it was valuable to be able to say to my father, ""I have warned you of these consequences and your behavior remained unchanged."" And then... our relationship was over. And I was free. And honestly? It's better than I could've ever imagined.
3. Which brings me to this point. Right now, everything seems so big and so scary. And in many ways, it is. But please believe me when I tell you, your life will contain so much more joy and love than you could ever dream of. You will meet so many wonderful people and find so much peace in getting to live more fully into yourself and get to know the young woman that you are. The work you are doing now will pay off, whether it is preparing for college or beginning to calmly set boundaries with your parents. I wish you the best on this journey, but seriously, it's not all gloom and doom. It's gonna be okay- it's gonna be better than okay- it's going to be really, totally wonderful.
You know who they truly are now. Pretty sad and disappointing to realize. Still, you will always go further with the truth. Go for it young adult!💕❤️😊
I am not sure if it helps; but quietly asserting your right to ownership over your own body is a part of becoming a woman, and its a stressful time for cis and trans women alike. Sure there are unique challenges to being trans, but there are also unique challenges for cis girls. 

My point is, find reassurance that what you’re going through is unfortunate and scary but normal, and if you approach it as such it will get easier for folks around you to accept you. People (even parents) respond to confidence. Keep your cool, don’t give them the fight they want but keep your focus and go toward what you want. You’ll get it 🥰
This is so relatable did our parents get a ""unsupportive course"" or something
Good on you for realizing this. I turn 30 in a few months, and after going no contact for several years with my parents, I tried so hard to make things work, but absolutely nothing changed with them after 5 years of no contact with a 2 year reconnect. I finally blocked them yesterday, and this time I know it is the right call, and today I feel free. Some people are absolutely capable of change, but it is not your responsibility to manage them, and your health is the most important in your life. 
You deserve to be respected, and treated nicely! I hope you have a good day! c:
It's terrible that so many people have to give up their families just to get proper medical treatment, but as much as it hurts, it will be for the better. They are selfish, and you deserve happiness. ❤️
Make damn sure you can fully support yourself (food, shelter, utilities, job) and have an external support network (friends willing to, say, let you crash at their place for a month) before you burn that bridge. Take what your parents are willing to give you, hold love and forgiveness for them in your heart without compromising your boundaries, and be prepared to live your truth! You are you, and nobody can take that away from you.
Insert* ""you do it for her"" lyrics -steven universe
I’m proud of you, girl. My dad was/is also a homophobic and transphobic POS, and I was nearly twice your age when I started my medical transition: still loving every minute of it.

Like you, I lost all support and chances of inheritance: I currently live in a camper and wait tables @36. The comfortable life I could have had came with too many strings attached, and I would rather be a poor trailer park girl than a middle class repressed 🥚.

Follow your heart, and live your best life. Also capitalism must be destroyed.

🖤💖🏴🏳️‍⚧️🏴💖🖤
If you disappear for a while after you turn 18 it’s possible your mother will come around.
Good for you. Live your best life, sis. 

If parents can’t support who their kids are, the kids aren’t going to stick around.
Absolute goddess mentality 🫡 

I’m really sorry your parents are transphobic. That sounds agonizingly difficult and I wouldn’t even begin to know what to do in your situation. You are an incredibly strong woman. She will prevail ✊
Your situation is sad but not uncommon.  In the end, you'll have to live the life you desire....one that fits you best.  Life is really short and being happy cannot be undervalued.  There's hope you'll find peace with your parents.  My experience was similar to yours but because my parents divorced long before my transition they didn't have their own marriage to save.  Mom was supportive and dad was not.  I pressed forward and did what I knew was best for me.  Fully transitioned......including work etc.  Everything worked out over the course of some years.  I have high hopes it can for you as well.   If possible, try not to be too angry with your parents.....they'll need time.  In the meantime, begin making your plans with the assistance of anyone in the right places to help you.
I am on the same boat. However, I’m almost 22 in two months and still live with my parents. I’ve been out for 4 years and medically transitioning for nearly 2. In the meantime of trying to get accepted into a job and doing what I can around the house, my family makes my transition about themselves. That I’m “selfish” and that the entire world doesn’t revolve around me, and if someone declines to call me my preferred name and pronouns, that’s “their boundary”. Any boundaries I make regarding to being respected gets thrown out the window. I either have to submit to being called my deadname and “she” all day, or resort to unnecessary drama all because of a fucking name and pronouns. My mom is trying to come around but resorts back to deadnaming and misgendering, it’s a frustrating cycle. 

My advice is apply to as many good paying jobs as possible. Save up and move out when you can.
You have to pay attention to that hostility. That is the dark side of love right there. That is the true face of their love, a self-serving love betrayed. The veil is lifted and maybe the first time in your life, they are showing you a deep essence of their true self, maybe the most sincere thing they ever showed you, next to the joy they expressed when you most perfectly matched or exceeded their expectations. 

But I think it's important at the same time to see it with some compassion and some hope and to not mistake it for the totality of their love. They may change. Limbic creatures detest change and will fight it tooth and nail, but some of us are also eventually capable of being human.
If youre in the US they are legally required to have you inherit 1/3rd of their money if you are their next of kin.
so much love and strength to you. ❤️
You are such a strong woman
I'm so sorry you are on this situation. I came put at 45 completely independent and kind of had the same reactions. Mom not comfortable and dad rejecting. Eventually my mom came around but dad is stuck in transphobia. My mom is avoiding to take much sides and ultimately she lives with him. If I had come out at your age I would have had the same situation that you are having plus violence. 
It's sad to realize you are losing them more every day but in the other hand you are working on your own happiness. You won't be happy without transitioning, so you better understand what lies ahead of you. 🫂
I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I'm in something similar. My parents are less outright hostile, and I""m older, but it rings true too. Please, when you are able to get out of there cut them out of your life and don't look back.

Your family sucks, but it won't be the same. You will make a new one. You'll find people that actually care about you and make you feel happy. People call the concept a found family, but regardless it's real. <3

PS: Make sure you have your documentation, like your ID and birth certificate, any money you have earned, and anything else with you just in case. Some people can be cruel. And that their names aren't on any accounts you have. If you have a bank account as a minor I believe you have to have a parent/guardian open the account with you.

Good luck. You'll be able to be yourself soon enough. <3

Been there, good luck on your journey, it's a difficult one, but definetly doable!

Quick tip: make sure the place you move to can be set as your homeadress, otherwise your parents will get your post, and can use this against you.
I’m so sorry man. Goodluck, do it for yourself. People who truly love and care about you for you will come around.
Same lol
Same lol
You're already so self-aware and that's a great start! I'm really hoping you have somewhere to go at 18, because I wouldn't live with them 1 minute more than I have to. For them to deny you that is cruel at best, these are the types of parents that claim to be good parents but then wonder why their kids don't talk to them. Trust me, this is tragically more common than it should be. But you've already got a great head on your shoulders, I know you'll do great out there! And once you find a space of your own a massive weight will be lifted from your shoulders. Hang in there!
are you me? this is my exact situation, ages and everything. i will read the comments religiously
I get that feeling. No family or friends close enough to call that.
That's so strong of you, I could benefit from a fraction of the guts you have 💜🙏🏻
This post gave me a lot of hope. I’m also seventeen, and in a nearly identical situation where my parents don’t accept me, especially medical transition. My parents have the same dynamic as well. I’m FTM not MTF but I’ve never related to a post more. You’re not alone OP, and I wish you a lot of luck. ❤️
do it for her!! YES!! i’m so sorry this is happening, and i’m so sorry it’s such a relatable and universal experience for most of us. i’m wishing you only the best for yourself!
Thank you for making this. I'm in a similar position and christ this made me feel like what I'm doing with myself actually makes some sort of sense haha. I'm still getting used to being me and this really did help me. I wish you the best of luck, and seriously thank you for making this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who needed to read this. Just remember you're never alone and that you're also a total badass in my eyes :)
I legit had to look my father dead in the face and say, ""you either accept me as your son and stop your shit, or you can bury me in the ground and have no children"" course I was 21 but it still hit him hard and made him think about what I ment to him.
I'm sorry to hear that :(
If it's of any help, I'm a trans girl about to turn 17 and dms are always open if you need someone to talk to 💜
Happy cake day
Thank you, I appreciate the kind words.
Wow this is a beautiful comment.
This is really good advice! Prioritize your education; it will make transitioning much easier and will make it easier to find other trans people and sources of support and found family.
This comment is so beautiful, I love this community so much
Thank you for saying that. I will admit the journey ahead is gonna be pretty rough but I’m willing to accept whatever comes my way to secure my happiness.
I can’t describe how much it pains me to have to live into my older years and look back on a childhood I never had. The fact that all of that was denied from me and actively so, hurts so much. I feel like if my dad could, he would be actively more violent towards me being trans but thankfully the laws are a thing. I just can’t shake the feeling that I have to inevitable live with all this baggage that I feel no one will ever be able to truly understand.
Delete this shit.
Am nearly 40, the only thing that hit me like a rock is how sweet my life is without kids.
I think he’s just transphobic. And this comment is generally pretty dumb.
Op is the only one who decides if they have children or not. Pretty simple right?
You're so very welcome.
Thank you 🙏

It’s an overwhelming generalization based on your personal experience. Some people have kids in their twenties. Some people have kids in their teens. Some people never have kids. Some people choose to bank sperm in their twenties because they’ve fully and seriously considered the kinds of family planning they want to do. Some people just wing it. Some 18 year olds do what is best for themselves. Some 18 year olds make big, stupid choices. Any post that generalizes about what everyone does in their 20s is a pretty dumb. Don’t you think?
I briefly went through your profile history/comments and noticed you casually dropping slurs such as the f slur and the r slur. After a dumb comment like this i had to check and now im curious why are you even here?
Based on what you're saying op would already be familiar with this concept so ... What are you adding to this conversation? Rather than just distracting from ops valid points by implying they should sacrifice their mental heath for their parents opinions and biasis. And your own opinions and biasis.

Just answer the question. Why are you here? Just to harrass trans people and downplay our issues?

'Transgender people tighten gender stereotypes.'	"The amount of times I read this bullshit...

I'm not. I'm just trying to explain to your cis brain how I feel. The problem is that you wouldn't accept a 'I just know'. You also wouldn't believe me if I told you about how feminine I was as a child (I'm a trans guy). I mean we all know that trans guys can't possibly be feminine and trans women can't possibly be masculine, right? 

It's not trans people who are pushing these stereotypes.It's these cis people who need a very clear and basic explanation of everybody's gender identity so that they can verify that we are truly the gender we claim to be."	"> “*What is it about you that you think makes you a man/woman?*”

\- Generally someone who will reject anything you say as a stereotype that doesn’t mean anything
The amount/force of gender stereotypes pushed onto kid's will sometimes scare them from being able to explore who they are, making them not able to make a track record of childhood experiences where it was ""obvious that they're trans."" Then people/family will act like it's their fault for not knowing sooner and doubt their feelings and experiences, I hate it
""no hate""/""no bad intent"" posts where they ask trans people about their ""inside feelings"" in relationships to their genitals makes me uncomfy. And there are already so many posts like this on this page anyway why can they just scroll a little and read those
I stopped talking to stupid people a long time ago. It was a very rewarding decision.
""You didn't show signs as a kid""  I did, but mostly, I had to hide any femininity, because otherwise my dad would've screamed at me and possibly hurt me.

Most things I did as a kid were either to blend in (playing sports even though I hated it, saying my favorite color was green instead of pink) or was me compromising because I couldn't get what I actually wanted (action figures instead of Barbies, Mighty Max instead of Polly Pocket)

Years of repression and being punished/bullied for being girly turned me from an extremely feminine kid into a rather butch adult.
It's like nobody can reason any more.
I miss being feminine sometimes, I just don't wear feminine clothes right now to avoid my annoying family constantly calling me womanly words
""They're forcing GNC people to conform!""

Me, a trans femboy: *exists*

""They're forcing gay people to be straight!""

Me, a trans femboy: *kisses my boyfriend*
People seem violently opposed to the notion of allowing others to be their authentic selves. Very sad.
That just dumb, I don't hate wearing dresses and skirts, as long as its a costume, I'm really into medieval and fantasy costumes and am learning to sew.  
But I sure as hell don't feel like a woman. I hate most of my body and if I woke up in a mans body tomorrow I'd be much more confident. But even then I still woudn't mind wearing a dress for a costume. Gender stereotypes are dumb.

Edit: spelling mistake
This. I'm a trans woman but I don't really try too hard to be super feminine. I don't CARE how people perceive me because it's all a performance and I just want to do certain things / have people use my pronouns. For a lot of cis people, that makes me a man I guess. \*shrug\*
Over here supporting feminine stereotypes with grease and gun oil under my nails blasting Meshuggah and Decapitated 🤷‍♀️
People keep saying shit like ""wearing a dress doesn't make you a woman, you know"" and I'm like *no shit, asshole.* I don't wear them because they make me a girl, I wear them because I WANT TO and because it wasn't socially safe to do so until I looked like one.

Cishet society's roles and standards are what made me ""conform"" to stereotypes because it wasn't safe for me to not conform
How it started- ""how could I ever take you seriously as a woman you look nothing like one""

How it's going- ""why are you conforming to gender stereotypes!""
Even if that made any sense trans people are not responsible for increasing the overall total of gender non-conformity in the world. If cis people care about it so much they can be GNC.
I'd like to see what some of these people would do if they saw a non-conforming or non-passing trans person being harassed for not conforming to gender roles.
(Spoiler alert they'd probably join in because they hate all people who don't conform to their framework)
How do you know your a man 

My response: Because I feel like one and deep down I know I am one no matter what I do female pronouns just don’t feel right because I’m not a girl 

Expected and wanted response :well this and this and this even tho I’ve done this and this and this 

Their actual response: well you used to wear dresses and liked mermaids and were okay with it 

My response: clothes aren’t gendered dresses are comfortable. I did the hair and makeup stuff for you. Mermaids are just cool. And I never was okay with it I just didn’t know how I felt or was in denial 

Their response “blink blink”
patriarchal structures and terfs are who tighten the stereotypes…
Its hard to keep on trying with those people :/

Like we sre who we are no matter what
this need to be spread around more
being trans is wild. I got critised for painting my nails by the same person who not ten minutes ago told me i'm enforcing the gender stereotype of men being unemotional or some shit like that. they will only ever see what they want to see, no matter what you are. making an attempt at appealing to a cis person is a useless waste of time
I have been that person. A friend of mine told me that he knew he was trans because he ""hated wearing dresses as a kid"", and my feminist, anti-biological-imperative brain kind of exploded. I felt really defensive there, honestly.   
I want to live in a world where people can exist in whatever way suits them best, without social pressure.  
For me, ""I knew I was trans, because I'm trans"" was more than enough. You are you are. Tying gender up with arbitrary markers seemed reductive.   
I've been lucky enough to have a few friends walk me through it now, though. People like stories - palatable, bite-sized explanations.   
Huge, complicated, fuzzy, nuanced explanations are wonderful, but sometimes reductive simplicity is useful. 

Besides, my friend didn't owe me that larger conversation. If that's as deep as he wanted to take the conversation, that needed to be fine. At the time, I think there was some part of me that thought that my judgement mattered there. I wanted a story I could get behind, rather than just getting behind my friend.

I'm grateful that I've had patient friends talk me through some of my dumb shit.
as a cis ally, I'm sorry the other cis people are so dumb ;-;
Please invite my they/them ass to your busted-ass lunch table for show and tell lol.
This is an interesting topic. 

I'm not trans. I've always thought about a social experiment about a micro-society where everyone is forced to wear the same clothes, have the same hairstyle and do the same things.

Would still be there people with gender dysphoria in this society? what are your thoughts?
YES TY this is something I've struggled to articulate for a while now!!
PREACH! I absolutely hate thinking I can explain this shit to cis people and then I actually try to explain this shit to cis people. It’s literally a waste of time. 

Nowadays I don’t even explain it. I just shrug and move on. The real good allies don’t generally need an explanation, they just don’t like seeing people get hurt so they stand with us. You don’t have to understand my whole identity to see me as a person. 

As for the damn therapists, I got nothin’.
Well said 😊
Some people just don't understand that gender is such a complex topic and trans people don't want to have to explain (and shouldnt have to explain)advanced psychology/ biology shit to someone who doesn't really care so we simplify shit to help little pea brains understand to avoid breaking down our whole identity anytime we are questioned.
aka my mom
My answer would be ""the fact that I am one""
This happened to me… I knew I was neither a man not a woman since I was 8 but never told anyone or knew the word non binary until 5 years later :/
Partly the exact thing i experienced
Apparently growing my hair out until I could see it flap around me if I shook my head wasn’t a big indicator..

Also having to choose a female character in any video game because playing as male makes me enjoy it less. 


Also shaving my body (unfortunately there’s a fair bit to get rid of and I’m shit at shaving), holy shit I love how a hairless set of legs feel
what I wouldn't have given if somebody sat me down and just said ""listen, stupid kid, if you don't want to be a man, then don't be a man""

instead, all I got was ""you were born a man so you have to be a man and if you don't like it, no one cares, you just have to push through, stop being a p\*\*sy etc""

and I internalized all that for 32 years, JFC I hate this feeling so much

no wonder I showed no signs, any time I had even as much as a girly thought (or really, just a thought I perceive as girly) I felt I have to hide it any way I can and overcompensate with carefully planned masculine behavior
This.

I had masculine interests as a kid. I really admired girls, but felt forced into male gender parameters.
Me
As have I and the quality of conversation I do have has improved dramatically :)
If I stopped doing that there's not many people I would talk to.
I can relate to this a lot. I grew up in a very conservative area and just being gay was taboo much less trans. I dealt with a lot of bullying and I never got to or let known what I actually enjoyed doing because it was feminine and ""boys are not supposed to like or do feminine things"". I was bullied just for being a bit of an outcast much less if I actually did the things I enjoyed. 

It just seems people see what one did and assume because they never realize we have to hide for whatever the reason might be.
I didn't show many signs because I was autistic and a tomboy. Only that I looked like a boy so people didn't know I behaved tomboy-ish instead of boy-ish.
This is one of the most annoying things. You want to wear what you like and is comfortable but you can't cause either they will misgender you or say something bout how you sure you are trans because that is feminine/masculine. It's like I'm just being comfortable and wearing what I want to wear because you know clothes! So many times did I wear something when I first started transitioning and something like that happened. Like come on I can't afford to change out my entire wardrobe just like that. It costs money. And even now it still happens. Stupid....
Welcome to the world and here’s to hoping it improves
This is not correct. I'm a cis person and I just don't understand the feeling, because I don't feel like a man. I feel like if my mind was transplanted to a female body I wouldn't have issues with that. And that's the only way I can think of being trans... so I just don't understand it. However, there have to be logical reasons I am just missing
There's honestly not any point to this kind of thinking, because that's not the world we live in, nor will it ever be.
Or the fact that you don't only have to explain it once. You're expected to explain it to everyone everywhere forever. And you better be happy to do it.
why are we the only people required to show scientific evidence to prove that we exist?
I’m autistic too. When I was a kid, my dad was my role model. I wanted to be just like my dad. I loved wearing suits because my dad wore one to work. I loved working in the yard with my dad. I wanted to play guitar like my dad. I wanted to be tall and have an Adam’s apple and a deeper voice like my dad did. I remember deliberately hiding some things about me because it was “too feminine for a guy,” at least it was in my head. I’m sure there were feminine things that I subconsciously hid too. 

I didn’t hide these things about myself because of my parents. They wouldn’t have cared. I hid them because I felt the pressure from society to conform. 

I tried to copy what my best friend did in an effort to fit in with other guys. I always failed to fit in. I made friends with girls with little effort until society made it seem weird for a guy to have girl friends (in middle schools). It took me the first 16.5 years to figure out that I didn’t like my body or my expected role in society. I was only trying to fit ideal that I believed I was supposed to be.
Yeah, I'm autistic and a tomboy, too.
yeah this is what I was thinking about but in actual words
Yeah clothes have no gender imo it’s just the fact that people will deadname tf outta me if I wear dresses or flowery clothes (which I hate flowery clothes anyway but not the point)
valid I guess but this has nothing to do with my comment
It would resolve a fundamental issue: Is transexuality biological or social?

By mental experiments the theory of relativity was concieved :)
The fact that I know I will have a lot to explain when I come out that I am debating on writing a fucking presentation to show my mom because I know i will struggle to explain and she definitely won't accept me until she understands.
The point I'm trying to make is that a lot if not most of the people just want to understand. There will always be people who just hate trans people and want to hurt them though
Being transgender is not a ""fundamental issue"", nor does it need to be solved. It does not matter whether it is biological or social; it just is.
I wrote letters to all my family & friends. They still had questions but I drew boundaries and tried to answer some questions I figured they would have.
If the fact it took me 30+ years to explain it to myself and figure it out, it isn’t going to be able to be simplified into one statement. Unfortunately, many people just want a quick and easy answer so they can move on with their lives.
I don't want your weird wisdom. I didn't ask for it nor is it warranted or has anything to do with my comment, which was me recounting an experience I had with transphobic cis people and their double standards and my conclusion that trying to appeal to that is useless. 

if your response to somebody recounting transphobia is ""not all cis people"", then it feels like you're just offended that cis people aren't all that great. i'm done with this discussion, this is irking me
Knowledge is power. I advocate for science. 
I understand you are at a defensive position since there are a lot of transphobic people. 
But the more we know about transexuality scientifically, the less arguments for them.
I think I'm gonna do that. I go non verbal when I'm anxious so I think writing it will help me get everything out
You said ""making an attempt at appealing to a cis person is a useless waste of time"". It has to do with your comment.

It is not wisdom, it's just a comment. 

Seroiusly this makes you angry? then you have mental stability problems.
Do you give the same energy for homosexuality?
Of course, it would be interesting to see what happens in an experiment where the norm is being homosexual.
How much homosexualiky would be there?"	vidtfe	trans	1025	0.98	2022-06-22 19:52:43
If you never had any human interaction for the rest of your life, would you still transition?	"I (MtF) was talking with a friend and we got on to the subject of my transition (of course). They are very supportive, but also really curious. Based on some of the questions they were asking, I could tell they're understanding of what transition is (for me, at least) was not complete. Like most people I've encountered so far, they always think about the impacts of my transition on other people, like trans women in women's sports, or bathroom bills or terfs believing we're destroying women's spaces.

I explained to my friend that for me, even if I never had another conversation with anyone else, never had another single human interaction for the rest of my life, I would still transition. I would still pay hundreds of dollars per painful session to get facial hair blasted off my face, I would still take my hormones, and I would still undergo painful and expensive surgeries. I am transitioning so my physical body finally matches that mental picture I have of myself. That dissonance exists in me regardless of whether other humans exist or not.

Anyone else agree?"	"I'd transition *sooner*
Hell I think that would make it way easier. If I never had to interact with anyone else ever, almost all my fears and doubts about medical transition would go away. Sure I might still have to deal with the occasional impostor syndrome but my other apprehensions have a lot to do with social interactions.
If I never had to interact with another person, I would be all in, boy mode gone, living as me. While it is important for those I love to see me as me, it is even more important for me to be able to see me as me.
I think a big element of the transgender experience is the social aspect, the element of being socially seen as who we are on the inside. That said, I'd still have started my transition if I wasn't going to socialize at all.
Ya I’d still have to look in a mirror, no?
I haven't had any meaningful human interaction in going on 7 years, and there's nothing I want more than to be a woman.

You might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. My life really is that empty.
For sure. I transitioned for myself not society ya know?
i’m terrible with these “what-if” scenarios because i always take them to the extreme.

i’d have to say if there was no social/interpersonal aspect of my life then there wouldn’t really be a need for me to transition. i would have no bodies to compare my own to. if no one was observing me, then i wouldn’t have to worry about whether i am read correctly. it would just be me, and i already know i’m a man. (actually, without any human interaction, i may just identify as “human”. because how can something separate (a “man”) exist unless there are other men to compare to, or women and non-binary folk to contrast to?)

if i’m still getting some level of human engagement (through something like media, for example), then i would have more reason to want to alter my body to make it align with what i identify with/value.

if a robot doctor was prescribing me testosterone, i might still take it. t does have an effect on my brain, but i think the biggest changes it makes is that i feel more comfortable existing in my body *within society* while on it (and yes, i do like how i look with the masculinization that testosterone brings to my face and body, but if it’s just me, do i *really* care how i look?). i would definitely have to reassess how i felt off of t in that situation. also, without human interaction, i would find my testosterone-induced libido pretty annoying. i still have my ovaries, so letting my body make his own hormones would just be simpler. 

i’ve already had top surgery, but if i had to do it again in this hypothetical situation, i might? i never liked my chest but my main issue with it was that it prevented me from successfully living as a man. i would possibly get rid of them again only for convenience’s sake (they were large, heavy, and would sweat something fierce on the underboob).

in this hypothetical situation, i think i would actually opt for other types of modifications to change my body. can i get horns? can i get black sclera? can i get an extra 6” to my height? can i get fangs? if i’m not interacting with other people, i no longer have to worry about how my appearance will be received by them so why not go nuts?
If I didn’t have any human interaction for the rest of my life? I’d die of boredom, but yeah I’d absolutely still transition.
Yes. Absolutely.
Yes I still would, the social aspects are a big part but it's also how I want to see myself, matching up who I am mentally and physically for me.

I spend a good chunk of time alone and feel so much more at ease with myself now than pre-transition. So still definitely would no question.
I work from home and generally stay in Sunday to Thursday, so I'm basically doing that already bar the couple of work friends and my gf lol
Fwiw, when you go a decade or more without any friends or family, you begin to barely understand the immense trauma, damage and excruciatingly horrible pain of what you're talking about. Being a pariah, excluded and isolated is much worse than most can ever imagine, especially when your own ""community"" contributes excessively due to classism and selfishness. 0l

Transition without the necessary resources is worse than death for many of us. 

I expect downvotes and massive silencing of this reality to ensue. That is the new social media cancelling way.
holy shit that was eye opening - I've been questioning if I should come out/transition lately and the second I read your title I was like, ""Yes??? Of course if I was able to transition without anyone being able to criticize I would!""

And then I realized - Now I feel VERY validated, thanks OP :))
If i had a job, earned money and still hadn't to talk to anyone, i would transition earlier than i'm planning. But i would take it much easier.
I absolutely agree. Even if i never had to interact with others, the experience of existing in a body that isnt mine is distressing or just very dissociative. Ever since starting T i can slowly start seeing my body as mine, my voice is sounding more like how i hear myself in my head, and it feels like my emotions are getting regulated in the best ways. Im transitioning to not just love the body i exist in, but to make the body *mine*
The fear of judgement by other people is what held me back from transitioning for a while. If I didn’t have to interact with people I would have transitioned earlier.
I think that's exactly why we're seeing so many if us cracking during the pandemic. Without the noise and expectations, it's so much easier to be ourselves.
I would transition and become best friends with a football.
Fuck yes. Its not about anyone else, its about me and who I see looking back at me from the mirror.
Are we talking biblical-rapture style, here? Like the world is still here but everyone else is gone? If I was the last woman on earth the FIRST thing I'm doing is burning my old wardobe and walking naked to a mall for a shopping spree.
Absolutely. Even when I was in 1st or 2nd grade, I would randomly cry about ""not wanting to be a girl"" but I didn't understand why I felt that way so I just ignored my feelings. If I could have transitioned, if I knew what that was at the time, I absolutely would have done it - but I had no idea what the LGBTQ community was. I just knew I wanted to somehow transition, but I didn't know what to call it or how to do it. If I never interacted with any humans ever up until that point, I would absolutely still decide to transition.

This is a little off-topic, but this is also why I think it's very important for LGBTQ stuff to be taught in schools or at least talked about. It would have saved me so many years of confusion and random breakdowns in bed if I knew what being trans was
Where is this mysterious island of nobody but trees of estrogen and transformation fruit that is devoid of human contact?

Asking for some friends...
What? Yeah, of course! That would make everything so much easier
Yes
hell yes i would! im not transitioning for anyone but myself
probably not medically. maybe hormones. I'd like hormones. but I don't have too much body dysphoria. Actually the body dysphoria I do have mostly comes from thinking that other people think I look like a man lol
Yeah... I mean... A big part of the reason I transitioned was because of body dysphoria so... I'd transition for that regardless of human contact.
Definitely. Wouldn’t voice train though lol
I transitioned for me, not for anybody else. The presence or absence of other people just doesn't figure into it.

Ironically, not transitioning is something I did for other people for a long time, so obviously their presence figured into that decision more than anything else.

I'll always regret not transitioning sooner, but I just have to keep looking forward at this point.
Yes, pne of my fantasies was to have a desert city for my self to be able to transition in peace
Absolutely. Most of my dysphoria is physical rather than social.
It's all about me. None of it is about them but they sure do like to personalize it.
Lmaoooo I am literally isolated from humans already as it is, I would hop on that so fast
I think of I never had to interact with anyone, I WOULD transitions.
With no hesitation I absolutely would still have done it. 

Hell, not talking to other people would be kind of a bonus tbh.
Abso-fuckin-lutley. shit would be way easier.
The biggest obstacle for me is transphobia and how other people treat me because I’m trans. If I never had to talk to anyone again I would be so happy and never anxious again lmao
Yes! No more fear of others not accepting!
Would I transition, yes! Absolutely, 100 percent I would. I'm not transitioning for anyone else, I'm doing it for me. Would I be happy, no, but not because of the reasons I am not happy now. I'd miss the fun of my d&d games, or spending time with a partner, but I would at least know that as miserable as I would be I would be my true self
Id be much more likely to transition all the way to be honest.
""Yes and . . . ""

I would do it to be more comfortable with my body. But the way I'm treated by people around me is definitely a factor in my transition. Being perceived as male/masculine is uncomfortable for me. 

Transition is both to be more comfortable with myself and to correct the perceptions that other people have of me.
On one hand yes ide transition cause dysphoria when I’m by myself is real, but ide definitely take more creative liberties with my transition if I was alone on an island with the stuff I needed to be comfortable magically delivered by unmanned boats. It would actually be cool minus the lag on my new island Xbox
Yes, absolutely. My transition is for *me*, first and foremost. I want to see myself the way I feel, and I don't need anybody else. Would be nice, though. :)
yes.
This will make the transition better not worst
Yes! It’s not about anyone else but me I wish to be comfortable in my own skin. In your scenario I hope my treatment team is still around though I am kind of fond of them! Ok and the kids and spouse! But the answer is yes.
I already barely socialize outside of work, also i feel like if anything itd make it easier. Removes the whole 'people perceiving me' part yknow
I mean that would be my worst nightmare because I’m a people-loving extrovert but I’d certainly at least still act & dress female, because I am. As for the other stuff, I’d certainly do something about my facial hair sooner than otherwise with less to distract me. But I’d feel less societal pressure to go further.
You really asking, would you eat for the rest of your life or drink water...
Probably. But life would probably be pretty short with no human interaction.
I would also choose to transition. I want to because I want to so I could do certain stuff I always wanted to
i would absolutely still transition. i don’t want top surgery to make other people happy, i want top surgery to make myself happy. making other people see me as more of a woman is just a plus.
Considering I was crossdressing when no one else was around, yes. But, the question assumes I'm the last person left alive on the planet and forget gender at that point because all of culture in general goes up in smoke. Gender is a social construct, if there are no people, there is no society, there is no ""social"" anything.

Feel like I'd have bigger more basic pressing issues then, like food, electricity, clean water...
Yes. Absolutely. 100000000%. Without any doubt. I can’t imagine why I wouldn’t. 

Transitioning is for me, not them.
Yes. I want titties
Yeah, have to agree with the majority here. It would only make things easier for me and ease a huge amount of anxiety around transition.
YES!! I would still transition.  My desire to gave a body which my brain's pre-wiring plugs in to... is that strong.

I have always known that I had female breasts, they just were not there.  I have always known that I have a vagina, I just don't have a connection into it from the outside.

I have always been a female, even though I never believed or even considered that could even be possible... because, penis.

I was never transgender before, because I didn't know transgender existed.  Well, it did, but only for some extremely miniscule number of people that might find an article here or there about. I would no more have considered that I was transgender because of the existence of ""those people""... than I believe I have 380 million dollars in my checking account because im NYC, someone won $380 million yesterday. Just because it happened to someone else... by no means means it happened to me.

Except, of course, it did.

The more I learned about it, the more I saw myself at every age of my lifetime. The more I saw a *girl*... at every age of my lifetime.

Sorry, was just reminiscing.  Yes, I would.  Yes, it's that strong
Absolutely. When I'm home alone, I don't wear men's clothes or even PJ's. I'd still put in my breast forms and wear skirts, dresses, etc. I might eschew makeup though if I never saw anyone else. The makeup makes me feel better when I'm somewhere without a mask on.
I haven't started anything yet but, no interaction would be amazing. People are the reason I haven't started anything.
I would. For me, (as big as it is for me) it's less a matter of how other people see me, and more a matter of whether or not I'm comfortable in my own body.
Yes.
For me, transitioning is largely about feeling at home in my body. The social changes are more of a mixed bag - overall good, but not the primary motivation for me. 

&#x200B;

If I had to choose between ""having exactly the body I want but being seen and treated as my AGAB"" versus ""keeping the same body, yet being seen and treated as my actual gender"" then I would choose the body changes without hesitation.
Fuck. Yes.
After thinking about it, yes, I would. 

It would make a lot of things easier but a lot of things harder but when it comes down to it, I was already alone and unhappy pretending to be a man. I've felt actual happiness just from breathing since getting on HRT and I've never felt that in my entire adult life. 

I still have my hairy face. I don't have breasts. My groin doesn't look or feel right but I didn't wake up this morning disappointed that I'm still here. I still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do but right now, I'm happy to be breathing and to see that there is a path forward. 

I'd like for part of that path forward to be to find someone to be with and that I can help along with their life but this is not the linchpin to my happiness.
So, in my very long journey to discover a meaningful ""why"" to justify how I felt before I was fully out of my egg, I came to a couple little thought experiments.

And, I asked myself, if I didn't have to worry about anyone else in the world. Nobody else mattered, and nobody would know. Would I still take that magic potion to change? And, at least, for me, it was a yes. 

At the end of the day, it's something I needed for myself. If anything, the existance of other people and their beliefs were one of the few things that made it more of a stressful thing that I tried to avoid and convince myself out of.
I feel it's my anxiety about human interactions that are holding me back from a move towards transitioning.  If it was just me on my own, hell yes!
Yes
Yes I would, I want to feel good with myself and feel comfortable  
Especially with my breast. I love to go swimming some day again but I just feel hella uncomfortable, even if I went swimming by myself.
Fuck yes. The only thing holding me back is other people. I face scrutiny, hate and harassment near daily. It would be so much easier without human interaction
Yeah of course. I have to spend 100% of my time with my body, I want to at least not absolutely loathe it.
Transmasc here.

Most of my dysphoria is social, or physical but related to how people perceive and subsequently gender a body that has breasts. I think if I just never saw other people ever again starting now, I’d still transition. Spending decades around people whose actions impacted my life shapes my perspective on everything—which is just how existing in society works—and will continue to, even if all that is permanently in the past.

Also, I was already frustrated with having periods long before I discovered my gender.
I would say that I would even do it more. But, I would perish from the lack of human interaction.
I honestly dont think i would. Because i would never have had a concept of gender. My body makes me uncomfortable because it doesnt match my gender. If i never had a concept of gender i wouldnt really care about my body and would just exist.
Yes absolutely
I mean, obviously. To me, the more relevant question is: ""Knowing that you'll have to live in the shitty world we do, would you transition?"" And for me the answer was yes. But if not for all the judgment and weird looks and legal issues and everything else that goes with transition that comes from *other people*, it would be a much easier choice.
Yes. A girl hermit is better than being a boy.
100% yes
I’m not transitioning for other people. I did it for me. I started transitioning to help my dysphoria and make me happy with myself. So yeah—hundred percent would have started transitioning even if no one were looking. It’s about me, not them.
i agree 100%, i'd transition no matter what. put simply: gender dysphoria is a bitch.
100% agree, if it was about public perception then it honestly would probably be easier for me to not transition at all, but this has nothing to do with public perception, it is for me and me alone, so I would certainly do it even if no one ever actually saw it.
Id take all the steps immediatly
Man can this happen, people suck ass I don't wanna talk to them
Yes
Hell yes, it's not about others it's about justice for me.
Hell yeah, its about me not anyone else. Its for my comfort not theirs im not gonna suffer just because i cant talk to people
hell yeah. absolutely
I would transition and it'd be easier because if I get a shitty haircut then nobody gets to see me with it
I'd still be stuck with myself, wouldn't I?
Yeah
Yes

I’ve always coped well with isolation, and normally preferred it anyway. Most of my anxiety(outside of body dysphoria) comes from social situations.

Never having to interact with any human being ever would be an acceptable tradeoff for the ability to go a day without wanting to drive a knife into my stomach.
Actually this would motivate me to transition because I would know that no one would judge me
Yeah totally (tho not looking for surgeries myself), I'd love to have my face always be smooth wirhout constant maintenance, and I'd love to be able to look down and see boobs there
100%. it wouldn’t affect my decision at all actually. i’m transitioning for me, not for everyone else. being comfortable in my skin is top priority
lol assuming I have any human interaction now
If I never had to interact with anyone again, I’d start my transition this second. What’s keeping me is the dear of what others will think
yeag
The only reason I haven’t done it yet is BECAUSE of human interaction. Also ADHD being a bitch but yknow.
Yes I want tiddy and better hips and a cuter face and I've wanted that since I was 14 years old.
My transition (and while I am cautious to speak for all trans people, I imagine most if not all of us) has nothing to do with *other* people. If my identity was decided based on other people, then I wouldn't have transitioned... because a lot of (cis) people treat us very poorly for it and don't want us to do it.

I think the problem is that a lot of cis people assume that trans people transition for attention, but I don't think any of us want being trans to be a focal point of how we're viewed by other people... which means that if being trans is getting us any attention, then it's probably not the kind that we want. 😳
Yes lol
I would have transitioned sooner
Oh fuck yes. No question at all. HRT is one of the best things ever to happen to me
..If It succesfully gets me what I want, then yes, definitely, a lot of cis people don't understand it. In fact, If I wouldn't interact with others I would do it sooner because I wouldn't feel all ashamed or scared of others their judgement. On the other hand, if I never had social interactions at all, I wouldn't really realize what I was missing/wanted in the first place so the option would have to be presented to me first.
💯 this is definitely it for me.  I'm transitioning for me.  Sure it'd be nice to pass in public for safety reasons, but the goal has always been to feel comfortable and happy in my own skin.
Yes, I would still want to transition. I much rather enjoy having estrogen be my primary hormone than testosterone. If I never had anymore human interaction, I could freely wear whatever feminine clothing I want without fear of judgement or harassment.
Same. I would still medically transition regardless, because I am still stuck in this body. I won't transition for others, I will do it for myself. Especially considering I'm nonbinary and there is nothing I can pass as, it's not like I'm going to fit in to society or whatever anyway.
If I had no human interaction I'm pretty sure I'd kill myself.
Well, yeah. In some ways, it would be way easier to transition if I didn't ever have to interact with anybody else.

It wouldn't do anything for my social dysphoria over being excluded from the sisterhood of women, but that wouldn't be any *worse* than I have it now, so...
Yes, but it would be easier meaning that I could transition to whatever stage  I want I guess. I wouldnt have the societal pressures of whats masculine or whats feminine like ""oh thats what a man does"" and vice versa. A lot of times when i think about transitioning I honestly feel like its heavily motivated by what society tells me what women ought to be and what men ought to be :/
Yes, I would too, I mean my psychiatrist asked me a similar question when I said I was trans he asked ""if everyone on the planet had no gender at all, including you, would you still want to transition?"" I mean, yes.
I agree, completely
Probably not. Because I wouldnt have people reminding me daily that how my body looks is what defines me.
100%. I'm myself no matter if there's other people around, I'm doing everything for me not for anyone else.  
if anything, would be even easier.
Yeah, I'm transitioning because my mind punismshes me if I don't and it gives me euphoria if I do so.
Oddly enough, that might actually make me feel able to transition.
Yes. I would 100% still transition.
Yes
No, I wouldn’t do anything. I wouldn’t be me if I couldn’t interact with anyone or has relationship. I would probably overdose or go clinically insane. I do transition because I relate to men as a woman. If I can’t talk to men again or have relationship with  anyone, I would like I said be clinically insane
Would still transition, even if id never see someone else again dysphoria wont leave me the fuck alone.
Would make it easier but also extremely difficult because I need people to talk to sometimes.
If you're talking about never interacting with any human (irl or through media) since birth, then most likely no. 
As there's no point of reference there's nothing transition into and no urge to do it. 

But if you're talking about no interactions with any human from now one, then definitely yes. I'm not transitioning for other people. I want to do it because I want my body to look a certain way. So as long as I can see my body I'll want to transition
Physically yes, socially... probably...the cloths are so much prettier. If anything, everything would be so much easier
I would definitely still transition. I see it as something I am doing 100% for myself because I deserve to represent that which is an essential part of my being in a physical manner. I deserve for the mental pains of dysphoria to go away and I will make it so.
We exist in reference to others. There is no self without how that self relates to other people and larger community and overall society. This is why solitary confinement is considered such horrible torture, it strips you of your own identity and feeling of existence. If I had never had a conversation with another person, I wouldn't have a conception of myself or a reference to compare myself agasint, much less a desire to transition.
This argument kind of erases people who are primarily socially dysphoric. Because the reality is we live in a society. And there is a variety of dysphoria. If I'm alone on an island there's no one there to tell me I'm not a man (ftm). There's no other men to compare to. There's no rules what a man is, how a man moves, what traits a man has, what hobbies a man likes. Of course you're valid in internal dysphoria and I acknowledge how difficult that is. But society forms a significant amount of the environment we move through in life and how we are perceived in that environment. There is a variety of dysphoria and I guess I'm saying this here because internal dysphoria is the only dysphoria I see acknowledged and I see this island scenario quite a bit.
I literally live alone in the woods. 

Answer is always yes.
I would have even less hesitation about it.
Absolutely!   I’m doing this for me…
Given that the biggest hurdle to me presenting as my gender in public right now is my fear of how I'll be treated...
Honestly I would rather kill myself then. I don't want to be a woman just to exist, I want to be a woman to live, love as woman, etc that all requires interactions.
Hell yes. My partner & I are aiming for living off grid eventually. My egg has only just cracked at 28 & I would 100% still be myself even if it was just for me.
Yes

This is not me
Yes
Yes. I am transitioning for me, not the world.
I feel like I’d… be a lot more comfortable tbh. And I might not even really transition. I already fit the idea of “me”, I guess, but I don’t fit the idea of me to anybody else. So I have to transition and look different and present differently to be that me to them, I guess? Thinking about this question actually answered a lot of questions about myself, so thank you. I’m “happy” as I am, just not happy about how I’m perceived.
Yup. I’m transitioning for me and nobody else. How other people see me or what they think of me is none of my damn business.
honestly even though i did interact with people throughout it i didn’t do it because of anyone but me in fact i did it despite several people. for me it’s always been about my mental health and my ability to feel comfortable in my own body and i think i’d do it again no matter what the circumstances
I'm transitioning for myself and for my own mental health; not for others. In fact, from a theory point, it would make this a lot easier. The fear of not knowing what will happen and believe it'll be always something bad...

I'll miss my good friend that at this point in my life I consider them really good ones and they're supporting a lot with this but I can deal with not speak with the rest of the world.
Well, no shit. Im not transitioning for other people.
Yes. I hardly socialization now, and i’m still transitioning
hell fucking yeah i already barely have human interaction
I would be more likely to transition. The fear of how others may react even violently and then being unable to hide my transness is something visceral that I'm considering now that my breast augmentation has been approved.
I may be in the minority, but I don't actually feel much disphoria from my interactions with others. It really is more about how I see myself, especially when I catch myself in the mirror on a bad day. So yea, have to agree, would still transition even if I never met another person, because it's about how I feel and what I see with my own eyes that matters
Harder yes
Not being a trans, I would have to support your position. As the mind is very powerful, snd if this what you need to complete yourself than do it.  Not as drastic as your transition, but I need to loose a 100#’s.  I’ve done 150, with bariatric surgery, but that final 100#’s would leave me with too much excess skin, that I really don’t want to deal with.
Hell yeah, I’ll destroy the universe to become the opposite gender
Makes me more likely to transition ngl
Yes. Whether I interact with others or not doesn't matter, at the end of the day my gender identity doesn't match the body I have
How would you get your pills, doctor recommendations, surgeries, hair removal, and advice if you have 0 human interaction? Gonna make your own pills? Perform your own bottom surgery? Even the trans community itself is “human interaction”

Hate to say it but sounds like you genuinely rely on advanced modern society to get you to where you want to be; instead, why not say: “If you never had any human interaction ever again, would you love yourself for who you are?”

If no, maybe seek some help frens
yes. i would.
This is actually one of my biggest (irrational) fears; that if I transitioned no one would talk to me for rest of my life, at least, not in a connected or meaningful way.
If I’m honest it’s one of my biggest hurdles.  I need people in my life.
I probably would. but at the same time I probably wouldn’t just because I don’t think I can really imagine a world without human interaction (at least online) I mean I ain’t a sociable girl AT ALL but loneliness is still a main factor on why I feel like shit all day so I probably would just feel very shitty all day and want to just lay down in bed. leading to eventually bot doing it
I dunno, picking between not transitioning and no human contact ever again is like picking between bubonic plague and cholera, both options suck and I probably wouldn’t live long either way
It would be hard for me to get the surgery I want without interaction with other humans but I absolutely would do it!
Oh hell yeah. 

Because then at least I wouldn't be paranoid people can read me. 

I wanna transition for me and me alone. These parts aren't mine and I especially don't wanna live with them if it's just gonna be me on my own. 

I'm the one who's gotta live with me and for me to fully enjoy thay that means transition even if I never talk to anyone ever again.
Idk how I'd get access to T or top surgery, but absolutely. It's for my own comfort more so than other people's
OMG, saaaame
Right? Literally all of my hesitation is around how other people will react.
Agree
Sooner? I think you mean right the fuck now
Yep, would have started like at 18 probably.
I think about this so often. I would have never detransitioned due to fear and I would have started transitioning way sooner
Came in to say exactly this. And in a way, of my three years transitioned, two have been during a pandemic where I don't really go out and do anything anyway...so that kind of did happen...
Same. I'm MTF pre everything. Still doubting about medical transition. But... If I never had to interact with anyone else ever, I would start hrt right now.
This 100%. As a person of mixed color who is acutely aware of most senses of ""passing"" are irrevocably entwined with whiteness, if I didn't have to interact with anyone ever again, it would make transition 1000 times less emotionally anguishing for me because I wouldn't be saddled with the fear of how I would turn out or be facing the terrifying reality that trans POC are killed at almost 10 times the rate of white trans people.
If I never had to deal with another human being my idea of femininity would become so abstracted I would never feel imposter syndrome. I would just change my body and develop habits and mannerisms that makes me feel better about myself
I just had this thought experiment internally while listening to a podcast about Castaway.

If I knew I'd be on a deserted island, and had a chance for any kind of prep or supplies, I would desperately try to make hormones one of those things. I want to be me, to grow toward me, like, as opposed to there *being no me*. 

Like, if it's gonna just be me, alone, damn straight I want to at a bare minimum feel like I *exist*.

Caverns of Socrates is a great metaphor. If that person who saw the true world was told they would be alone now, you can be damn sure they are going to pick bring alone while have sunshine on their face.
100%
I agree, for me. I feel a lot of the pressure to FULLY transition and do it quickly is from society as well. If I never had to talk to someone again, I’d probably just wear clothes I like more and act more like I want. I wouldn’t have to worry about how others perceive my gender, only how I perceive myself.
Oh, I completely agree with that. Being seen, accepted and interacting with the world as a woman is a big part of my transition. But I wanted to make the point to my friend that a big chunk of why I'm transitioning has nothing to do with other people.
No, I get it. At one point in my 20s I cut off all human contact because so many of my 'friendships' were toxic...

I'm now married and have a small handful of friends, but I've maintained a lot of the boundaries that I set up after that dark time of my life.
THIS THIS THIS.   


I've just started my transition process (MtF), but this exact question has been nagging at me constantly now. I feel like I would LOVE to transition and be a woman in every stereotypical way, but then I realize that probably a large reason I feel that way is because I exist in a social world around humans. If it was just me alone in the wilderness I would just accept myself as human like you mentioned.   


This definitely makes me doubt myself, but I also have to accept that I don't live in a hypothetical and I will probably never be able to remove myself from some sort of societal interaction.
No, this is exactly the thought process I had.

I mean, its just me in the shower, so why do I avoid looking down?

Its just me in the mirror, so why do I avoid it?
No prob! It felt validating to me to explain it to my friend that way and seeing them nod in understanding.

Granted, for me, this is just part of why I want to transition. Another big part of it is to actually interact with others as a woman and be seen and accepted that way.
Ha! I was thinking that I could ditch all the effort I'm putting into voice training!
Nah, I wasn't assuming you're the last person on earth. I actually had it in my head that you'd just go about your life as normal, but just not have to talk or interact with anyone.
I actually came to the realization by asking myself of being a woman would make it easier for me to deal with others. A big part of my transition is to experience interacting with others as a woman, but I would totally transition if in total isolation as well.
I almost did because of human interaction...

I'm way better now...

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Not since birth, that's way too speculative as you'd never be able to predict how you develop mentally through childhood with no human contact (even if you could solve the practical problems like food, hygiene, medical care, etc).

And I don't even mean never seeing another person ever again (empty earth scenario). I just mean living without trying to form any relationships with other people, no conversations, no friendships, every interaction limited to the smallest, least amount. (This is based on a period of my life where I actually lived like this for a little over a year.)
I never said anything about an island, and didn't say anything about not living in a society. I know many commenters have made that assumption, but that's not where I was going.

I personally have lived times of my life completely socially isolated, by choice, because of not being able to properly socialize with people. I still struggle with it, and I believe a majority of the reasons for these struggles is that I was subconsciously a woman trying to interact with people but them seeing only an awkward man. While in college, I lived for over a year barely saying more than ""hi"", ""thanks"", ""yes"" or ""no"" to the various people that I had to interact with (clerks at a store, classmates, members of the public), and for those people I had to have more communication with (family, college professors, etc), I kept it as short as possible.
i think i mean 30 years ago lmao
Yes. I live here, not a hypothetical. So answering the question might give me a new perspective or an opportunity for self-reflection but ultimately transition is what I need here.
>i live here

YES! YES! THIS!!     
it doesn’t matter if we transition for societal reasons because *we live in a society!* it doesn’t matter that gender is a construct, because *the constructed thing has a function in the world we live in!* we’re playing by the rules of a game we can’t fully opt out of, and we’re exploiting the loopholes in order to live in a way that’s most comfortable and authentic to us. there’s nothing wrong with that.
the thing is, though, it’s not *just* you in the mirror/shower. it’s also all the bagage/memories/assumptions/insecurities/messages from the outside world that you are bringing in with you in your alone times. you can’t fully separate yourself from it.

after being alone for a month, i’m pretty sure your mindset would change. (maybe not completely, but probably at least a little)
oops i replied to the wrong one lol
True.

I've been alone for extended periods of time. Before I realized I was trans, when traveling I would go days without seeing myself in a mirror, and completely enjoyed it, but I would still avoid looking at my own body when showering.

Since realizing I was trans and started transition, if I'm in a similar traveling situation, I find I occasionally want to look at myself in the mirror to see if I see him or her. Seeing her makes me feel good. Seeing him is jarring."	ski19k	trans	1022	0.99	2022-02-04 16:48:04
Am I in the wrong?	"UPDATE: well guys I was right that I might not get therapy if I told. I told my psychiatrist and she thought she was bad too. And told my mom but my mom decided to tell my therapist everything I said about her. And my therapist kept going on and on about how manipulative I am. And how she doesn’t want to work with me but she has bc I have attachment issues. My mom just came into my room today and told me I can’t get another therapist. I asked why and she gave me a bs answer. I can’t wait to get the hell out of this house




So today in therapy I started talking about me being transmasc n stuff. And she started to mention that people that undergo hormones and surgery become more suicidal than when they didn’t do that. I told her I don’t think that’s true Bc a lot of trans people are more suicidal if they don’t get confirmation surgery. But she didn’t listen. Then I was talking about how I don’t see me in the mirror and then she said “you’re beautiful” then I told her I don’t like that word but she still called me beautiful again. Then she was talking about a kid around my age than underwent confirmation surgery and now they running around saying they want commit on tiktok Bc they had the surgery( I don’t think that’s true Bc I think somebody passed a bill where I live that minors can’t have hormones or surgery) then she told me that I will never be a man no matter what I do. That shit hurt. Then she started comparing confirmation surgery to Michael Jackson’s nose surgery. And I tried to explain to her that plastic surgery is very different from gender confirmation surgery. But she didn’t listen. She don’t understand gender dysphoria is different than just hating your body. Like I told her I tried to give myself top surgery this weekend but she did not care. She also mentioned she right wing but that had nothing to do with what she told me I think she’s getting her facts off a unreliable source tbh. Am I in the wrong? Or Do I just really hate the feminine parts of my body? Yo please tell me I need answers"	"New therapist time if you ask me
A lot of people are saying get a new therapist, but from your replies it seems like that’s not an option. Sometimes, no therapist is better than a bad therapist. If the therapist isn’t supporting you and is clearly dangerously misinformed, then not seeing them anymore- even if that means you don’t have a therapist- may be the best option. Medical trauma from therapists is a real and damaging thing. You have to weigh whether any help you’re getting from this person is worth the hurt.
This is a very transphobic therapist who is abusing her position to convince trans people they aren’t trans. This person needs to lose their license
Depending on your state/country that may be extremely illegal. I'd recommend checking your local laws first, and if the law is in your favor consider reporting them/going to court. 

Also, look into your therapists terms of service (it might not be called that, but many will have something similar), and your local laws to see if you can record the audio of the session without their knowledge. A recording of your therapists clearly going against the standard of care will be a lot more serious than just your word.
pro tip: if anyone says ""you'll regret it"" or ""lots of people regret it"", huge red flag of misinformation and/or transphobia
I'm a therapist. This level of professional ignorance is inexcusable. Unfortunately, many therapists lack the requisite understanding of LGBTQ2 issues needed be helpful and not harmful to those in the community. You are not in the wrong, your therapist is just pathetically unequipped to serve trans clients. I'd get fired for saying that kind of shit to you
I am a therapist. This is abusive and actually against the law. This person can lose their license for this. I would contact an attorney. If you can get them to stop practicing therapy entirely it is a good thing for you, and every other trans person they will damage in the future.
there is scientific evidence to the contrary. give me a minute and I'll find the study. It was about trans youth and idk how old you are but regardless I'll find the study and link it here in a minute. trans health care is life saving with an incredibly low regret rate especially when compared to other life saving medical procedure.

Edit: https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext

if you're not used to reading scientific papers, scroll to the table, there's a column for percentages of trans kids who didn't receive gender affirming cards and a colimn for kids who did receive gender affirming care, the instances of depression and suicide decreases when trans kids get gender affirming treatment. Not increases. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or willfully denying science. 

This study references some other good studies, such as one where 0 out of 80 respondents regretted their transition. usually the numbers I read are around a 1% or less regret rate. for medical procedures of ANY kind that's STRIKINGLY low. Mastectomies and chemo for cancers do not have that low a regret rate. Sometimes transphobes will reference studies that show that gender dysphoria is a rapid onset social contagion among teens, but this is based on studies where unaccepting critical PARENTS of the children were surveyed and the trans kids opinions were not considered. Refer to Brie Hanrahan's article ""A reasonable person's guide to the jk Rowling article"" for more debunking of the poor excuse for science that transphobes use to try to create the idea of regret.

But one thing I wanna say is that, of course the science is on our side, and a lot of transphobes know that deep down. You can find well researched peer reviewed literature that shows trans healthcare is good and low risk and incredibly effective, but you don't have an obligation to argue your own existence. you CAN cite your sources on why trans healthcare is a positive, but you shouldn't have to and transphobes don't care if you do most the time. You don't have to argue for your existence.
Nope, done. Find a new therapist. She's more interested in defending her worldview than your mental health.

YOU are fine. And need a clean clear space so you can figure out the path to what you want, whatever that is. She's not capable of giving you that. Drop her like a bad habit.

I really hesitate to say the next part, but.. it might be time to end therapy if she won't leave it alone. She can actively make the whole thing worse. If your parents won't let you switch, lock in on developing the skills you need to be independent. Dive into learning how to budget, extra cheap meals, how to write a resume, all the things like that. Use that as an armor and just get through the next few years so you can go when it's time.  


Make sure you have copies of your paperwork- your birth certificate, ssn (if you're from the states) all the things you need to prove who you are.
That therapist is transphobic and regardless their factually wrong.
She shouldnt even have her job. Thats unbelievably screwed up. 

1: shes invaliding gender dysphoria which is a diagnosable condition

2: she told you her political position which is extremely unprofessional 

3: you mentioned you attempted to harm yourself by preforming your own surgery and she did not mentally evaluate you for being at a potential risk of self harm or worse

4: shes pushing her personal opinions on you about your transition 

5: she doesn't respect your boundaries about the language she uses

6: shes comparing you to the experience of other people
A therapist who ignores basic facts you can google is a hack. This therapist doesn’t understand or care about you my guy. You deserve to be happy, no matter where you find it.
Hi hello. Not an expert by any means, but while i’m college I did a few research papers on the LGBTQ+ community, as well as the trans community specifically. Every single peer reviewed paper I found reported significantly less suicidality and depression as trans people underwent physical transitioning.
New therapist
You are not in the wrong. That is a bad therapist who does not believe in actual research and facts. She is trying to push her own transphobic agenda. I would stop going to her and leave bad reviews warning other people if that is an option.
Okay so some thoughts.

Although it varies from state to state, where I am (and most places afaik) ""Therapist"" is not a term regulated by the government. Anyone with a pen and a piece of cardstock can put up a sign claiming to be a therapist and charge money for sessions. Now obviously I don't know the woman you're talking about, and if she uses the terms ""counselor"", ""psychologist"", or ""psychiatrist"" there's a much higher probability she went through some actual schooling, but the next time you're at her office I would see if there's any information about her actual job title (business cards, signage, degrees on walls, etc).

It's certainly not impossible that someone with technical competency would be so blatantly biased against their clientele but that raises my eye brows, especially when you mentioned that your parents denied you access to another option. There's a certain subset of the ""therapy"" crowd who identify themselves as 'christian counselors' or something similar (not certain as counselor does tend to be regulated to my knowledge, but counselor is a comparatively low rung on the ladder of mental health professionals so bigots making their way to such positions is more believable.) 

These people by and large won't help you with trans issues. They won't affirm your gender identity, they won't be knowledgeable enough to help you even if they wanted to, and they CERTAINLY won't help you get HRT. In fact, even aside from any trans stuff I would expect whatever advice they give you to be filtered through the ever-giving lens of ""christian love"" so I wouldn't expect her to be of any help at all, to be honest.

If I were in your position and they wouldn't let me switch to a better fitting option, I would stop going entirely. If they're going to make you go, there's nothing they can do to make you talk. Sometimes all you can do is buckle down and weather the storm, and that's okay. Just know that better days are coming, and *know* that you have the strength to make it through this, okay? If you ever need to talk my DMs are open. Currently working my way through undergrad as a psychology student so I might know a thing or two about a thing or two, but first and foremost I'm a friend to talk to and an ear to listen.

much love ❤️
I say this as a therapist. You must stop seeing her. She is doing you far, far more harm than no therapist at all. Imagine a dentist that chisels random cracks into your teeth. Would you say ""they were the only one you had?"" If your parents ""won't let"" you stop seeing her, then you need to sit silently, playing on your phone, for the duration of your session. She can only harm you psychiatrically.
Please don't diminish or excuse what they did or think there is any ambiguity here: you did nothing wrong. This therapist's comments should be grounds for losing whatever license they have. Their comments were absolutely unacceptable.

Report that therapist to the relevant licensing authority. It isn't their role to push their individual opinion of a client's issue.
I would call the clinic and report her if you feel comfortable doing so they are there to listen and support you their ways telling you otherwise is against therapy
Jeez are you seeing the same one I went to? Mine did the exact same thing with me.
Sounds like the type of therapist transphobes send you to to try to ""change your mind/cure you/ get you back on God's path / whatever else nonsense""
This is not a good therapist. I would report her.
Your therapist doesn't know how to treat trans people. She's actively taking steps that increase her patients' risk of mental illness, self harm, and suicide. Find a new therapist and warn anyone you feel safe enough to tell about never going to her.

I say this as someone with a PhD in sociology whose field of expertise is sexual and gender minority population health: every single thing she is doing is known to profoundly negatively impact trans people's well-being.
She is waaaaaaay wrong and is doing harm.
How dose that therapist have a job still
Yikes. This is a very bad therapist.

From what youve said in comments it sounds like you're not in a good home situation. Please don't give up. You may have to be in survival mode for a while. It may feel like you'll never get through it, like it's an eternity. Please don't give up. Get through each day.

One day you'll be 18 and that long slog will have earned you a whole life on the other side that is all your own. It won't be easy, but you'll be able to move away from your parents, to a place where you will be be accepted and be able to find therapists and doctors who will respect you for who you are.

In the meantime, do what you have to to stay alive. If it's available, finding an LGBT youth group with supportive adult leaders could be a lifeline.
She's absolutely horrible at being a therapist. Not only is she CLEARLY not fit for the job, but therapists should NEVER talk about their political views in a way that is used against you.
Gross. She sounds like a right wing fox news addict to me. She's getting her information and her ideology and her personality directly from old white dudes who don't even know what the fuck they're talking about, in regards to literally anything. 

She's %40000 wrong.  

Also you can be trans and hate the feminine parts of your body. I'm a trans man and I came close a few times to DIY top surgery because the dysphoria is killing me. 

Find someone who knows how to do their job and actually listen to their patient and do a better job of providing accurate help, instead of just making it worse.
Well, she sounds toxic AF. Whether transitioning is or isn’t right for you… the way she responded to you is highly irresponsible. Get a new therapist or at the very least, stop seeing her. I wouldn’t not trust her with anything after receiving such an obviously biased response to a very complex topic.
If your parents dont let you change therapists then no longer talk to her. if you have to show up, refuse to talk to her.
You can report her for that, the clinic should have the information posted somewhere, like maybe the wall in the waiting room. 

And no, you are absolutely correct.  Family support alone decreases the risk of suicide about 50%, and actual transition is so, so helpful for mental health. I transitioned in 2020 and my dysphoria is significantly decreased. Like I would have intrusive thoughts about trying to diy surgery, and I permanently fucked up my ribcage binding so tight. I distanced myself from feminine things and softness to try and be seen as anything but a girl. Transitioning has allowed me to embrace those things again. 

I recently built myself a bed with lilac and pink curtains, and two weeks ago went to a doctor's appointment in full lolita style. I looked like a frilly cupcake and it was glorious. No matter what I wear, no matter what I like, I'm not a girl.  And the freedom of not trying to either force myself to be one, or of trying to distance myself from it, has been so amazing.

Detransitioning is extremely rare. Like, not even 1% of trans folks rare. And the majority of those who detransition do so due to lack of support, bullying, etc. You know who you are. 

If being confrontational isn't your thing, check your local laws and if it's legal, start recording these therapy appointments, to start documenting what she is saying to you. If you can't, try at least keeping a journal. She is very much violating all kinds of ethics codes, and could potentially lose her license for this. 

No one, NO ONE, has the right to treat you this way. Please try and report it, and seek help from a trusted adult.
I missed that this was their therapist and now I've gone from more of a wtf that's a bad friend/person/whatever to what the FUCK how the hell does this person have a license to be a therapist??
From your replies, you need to call CPS. Or raise a stink at the clinic where the therapist works. Tell someone she's enabling your family's abuse. I know it's scary and if talking about it here helps you definitely should but nothing is going to change if you don't say anything.
You are not in the wrong 

Do what you think will help you feel more like yourself regardless of what your therapist says
[deleted]
She’s absolutely wrong. Transition saved my life. Hormones decreased my suicidal thoughts more than anything ever has.
I am almost certain she is violating some sort of ethics code as a therapist here.  
I would report her behaviour and get a new therapist.
Gate keeper fire her ass
Yeah, you ain’t in the wrong, mate. The fact that she dismissed you trying to give yourself top surgery? And not listening when you said you don’t like being called beautiful? Yeah, you’re not in the wrong, mate. I’m sorry about your therapist, mate, and don’t doubt yourself. You’re in the right.
she is not anywhere near qualified to be a therapist ! honestly, i'd try to find a online therapist rather than this one, if you can't find that i'd honestly just chat to an experienced friend, this person shouldn't be anywhere near a therapist office.
you can love the feminine parts about your body and still be a man
New Therapist, also sue for malpractice as she's quite clearly biased and follows an anti-trans ideology which is harmful to patients.

This is in direct violation of her hipocratic oath and could see her struck off if you're not the first to complain
New therapist or dump her. I was waiting for a therapist for individual speech therapy, and thet gave me a therapist who didn't even read a report sent to her months ago, it didn't work out and I couldn't get a new one, so I spoke with my mom and ageed that it wasn't going to work out and we went back on the waiting list. No therapist is better than one who disregards your feelings.
awful, disrespectful, and unprofessional. this person shouldn't be a therapist
That are so many red flags. Youre absolutely not wrong. 
Ive heard 'Why would you change, youre beautiful' too. I never found myself ugly I just never saw myself. Luck for me Ive never seen that guy again.

You got this bro! 
Ignore that gint bs if you can. You are already a real man and no shit like what she said can change that.
And you can be complete stealth. It is pretty common as FtM (dont know by MtF, sorry ladys).
She's psycho. I'd stop going if your parents won't let you see another one. I'd also report her. Going to her is more harmful than good obviously.
Absolutely untrue; the opposite is in fact true: trans gender people offered affirming therapy, including HRT etc are LESS likely to be depressed and entertain suicide.

This sounds like a conversation therapist not a supportive one
new therapist, if you can't get a new one, fuck around with her. no use in complying with somebody who doesn't want the best for you. mess with her and troll her

If she admits that she's right wing then she definitely gets her shit of unreliable sources and listening to her or telling her more could be dangerous to you.
As a future therapist I can safely say just through the entire therapist out. Therapists should be open to all patients.
I’m not sure why this popped up on my feed as I’m your typical middle aged white dude who doesn’t really know shit about being trans. That said, even with me having no idea what you’re going through I can tell you this therapist sucks.
If she works for a practice and is not private then go to her practice about it. Inform them of what she is doing and how she is treating/talking to you. That’s waaaay out of line and so beyond unethical that it’s disgusting. She could straight up be fired for shit like that and should be. If it is a private practice then go to someone else if possible. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. That’s not right at all.
Sounds like you need a new therapist dude.  She sounds like a total misinformed dingus that shouldn't be interacting with the general public in a professional capacity.  I'd report her to whatever licensing board she got her licenses from.
Your therapist is an awful human being, to include being extremely transphobic. Don't let her give you imposter syndrome!
I've read so much of this thread, and it's just made me angrier and angrier.

My random anonymous internet brother \[I think?  Being repulsed at 'beautiful' I'm reading that as FtM, if I have it ass backwards I am so so so sorry and please correct me\]...this goes beyond a shitty therapist.  This goes WAY beyond a shitty therapist.  Thank you so much for speaking up.

Call CPS yourself...ideally the agent who handled the first report.  Call whoever made the initial report...your first therapist, I think?  Call any other mandatory reporter.  This is a very very ***very*** clear case of child abuse, and it's blatantly obvious your parents are moving you from school to school and from therapist to therapist in an attempt to cover up that they're abusing you by surrounding you with adults who are supposed to be there to help you but are instead helping them.

Please...for your sake, don't just wait this out.  The right people can get you out of there, can get you into foster care with loving/supportive foster parents, can get that therapist into so much hot water with their ethics board they can never abuse their profession to hurt anyone again.
She’s too busy pushing her views onto you which is not what therapy is about. She’s too much in her ego and not focused on YOU and YOUR needs. If therapy is ever hindering you or your mental health maybe its time to pause and think. Therapy is supposed to help you navigate what’s yours, not theirs. No one needs to be pushing their views on you. Especially when they’re getting paid.
Don’t pay her, find someone who is actually a therapist who cares about you. I have more colorful things to say but I’ll leave it at that.
Jfc I would just walk out at that point
That’s a bad doctor acting in bad faith. Tell her to go fuck a truck, and find someone who will actually care about you!
You're not wrong at all, and this is similar to the exact reason I left my therapist. During my last visit, she was totally dismissive about hearing me when I talked about transitioning and trying to pass, and when I expressed that I was trying my best to dress like a man, she looked me up and down and remarked rudely ""you don't look like a boy."" (Everything i was wearing, i bought from the men's section, and i felt infantized because I was in my mid 20s at the time and prefer to be referred to as a man, not a boy.)
She sounds like about as good a therapist as my friend's homo/transphobic stepfather, who is a therapist. I do not feel safe around that man.
It sounds like this person wasn't interested in helping you plus if she's right wing those people aren't about trans people transitioning they'd rather we conform to their ideals of normal even if we suffer. My advice find another therapist ASAP
So she's just making up shit at this point?
Both your parents and therapist sound like horrible people. I'm sorry OP. Perhaps go NC with your folks once you move out they don't deserve you.
I agree with the response that you should report her because what she’s doing is illegal and dangerous.
Your therapist is a transphobes, that’s not a way to approach those kind of questions in any sense. Please find someone who is knowledgeable on the subject 💖 best wishes
I'd suggest getting a new therapist.
Your therapist is a transphobe and you need a new one.
your therapist has been hanging around too many terfs.
Stop going. Problem solved.
https://imgur.com/a/DanauE6
Who is this person?
If you feel like a man, and want to be one, then that's what you are. Simple as that.

Your therapist is clearly still stuck in the past, she's repeating generic and typical transphobic misinformation.
Yea get new therapist. What country do you live in? I know many transgendered people from the countries where it is illegal and it hurts me to see them suffer.
I would talk to someone higher up if I was you, without your parents knowing, try to tell someone else in that place that she is gaslighting her own patient and forcing her opinions on you which is something therapists aren’t supposed to do
Sounds like it’s time for a new therapist
Get a new therapist shes in the wrong and was just trying to convince you of some bullshit ur not in the wrong and you are a man even if you still have your feminine parts don't listen to her  your feelings and identity are valid :)
This sounds more like an issue that your therapist has with trans people in general tbh, you're not in the wrong at all dude.
She was abusing you
She sounds awful and like she could do more harm than good
That's not a real therapist; that's a bigot who managed to get a D or higher on like 10 tests.
as another trans person who was abused as a teenager— this is not worth it. this isn’t therapy, even— it’s just more abuse! i know this part of your life seems like it’s going to last forever, like it’ll never be over— but it will be. really soon, it will be. just focus on keeping yourself as healthy and if possible happy as you can be. ditch your therapist— tell your parents she threatened you, and if that doesn’t work you can anonymously report her for threatening you. since there are no other therapists around who’ll help, try some online free options. insight timer is an amazing app that’s free for everyone, it has everything from meditation to anxiety and trauma meltdown support. there are communities of survivors on there who can help you. if you have any friends whose parents are cool, ask if you can stay with them sometimes— any nights away from home in that situation is really good for you. i had a friend whose parents were awesome— they had me over all the time, and i actually converted to judaism later in life because of how kind and accepting they were, all of the holidays i spent at their house, etc. if you can get a job (i don’t know how old you are or how feasible that is) you can start saving money for later on now. if you’re too young to work, try doing odd jobs for people in your neighborhood who you’re comfortable with. nice old ladies who are frail might need help with the garbage or their gardening and might be willing to give you a twenty or something. keep the money secret from your parents— find a good hiding place. i know this isn’t really what you asked for advice on, but i’ve been there and i wish i could go back and tell myself all of these things. also, if you’re ever in crisis mode, you can always call or text a hotline at the trevor project that’s specifically for lgbt teenagers https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ they have a ton of amazing resources if you haven’t been recced them already. also in case you need a lot of advice videos, alexbertie on youtube started filming his transition when i was a teenager, so his whole transition for like a decade is on youtube, documented with lots of helpful hints, tricks, etc. he’s a really nice guy as far as i know, and he really helped me a lot. i’m gonna stop typing now because this is a block, but we’re all here for you and sending a lot of love your way, man
Please, please, PLEASE get away from this fucking monster. She should have her license yanked--and depending  on which state you live in, she will if you report her. 

She is so wrong and so full of shit on so many things she told you, that for you to go back to her for any more ""therapy"" is simply impossible. Never, EVER talk to this incompetent, hateful chupacabra again. 

If you live in California, report her to the Medical Board of Quality Assurance. 

Meanwhile for YOU, find another therapist--a GENDER therapist. Make sure she's LGBTQIA+ friendly, and you can check if you do a  search on the Psychology Today therapist website. 

Let me assure you this person is totally full of shit. Believe NOTHING Shen told yiu. She wanted to hurt you , and it sounds like she succeeded. 

If you have specific questions about how you're dealing with your trans sensibilities, please DM me and I'll try to help--as a trans chick. whose dearest friend is a transmasculine person. 

But regardless: Never, EVER see this awful woman again...
Askjfskfjkl bro, you need to ditch that therapist (if you can even call her that) right away, she is blatantly violating everything a therapist is supposed to stand for, also report her if you can
Your therapist is filled with horseshit. She’s pushing her ideals onto you along with misinformation and is downright putting you down for wanting to feel comfortable in your own body in a way that’s non-conservative/traditional. I am so so sorry she traumatized you like that. I also suggest you stop seeing her as soon as possible, for your own safety. If you feel comfortable with doing so I’d also make sure other trans and or non-binary people give her any business before anyone else gets treated as poorly as you were. You are handsome. You are brave. Don’t let a shitty therapist get to you. 💙
Hey, dude, that therapist is full of bs, she's a bad person. I have trauma too, and trust me, it's better to be alone than with abusive people like your therapist. If you're going to school, talk to the counselor or any teacher you trust, they'll report to CPS. If you're not going to school you should call CPS yourself and no matter what, if you ever feel threathened, you ever feel someone is going to hurt you or someone did hurt you, you can call the emergency number.
You're right. She is on the wrong. I assume that she's cis, so she shouldn't be talking over trans voices. My advice: change your therapist
I would from now on just sit there in silence. This isn't therapy. She isn't doing her job. 
I believe it would be a win win situation. Parents get mad that you're not talking. Rafi fix up talk to a different one. If not then they are wasting their money, you get an hour's respite from them
Your therapist is unhinged and I'm unsure how they have a job
Listen, I read a lot of posts like this and think people are whiners (so mean, I know) but fucks sake, man, this isn't okay. This therapist is not going to work out for you. I have so much to say about this but I'm trying to be controlled here. *Do you have a way to switch therapists?*
Report her to some sort of union or education facillity
Report her - at minimum she won’t see you anymore
You did nothing wrong. This therapist is deeply misinformed in the best case. In the worst case this person tries to drive everyone back to their assigned gender at birth and doesn’t believe being trans is a valid state.

Please contact the licensing body she uses and report this behavior. She has hurt you, spread misinformation, and can do the same to others.
One thing you always have to remember: no one is infallible, just because she is therapist doesn't mean she can't be wrong about those things. Of course I don't mean ""trust no one"" but don't let yourself be blinded by titles either.
You are not in the wrong. She is full of shit and is a terf. I'm really sorry you had to deal with that. Reading the comments I understand that unfortunately you can't get a new therapist, which I'm really sorry because that sucks.
Ah you need to find a therapist who you can trust this person sounds sketchy! Very!
Therapist pushing their views on a patient? Fired.
refuse to speak with her, if you can’t find a new one and/or stop seeing her. she is a horrible person and shouldn’t be a therapist.
Please note that “Christian Therapy”/“Christian Counseling”/“Reparative Therapy” for LGBT+ people is essentially Conversion Therapy without some of the more physical parts. The psychological traps, gaslighting, training you to not trust yourself, and training to abdicate your own sense of what is right to external authorities are still there. It is still psychological abuse.
Yeah she’s completely fucking nuts, and as a trans person in school for therapy she really should be losing her licence. It’s rock solid science that trans people who get affirming care and therapy have excellent outcomes, and that high suicide rate that psychopaths love throwing around is a number only found in trans people who are given the treatment you are. Stay strong and get a new therapist, she’s doing more harm than good.
She is only write on one thing and even then she is still wrong : when you will go on T or E it's possible that you experience mood swing, it's totally normal (just like before having period people have a change of mood because of T or when trans women have '' hormonal '' periode once a month)

Anyways, having drastic change of hormone *can* make you suicidal for a short period. It doesn't mean that you aren't trans or anything, it just mean that your body need a moment

I quickly see this in my psychology class so I may be wrong on some point ^ ^
Wow you need to get yourself a different therapist and if comfortable- report her ass!! This is blatantly bad, disingenuous, false, transphobic  info!!
This may be a case of “no therapist at all is better than a therapist gaslighting you for your parents’ entertainment”
I’m so sorry. I commented before reading (I know :/) but you are strong enough to tell either the school counselor, or call the state licensing board, if there’s any other adults around that accept you, tell them. This is an abuse tactic. I’m so angry for you 🤬😡🤬
I’d honestly say tell her that you won’t accept her treating you this way. You’re a man. She needs to treat you as such and that transphobia is a hate crime.
You are not in the wrong and you're definitely not powerless in this situation! I went through something similar with a psychiatrist last year and this is what I did. If you call or email the clinic that your therapist works for and tell them what happened, then you can report the therapist without having to talk to the therapist directly or involve your parents. I recommend an email because then you can include sources proving the therapist wrong and have a paper trail of how they respond. The YouTuber Jammidodger is a trans man who did his doctorate research on how medical transition lowers the risk of suicide in trans men who want it and he posted a video about it last year with the study linked in the description. The clinic should already have your insurance and payment information on file, so then you can switch therapists without your parents finding out. You deserve to have access to a good therapist. If you need immediate help, The Trevor Project has a phone number and an online chat service where you can talk to trans-friendly therapists for free.
Let us call her and shame her. That'd be fun.
I’m like. 90% sure that that is, at the very least, unethical, considering the overwhelming majority of the medical community, especially within the field of neurology, hasn’t recognized gender dysphoria as an illness or anything like that for at least 3 years, so practicing therapy and treating as though it were (which it’s arguable that’s what she’s doing cuz from what you’ve said it doesn’t sound like she made any official clinical recommendations, but I think that’s absolutely what she’s doing) would be unethical at best. Definitely tell her to kick rocks and find someone who doesn’t suck at least. Sorry you’re going through that. I just got a new therapist and I’m sorta worried cuz I told her I wanted to start hormones and get top surgery as soon as is possible and she told me I should slow down, which I kinda get cuz the context is I’m starting life completely over again after a severe mental health crisis, but at the same time I told her how happy it will make me and how happy even just getting to dress how I want and learning how to do makeup has made me, so I’m not sure what exactly I should wait for and even tho I don’t think she meant it to be like that, it kinda *feels* like it, so I’m gonna feel it out over a few more sessions. But in your case definitely find a new one as soon as you can, if they’re refusing to recognize a fundamental part of who you are they aren’t going to be able to help you in any meaningful way.

ETA: just read your responses about not being able to get a new therapist. That’s fucked I’m sorry. Me personally I would just go to every session with headphones on and not say shit cuz whatever clinic your going to *will* drop you as a client basically immediately so at least you wouldn’t have to see her. However, if it’ll cause serious issues with your parents that you don’t think you’d want to deal with until you can be free of their control, please don’t be like me lol.
Hun please don't preform surgery on yourself.
It... Is generally less safe, and I have at least heard (correct me if I'm wrong) that it could decrease your chances of getting help from medical professionals down the line. I think it's something to do with viewing it as the person being unstable or something.

That out of the way though...
Your therapist sounds like they have zero understanding or knowledge into trans people. 
Like, even if they don't specialize in it, it sounds more like their biases are interfering in their ability to actually help you.
To me it sounds like she shouldn’t be a therapist.
get rid of the therapist
The reason Michael Jackson got a rhinoplasty was because he suffered an injury prior. It was a corrective surgery. But he had not yet been diagnosed with lupus. This causes tissue destruction, which can be aggravated with surgery. But it was too late. 

I would like to point out that yes, plastic surgery is most of the time highly unnecessary. But in some cases, it is surely required for many trans people to have any hope in passing. I am in that bracket. While I personally do not need bottom surgery, I desperately need a rhinoplasty. Even as a guy I had a larger than average nose. 

In the case of SRS causing suicidal thoughts, this is actually true. But it's not for the reason people like to assume. When it is botched, it can lead to chronic pain. This is specifically because care for trans people overall is severely lacking. SRS is also still in its infancy. And naturally, we are not suicidal because of anything involving being trans, but rather because we are treated so horribly by society. 

For your particular situation regarding your therapist. She has crossed several lines. She is not a therapist. Their job is to listen to your problems and try to offer some form of guidance. The only thing close to betrayal would be disregarding this trust to protect you or others from harm (due to violent thought patterns). I didn't have to, but I tried to pick apart everything I knew moderately well regarding this quack.
Keep reporting her and let people know not to go to her. I hope you’ll eventually be able to get a new therapist.
Least the therapist tried being polite. I typed up a 7 paragraph rant but meh not important. I'll just say at least your therapist didn't tell you to stop wasting time.

Whereas confirmation surgery/hormonal transition may help some trans people, oftentimes it is not the definite solution. It won't wash away your gender dysphoria completely, same way as cosmetic surgery won't solve body dysmorphia.

That being said, I would like if your T would have provided some evidence based study on the suicidal rates when transitioning, instead of using anecdotal data.

Also, rephrasing ""you will never be a man"" would be necessary. Surely she meant that your chromosomes will always be XX, therefore, you will be prone to women's health issues (autoimmunity diseases and such).

Regarding confirmation surgery, it is indeed cosmetic, you don't get a fully functional physiological twin penis or vagina, but it can serve the purpose of reducing gender dysphoria / body dysmorphia.

Overall, she doesn't seem to be able to help you. Either for being biased or ignorant on the topic. 

Your struggles and identity are valid and should be taken seriously and with care. That doesn't mean that transitioning should be taken lightly. Having a deeper look at transitioning and adjusting expectations are necessary imo.
Yea I wish I could get a new one but I can’t Bc my parents won’t let me. I’ve posted about her multiple times Bc she’s just a mad therapist
This ""therapist"" sounds more like danger to you than helpful. So bad and wrong in so many places. Absolutely, gender confirmation intervention is life-saving. That's the global, medical opinion. Ignoring you? Then saying you're beautiful is pretty much misgendendering you. I don't think this woman is safe, or should be treating you. 
Perhaps you could write down (or copy/paste this thread) the stuff she's said to you, and also print out some information on the importance gender-affirming care and give it to your parents, asking for a new therapist. This woman sounds like she's trying to convert you, not help you. Danger signs all over. Good luck. X
Agreed new therapist wtf
And maybe worth filing a complaint against this one.
Well I used to be very unstable so I got sent to a hospital for that by my old counselor( I loved her) but my parents took me out Bc they called cps on my mom and they were supporting me and trying to help me.
I agree that no therapist at all would be better than this one. Is there any avenue school, out anyone else in your community where you can find a trans-informed therapist?
A way you do it is find their license number by searching it on the BBS (board of behavioral sciences) website. You can file a report there. Admittedly I'm only familiar with california law, but other states use the BBS.
therapy is largely unregulated so it is totally possible they don’t even have a license in the first place as there is no “official qualification” you have to get to call yourself a “therapist”
[removed]
It’s prob not illegal Bc I live in a VERY red state not a speck of blue lol
She’s is the only therapist near me( an hour away) that even mentioned that she is ok working with gay people
Exactly, people like this are why trans suicide rates are the way they are. They need to go.
Print out this article and bring it to your next session OP.  If the therapist will keep saying it with the facts in front of her, you’ll know she’s willing to make stuff up to align with her beliefs
Yea I’ve been trying to prepare to get out of my house since I was 14. It’s just a waiting game now
She once told me if I go back to a mental hospital that she would send me to the worst one she can find.
She’s the only person I have I can’t get another Bc parents :(
Thankyou that means a lot. And I never knew there were Christian therapists out  there. I guess I know why I wasn’t allowed to choose.
I don’t know her first name Angie?
That is absolutely appalling. We get that shit from friends, parents, co workers, classmates etc. NO ONE needs that from their therapist.
These people habe a way of piercing you with statements and questioning until you talk. 
This whole story is so abusive!
No that’s not really she told me plain as day that being trans is not real thing and like people who think they trans Bc they hate their bodies and it’s another psychological problem.
also, you are not even slightly in the wrong, you are a strong and brave young man who is doing what's right for himself, don't listen to a word of her bullshit.
Someone trying to hurt you and who's too cowardly to say that where other people can read it. Disregard them.
I am in the US
Thanks that means alot. I just wanted say that’s a big coincidence Bc I am planning to convert to Judaism when I am older!
No unfortunately not
I love Jammie!

Ugh, and I’m guessing your parents like her because her views align with theirs? Gods forbid a therapist do their job and be impartial and objective while still being warm enough to be approachable. Someone that can actually help you sort your thoughts and feelings instead of actively rallying against them to push their agenda.
She needs to be reported to the licensing board tbh. She is not only failing to do her job, but is actively working against her patient's interests.
Just stop actually talking to the therapist or get on a different topic and waste both your parents and your therapist’s time, and your parent’s money.
Honestly why go to therapy if the therapist doesn't want to help you apparently. Sounds like a huge waste of time and money
It's better to have no therapist than a therapist who will put you down, gaslight you, deny your experiences and make you feel worse! You can already get all that every other day of the week. She should be fined. This is not okay.
Sounds like your parents are trying to force you through conversion therapy.
I’m sorry you lost access to your old counselor. That is a really difficult situation to be in.
All the pieces are falling together perfectly in this puzzle. ~~How old are you and what state are you in hun?~~
Therapists in many places are “mandatory reporters”. If there was cause for CPS to be called, your parents seem to have selected someone who will cover up what is going on and happily downplay anything you say.

Find an adult, possibly a school counselor, and talk to them.  They may be able to help you with reporting and getting you to a safer and more supporting situation.
I believe you can call CPS yourself, it's something to consider.
Nope closets therapist that has their names in their bio is 2 hours away :(
What country are we talking about here??
Unsure why we are playing devils advocate here but yes either way they would be pushing an agenda which is abusing their position of power over their patients. It’s irresponsible, unprofessional, and just plain gross. That situation is more than likely nonexistent tho as it’s usually the patient that brings up being trans and not the doctor. The doctor usually dissuades patients from thinking they’re  trans or forces them to prove it in some silly way
Whataboutism. Love to see it /s
1) we live in the future my friend! Distance is not an issue anymore, it's really easy to find an all online therapist, I might be able to point you in the right direction if you want. 

2) the color of your state doesn't really matter that much in this case, since this would be a part medical ethics/standard of care, which is determined by a board of professionals rather than by politicians. As far as I know, almost every state has a part of their ethical standards saying that a licensed practitioner can't give you A)blatant and provably false information, and B)can't say or do things that are ""clearly racist, homophobic, sexist, or otherwise overtly discriminatory.""

As well as the ethical standards, all licensed therapists/counsellors/psychiatrists/social workers are held to a ""standard of care."" That means they are expected to take what you say seriously  and respond in a way that lines up with medical consensus, and the reasonable person standard (would a reasonable person with their same education, license and skill level respond in the same way). 

And last thing, I don't say this to scare you or discourage you from actually talking to a therapist, but I just realized while typing this, you admitted to self harm/attempted self harm to them. From what you said it sounded like your therapists just kind of brushed passed that, which is massively illegal everywhere. Especially at the level of home surgery. they'd be, at the absolute minimum, required to talk about that with you and ensure that you weren't planning to do it again. If you're a minor they'd have to inform your parents and possibly CPS. Most decent therapists would have sent you to a Crisis center or dedicated mental health care facility. 

I'm sorry if this got a bit overwhelming or confusing, but even though I don't know you I am genuinely concerned for you, and concerned for any other gay/trans people that are seeing this therapist.
[this site](https://www.counseling.org/knowledge-center/licensure-requirements/state-professional-counselor-licensure-boards#) will help you find the contact info for your states licensing board. I hope things work out okay for you, and you can get real help.
Sounds like she's only ""ok working with gay people"" insofar as she thinks she can use her therapist's office as a form of conversion therapy, which is...super super super unethical.

I wish I knew if my therapist was taking new clients \[he's semi-retired\]...100% remote sessions so proximity isn't an issue, became ""the GSRM therapist"" locally entirely due to word of mouth, I've been with him for depression for years and was my first ally when my egg got launched out of a cannon...super supportive, put words to things I couldn't describe, etc.
I'd say this Sub-Reddit might be more beneficial to you than this therapist.
The statistic is totally misleading because it includes attempts pre transition (many do not attempt again after coming out), doesnt factor institutional gatekeeping and denial of trans health care, familial support, homelessness, co occuring smi, ptsd, discrimination, etc. Anybody with any scientific literacy knows this. There's no way a therapist is that wildly ignorant, it has to be purely malicious.
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202201/the-evidence-trans-youth-gender-affirming-medical-care more studies just to tack on to the conversation.
And I hate it that it's that way for you. You should have parents that support you, or at the very least let you figure yourself out without getting in the way. Please don't mistake your hard won stability as her doing like she can take that away from you- YOU did that work, and quite likely in spite of her. Good on you- that had to have been hard.

If you can't not go to sessions,  look up the gray rock method- it's a super useful tool in the right situations, and this may be one of them. 

&#x200B;

Signed- Mom of a (trans) kid. 

&#x200B;

P.S. This is bullshit, you deserve better.
Thats so not okay. You should stop seeing her. I saw your other reply saying you cant get a new one but even so you really should stop seeing her. Shes causing more harm than good. If your parents are in control of your therapy tell them about her disregard for your safety and mental wellbeing. Tell them she says stuff that triggers you and she doesn't apologize or stop.
Threatening a client goes from ""bad at therapy"" to ""genuinely abusive and dangerous individual."" This really is the equivalent of going to a doctor who is poisoning you. You may need to go at it alone. But you have to get out.
That is really awful. A therapist using abusive threats like that should lose their license to practice. I wouldn’t be surprised if she isn’t licensed and might be trying to use the “religious counseling” loopholes some places have.
Well no therapy is better than this.

You need to report this person as they are causing legitimate harm and will hurt others, regardless of what your parents say.

I know it's hard but you absolutely can do this. You are being abused and this may be your only way of ending that (for now at least).
Keep it in mind when you're listening to what she has to say from now on, ya know? Good therapy, REAL therapy is about helping you cope with life as it comes at you. She has an agenda beyond that, and because of that she's never going to give you the advice you need to hear.

Imagine you're locked in a room with a window. The glass itself is red, and as such when light comes in it casts everything in a sinister crimson. Everything you can see of the outside world bears this red hue, looking much more evil and sinister than it is on its own objective merit. Some day, you'll be able to leave the room. You'll be able to pick your own window: one that let's the flowers discard this imposed ombre in favor of their own natural beauty. You *will* be allowed to look through your own eyes, I promise you that. But there's no shame in backing away from the window for now. 

~

It seems that your parents are very unsupportive of your trans-ness. But if you're sneaky about it, there'll always be ways you can modify your gender presentation that'll fly right under their radar. Now I'm transfem so I wouldn't be the best person ever to ask about how to be masculine (lol) but I will offer the advice to get one of those hand-squeezy things that works out your forearms. They're a good little idle exercise to do throughout the day and it should be fairly easy to make the case that it's a fitness thing and not a gender thing.

If you find yourself forced away from the window, you can always find a crack in the walls through which to peer at your flowers 🌸 Your captors will be none the wiser.
Ahh, mine was Gwendolyn
Yea I once told her about a time my mom assualted me and she said it wasn’t that and I was being dramatic.
And adding to that as soon as I got outed I was sent to a religious school where pretty much everyday they preach people like me are going to hell.
Just DM OP, tbh this is going beyond therapist bad vent and into solid child abuse.
OP is probably 16 or so - they say they have 2 years remaining until they're a legal adult.
Yea it’s just I don’t have the balls to do that lol
Well specially the UK but it’s much the same in other countries (excluding the USA)
[removed]
Lmao it is tbh
Thankyou for the support. But Thankyou the most for supporting your kid. I wish I had a
Parent like you. You will never know how much of an impact that will have on your kid. I wish you and your kid the best of luck
Excuse me? I was upset before.. now I’m seething. How DARE she play the victim blame game as a THERAPIST. She needs to lose her job like last year.
You could report your therapist for breaking the law. OP, your therapist is required by law to report abuse. You should call CPS and tell them what is happening to you and that your therapist is enabling your abuse. Please be safe
🤔 report her to her professional body, once she's barred from practicing your parents will have to let you get a new therapist.

That's absurdly unprofessional behaviour.
Yea she needs to lose her job right this instant. If you bring it up to literally anyone that's higher on the board she'll have to go through examination and then she will promptly have her license revoked.
I think that talking to this person might be more harmful than not. Any chance you can just stop going or stonewall the whole time if you have to? Talk about music and the weather?
you need to report that therapist to get their license revoked
Um? That is a red flag. Therapists are not supposed to downplay stuff like that. They are supposed to listen and help you process stuff.
if you're being forced to go, go and be silent. A bad therapist can do a lot more damage than no therapy at all. Don't engage. Don't give her or your parents what they want. Be true to yourself, and get a different therapist as soon as you're able
You're right. I wanted to know because a lot of people are guessing suggestions based on not knowing OPs age or state and that makes giving advice difficult.

My blood is boiling reading this post, there is definitely some serious child abuse going on here by her parents and especially this ""therapist"". I'm not an expert so I will leave this to someone more qualified.
Links the federalist lol
No joke! There are knowledgeable people on here, who actually care about helping and supporting each other. 💙💗🤍💗💙
Thank you. If you need some legit mothering or just a recipe for some cheap eats, send me a message. :)
Yea she’s all I have tho sadly:(
And?
Will do 👍
Tell every other employee you see at the clinic that you hate this therapist and need a new one. Tell them youre miserable. If you keep bringing it up something will be done, whether its for your benefit or for her reputation.
If she is licensed and stuff, I’m pretty sure there is a place to report them for this stuff ( forgot the name ). She might be able to lose her license over this.
Is bad therapy better than no therapy at that point though?
This is so funny actually. Where’s the helicopter joke. What else do you have??
And lol
[Not a great source.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/)
The post History is also red flag.
I can’t do that it took everything out of me to tell her I don’t like to be called beautiful. Sorry o couldn’t help
But without her I am stuck. One time I was having a serious crisis and my family took everything away from me. Like my phone. I couldn’t call no one for help. And my parents just dismissed me.
NO. NO NO NO. No therapy at all is better than bad therapy. Love, a therapy student. 

The relationship is EVERYTHING and it doesn't even matter how cool the shrink is if you don't trust them. Their job is NOT to judge you or impose their moral values. One of our tenets is Unconditional Positive Regard. The therapist is trouncing all of this by imposing her shitty, regressive beliefs. 

Refuse to go anymore, OP. Tell your parents that if they make you go, you just won't talk, so they're wasting their money.
Just about all the major media companies would fit under radical left, I don’t see why a change of pace would be a bad idea
Some of my posts were trolls, such as one about “fatphobia”
Youre the only one that can help yourself right now. I know how hard it is to stand up for yourself but you need to raise a stink. Therapists like this are why people live miserable lives. Continuing treatment with this person will negatively affect you.

If you can't change people, you need to make your therapist aware that you will not listen to what she is saying. Never give in to her and make her job difficult. She may make the decision to find someone else for you.

Never give up on yourself. You know who you are, not this horrible stranger.
With a therapist like that, none is better. You need to stand up for yourself or nothing will get better. You need to report her.
She can’t help you. She’s clearly not in and way educated in transgender issues. She in fact is spouting transphobic rhetoric. This could be exactly why your parents chose her. Look her up, do research about her credentials and what issues she claims to cover.

If you can’t get rid of her, stonewall her. Say absolutely nothing of value during seasons. One word answers or no answers at all. 

The longest sentence You should say to her from now on is “I’ve decided you aren’t qualified to help me, and any further dialogue with you would be harmful to my mental and emotional well being.”
OP, if you're comfortable DMing me her name and where you live, I am happy to report her. No pressure, and I can't guarantee it will change anything, but I'm more than happy to do it. You just say the word <3
I'm telling you, other adults at the clinic will help. Telling your parents will be dismissed and your therapist doesnt want all her clients bailing immediately (because shes abusive) so shes holding you captive. Tell anybody that you need help and that BOTH the therapist AND your parents are ignoring you. Something will happen eventually
I don’t know how old you are - if you’re still in school go and talk to a counselor there.

School counselors are mandatory reporters, and you’re being abused by your parents.

I’m sorry this is happening to you - you deserve far better.
With her you will only get worse though. You need help from someone willing to give it and she is obviously not it
The thing is, you don’t have that therapist either. She clearly is far more of a harm than a help. You are likely worse with her than without her
Im so sorry you’re in that situation. How old are you? How many years til you’re legally an adult? I hope you can get out ASAP
It's not the left/right bias that's important. It's the failed fact checks, promotion of conspiracy theories, and the fact that they were banned on Twitter for spreading COVID misinformation.

I don't doubt that it's okay for the occasional news outlet to be right-wing, because that's diversity of thought. What matters is whether or not they actually report on the truth, which The Federalist clearly doesn't.
Thanks I might do that but I am gonna tell my psychiatrist about this first and tell her what all my therapist has said and see if she can recommend me some therapists ( and hopefully talk my mom into letting me)
This - reach out to an adult you trust at the clinic or your school or call CPS and  them what is happening
Round 2 years :(
Great idea. Fight for yourself, you're worth it <3
So idk if this is possible for you and even if it is, it may not be the best choice depending on your situation. But after my mom told me to kill myself when I was 16, I ran away from home. I went to a hospital and when they tried to send me home I went to a friend and his mom took me to the police. The police took me to a group home. After a few days in the group home, my parents signed off on letting me move in with family friends. I never would’ve thought they’d agree to that but they did. I never saw them again and it’s been 10 years, it will be 11 in May. Best choice I ever made."	sc0vek	trans	1012	0.99	2022-01-25 01:04:48
My mom told my brother I want T.. he said I’ll go blind	So- I told my mom a few days ago I wanted to start T since I found out I don’t have wait till I’m 16 to get it since I’ve seen younger people acquire it.. she said she has to do much research and think about it blah blah.. but- I’m watching tv and then my brother tells me- that she told him.. and he started asking why I wanted it and I explain to him why and then he goes to say “it’ll mess your body up” “it’ll make your vision blurry-“ “to the point where you can’t see” and I asked him who told him that and how he knew this and he said “he’s seen it” … 1- he’s a pathological liar but I’m still very gullible and believe it a bit.. is this true? 2.. he’s been a therapeutic foster home - how did you ‘see’ this-?	"No wtf? It doesn't do anything to your vision.
Is your brother blind? cause he’s got a lot of it. 🤔
Definitely not true.
It's literally just a hormone, it'll do what hormones do, in this case what T does. If you don't have any illnesses explicitly affected by testosterone, it won't trigger anything on its own for lolz.
WTF?! How many cis-men are blind from T? Is he blind yet?
Why tf did nobody bother to tell me I was going blind??? Damn, I really need to hurry to start HRT. For, uh... sight reasons
why aren't all cis men blind by now, then? lol

also: yeah, the blind thing is bullshit, but - you say you're gullible. fact-check it, then! google is a friend. do your research
he’s full of shit
He is right about one thing. T will mess with your body. It will make you finally able to love yourself. As a trans girl I'd give you all of my T cuz it had the opposite effect on me, but unfortunately we don't have that kind of technology.
That Is not true in the slightest, idk why they would say that
Hormones are in Milk. We would’ve seen a milk ban by now
Do your own research instead of trusting family thats trying to convince you to not start T.

He's definitely 100% wrong.
It’s incredibly important to do research before starting T on what changes may occur. So definitely don’t ignore that part, you should do your own research honestly. It’s doesn’t make you blind, people just say stupid shit. Starting hormones is a monitored process that you should be safe through it all. You’ll be okay, but you need to monitor yourself when you start hormones/ if you do.
You said it yourself, bro—he’s a pathological liar. Why would you trust *anything* he says?
Lol, don't worry yourself with his nonsense. He's lying. There is not a way in which HRT / testosterone injected into the body could interact with receptors in the eyes and cause deterioration of sight, if it did there would be innumerable articles and studies on the subject. I reckon he's just attempting to fearmonger. That or he's somehow mixed up the higher percentage of AMAB people with colour blindness and mistakenly connected that with testosterone rather than chromosomes and copies of genes
If that was true all men would be blind
Behold, the power of literally just making shit up on the spot
But... his body has T... and he's  presumably not blind?
Total bs
T can't make you lose vision. TW- Ironically pregnancy can though. My ex's sister lost alot of vision during her pregnancy. You can also lose teeth/hair and other such things. I had alot of complications that almost unalived me in both of mine.
Shoot, not even just cis men would be blind. Everyone has T/E (just different amounts) so is *everyone* blind?
I’ve been on T for 6 months. If anything it made my senses stronger and made me feel more confident. Idk wtf he’s on
If it truly made you go blind, more cis men would have glasses
Yeah cuz all men are blind... your brother is a liar.
Absolutely not true. That has never happened from testosterone.
T won't do anything to you it doesn't do to a cis male

Ignore anything he tells you he clearly can't be trusted.

if you want to know the effects just look up mascilinizing hormone replacement

No
Well you won't have to look at your brother anymore.....LOL. E actually improved my vision. I passed the eye test without glasses for my drivers license for the first time after starting E. Your brother is insecure about your change. You can try talking to him if you think there is any hope.
I'll make her blind for you 😎👉👉
Your brother doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Besides, you want to change your body by taking T. That one kinda sounds more like a defense.
Ask her for the source

Because it probably doesnt exist
So ***that's*** why I need glasses! /s
Bruh what the hell is he on man
Cis men are notorious for being completely blind after puberty
It does affect your vision but you don't go blind, you start to see things more clearly, and you start to see who has your back and who is truly in your corner and who your real enemies are
You won’t go blind. Just DYOR.. 🥰

& it’s so far from the truth. Nothing of the sort can even happen.
Younger people can use hormone blockers too. Just an option if your mom decides she isn’t comfortable with T yet
Honestly, if it did make you go blind, that would be great.

Cuz I've seen enough
The part of my life where I run on T is finally coming to a close at the age of 17 (as I will be getting E very soon). So I've got some experience with this hormone. My vision is immaculate. T doesn't do that and it has absolutely no reason to. The closest thing I can think of as to why someone might think that *might* be is that T will make you horny, so you'll masturbate, and that makes you go blind (however, masturbation doesn't do that either and T doesn't neccesarily make you horny, and even if it does you can just be stronger than your urges if you're really adamant about not doing the deed)
No, that brother of yours is insanity embodied if he said testosterone will make you blind when you're becoming a boy!
breaking news y'all, men can't fuckin see apparently


.... don't remember that before transitioning but what do I know 🙄
No it won't. There might be crazy mood swings and a wide range of new emotions, but not blind.
No it won't. There might be crazy mood swings and a wide range of new emotions, but not blind.
Your brother’s a dick
Umm.. there’s PLENTY of cis men that don’t go blind at puberty, for one. Also, contrary to beliefs among incels, men and women aren’t different species
Yeah, cause every trans person I've talked to is fucking blind.
Makes sense.
Is he blind lol
I’m more concerned about why your mom is telling your personal business to your brother? If a decision had been made, I could understand because he’s going to find out eventually anyway… but, otherwise, it seems like a breach of trust.
Are we just recycling masturbation myths now? They forgot about you growing hair on your tongue and palms, becoming prone to cheating, and your genitals falling off. Did I miss any
It’s a hormone…nothing more.
Your brother is on some kinda trip, lol. Like fucking what?
Hormones can cause visual changes, so when the optometrist asks what medications you're on you should mention if if you feel safe.  But it won't make you go blind, no
you answered your own question, you said he was a pathological liar
Dude is an idiot who just wants to make you feel like shit. If T made people blind cis men would be on T suppressants and estrogen pills
Sure and they used to say you would go blind and grow hair in your palms it you masturbate! Your brother is full of shit!
No, that's probably carbon monoxide. Testosterone is a harmless hormone present in human bodies, that regulates certain emotions and the growth and expression of certain traits.
Sounds like your family is transphobic on the DL
No man, that's if you jack off. Lol.
.... Your bro realizes he has those hormones being released inside his body all the time, right?
Every biological guy will be blind then xD anyway, when talking with your doctor or endo, make sure they keep up with blood tests and etc. You can ask them about risks and side effects too.
T will make vision go blurry to the point that you can’t see? Really? Is that his excuse? He can’t see? 

Tell him a registered nurse agrees with you, it doesn’t make vision blurry to the point of blindness…
hes right i have absolutely horrible eyesight
I mean most people already produce it so no? Also you should listen to doctors regarding side effects not family or other random people
Not sure if anyone has pointed this out yet but perhaps your brother has associated testosterone as a thing that makes someone manly and then confused testosterone with steroids. 

Steroids have the risk of making someone go blind so maybe that’s where he’s got this from.
""Azula always lies."" Repeat this to yourself (but maybe with your brother's name instead)
May I ask how old you are?(you don't have to say but I'm wanting to start t and qm worried my mother will use my age against me)
if that was true all trans men and anyone else with testosterone in their body would also be blind its bullshit
Testosterone affects the hormones in your body, it has nothing to do with your eyes.
Ask him if he himself has blurry vision. If he says yes, tell him to go to an optometrist or something coz thats not normal.  
T is just a hormone, and the changes it initially does resemble puberty. So whatever he went/is going through may be your case when taking T. (deeper voice, growth, etc.etc.)
do u think every amab guy is blind ? no so no its not true lmao
Yeah no it doesn’t do that, if it did all humans would be blind since everyone has T, just in different amounts. And cismen take T too for low T.

What you’re more likely to notice is your brain will overall function better, less cloudy, you’re likely to be less moody and overall feel more at ease. What current research suggests is that when the brain is developing in trans people that some switch gets flipped and it develops for the gender (and hormones) that doesn’t match the genitalia which (unfortunately) develops first. What hormones are doing in part is correcting this via giving the brain the hormones it was wired for but the body isn’t producing the correct amounts for the brain to operate correctly. Then the other gender affirming changes happen over time.
Only enough I've never met a blind trans man, or masculine nonbinary person, I'm sure they exist I just haven't met any
And I couldn’t get a video game system as a teen, times have changed
I figured.. bc I follow a lot of trans things on my socials and not once have they mentioned their vision being affected
Unless you masturbate too much /s
I said “but.. you have T in you..-“ and he said yeah but- you want ‘steroids’
I should ask😔
As an AmAB trans femme, I have to say that getting my sight back because of testosterone blockers has to have been one of the best side effects of HRT

(Huge /s if it wasn't obvious)
Yeah, this is like the ol' ""masturbation will make you go blind!"" thing. Just a thing that is a scare tactic.
💖 😭
Possibly he doesn’t want me to do it :/
i second this. it seems they should re-evaluate their own knowledge on testosterone before starting it
I worry a lot — even eating my own words knowing it couldn’t be true
Well, all those cis men are *figuratively* blind, but not *literally* blind.
I'm betting OP's brother's been taking FOX News pills for a long time! That could be why he's a pathological liar!

>!Just messing with you...!<
*Figuratively* blind, I bet!
Yep ^^^ this. One day their voice cracks the next, total darkness 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Yeah :/ thats just how she is,, telling my business or holding it against me- it’s why I rarely walk to her now — but this was really important to me so I didn’t really have a choice ,, — again I asked myself “what was the reason of telling him?” Was he supposed to magically get my T

Just kidding
I’m 15,, last time I did research the thing said I had to at least be 16- but then I saw a 14 year old on T and as I remember they said the youngest they start it for a trans person was 13 - 14
It’s like how some peoples brains don’t produce enough dopamine, so they take meds, which are just artificial neurotransmitters. And diabetic people take insulin because their bodies don’t produce enough. Why is it so fucking hard for people to comprehend that that’s all transitioning is. Like, I just wanna look in the mirror and see ✨me✨, I wanna talk and hear ✨me✨. Not the girl I’ve been forced to be for 23 years.
If it affected your vision it would be like widespread knowledge and you’d have read about it by now. It would be one of first things people and doctors said about it but first of all it wouldn’t even be a thing anyone were allowed to offer. They study these things carefully before they make it available for people to take. Also it would make all cis guys on the planet naturally blind during puberty lmao. I mean wait it goes even further than that… all humans have T in their body because uhhh it’s a human hormone, even ovaries produce it in cis women, and why would humans have a hormone that makes us blind lol
So in General Cross hormones don‘t do anything else than they do to cis gender people producing those hormones. Like none at all. Neither does estrogen increase breast cancer rates over those of cis women etc.

You basically take on the risks of a cis gender person producing those hormones with their body.

Assuming you are using bioidentical hormones, and not overdosing etc.

Hence T injections and not pills being the standard of care etc.


So you are to expect what any other man will go through depending on genetics, male pattern balding for example. Plus prostate cancer is out as a benefit…body hair and lower voice,

But cis men don‘t experience blurry vision due to testosterone ever, so how the fuck would your body somehow do something different? 

Your brother is a shit talking little shit and knows absolutely nothing medically relevant.
Will get those hairy palms, too.
T isn't steroids, what. also, like others said, even the people who take actual steroids aren't visually impaired
My dad has been on replacement t for 60 years due to hormonal issues. He’s incredibly healthy
Ok, sure. Then all bodybuilders and guys in gyms have eyesight issues which of course is total bollocks.
Your brother has issues with it and tries to gatekeep you with fear.
This is your brain on elementary school drug programs.

&#x200B;

literally in elementary school they just told me steroids are bad and refused to elaborate, boy was i confused when I learned what steroids actually are
What a rotten and/or deeply misinformed brother. I hope he gets over that. You don’t deserve this kind of behavior from him!
All kinds of things can happen to men that abuse T  to get gigantic muscles. Trans men and even cis  men being treated for low testosterone don’t get doses anywhere near that high.

A competent doctor will be monitoring blood levels to keep things safe and fine tune your levels. They will also be watching your overall health to make sure things go well.
I hear ya—it can be difficult to do that when you *should* be able to trust them.

CONSIDER THE SOURCE 💜👊🔥
Ik you were lmao
???
You're a saint man thank you I wish you well on your transition
Exactly what I was thinking
Testosterone is an anabolic steroid.
I would say that OP's brother is insanity personified for this!
The joke is that if ur blind u can't write
you know what i meant, though. being on T isn't the same as taking steroids for bodybuilding etc. even the way it's taken is different
When I told him he had T in him he got real quiet and glared at me every now in then✊🙂
He's just checking to see if he's blind yet. When he glares you can hold up a random number of fingers and ask him how many to help out his vision check.

I'm a bald trans gal - how F'd am I ??	"Title explains ( FYI I HAVE NATURAL COLOUR HUMAN HAIR WIGS - ON MY PRILOFILE) 

I started losing my hair back when I was 19 - I'm now 26. When I mean bald I mean like king poseiden in the spongebob film 

Previously I'd shaved my hair off to avoid it - but I looking to do something about it post transitioning. (I've also had human hair wigs since coming out) 

Options

-  hair transplant £10,000 and will look crap at best 
- already on dutasteride and it's not a magic pill anyway 

- how will I be able to love myself when I literally look like a bald dude when I wake up ?

Suggestions from users 

(I have amazing quality human hair wigs - but I feel like I'm playing pretend by putting them on 🥲)

(Complete T suppression and on HRT - I have baby hair / shorter-whisperier  hairs on the top/crown)"	"You’re not F’d. Some women are bald either by choice or not. You can also play around with wigs, either ones that are as realistic as possible or ones in colors too vibrant to be real hair (or something in between). You’ll figure something out that works for you
some women go bald too

maybe lots of thinning from genetics or from a medical treatment...  my sister fried her hair having it bleached and shaved her head lol

of course wigs exist lol
you should be okay
Fuck I can't believe people don't know anything about hair.

You can regrow most or all of your hair. It's not fast but it's gonna all come back.

Removing DHT and starting E is the first step.

Dermarolling is the second step:
https://youtu.be/thQ1taoKoo4

You can increase the density of the hair by using PRP but that might get a little expensive. (You can't create new follicules with this, but it helps reactivate the atrophied ones)

There are quite a few other techniques as well if you search for them. The hair follicles you have are simply atrophied but still there. Using techniques such as the above can reactivate them but it's not easy and takes a lot of time.

I suggest using your wigs while doing this therapy over a long period of time.

Minoxidil will also be necessary in the beginning to kickstart some of this. Check out ""Dr Powers hair serum V5"" for a good cocktail of hair drugs.
https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/wiki/hair-restoration/
Are you on E and a blocker in addition to dut?
I’m in the same boat sis. It’s giving me a lot of dysphoria. The way I see it, there is only one thing to do:

Get the remainder of the scalp hair laser removed so the hair shadow isn’t visible anymore. And just be a bald woman. And get good lace front wigs for special occasions. I’m also considering getting some sort of head tattoo - not sure if that’s an awesome idea, though *sigh*

I know this sucks so bad, I could cry :-( but there’s no way to get hair back after more than 4-5 years

Hair transplants really don’t work once almost all hair is gone.
You’re not fucked bald women are attractive
[deleted]
The same thing happens for women with allapetia(?). It’s a medical condition that causes some people to lose all of their hair completely. Look into some of the coping strategies that those ladies adopt.
It sounds like what this post about is how to love yourself outside of wigs. I noticed a trend of everyone suggesting wigs to your solution but at the end of the day a wig is not a solution to love yourself upon waking up in your natural form. As a trans man, hair has always been important to me so with taking T, it was hard to accept it thinning a lot and not looking as it once did, so I get it. I understand how hard it is to find validation in a world that stresses womanhood with hyper femininity (and in my case, being a man with hyper masculinity). I know the ideal for you would be to have luscious locks upon waking up, as I’m sure it’s the ideal for most cis women too. But there are many women who suffer from alopecia, naturally thin hair, and so forth. But I want to stress that your womanhood has nothing to do with your hair. Your confidence and self worth has nothing to do with your hair. The love someone will feel for you one day will have little to do with your physical appearance and everything to do with who you are as a person, how you treat them, how beautiful your soul is, and how attractive your confidence is. I gently suggest working on self love and acceptance. I’ve known many trans women who were naturally bald, that wore wigs, and still found people to love them in their natural form as well as done up and marry them. You are beautiful because you deem it so. You are a woman because you deem it so, and nothing in this world, no person in this world can take that from you or make you feel inferior because of these aspects you may deem as a “flaw” if you don’t allow them to. On the other side, I know it’s super important to feel good and if hair is something you feel will make the world of a difference, I would look into FUE hair transplants. They are far better than the traditional hair transplants and have a much higher success rate and do not leave that knarley scar in the back of the head, it heals natural. I wish you so much self love along your journey and hope you find things that will alleviate your stresses around this. In addition, you have amazing bone structure and are already so feminine, if hormones is on the agenda, I have no doubt you will have amazing results (but if not, you are no less of a woman hormones or not). Lastly, I would look to the women who rocked buzzed and bald cuts who I happen to think were so incredibly hot. To name a few, Demi Moore in “G.I. Jane”, Lori Petty in “In the Army Now”, Sinead O’ Conner, and Amber rose to name a few. Many female models rock bald heads too.

Take care and good luck!
I think you should just embrace it. Bald women are gorgeous! Maybe use make up, jewelry, clothes if you want to look more feminine.
Give it a few years on hrt, regrowth certainly happens in both trans women and cis men much older than you who suppress DHT, which hrt does by default. No need to freak out yet. Also looking at your photos, you’re very pretty, and certainly will pass femme bald or not, and if you further want to guarantee that you always have ffs as an option. 

Also buzzed hair and expensive wigs is super in right now. Seems every girl on tik tok is doing it.
wigs
It's only an issue if you allow it to be. Most of the fight is against ourselves. Lots of women wear wigs everyday. If you choose not to that's also amazing. Make it so whatever you do is a win x
Get a wig.
My moms hair is thinning and she’s cis, but sadly as far as I know wigs and transplants are the only things I know of for that
Natural hair color wig will make you look like you have hair, spend a couple hundred on a nice one and learn to take care of it, pair it with beanies and bandanas for an extra boost to hairline normality
I'm a 24 y/o trans woman whose hair is thinning in the same way. Before I was sure I wanted HRT I was *so* dysphoric about it. What helped me get through it was by following bald trans women on social media (most of whom just get their scalps lasered to avoid the male pattern) and gaining some confidence in how I might end up presenting. It helped to know that I am a woman either way, and nobody can take that away from me. *That said, if you want to wear wigs then you should not feel fake about it. Plenty of cis women wear wigs and aren't considered fake or any lesser--we're all just trying out best to look our best.

I hope this isn't hollow comfort, but we're women, sis, and we slay with or without hair.
Mmm.. i was reading all the comments, and there are a lot of good one that also helped me in a way.
I wear a wig too and I know what you mean by..those not being natural..is that you feel it is an extra part, ""removable"" instead of natural.
I also have the same problem when I wake up.
And the same feeling of not being accepted in ""nature mode"" even if I have just a bald patch in the front and the rest still hanging around somehow.
It was and it still is a major aesthetical problem, but in a way or another i must cope with it🤷🏻‍♀️
I avoid mirrors in the morning and i have learned to love head scarves styles while home. when i go out I wear my wig and use accessories.
Basically there isn't a fixed ground,  there are many microstrategy to cope with it. I am also considering a transplant...is expensive yes! but it may works well with a strategic hair cut, i won't know that till i do it.
What I am trying to say is that we can only do the best we can and learn to live with it!
A partner will be ok with it if we are confident about it.
Without self confidence, we make it more obvious.
Is difficult sis..i understand.
All i can say is cope with it in a way or another, work on self-confidence, and start to see it as a characteristic of yourself, not a defect, is a first step and probably the best thing to do.
My partner (36yrMTF) has this same problem & has been using rogain. It’s slow going but her gender consult doc told told her it’s proven to work. 
You can also get a toupee with long hair for longer results than wigs produce
I am a cis-woman who is bald due to alopecia.  I either wear funky hats or a wig. My tip is to not be shy about playing around with combinations of hats, scarfs, wigs etc and not to always believe what the shop assistant or wig specialist tells you. Also you can cut a wig to make it better fit you... either yourself or find a wig stylist.

In the almost 20 years of adult life I have been bald, everyone has been extremely surprised when I tell them, even if I have known them for years!!!  (A few close friends have even forgotten!) People are not very observant, so even times when there was a wig mishap, no one noticed :-)

One quick tip... use a buff scarf as a wig or hat liner ([buff.com](https://buff.com)) They are great.

My next job, when I get a bit of money together, is to get my head tattooed!!!
Is the skin shiny where bald? I read something lately that talked about it going shiny when the follicles are fully dead, if you aren’t reflective there’s a good chance you might see some regrowth. Wish I remember where I read it so I could link it
There’s nothing wrong with wearing wigs. I had hair loss pretty badly when i was about 11 and I’m afab.
I am a cis woman who was bald for a year because cancer. I went with wigs or headscarves.
Well hormones already help but you can add finasteride, a microneedler for your scalp that you should then cover with minoxidil. The combo should be able to start growing it back. There are other products but use them for increased thickness.
[deleted]
I get this same feeling! I'm 41, and I am almost completely bald. What little hair I have makes me look like Danny Devito up top, which would be great if I wanted to look male, but I don't. I've tried a few wigs, and I look okay in them, but I feel like I'm lying. It doesn't bother me when other people wear them, but when I put them on I feel like I'm deceiving people. I can't shake that feeling, either.
Not all hair transplants are bad though. I assume you have thinner hair? There’s a place in Orlando FL that charges $5500 for a whole treatment. (They charge by visits because it’s way cheaper than getting charged $3-5 per graft of hair). Maybe something to think about. I’m kind of in the same boat. I couldn’t get pills for the HRT and my hair almost fell out overnight. Side affect of hormone imbalance 😢 I have long enough hair on my sides that I do a kind of comb over. It’s still very obvious unfortunately so I wear a beanie. You can also try hair extensions, “crown fusion hair extensions” I think they’re called. It’s like hair that’s glued with surgical glue to the top of your hair but also pulls the remaining hair through so your hair and head can still breath and it looks natural, vs just wearing a wig thrown on top. I’m probably going to try the crown method myself until I can pay the $5500 for the hair transplant
There are a lot of cis women without hair. You can rock your wigs or even the bald look.
Are you into tattoos? You could rock a head tattoo. But if not, just wear wigs. I dated a girl that had alopecia and had a HUGE bald spot. Honestly, it takes about 2 seconds to adjust to it lol. I know it probably feels like the end of the world, but it doesn't have to be.

Go for it girl, you got this. Beanies and wigs, you'll be cute af
I shave my head and wear human wigs too! It’s easier for me
Girl, it is a piece of clothes.  It is no more fake than what you choose to wear in the morning in every other capacity.  Nobody gives ciswomen shit for wigs and weaves and just sees it as their choice.  Or push up bras, or spanx, or makeup, or padding.  Nearly every girl needs some help somewhere to meet today's beauty ideals.  (Which is kind of shit, but neither here nor there.)  Just because you're choosing it out of necessity/ dysphoria doesn't mean it isn't a normal thing to do.  90% of the girls you see have some on that is just as ""fake"" as your wig.  If not multiple things.

I don't know how long you've been on HRT, but I would say give the meds some more time.  You might stay bald, but you will eventually look like a bald woman in the morning.  And that will at least be much better.
If it helps any, before I (ftm) was out I wore wigs daily and I always had a ton of compliments. No one ever knew it was a wig until I pointed it out. I just saw it as a part of my routine the same way someone puts on makeup.
Idk i think if you are already on dutasteride *and* suppressing your T i think you can make some pretty good progress.
I understand your pain, I'm stuck with full geography teacher pattern baldness. I shaved my hair just today and I'm using wigs. I started balding at age 15 and have/had very fine hair.  


I've heard of a more permanent hair appliance that glues to the scalp designed for people with alopecia which look very good, they are fitted and are only removed once every few weeks. I haven't read too much into them but they may be something to consider.   


I've also read recently that human hair cloning is making some pretty big strides and while still undergoing trials and presumably will be very expensive, could be something to hold onto for the future.
My family balds and greys early too. I've been on hrt for less than a year, but I'm definitely going with wigs when I decide to present as female. When I'm in male phase, I'm just keeping my hair cut short and wearing loose clothes. All I can do is own who I am.
I'm a bald trans gal too! I rock my dome with pride now, though I used to feel very dysphoric over it. I started looking at it from the point of view that it's part of what makes me be unique. 

Do whatever makes you feel comfortable luv, if you'd rather wear a wig, then thats just as valid as not, but either way, theres nothing wrong with you, and your not f'ed. The human body is nothing to be ashamed of, so be proud of yourself girl 💎🙌
I started regrowing what I had lost prior to starting, I would say I was clearly balding, I think parts might have actually been bald. It’s pretty much all come back, the reading has reversed. It’s still a little thin on top compared to the rest of my scalp. I think no one would think I was ever bald at this point. I didn’t think this would happen.

estradiol cypionate injections, starting progesterone when my prescription arrives

I’ve been taking finasteride and putting drops of minoxidil in my hair still until I feel it isn’t still super thin on the crown.
Lots of folks go bald for many reasons as long as you get good quality wigs you should be fine
My mom went bald from cancer but she wore bright beautiful scarves tied into a bun in the back and I loved that look - very gypsy and bohemian to me.
Bald women- bald women are god damn queens and I will personally bully anyone who disagrees, and I have little to say hun other than I've been encouraging my mom who's been balding to just go all the way through with it, honestly just embrace it hun! It's like having a small pp sure you may think of it as a bad thing at first but it's about how you use it oki!<3
Regarding waking up, i assume you sleep without wigs right? Have you tried to sleep with a sleeping hat or something similar? Maybe waking up with one will make you feel a bit better

I can't tell you how to feel but my mum before passing away she was bald when she survived cancer the first time. She would also felt bad during that period of time until she sometimes came out the room with the few hair strains she still had. 

Try to put your wig with your eyes closed, then when you have it on your head arrange it if it's misplaced.

I hope it helps!
Bald ladies are cool as hell
You aren't fucked at all!

One of my favorite people in the world is trans and bald. She wears these cute head scarves all the time and had like 10-15 wigs.

But she doesn't need the wigs to look beautiful because she is.

Don't think it's some ""act"" you're putting on, just because your hair isn't yours.
Im surprised no one recommended head scarves/head wraps yet. There are some really pretty ones and paired with good earrings can make for a gorgeous look
I have a permanent hair piece. It lasts about 5-7 months and costs $650 CAD plus $86 for upkeep every three weeks thereafter. They are six inches long. To get them longer than six inches the cost skyrockets to about $2400.
Bald female presenting presenting people are hot if you ask me and you make those wigs look amazing. While this may make you feeling dysphoric, it's not unique to AMAB people. If you find the person who makes you feel amazing regardless of your hair, you will learn to love yourself better. It's a fear that people won't love us that makes us attack ourselves as ""unattractive""
So, just a rando internet cis male here.  You look amazing in your profile pics. Anyone who is worth dating will think so too. No matter what you look like when you wake up in the morning.
Hi Nicki! So, two things. First of all, I looked at your profile and those wigs are NATURAL looking. I know you don’t like wearing them and I absolutely understand why, but at the very least nobody can tell you’re wearing a wig. And second, you really do have a feminine face. You can rock being bald! Especially if you get your hands on some hairbands or other accessories :)
You have to love yourself.  I have nowhere near the struggles you have but I hate seeing myself every morning.  You are an amazing woman, and you carry that in every photo I have seen.
Bald women are hot so no
Have you looked into hair systems at all? That might be a good option if you want to wake up with a full head of hair.
I'm in a similar boat and I look like a girl Friar Tuck :( 

I'm just starting to explore options now. I've also bought a couple of wigs that really help my body image and it's good to quickly swap/try a different length and style. The moment I put the wig on and see my reflection I begin to like myself. I'd much rather have real hair though that I can take pride in and I do really understand what you mean - I feel that too. I hope that you find acceptance or a solution.

The fates have also cursed me with too much and dark body hair :(
I plan on just wearing wigs. I know what you mean about the feeling like you're ""playing pretend"" though. There are cis women who wear wigs, and I think it's a feeling that can be dealt with and eliminated with a shift in thinking or perspective.
You said the wigs make you feel fake so maybe think of them as an accessory and not something you have to hide. Just think, you can have any color and not have to worry about your roots or going to the salon to constantly maintain it. I’d love to have pastel pink or purple hair but I don’t have the time or money to maintain it by going to the salon every two weeks to touch it up. So maybe picture your wigs as another accessory like your jewelry, glasses, etc.
Hair can be nice but it def doesn’t define you as a woman. If I were in that situation I would definitely consider using products like rogaine to try and stimulate the follicles that you do have to thicken the hair, also to regrow weak follicles. Any part that is absolutely smooth without a single trace of a hair would need surgical intervention, but definitely isn’t necessary. If I were to create some kind of plan for you I would use rogain, get hair transplants and then in areas that you feel could be made to look more full you could get like medical grade tattoos which can be helpful so that your scalp won’t show too much. For now wear a wig if it makes you feel most comfortable but the fact that you have small hairs on the top of your head is great! That means you can grow them back!!!! It might not look like before but you can definitely get a bunch of them back after a year of rogaine usage.

Btw Elon musk is a great example of hair regrowth potential, not that you are in any way Elon musk or a man. I’m using him for the balding example.
Before I was a trans guy, I was a buzz-cut tomboy. I dated men and for the most part they were fine with it. I don't think you have much of an issue. Just be your lovable self!
Hair plugs look pretty good if you get the right doctor. Plus you look cute in wigs. Hair restoration works really well especially the doctors in CA in the states.

TLDR: ur not fucked, I’d look into coding bootcamp bc ur gunna need to be rich. That’s like the only way I’ve seen trans girls get rich.
Either wigs, or go with a shaved head. There are loads of women with shaved heads who pull it off. It’s becoming increasingly common. You just have to make sure your foundation is a perfect match lol
Give hormones some time to see what you're working with. Even if you don't get growth on the top, your sides may thicken enough to get a decent transplant. Even if you wear wigs, having a hairline again, or even a wispy pixie without them might make you feel better.
Hi friend!! There are some seriously beautiful and badass girls who are bald out there! Have you considered embracing it and making it something that gives you feminine power and strength? 🥺💛 I’m sorry if that’s not helpful at all, but I’m here to help however I can 💛🏳️‍⚧️
Bald girls are hot

All 3 of my major relationships were girls with buzzcuts

Still not lesbo tho
I've seen some really beautiful cis girls who were bald. Just shave everything off your head, wait for more hair to fill in, if possible.
Use makeup around the eyes to make them look bigger/softer? Mainly try to make the face look as feminine as possible. Don't worry about your hair too much. Especially because you've got wigs! That's awesome. Just always make sure to have edges with those wigs so they look as natural as possible.
You're blessed cause its really easy to put on a wig!
bald women are fantastic you're perfectly fine
Makes wig wearing easier. Not that fucked.
Bandanas, turbans, hijabs, any head coverings can and do help
There’s plenty of bald girls out there who are a amazingly beautiful. Don’t listen to what society tells you you have to be. Also no one can tell it’s a wig. You can also try hair loss medication
As a bald man myself I kinda understand a bit of your pain. I don’t know how better to help you but there is nothing wrong with wigs 😃
I'm bald by choice but it's because I'm nonpassing by choice and a huge dyke :/ either way I think bald women are hotter and if you wear hats you can cover it or potentially draw attention away from it.
You can own it! I have met many women who shave their heads. 

Many are very attractive. 

I am sorry you feel bad about it and I hope there is a way you can feel better about it because you ARE AWESOME  and I also hope you can find a fix that will make you happy! 

I am 39 and went bald pretty early on in life and I just had to except it. My facial hair came in hard at the same time I was losing my hair and now I can't shave my face fast enough. 

Whatever you decide I got your back though!
You could try either PRP for hair growth or Fontana laser hair therapy or minoxidil. They’re all proven to work
I'm 39, the last 5-6 years I've had a bald spot growing and Receding hairline. In September I got minoxidil, biotin/collagen shampoo and a derma roller. I started hrt In December. So far spot has filled in nicely and my Receding corners are starting to fill in.  Ymmv, but there are def options and treatments.
Mtf hrt will make hair regrow, as I've understood. However, it's not exactly an overnight process...

I don't know if it's much of consolation, but balding does happen to afabs too. My mom who's past menopause is slowly losing her hair and experiencing slight beard growth, and she's not even close to being the only woman I know of with these issues. Increasing and decreasing hormone levels get pretty funky... 🤨😯
I used to work with a girl (late teens and into her early 20s) who had some significant hairloss from psoriasis. It was probably a year before I realized she wore wigs, and even then only becasue she mentioned it.
Its like fake boobs, you get to mix and match and stuff. Dont have to worry about messing up your hair with dye and such. Customizablity is sick girl.
Their are some wigs that look fantastic. Looking at the picture on your profile, it looks like yours is one of them. If i did not have the context of this post, i would not know that it was a wig.

Also there are a lot of bald women, way more than you may think.

I think you look beautiful 😍
Finasteride has done wonders for me. Not even a year in and my widows peak is almost gone. Obv ymmv but id ask your endo about it!
That's my actual greatest fear I'm an incredibly vain person though
To me it sounds like it's genetic, so there is probably not a lot you can do, but keep in mind there are bald cis women too. My grandmother wore wigs most of her life due to cancer and insecurities.

Maybe FFS would help you see yourself as a bald female who wears wigs instead?
Get hair transplant in Turkey for almost 1/10 of that amount.
Lol I’m non-binary and I used to get the “a shaved head is so feminine” type of comments all the time. also a lot of folks on HRT report that it comes back, if you’re able to go on them.
Either some nice wigs or just rock it! Lots of girls shave their head and look amazing, but I understand how that can be hard to think of as a feminine thing

Edit: plenty of women also wear wigs! Either because they're bald, don't like their natural hair, or just because that's what they like!
Embrace the wigs! I have a ton of wigs I cycle through, and though I’m not all that happy with my hair (super curly, frizzy, and difficult to manage) I feel like I can regain some control with the wigs. I’m also on T and have a family history of MPB so I’m prepared for it. I just think of it has having a different hair style rather than fake hair. There are also a lot of cultures that incorporate wigs into their style, particularly black culture in the US. I’d maybe do more research into that to help it feel less “fake” in your mind, and instead as a perfectly accountable method of style and self expression
Maybe follow groups for people with alopecia or cancer, there’s a lot of support there for people who are (going) bald, and there’s tips in there as well. 

I had a shaved head for a year or two (because I liked it and it gave me gender euphoria) and I joined a couple of those groups too, as they’re all about loving baldness but giving tips on how not to be bald too, and where to get the best wigs, etc etc. 

I’m really sorry you are dealing eith this problem, I hope there is something for you out there💕

(Though I know quite a lot of people who wear wigs daily and though I’ve heard it sucks sometimes, especially in summer heat, I think that’s your best option)
You aren't F'd at all. I'm 60, 6'1, 450+ pounds at the beginning, mental and physical health issues. I thought as you do.

The therapists got me to start paying attention to other women around me whenever I could, it didn't take long to prove that I wanted to change and a lot of others who looked worse didn't. The big secret? Fake it until you make it. Act confident and as things improve, and they will, it gets easier. 2021 was the second worse year I've ever had and I still managed to drop 110 pounds and start exercising. You can conquer your mountain too. 

BTW confidence works with wigs too, there's a transwoman in our support group who is bald in support of her daughter who is undergoing chemo. She's going with it even though her daughter is getting her hair back and she never has trouble over it. Hormones make a huge difference to your face and outlook.
Some women are bald and it can be very attractive.
One of my mom's friends growing up couldn't grow hair. She always wore a wig. She was really pretty - I think you might be worrying too much about it!
I think it should be ok and you aren't F'd. In my highschool there was one girl who also lost all her hair. At first she wore some wigs, then she just cut her hair short and eventually shaved it all off (it got patchy before being completely gone). She still looked fem af and was honestly rocking that style. I also read in the comments that HRT might help you get your hair back, so whether it does come back or not I'm sure you will look epic.
I was bald too. A couple years of consistent finasteride and minoxidil have gotten me to a comfortable place. It's not perfect and my bangs still kinda suck, but it works well with certain hairstyles and it's nice to not have to wear wigs or extensions anymore.
my mother has alopecia, she has worn wigs most of my life. She has struggled with her feminity, so i can only imagine how difficult it is with trans issues ontop of it. 

i've always been inspired by her capacity to indulge in beauty in other ways, through makeup, music, clothing, creativity, perfume, nails, trying different hairstyles with wigs. humor has been a great tool for her to deal with it. 

actualising the self does not have to be limited to the avenues we don't find joy in. there are many ways to produce a self that feels realised and authentic to our souls. its in how we view others, how we treat others, how we treat ourselves, it's through compassion.

listen to SOPHIE's music or read Judith Butler, their work embraces pretending as the only way we exist. Everything is fake and real at the same time. :) <3
I know this is usually used for trans men to grow beards but maybe minoxidil could help your head hair growth. I've seen a few posts where they've used it on their bodies and had good results, so maybe it'll help with your hair? ultimately though it will take years to grow back to any decent length and I'm really sorry you have to deal with this. good luck
I would take a look into Dr. Will Powers hair treatment stuff. I heard it had incredible results. The formula is publicly available too.
Besides the medical things that you can try...well being bald doesn't make you less woman.  Once you accept that also woman can be bald is all about your confidence. 
I'm on the same boat, was using a wig until few months ago, but after 2 years i decided to embrace my short hair and go all in with a buzzcut. Makeup can make wonder.

But again even with a wig there is nothing wrong with it...at the end is all about how you want to be.
One of my aunts is bald due to chemotherapy. All of her hair fell off but she still wears the cutest (and sometimes sexiest) outfits. I think it's still a matter of how you present yourself and how comfortable you are in it.

Just do what makes you feel comfy. You don't need to pass to anyone but yourself.
I’m in the same boat looking for options. I don’t yet have a wig. Don’t know where to find a good one
HEY ITS OKAY!! YOUR TOTALLY FINE!! YOU CAN HAVE FUN WITH WHATEVER COLOUR HAIR YOU WANT WITHOUT DEALING WITH IT DYING FROM BLEACH AND STUFF!! THINK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE :D
I hear what you’re struggling with here, and I just want to encourage you that they way you feel looking at it now may not stay the same forever.

I started questioning my gender early last year, and one of the steps I took was shaving my beard off for the first time in years. I realized that I’d been growing it out in part to make myself look more masculine, but also in part to hide my actual chin and jawline, because they weren’t the shape and size I wanted them to be.

The first week after I shaved, I had some pretty strong feelings of dysphoria every time I looked in the mirror, but I self-soothed every time, gently hugging myself a little and stroking my arms, saying “it’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with your face, that’s just the way it is shaped. It’s a good shape, there’s nothing wrong with how it looks, you’re just not used to it.” And I would just keep doing that till the feelings settled and I could look at it without any reactive feelings of disgust or confusion.

It took a few weeks, but it got to the point where I *actively liked* looking at my face without a beard, and now I feel weird if my facial hair gets beyond stubble into prickly territory.

Baldness is a gender neutral trait, because everyone has hair and everyone can lose that hair. I think the pure bald haircut can be really bold and powerful, and you can change anything you want to about the rest of your appearance to make it fit and feel like it’s your personal style.

Look up Mark Bryan for an example of some outfits paired with a bald head to see just how wide of an expression of gender is possible with that hairstyle.

Now, if the feelings are too overwhelming or uncomfortable for you, I definitely recommend trying a wig out as an additional option. I guarantee you, the quality of wig prep technique and styles of wigs have improved to the point that you’ve probably seen a wig already this week and had no idea. It will take practice getting used to putting them on and styling them, but you’re also on the internet, with literally hundreds of demos and lessons and even elder trans folk who would be happy to help you learn. You can look totally natural and comfortable with a wig if you decide that’s what’s right for you.

I wish you luck in your self-discovery and expression, though. I know how hard it is to feel as though your body is an obstacle to be removed or dealt with. It has really helped me to learn how to see it in a way that I can celebrate and decorate, even if it’s not going to look *exactly* the way I want. I can be more happy and comfortable in my body now than I could before, and that was worth the effort alone. 🙂
Wigs are not playing pretend girl!!!!! If they make you happy wear them~
Tattoo a hairline. Microdermal tattoos
Hi Nicki! 
I know dysphoria can be a real pain in the butt but please don’t lose hope. I did peep your profile and I saw some of the selfies you posted - you’re an absolute cutie! I know it may not mean much from a stranger on the internet, but I think you would look lovely with or without hair 🥰

That being said though, giving HRT and other therapies some time to work can help too. Minoxidil can help reactivate the follicles and usually you can just use it for a year or so then wean off. I wish you the best of luck!
You look gorgeous sweetheart
youre not fucked lol. girls can look good with a buzz cut
I don't know that this will help, but I (mtf) found out recently that I hate my hair. It sounds stupid because I was stoked to be able to grow it out finally (I was military for 12 years), but...I just fuckin' hated it.
I buzzed my whole head recently and feel more feminine for it.
If wigs make you feel bad (I used to use one too), try a punk look. Seriously, it sounds silly, but people won't even do the second-glance thing if you seem unique from the offset.
I’m done with my receding hairline. For now I’m wearing a hand made human hair topper. I made it myself and it looks great. I’m starting to dabble into wigs. There are some spectacular realistic wigs for any gender. I found a great supplier from Instagram. Also the beautiful dark skinned womens hair stores are great to go and try any look you like. All the best from xx
Thanks but I've already got 2 amazing human hair wigs - had them for 6 months. 

I'm just so self concoius about wearing wigs and it makes me feel fake. 

How can I find a partner who will accept me. I understand afab women are bald. But since I'm amab - without hair it will never help me pass and I'll look like a bald dude 🥲
Yeh I have really lucky to have decent human hair wigs 

- but I hate waking up and just having the reminder. 

- also how the hell will I find a partner that will fond me attractive 🥲
Minoxidil is fantastic
- 6 mg/day E 
+  undetectable T (I was on Bica)

Thank you for asking !
Once the roots are dead, no amount of anti androgen will revive them, unfortunately
Don't do that, hormones can recover your hair when combined with minoxidil.
Not true, see my comment:
https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/s42luc/slug/hspc2vk
Laser on head hair is inconsistent at first because of the way head hair growth is, and so the MINIMUM number of laser treatments is double of the rest of the areas of the body like face.   Because of the time commitment (years) and the patchiness of the interim period, many people who start the process don’t go through with it.  Because of THAT fact, many laser places do not offer head laser anymore.   

Source: my two laser places when I asked them each this same question.


I’m also looking to get a tattoo, though plan to use wigs for my day job.  Also, there is a micropigmentation clinic around my city, so I want to check out actual clients of theirs, since I am curious if that is the right direction for me.
I don't disagree - but it normally suits a woman if when she doesn't need FFS to pass 🥲 

I unfortunately still look like a bald dude - not a bald woman
Thank you for the info !! 

I'm planning on having FFS at the end of this year so I'm waiting to look at a transplant until after that (I'm avoiding any hair line lowering in FFS to preserve flexibility in my scalp for FUT) 

Info on the clinic would be nice as I'm just paranoid about the tabloids reporting  ""Bodged turkey transplant""
What does microneedling do?
I understand that women lose hair - but they look like bald women. 

I'm amab - so me not having hair will never help me pass/ and I just look like a bald guy 🙃
Doing all of the above + human hair wigs.

 It's just shit to wake up and be like damn that isn't a good look 🥲

Just finding it difficult to believe someone will be able to accept me
Thank you for the reassurance! And compliments ☺ But I just could imagine letting anyone see me without my wigs - it just kind of isolates me a bit. 

I'm planning on FFS at the end of the year so I guess looking like a bald woman > looking like a bald guy.
Got 2 amazing quality ones already 🥲
Got 2 human hair wigs !
I was also looking for something and finasteride would boost my T and my T levels are already lower than a cis male “thank god” lol but since I saw the wording “raise” testosterone I opted not to do that. Unless you all can tell me different?
Starting HRT next month
This Is The Way
Check out online retailers for DIY.

For example lordhair.com has long pieces for $400
You can have hair again, check my comment:

As for romance though, I got nothin' for ya'. I'm mostly T4T and still can't make anything work. Sorry 😅
So many women wear wigs though sis. I don’t dye my hair so I just use em. Make sure you’re using lace fronts and high quality ones. No one would be able too tell. So many women wear wigs and that’s okay!
My wife is a transfeminine person and has a shaven head. She also likes wearing laces, but of course I love her and see her beauty even with a shaved head. If you are looking for ways to pass better, you can try wearing large earrings and make up, or even bandanas or other objects made for decorating the head. Don't give up and keep using whatever you can, it might feel weird at first but you can get used to it 🥰💖
Look at Ayanna Pressley. You can't say she isn't a fierce feminine woman. I often work myself up about things that don't feel feminine. I might start out by telling myself it's dysphoria. But when I look at women in my family, I see they have the same receding hairlines. They have the same strong jaws. There are other cis women who are tall, strong, and have big hands. I can be like them. 

I don't know how you relate to what I've shared, but I think you're gorgeous and I wish you peace.

You’re not fake for wearing wigs. Women with cancer, Jewish orthodox women, black women, white women, brown women all wear wigs. It’s so common I had a lady ask to BUY MY HAIR as a kid because she wanted to make a wig from it (I had long, auburn curls). Seriously. It’s okay to wear wigs
You have to first learn to accept and love yourself before you can really find a partner who you expect to do the same. You're far from F'd OP, and there's absolutely no reason other than the ones you've made up for yourself to feel fake by wearing a wig. You are beautiful and deserve to feel love from yourself ❤💙
If it helps, I saw your pics a while ago, recognized them when I Iooked at your profile just now. I had no idea they were wigs at the time. Even still, you look incredible :)
I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but I have found many bald women attractive in my life. 

If you're worried about partners, maybe consider a T4T relationship? Idk your orientation but trans people will understand these issues and insecurities a lot better than cis people would, as well as having similar insecurities of their own
I don't know who told you bald women aren't attractive but i would like to have a ""polite conversation"" with them
If it helps you can cover your head, even when sleeping. Many people wear a sleeping cap. I’m a bald woman too and I like wearing fun tie dye bandanas, elegant breathable hijab, toques and beanies in the winter, etc., 
We’re not F’d and we’re beautiful ladies
Well…if it’s been more than three months and there aren’t any baby hairs you may not be getting regrowth.  You can ask someone else to look at your head.  It’s kind of hard to see the top of your head properly in a mirror.

The only other cheap option is minoxidil if you aren’t already using it.  It can regrow hair but that hair is dependent on it and you have to use it for life.  Still better than spending 10k.

I’d you’re completely bald with no live follicles you can’t even use platelet rich plasma though you could still get a consultation on it.  

I would try minox for a few months while taking the current meds and see if you have any regrowth.  If that fails then yeah you’re looking at transplants.
I know, it’s just that it started at 19 and she’s 26 so it made me wonder if they can possibly all be dead.
I’m sure you look better than you think sis
There is no guarantee that you will look like a guy after 2 years of HRT. And even if you do, does it truly matter if you are being your true and authentic self? I’m 39, and only now starting my own journey. I will never look like a true woman, but I am the happiest that I have ever been in my life just by taking the first steps. Who cares what society sees, it’s only about you.
I know it sucks to feel like you don't look good but tbh everyone looks awful when they wake up. And I don't know anyone who won't accept a woman just because she's bald. 

How do you feel once you're dressed, and put on your make up, and your wig?
Exactly! That’s the spirit! Seriously tho, give hrt some time. Once you hit 5 years or so you literally don’t know, it’s a completely different world.
I hope it was consensual
I'm lucky I can afford/ have good quality lace front human hair wigs ! Thank you for the reassurance 

It just feels as though I'm fake and it's not really me - I'd love to be able to put my hair up in a messy bun and not have to worry about anything else. 

I can't imagine a partner being able to wake up next to me/ accept me becuase of it 🙃
black women especially! they make hair a craft. Many black women wear fake hair.
I often struggle with the fact that I have huge feet and probably won't be getting cool boots or anything like that. I also have huge hands, but I don't mind them as much. I imagine somewhere out there, there are cis women feeling my pain
>:)

:)
Thank you ! 

I'm attracted to feminity so I'd find it ironic if someone would be able to love me for my feminity (why I'm conscious about the balding)

 I just feel like I'm deceiving someone with my wigs - and taking it of they would just see a man 🥲
I'm also just a stranger on the internet whose preferences have nothing to do with how you feel about yourself. 

But I spent a lot of time in the punk/alt scene, and women with shaved or bald heads are my kryptonite.

They look badass and delicate at the same time, and often very feminine (we're talking punk here, so some opt to decidedly NOT).

There's nothing wrong with wanting to have hair, or wearing wigs. But in case you can't or don't want to, please be assured that you absolutely are no less of a woman if you're bald, that you will be attractive to people as a bald woman - and that you share this situation with more cis women than would like to admit.
Only a dermatologist can answer that question. I also started balding at around the same age and started taking fin when I was around 28. I never had any regrowth whatsoever, only tons of side-effects. Now I’m in my 40s and all hope is lost for me in this respect
In WWII Lt Aldo Raine had all of his men scalp the Nazis they killed so he could send the hair home for SkylerD95. 
Bawnjorno.
It’s a process but you’ll come around eventually luv. If you feel confident wearing a wig then by all means wear a wig and there are so many bald women with S/Os. If makeup makes you feel happy then wear makeup. If you want plastic surgery then pursue it luv. Life’s too short too be insecure and if you have a fix for it as simple as putting on a wig than do it? That’s your beauty and you’re just enhancing it. Mr.Right we’ll come and if he’s your Soul Mate he won’t care cause you’re beautiful regardless.
As a pan woman attracted to all women, I promise you that bald women are sexy. I’m sorry you don’t feel complete in the experience you want, and understand what it can be like to not have a full choice in something like this. But if it’s any consolation, I guarantee that you will be loved for being badass bald and playful in wigs.

When I started dating my SO we both looked like men, but we still liked each other, because we both knew we definitely aren't men. I know how important appearance and passing in general is to trans* people, but just try to not focus on it - if you date a trans* person they most probably won't care about how you look.
I’m so sorry.  

I recommended she try minoxidil.  Did you ever end up trying it?  I’m sure the answer is yes.
I’m only transitioning now and yeah, I’m using it. Who knows, perhaps miracles do happen. But yeah, I also used it earlier. The problem is that I used to be extremely sensitive to propylene glycol which close to all Minoxidil brands put in. I got terrible rash and other skin issues from it. Now at least I tolerate it better"	s42luc	trans	950	0.99	2022-01-14 21:05:58
Question for all mtf trans people!	"what's the dumbest reason you have cried?

(asking for a friend who thinks she was just about to cry for a ""dumb"" reason, and I'm trying to explain that emotions are valid!)"	"Ok ive got a good one.

I cried in my car right before my mental health appointment.

The reason?

I saw a singular ice crystal on my windshield melt away.

It was cold out and it held on and watched all of its ice buddies melt before it gave up and melted against the glass.

Had to watch its whole world fade away by itself.

(This was at like 8 or 9 months of E)
i once cried for not crying enough
I saw my friends cat last week and broke down crying.  I’ve seen him a hundred times. He’s cute, but he was OVERWHELMINGLY cute that day 🥰🥰🥰
(own example)

i cried cos i stepped on a wet puddle in the kitchen with new socks on
Let's see...

One time my wife came home randomly with flowers for me. She had never done that before, but she's been doing that occasionally since I've come out. I cried like a baby.

Oh! I have another one! Can I share multiple? I'm a fucking crybaby now --- which is kind of refreshing, I used to *want* to cry but be completely *unable* to.

I cried when I dropped a small bit of food on my new kitty pajamas.

And yet another!

My wife had wanted a long sleeved cat button-down. I had ordered it, wanting to get it for her for Christmas. The package arrived the day or so before, and I hid it. I didn't look inside it. I wrapped it. Christmas morning, she opened it and found out it was the short sleeved version and I just started bawling. --- and she kept telling me that she wasn't upset, just disappointed.

(It worked out ok, we finally got the long sleeved version and got to keep the short sleeved as well --- it was their mistake. Having the short sleeved one prompted her to experiment with dressing more masc and my gay ass melts every single time she does.)
I broke down crying in the ER last night because I had to get 2 tiny stitches on my finger lol
I litterally wake up and about 10 seconds later i start randomly crying from nothing- no reason at all- just cause my brain likes to say ""oh hormone balance? Nah let's fix that-""
Once i cried bc simba from the lion king grew up
My wife mtf cried because she ran out of something to drink lol. It was kinda cute and she was like I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY IM FUCKING CRYING! I love her lol. Or the time she literally cried over spilling milk lol
I work at a doggy daycare, this one dog named Chief wouldn’t stop trying to get through a door he wasn’t supposed to go through. He got through despite my best efforts, and so I just broke down crying on the floor in front of all my coworkers

Granted, it *was* the week after my egg cracked and I went through the hardest breakup of my life, so ya girl already had a lot goin on lol
My boyfriend wouldn’t get me fries . Even though he offered to drive later I played coy like I didn’t want them . And then I cried when he didn’t read my mind and go get them for me . And I just wanted a large fry so bad
i cried because i didn't play a videogame as well as i knew i could (a mmo in a group with other people).
then i cried some more over thinking how dumb it was that i cried about that 😅
Anytime I overthink and panic enough from something
I cried one time because I was embarrassed that I took the trash out to the curb and the neighbor told me the truck came 10 minutes earlier..
I saw a cute puppy at 3 am on a YouTube short.
Yesterday. Watching disney songs on yt and suddenly crying. K sis guess we feel into the unknown today
Bc someone had killed a zealot (hypixle skyblock) like half a second before I got there. So close.... reminded me the futility of life
Because… something to do with dreaming about being a cis lesbian with a hot gf i woke up and started crying because i wanted it to be real
Again I have to ask why this is only directed towards MTF.
Yesterday i cried because i felt i was being too envious and jealous because someone else was made admin in a server where its not relevant at all cause its all close friends. I knew i wasnt being excluded or whatever cause the people there never would do that without very very good reasons but still i felt jealous and it made me break down. Luckily those same friends talked me through it and helped me understand its just my brain being mean and that its fine to have those emotions
Well I'm crying just because some deep emotions connected to my person. I've not cried because of some silly things as some people reporting. Dunno why but estrogen calming me down mostly. I was more emotional on testosterone previously and now I'm somehow hold back.
Found out bone structures become harder to change well and truly by 18yo. Was crying for what felt like half an hour at 3am after reading about it
I looked in the mirror and felt good about myself. Started crying, but I didn't want to mess up my eye makeup so I ended up looking at a ceiling for 2 minutes.
I’m FtM but before I started transitioning I sometimes just felt like crying for no reason and would put on sad music to make myself cry. Hasn’t really happened since I started T though, that’s made it a little harder to cry. I kind of miss the ability to cry so easily tbh, it was cathartic.
I'm ftm and I cried the other day cus my brother and his family are booked up on the weekends surrounding my 22nd birthday🤷🏼‍♂️
I just cried bc at work just bc my manager made a joke to me that I thought meant she hated me now. lol

Spoiler alert: I read too much into it!
Dog tiktoks.
Literally just a cute dog. Wasn't even about the good boy passing away.
Just cute doggo
Listening to my favorite song. It might not have been dumb if it was a sad or emotional song or something, but it’s Roll With The Changes by REO Speedwagon. I was borderline sobbing from listening to arena rock.
Crying right now at something in Euphoria, not even how fucked the scene was but because of how envious and self loathing it made me feel for some stupid reason
Being accused of not hating my job enough to leave.
My bestfriend invited me to the salon she works at for a blowout and she introduced me to her coworkers by my new name. She had to take me to a seperate room because I started crying
Recently or just ever?
I’m really hoping I can cry when I get on hrt because I went through I think one of the worst days of my life a couple days ago and was dry eyed through the whole thing, just wishing I could get some tears out
İ honestly just cried/cry for not being cis and not to be able to have my own biological child

For now i didn't cry for something silly lol
Listened to daddy issues by the neighbourhood
One time when I was first starting hrt I cried cause I was at a restaurant and every table had a bottle of ketchup on it besides mine
I can cry about video game characters but not when a family member dies. My emotional capabilities are scuffed. Stupid man emotional conditioning.
I couldn't downtune my guitar because I didn't have a tuner
forgot to buy oat milk at the store yesterday. i had a fun morning when I realized ~no cereal~
So, a few weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night  for no reason and couldn't get back to sleep. Figured I might as well grab something to drink. As I clumsily got out of bed I managed to knock one of my stuffed animals onto the floor and I immediately stepped on it. I felt so so guilty that I broke down crying. Ended falling asleep on the floor holding that stuffed animal so tight.
I cried once because my kittens where snuggling together and it was just so cute
Not being born a woman
I cried at the FNaF 4 ending with the plushies disappearing as the kid slowly fades away. It gut punched me, ik it's dumb, but it was sad.

I have a list of my “silly cries” (literally called Olives list of silly cries).
Here’s one example: 
Cried because of a lonely bunny in Sarah Macmillan’s standup show:
https://youtu.be/th_nxlbXtTk
I was late for a family lunch
I once cried on my walk trought a forest because i just saw a random squirrel
I just watched a video on the opportunity mars rover and I cried because after 15 years it finally died. It died alone. I know it’s dumb, but I couldn’t help it.
Cute dog on tiktok.

Nothing more. Just a dog.
When i was first on anti t and my titty skittles ramped up i cried because i forgot to buy yoghurts. 
I went to the fridge one afternoon and there were no strawberry crunch corners left. I was inconsolable for half an hour.

I swear those first few months turned me into a great big vagina
Bc I've felt so much dysphoria over the past. It just built up so much I just burst into a full blown sadness and crying moment yk
I don't cry. And if I was able too that would make me cry
At work where I wasn’t out at the time. Was awesome. Got to stressed and boom, cried like a baby in front of the entire team.
To be honest.. till today… I don’t know why I was crying….
I dropped a cassoulet I had been cooking. One piece of chicken was lost. I fucking howled in misery
Oh boy, this is going to be fun...

Anyway, I just started Estrogen at the start of this year (the literal first day of the year), and already, it's sent my emotions all over the fucking place. Anyway, I was reminiscing with my mum a couple of weeks ago now, and I remembered the time I won a goldfish as a small child at a carnival game. I remember how excited and happy I was to bring it back that night. Anyway, the next day, we went out, and because I didn't buy any of the drops that you are supposed to put in your gold fish's water bowl to make it habitable, it ended up dying while we had left. Now it wasn't so much remembering that alone that set me off. It was mainly so sad to me because I just remembered tiny little me coming into the kitchen, and seeing it dead, and then crying my little eyes out while holding my tiny bottle of fruit juice. For some reason, that just got me. I even commented on how stupid it was right after I started crying, as I am not one to ever cry over silly little things like that. At least not anymore. Well, before the estrogen that is.
I almost cried when I saw my boy looking ass reflection in a spoon at work, dysphoria hit hard that day. For context I was a dishwasher in a restaurant kitchen.

Another time I just started crying, no reason at all. I ate half a tub of Ben & Jerry's afterwards.
Hey am I the only one on HRT who doesn't cry ever? 

Been on the good stuff for like 6 months and I was lead to believe I'd be crying like a broken faucet but I haven't shed a single tear in that time, even when I've felt legitimately sad and like I really wanted to cry. I was honestly looking forward to it, I remember getting a lot of catharsis out of crying when I was younger but yeah, no luck 😥
Post hrt or anyone that identifies as such...?

Mainly asking because iirc people generally seem to get more emotional with E
I Made a feminin lough. That is enough. A other thing was i haf to go  to my car to pick up my Handy. 2 Minutes Action. That was also enough to Crystal 30 minutes
Yeah, right. My most stupid reason I cried was on my bday, was at this restaurant, som nice cuisine; but straight over the street was a clothing store with mannequins. I literarily cried on my bday because of some random girl clothed mannequins. Redicules. destroyed my appetite.
I saw a cute meme with a dog in it <3 hahahaha think i might cry again thinking of it again. (This is great though) 🤪
My Little Pony, tbh it was probably more all the bottled up emotions of the day coming out but it came out while watching My Little Pony with my friend.
I cry so easily. Now at movies that have no reason for it. I cried at a Mothra movie, and more embarrassingly during Free Guy.

I cried when I spilled salsa on my pants, because there was just so much salsa. My wife thinks it is adorable.

Point is, your friend's reason isn't stupid.
I cry like this and I'm not doing hrt as of yet
I literally asked my friend to simply just tell a story right after I came out while using the correct pronouns and it’s the first time I’ve ever cried from happiness, It was so stupid and forced and yellow still loved it
I cry whenever I think about how much I love my dog
I cried because my dog got mud on my floor :')
I'm gonna answer slightly off-topic, because I'm such a rebel.

I don't cry for ""dumb"" reasons, because I have a hard time crying for \*any\* reason. There are so many situations and moments when I want to cry, but that's just not a response I'm capable of. I remember crying maybe a handful of times in the past decade or more.

Part of it is that I rigorously trained myself out of crying as a young teen by numbing myself in terms of emotional reactions. At the time, I didn't know how damaging it could be.

I've gotten over my emotional numbness as an older teen/young adult (go me!), but crying never really returned as a ""thing"". I'm in my mid-30s now.

What I'm trying to say is, I'd take crying over ""dumb"" things over this any day. Just a perspective to consider for anyone who thinks she cries too easily and for too small reasons.

(I hope HRT, if/when I start it, helps with that. I don't know if that's a thing, but apparently HRT is magic and can do everything, up to and including ending world hunger. So why not letting me cry as well.)
I cried because someone I love and still do was trying to kill themselves doing drugs and I have to blame the government because when he was fighting in Vietnam the government gave our military heroes drugs and they should be held legally responsible.
when I put a choker on and got a sudden rush of euphoria
About 3 months into HRT I stepped on an ant... Mum found me on the kitchen floor curled up in a ball crying my eyes out.  >.<
I cried because            
Especially when
I remember crying when I realized I left my favorite earrings at my parents house over 100 miles away
Talking to someone I used to work with and started crying as I talked about work. It was so random and all of us were equally confused, but I felt souch better afterwards.
i yawned
so Im pre everything, and this happend before I even knew i was trans. about a year ago I went to see a show that some of my friends were on the crew of, i had an amazing time while there and we had a good time after. When I got home, tho, for some reason I felt so sad and outcasted for no reason, despite having just hung out with them, i was able to make myself realize i was being rediculous, so along with sobbing i started lauphing to myself over how stupid it was
I cried because i saw a kitten

Im not even on e yet like wtf
I cried everytime I saw a specific baby cow gif on this website. It just looked so happy to be in a new home :'(
I cried because I cried..
A musical toy which, after I wound up, played a melancholy tune. No other emotional resonance, just the tribute of this porcelain girl playing on a piano spinning around as the clockwork mechanism ping'd its melody. :p 

That was before HRT...
I cried when i places #2 in a Fortnite game 🤦‍♀️
I've broke down multiple times over the dumbest things. Dinner is too salty? Cry. Son won't nap? Cry. Parents are being a-holes to my family? Cry.

Probably the dumbest thing I cry to are little videos of rescue animals finding their new home. Cliche? Absolutely. But I bawl like a baby when I see the little puppy happy. 😭😭😭
Last night I had a major crying fit from just reading a book after about 15-30 min of crying, I went into a giggling like a school girl bc my gfuel shaker cup glows in the dark!!!
I was in bed, and something happened that shouldn't be worth crying over, but I cried hard lol. I love HRT lol
I once cried because a Soda Vending Machine stole my note and didn't give me a soda. I spent all the trip back home in Public Transportation crying
My wallet fell to the floor once.
At the prospect of my favorite blankie being torn apart (it's very old and simples grazes can turn into tears)
i cried when watching shrek forever after lol
I read something about a father telling his child he’s proud of him and started crying because I really wish I could feel like I’m doing an okay job
I cried at the end of the Will Smith movie about him being cloned and fighting himself...
(Not crying, but I did cry for this)
I had a panic attack in science because people were laughing at me and shouting in my ear and I'm sensitive to noise(and they knew that)
I cried because I was going home after a date





Edit : it was a good one
I couldn’t find my lanyard that had a pin I really liked

I broke a guitar string and it was a fresh pack of strings xD
Pokemon theme song. The...gold and silver series I think, I don't remember what the title was
I once cried because I played in a modded Call of Duty lobby and I thought it had hacked my Xbox.

This was before I had a good understanding of how mods actually worked.
Cried from euphoria after a maths class because a graph said my shoe size was the average woman's shoe size
I have cried over spilled glasses. And I tend to get teary-eyed with opera arias :p
seeing pretty cis girls in uni makes me get full on panic attacks, self isolate and cry. Not on E.
Saw a cute cat video and the kitten was just so damn smol I teared up
I don't remember any examples because my memory is trash (pretty sure that was actually the reason for a few times), but I know Ive cried over small things so many times
Just yesterday I was joking with my roommate and I pretended to start crying about something she said. But all of a sudden the crying turned real and I had to run to my room to sob it out for a bit.
Oh man, before coming out my wife had seen me cry maybe twice in 6 years. Been on HRT for almost 11mo now. Here is my list: 

I called my cat and she came running. 

I made dinner wrong and we had to eat something else.

I looked at my wife and thought about how much I love her.

At a tiktok story about a bear, a lion, and a tiger that were friends. I cried multiple times. Like a lot of crying.

So many tv shows/movies.

Because I had a sunburn on my face and couldn't do my makeup before a BBQ with our friends.

My cat was yelling for food and it overwhelmed me.

Just so much crying 😂😭😂😭😂
Someone misgendered me for the fifth time and I broke down •_•
Stubbed my toe and fell on a table
I cried during Avengers Endgame, I felt so stupid afterward.
Went into hysteric crying laughter when I made a picture of Chairman Mao wearing a beret to make him “Le Mao” (Lmao). Never started hysterical cry/laughing until hrt, but it’s kinda fun in a weird way.
Oh I've cried over many ""dumb"" things.  The most recent being this moring.  I cried at work when I accidently input a 9 instead of a 6 when setting up a new firewall.  It was a simple error and easy to fix, but the tears came a gushing anyway as well as the usual feelings of being an imposter in many way.  Felt silly and was really glad that no one else was on campus yet.
I cried when I saw a picture of an old kitty with scarred ears. I could help it! Just thinking about how he must have had such a hard life and deserved a warm home to live out his twilight years. I'm honestly getting a little choked up thinking about it again.
Smelling the scent of body wash for men?
Happy crying because of a joke.
I watched Godzilla 1984 the other day, pretty drunk. When the scene where Godzilla fell into the volcano came up I started crying my eyes out. I'm a huge G-fan and know from watching the other movies that he survived but, for some reason, that just got me.
My coffee smells like dish soap because I didn't rinse the cup enough :P
dropped a hotdog on the floor and I cried for like a half hour over it
Yall I cried cause I was talking to an a.c. unit and when it turned off I cried
i cried because my wii would not connect to the internet. worst part? this was only a couple years ago.
I cried in the middle of watching an analysis about Mr.Rodgers. I never watched it much when I was a kid but watching this video just randomly made me cry
My dog was soft and she looked happy 

A pair of jeans felt right 

My cat sat on my knee 

The coffee shop at work closed
i cried when i listened to the Beta File Select theme from A Hat In Time's b-side album
I cried at a commercial for a cleaning product.
I once broke into tears looking at redwood trees.  They were just so old and beautiful!
I don’t think any time I’ve cried is “dumb” per say, I absolutely love that I’m more in touch with my emotions now. But I do cry a lot over the smallest things, especially things in fiction. I cry when a character is killed off or there’s a particularly powerful scene. I got misty eyed at the end of my recent Pokémon XY play through, which is a little ridiculous since the game isn’t even sad, lmao. Oh, and I cried REALLY hard when I wasn’t invited to a small party that I had no reason to be invited to while I was sick with covid and couldn’t even go, lol.
When i found out my favourite kids show wasn’t on netflix
This was like 1 month into HRT. There was a bug flying around in my bathroom and it landed on the mirror. I was about to kill it then I started thinking about how I would feel if I was the bug. Like just chilling, enjoying the view then *bam* dead. What if it had a wife and kids, how would they feel?? I felt so guilty I just let him out and cried for a few seconds
Try stuffing the so deep they can’t get out and keeping there for 50 years 
Emotions art definitely valid. And they will be heard eventually. Deal with now or deal with later 😘😎❤️
I one time cried when i got new pj pants and saw that they had no pockets
I just started HRT less than a week ago and I haven't had my first cry yet :( It's one of the things I'm looking forward to the most.
I have difficulty crying even when I'm Sad because young me was a sensitive boy that never wanted to cry. I'm hoping the estrogen helps make that easier but we will see. :)
I’m crying tears of happiness just cause I woke up. I’m never wearing mascara again it keeps running
I dropped a spoon on the floor and cried on and off for the next half hour because I felt like I was incompetent.
I cried last night because a plush familiar I have is so cute and I saw it getting ready for bed and it looked lonely  😭😭
Because a friend of mine didn't text back for an hour after reading my text
I was trying to help my girlfriend and I fold something... Ended up doing it wrong and then cried lol
Do the girls who are answering this enjoy crying, and feel proud of it?
I very consistently cry at the part of the final song in Encanto, right when Mirabel is given her own door knob. This extends to just listening to the soundtrack, too. Every single time.
Boromir death in LOTR, i get moist eyes just by referencing it
Beating Persona 5 and hearing the song for the credits (if you understand Japanese or find a translation of it on YouTube that helps a lot once you've played through the game)

Went to one of The Amity Affliction's concerts and they played my favorite song

Stubbed my toe walking out of the hospital

Spilling milk

Dropping my keys or literally anything for that matter

Brushed my hair the wrong way

The list goes on and on.
I watched a video of a cat with seperation anxiety trying to hop into the shower with her owner and I cried 🙄💅
I was laughing at a video of a guy drinking too much soda, burping, then running into a garage door.

Then I cried when I stopped laughing.

This is fuckin new. Real new.
I don’t cry much, because I’m still trying to hide the real me until I graduate high school. When I do, it gets real ugly
Lmao, I burst into tears when I put long socks on after shaving my legs for the first time. The feeling was unexpected and it was gender affirming.
ok listen here…. it’s not dumb :(

so my friend killed a spider and I got super mad at her and cried a little… she shouldn’t have
well it was more tear-up, but last night when going to bed, i watch my dog lay down and rest on my blanket, and it was something about it that made me tear up and feel so happy
Literally less than an hour ago.

I was so excited to have my first Dr.'s appointment to talk about HRT. Thought it was today but I marked the wrong day on my calendar so I have to wait another week 😭
Sometimes I cry for no reason at all
Reasoning for crying can’t be dumb, all emotions are valid, and everything has meaning as long as we choose to give it meaning.
If a human being starts crying its for a valid reason... period
I cried because someone invited me over to his private discord server- he considers me a friend!

And I cry so much at sweet and wholesome moments, such as how the members of r/momforaminute always respond to someone coming out. 💖😭💖
I cried during Sailor Moon where Princess Serenity watched her love die for the second time. Emotions are valid, no matter how embarrassing they feel.
I’ve cried over things being cute
Last night I cried when I received a gift from my partner. She got me a queer care package from a small bookstore. She gave them some information about me (name, pronouns, favorite books, general vibe and favorite Netflix show) and they chose books to send. Super cool gift to be sure!

Was it about the gift itself? No.

It was because she showed me the messages between her and the establishment and I just broke down with happiness cause I felt so *seen*

This led to a couple of hours of SOBBING ugly-cry style while holding her. She knows me so well.

It's like we've been together for 16 years or something (we have) 😆

What a fantastic anniversary ❤️
I've cried over my baby Daddy (FTM)
Ate my chicken wings

Classic hot boneless buffalo from dominos
He ordered two of them for me and him
Well I cried is because you know how man do this cute sorta annoying thing were they eat off your stuff?? Well yeah he did that n I was crying because he ate it all and I wasn't full and domino's already closed so I cried half the dang night... 💕✨

I miss him like crazy I wish we had adorable nights like those again..

 R.I.P Jaylen Johnson Jr 😮‍💨🙏🏼

 It was stupid reason to cry tho
I was building a Gunpla and I was struggling with 2 tiny pieces and got them after a few minutes. Then I just started crying lol it was hard and the pieces were being rude
I was in the car just letting my thoughts wander and my brain brought up WW1 and the idea of all those young boys dying in agony for no reason made me start sobbing. Obviously that's not a ""dumb"" reason, war and death are very sad, but it just came out of nowhere and I couldn't stop myself.
I'm probably not the best person to ask, since I have a lot of trauma issues and so I can't actually cry...

The last time I did cry I almost killed myself because of how awful I felt... It was bad enough that any time I feel like I might, I'm terrified I won't be able to control myself and end up doing something stupid... 

(Plz send hugs, I could use them...)
One time my sister asked “what’s on your face” and I cried at the Wendy’s drive through
I cry everyday because I can't come out of the closet 😔
I don’t know, I just cry about everyday so it’s hard to keep track.
i cry if something sad doesn’t make me cry
I started crying during the first scene of *Encanto*. I thought it would stop rather quickly.

I was wrong.

I cried for the ENTIRE MOVIE, including all of the songs except We Don't Talk About Bruno. I was an absolute mess.
I used to go to speech therapy for my speach impediment and I cried because I couldn't say yellow that's probably the dumbest reason I have cried
I haven’t even done anything hormone wise (and frankly don’t plan to as I’m ok with my body rn) but I’d probably say some of my friends… they make me so worried sometimes about the stupidest shit and I just cry to myself because I think they’re being reckless or just generally unsafe sometimes
Literally just felt like it, wasn’t sad or anything I just decided to cry a little for no reason and then I was like “interesting” and went on with my day. Or when I stab myself with my eyeliner or mascara brushes, that shot hurts
Just two days ago I cried for two hours at work cause I tried to join a discord server and messed it up somehow and just cried while helping my customers and couldn’t stop.
Mhmmm, the other day i randomly cried while listening to Bowie's ""Space Oddity""!
Usually listening to music, albeit pleasant, does not cause me great emotional imbalance, so i found it pretty random; i suppose that every now and then anyone, for any reason, can get more sensible and getting exposed to tiny amounts of a certain emotion or vibe can result in feeling it very strongly.
Emotions in their randomness, are very much not random, so much that feeling dumb over crying often comes as normal, when in reality all feelings are valid, it's up to us to not misinterpret them, and catch their true meaning.
Ducks

Just ducks

And it’s happend more then once
I have cried when my friend told me she cares about me. It is not a good example, but I think it is stupid enough for me.
I cried because my coffee tasted good.
I am answering with a follow-up question. How long did it take other mtf people on E to notice such dramatic changes in mood where you could cry more over “dumb” things?

Asking because I’ve been on E for 6 months and haven’t noticed anything this dramatic yet.
I. Love. Possums. 

I cant stress that fact enough, im obsessed with them. Think kristen bell when she sees a sloth. I watched a video on youtube that was just baby possums chewing on strawberries and y’all the tears were real.
Got a handmade valentine from my partner that said I was the most beautiful women they’ve ever known. I was so caught off guard, and I broke down for a good bit.
I was watching the Christopher Reeve Superman movie and I just began crying, I have no clue why but just seeing him fly around made me cry
I don't get to cry that much, but I get emotional, the dumbest one:

Near the area where I live there are no sushi restaurants, and the ones that can deliver are very expensive and take around an hour to arrive (That's why uber eats is not my to go). 

When I returned to campus (college if American) which is a bit closer to city's downtown I was checking with some friends if we called for some food or pizza, the second I open the app, the only thing there is SUSHI RESTAURANTS! I just couldn't, I was laughing then almost crying because there are no sushi restaurants near my house!! It was fun and dumb at the same time, I literally put my phone away because I felt that if I kept looking I were gonna cry for shure.
I’m not on hrt yet so I haven’t had any moments of hormonal imbalance sadness, but I do remember crying one night while I was driving home because I had worn my voice down so much and it made me dysphoric
I have cried over an insurance commercial, because I saw an owl, and for no reason I could discern. That was just this month. 🥲 That does not count the not-stupid times! I cry about every or every-other day with at least one good full-on weep a week.
I happy-cried a few days ago because my bf said something goofy and sweet and my emotions went into overdrive.

I wouldn't say it was dumb, but since I can't remember what it was it clearly wasn't important either.
None. I will cry for absolutely no reason. I don't know why
Im not into HRT yet, but the other day a bee snuck into our house and my sister, frightened, asked me to put her out... I tried trapping the bee with a plastic glass, and when I placed it over the window to trap her, I accidentally pressed her against the window with the edge of the glass... She fell into the glass and I took her out, but when I placed her over the grass, she couldn't fly anymore, she was just trembling there in pain... There was when I cried so bad... But it was even worse when I thought I had to kill her, so she didn't keep suffering... Even now that I remember it, I feel like crying... Poor little bee Ó,nÒ
I cried after seeing some beautiful flowers in the woods...! Repeatedly... love how emotional we areee!
I dropped a pen.

TBF, it was already a stressful day, but I was in a rush trying to get my work done and I grabbed a pen to fill out some paperwork and it seemed to phase through my hands. When it hit the ground, I just stared at it for a solid 5 seconds before bursting into tears at my desk. Thankfully no one was around to see, but yeah...
valentines day 2021 i cried twice for no reason I was 1 month on e
I honestly can't remember, but I KNOW that when I start hrt and accidentally drop garlic bread, my apartment will be a lake 😂✌🏻
No butt :(
Hair being pulled by my hood
My pen ran out of ink on a particularly stressful day .
I cried cause i couldnt find my safety glasses without realizing they were ontop of my head.
I cried the other day because I made a dumb choice and was upset about it. 

I punched a pole and broke my finger, and I didn't cry because it hurt, but because I was dumb enough to do it to begin with.
I cried because (most) fish will never know what it's like to be dry. at about 8 months of E lmfao
My dude, everything. Literal crybaby over here, T or no T my tears surpass everything.

Edit: just to add something so people know why. My baby sister was like 8-9, I sat and watched the Neverbeast Tinkerbelle movie with her. 

At the end of the movie she turns to me like “Aw how sweet” and just sees me bawling like a fuckin infant and I had to be consoled at the age of like 16
I cried my eyes out on Sunday because my husband and I just had a perfect weekend and I didn't want the normal work week to start again. I cried and in between sobs said ""I...wish...we...could...spend all day everyday together"" kinda sweet actually
I wish I had the ability to cry for “dumb” reasons. I can’t even do it for emotionally overwhelming reasons.
I cried because my deodorant smelled funky
A few months ago, so about 7ish months on estrogen. A kid played the xylophone at church. Couldn't stop crying lol
I cry when I spill food on myself, when my partner doesn’t text right away, when noises are too loud (I’m autistic so this is often) or too much is going on, when I feel even remotely lonely, when stuffed animals get left behind/I don’t have enough room in my bag to bring them all wherever I’m going, when bugs die, when I have to get rid of clothes and junk I don’t need, when clothes I love get messed up/stained, when I drive ever (I don’t drive anymore cuz of this), when people say even the tiniest rude thing to me online, yea there’s soooo many reasons to cry haha 😅
Puppy Chew Ad on tv.
I cried because i couldnt💀💀
No sacrifice by Elton John. I cried behind my shades while shopping
Crying if your transitioning or not is helpful. It is a lot better than suppressing your emotions.
Idk if it's dumb or not, but I once cried over how hard it is to cry. Like. I sat for an hour trying to just cry about it and get it over with. But I couldn't cry until I forced myself to cry about how hard it was to cry. Like wtf how does that work.
One night I was bored and watching YouTube videos at my desk and I decided to part my hair on the opposite side. I caught my reflection on the black screen of my laptop and I looked super feminine and it was the first time I ever really saw myself as physically feminine. I immediately burst into tears (of joy) because of how pretty I looked.

I also had a dream one time about being pregnant and I was going to the hospital for a c-section and in the dream I was so happy I was about to hold my baby in just a few hours when the procedure was done. I woke up in the middle of talking to the doctors and realized it was impossible for me to be pregnant with my own child and started crying. Had to go to class after that and pretend I wasn’t emotionally devastated for the rest of the day.
Because the guy I’m seeing spent all his Sunday watching some stupid football game. I actually cried due to anger and disbelief… previously I had a rock heart and I was emotionless. Nothing angered or phased me. I was shocked at myself
does this reason have to tie to trans problems? because if not then cake. let's just say someone fucked with my plate of cake and it was already a bad day
I took my little sister to Sesame Street on ice and cried when Super Grover got his powers back
Once the pizza I just made fell on the ground, upside-down. I walked away crying
So I’m FTM but I wanted to put something in from before I came out. 
I cried one winter when I was 15 because I realized all the of the bugs would leave me and stop visiting me. I hate bugs… WHY DID I WANT THEM TO VISIT- oh, cause I’m lonely… 🤦
I saw a cute isopod
1 month on E I laid on the floor and cried because a desk I was assembling had a broken piece I didn't notice before.

Something else I'd bought that day was also broken and needed to be fixed, and it just got overwhelming feeling like everything I buy is broken on purchase these days.
i got gendered properly

let me explain

i don't really pass unless i use a lot of makeup and wear baggy or not revealing clothing, or at least i feel like i don't, and more often than not when i'm not actively presenting as female i'm misgendered.

like a year ago i was in a starbucks and i gave the barista my name, Rosa, but i wasn't wearing my makeup because it was like 6 in the morning and i had forgotten to put it on. I was just wearing maybe a t-shirt and jeans, and i just looked like a cis dude with long hair. i could tell, and i felt like everyone else thought i was cis. 

when i got my coffee, the barista said ""have a good day, ma'am,"" and i cried on my way back home. i understand she was being courteous to me by gendering me properly, but i knew for a fact she didn't see me as a woman. i appreciate her for recognizing me as trans and accommodating me, but sometimes i wish she just called me ""sir.""

but idk that's the dumbest thing for me
Wait y'all can cry?
I broke down crying because I had a great night with some friends.... and was just so sad it had to end
I cried during the trailer of Attila Battle Angel before my egg cracked because I was so happy that little girls had a bad ass action hero they could look up to…in hindsight, I’m discovering a lot of things that are “hmmmm, that’s was a sign” now that I’ve finally accepted it
I cried because I didn't read the statblock of a monster my D&D character summoned properly which led to me not utilizing it properly and thus making it more of a hindrance than a help to the group. I felt so dumb and so bad. 😪
My partner told me to put my phone down because the screen was too bright. We were lying in bed together far past bed time and my screen was at max brightness.
No need to justify crying over stupid things, that's literally just what hrt does. There's nothing more to it and no reason to feel bad
Why mtf tho..
Drew lineart wrong and couldn’t erase it,
Tangled a wig,
Couldn’t find my glasses that were on my nose,
Because my food had a weird texture,
Because I imagined I did something bad,
Because my friend said “okay” in a very specific tone I didn’t like,
And many more!
It’s valid to cry when you feel like it!
I was abt six months on HRT. I was sat on the sofa in the front room of my flat and an advert for cat food come on.

cat food

And I just start bawling my flipping eyes out, crying ""That cat is cuter than mine!""

my cat looked at me as all cats do - ""Feed me, you bloody peasant and I won't wazz on your pillow tonight.""
I cried a few months ago because I was changing classes and I felt dumb for being put in classes a grade below mine because I didn’t do anything last year
For me it has to be this one even thet sent me into a full on dysphoric panic attack cry session.

My friends and I were playing som sort of pictonary type game and one of them drew a dildo/ vibrator and I was supposed to guess it but couldn't figure out what it was I thought it was an oven mit or like magnetic gloves. The group gave me a bit of rousing for not being able to guess it.

Later me and the friend that drew the picture were talking about the game and I was explaining why I saw it that way and she commented well I have k ow what those looked like since forever any woman would. That's what really got to me and sente spiraling into crying through the rest of the night
I cried for no reason.

that's the dumbest reason.
This isn’t even related to being trans but a friend of mine hugged me once and I randomly burst into tears 


Wasn’t in a bad mood before, wasn’t feeling particularly sad or dysphoric, I think I just needed a hug 

Needless to say, he was very confused
Once I was really hungry and I was making pasta. I started crying because the water was taking ""too long"" to boil 😂
Not hooking up all my cables properly after a couple try’s 

I have tons of electronics so it wasn’t reasonable for me to get it first try and I just sobbed for a couple minutes and I called myself a failure for it
There is only one ""dumb"" reason to cry... that being if you know it is going to be emotionally painful and you put yourself in the positive to be hurt on purpose! 

I enjoy crying... crying and laughing are release! 
Let go, live in the present, enjoy life!

I cry in public, and I don't care, I'm catching up on lost time, as I was physically unable to cry before HRT/GAHT! 

Give her a Hug for me, y'all are not alone! 🐛🐚🦋 ♾❤🏳️‍🌈⚧️ 🌹
As someone with Borderline Personality Disorder I have to abstain from answering this because everything I cry about is dumb
i was making a sandwich in the morning and i couldn't open the jam jar. idk it just felt like a personal attack to my lil hands
I cried to Christine by Lucy Dacus on campus on the way to the bus stop bc “she just loves her friend so much”
This one is justifiable…. 

Bluey: S2E9
Saw a plant that was too damn cute. I couldn’t stop myself. 

I’ve cried multiple times when people buy me coffee or if someone says they love me. I’ve teared up but no tears fell just by *looking* at people I love.
At one point I was moving my room around and  when I moved my bedside cabinet I forgot to take my glass lamp off and it fell and shattered and I started full on sobbing for 20 mins lol
Once Popeyes gave me mashed potatoes without gravy and I turned the container upside down to show there was no gravy and 3 seconds later the potatoes fell out on the floor and I lost it and broke down into tears 😭 🤦‍♀️ that was a pretty dumb one.
I cried at a video game for nearly an hour one time, but the thing is the part I was crying over wasn't even that sad lol. 

Off topic but if you want some rainmakers, I have some recommendations.

Movies - K9 Cop, Turner and Hooch, Hachi: a Dog's Tale, Homeward Bound, Legends of the Fall, Platoon, The Green Mile, Philadelphia, Forrest Gump.

Video games - Metal Gear Solid 3 (the ending), Metal Gear Solid 4 (the ending)
My boyfreind handed me a little chocolate doughnut and i ate it and cried cus it was really good and i loved it alot
I’m not on HRT or anything but I literally started crying because of there being green stuff (I forgot what it was called forgive me) on my pasta
I once cried because I saw a baby cry. Just felt that, yk? Wasn't even any baby I knew. Just some random baby at the mall.
once I had to hold in tears because a menu had too many options

I’m not even on E yet lol
I dropped my keys
I cried once because I watching porn and had the thought that I would never be as pretty as the girls in the video. It’s sad on a few different levels.
Dropped my groceries(they were fine)(the bag ripped at the handles as I was bringing it in)
The live action Lion King. It was scene.
This happened to me about three weeks ago. I had ordered a pair of booties that I thought were so cute. About a week later they arrived and I slowly opened the box. When I looked at them in my hands I started to cry silently. They are the best looking boots that I had ever laid my eyes on. After a couple of minutes I tell myself that I was so silly crying over a pair of boots.
I cried reading this posts comment section.
Cried when a friend sent me a video of a REALLY cute pig. Cried because another friend had a really great date with her new boyfriend. Cried another time because a couple of coworkers who started dating recently were just so adorable together. Cried because I didn't have Mac and cheese.
I had a slice of pizza last week, and I put black pepper on it and started  crying because I don’t do that every time so I missed out on a lot of pepper on pizza in my life…
I cried for so long today because i burned my toast
I was reaaaaally high last night and was watching the episode of the office where Michael leaves the show and I cried for about 20 minutes
I just had a mental breakdown because I don't fit in my mom's bathtub.
I dropped a toast on the floor and cried 😅
theres a post on r/cats about a serbian cat named dusko (with a little ^ on the s) who has a little binkie and is scared of the bathtub and used his binkie to conquer his fear. ive cried over him about 5 seperate times. i adore him so so much
Just watched A Dogs Purpose and. A Dog's Journey. Sobbed for 3 hours.
I logged into Final Fantasy and listened to the Crystal Theme after about two weeks on estrogen.
A spoon fall on the ground
I dropped eggs on my kitchen floor. I cried because I haven’t had my coffee yet and that was too much to deal with for my busy morning.
AC/DC sweet child of mine came on in bdubs and I burst into tears mid buffalo wing and cried all the way home lmao
i cried because my christian parents bashed me for being trans
I cried over the fact that I couldn't get the drain stopper to work for my bath tonight and the water only ever filled 1/4 of the way. And I'm not even on E yet lmao
That's going to make me cry! T.T
Glad to hear I'm not the only one who assigns personalities to objects, haha!
ok no this isnt dumb thats actually sad
Now I want to cry
Yeah I'd cry too, but more cause of it being a stark glimpse into my own reality on top of that.

I'm over that part now though, mostly. I will say though there's no hate like Christian love.
Thats so cute and sad 🥺
That sounds beautiful. You should make it into a poem.
Omg babe 🥲 that sounds like the best cry
Me toooo :)
This sounds like what I’m going to do very soon 😭
I do this sometimes when my cat cuddles with me! he's so adorable!!
That is perfectly valid reason to cry, wet socks are the worst
This is cute
those are all really good reasons to cry!  especially the last one! I would have cried too
Omg I’ve had the same experience!! I always knew I needed to cry, wanted to cry, had those pent up emotions, but I never could without some really strong trigger to help me there. It’s a lot easier after a year of transition and HRT. 

And while I don’t have a lot of stories of things that make me cry, the one that’s probably dumbest on the surface was listening to The Wind Waker’s soundtrack. It’s not altogether sad, mostly adventurous and ambitious. But, I hadn’t played the game in a decade, and after just a few minutes of listening to it before bed (I like ambience and remembered that game had good music) it brought back so many memories of my childhood, my family, Link’s somber determination that he had to leave… that, as an egg, helped me release my emotions and fears in the name of growth and courage. Crying out years of repressed feelings was about the most cathartic experience I’ve ever had. It helped me come to terms with my situation and ultimately come out, with that same somber determination. It was going to be hard, and scary, but it had to be done. I think that realization was what ultimately caused the tears 🥲
omg fair XD im sorry
I got seven last year
I cry over spilling milk all the time lmao. Stuff costs like 4 bucks a gallon.
Username checks out. Also I hope you are doing well sis!
This is by far the most woman answer ever as I've heard a few of my girlfriends say this
Earlier this week I cried because I paid for a gender swap and name change for a character I’ve had for 20 years across 2 mmorpgs.
This comment is calling me out. I’ve definitely done this. Especially the crying about crying part.
To be fair, that song hits different sometimes.
Exactly. This is such a generic question. Everyone cries
Because the hormones we take often make us extremely emotional, for whatever reason. I personally havent noticed that effect, but I guess thats maybe just me. Tho ypu don't have to be mtf to take E, nor does taking e specifically make you mtf. Its just a generalization though.
🫂 that sucks
Wait was this cus of hrt? Cus I'm pre-t so my estrogen levels are still dominating...

To be fair btw, I realized I cried cus mentally I went back to the 8-year old me who wondered why my brother didn't wanna see me.

 (Half-brother, 8 years older than me, didn't even meet him once a year for a few years, and seeing as I didn't know I was a boy and he was more of a role model than my own dad, it was practically traumatizing.)
Envious of her having all those pills?
just ever
from what i know, you will start crying. its all gonna work out
Very valid. Did the same
nah i don't either, just barely shed a tear at movies sometimes but that's about it
The power of your personality and mindset.
Now that I think on it, I've been crying at a lot of random stuff. I was listening to a couple of Love Live songs just yesterday and I was choking up through all of them
I think it depends alot, my best friend has only been on it a week and almost cried over 2 pigeons cos they were fat and looked like they couldn't fly.
I have scheduled crying time. If I cry over future stresses now, I cry less when they happen. If I even cry at all. It’s silly but it works.
I am [contractually obligated to link this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z906aLyP5fg), lol jk
Well hey now, I'm Christian, I'm mtf, I love y'all, and we're all valid. Not all of us are trying to ""fix"" people, some of us actually see the truth

Edit: forgot to put fix in quotes
Mayhaps lol...havent done a poem in years
Fucking inflation
Ahhhh validation 🌈🌈🌈😂🥰 thank you
Its because estrogen makes u cry a lot more than you usually would
Nah, I've had hormones for like eight months now, they weren't really hard for me to get and I didn't have to wait long either, so it's not that.It's made me cry twice, the first one I don't actually remember what it was, but the second was at Jules in the psych ward.It wasn't even at how badly she was treated, but it was at Rue describing all the things Jules hated about her body and I just got angry.I yelled out loud at the screen 'you don't understand, you started at 13, you never went through male puberty, you never had to be THIS' and then when the anger faded I just started to cry, both at the thing that made me envious in the first place and at how fucking stupid and unhealthy it is to get mad at another person who's had the same experience I have but \*slightly\* less shitty, she didn't deserve my scorn and that just made me sadder, looking at how bitter and angry I'm becoming.
Well I'm not exactly sure but one time I cried when I lost 20p as a kid
Oh I didn't mean it as like a blanket statement, it's more of a calling out of mainstream Christianity (i.e. catholicism and baptists, god the baptists...) for their propagation of lies and hate.
Of course I love the moments of validation one of my favorites was putting makeup on with my best friend and we were looking in the mirror together I was like oh my God I feel validated
Can't speak for all trans men, but I went through female puberty, still a question that can be aimed at anyone. Just weird that it's specifically for mtf, doesn't even specify that it's for those on estrogen anyway
ah, that makes sense. Yeah, gotta say, not the biggest fan of them either."	svcpom	trans	944	0.98	2022-02-18 08:09:52
Finally had the courage to go into a beauty supply store. Got immediately kicked out.	"I'm literally just standing outside the store crying right now. I absolutely hate being seen as a sneaking teen boy who's probably going to steal something. 

I finally built up the courage to go into a really cool looking beauty and makeup store I walk past on my way to work every day (just to look around, see big selections of beauty products for the first time and the like)

I was wearing my dysphoria hoodoe because I was really self conscious about going in since I'm still almost fully boymoding. I'll admit I probably looked a bit sketchy but I really don't know what to do to combat that assumption.

A seemingly nice clerk (about in his 50's) came up to me while I was taking a look at the eye-lashes and started talking to me about them. I asked him about the single lash packs and he explained to me how you go about applying them.

But then he started getting pretty hostile towards me and said ""ok buddy it's time to go."" I didn't really know what to do as I've never been kicked out of a store before so I just asked ""what?"" And he replied ""yup, you're done here"" and started herding me towards the front of the store and pushed me out the front doors. I didn't really respond after that as all I could do while we walked to the exit was try and stop my self from breaking down and bawling.

I just want to be able to walk in the store and look around. Why is that such a horrible thing for me to do? Why do I look so much like a horrible sneaky dude?"	"That's terrible, so sorry you had to go through that. Try not to let it discourage you though. And definitely leave them a bad review, companies like this deserve the backlash they receive.

Was it an Ulta by chance? They were in the spotlight a few years ago after several employees spoke out about a company policy of kicking out anyone who they thought didn't belong in the store. Teenagers, especially those in large hoodies or with backpacks and non-white shoppers were always targeted. The cashiers at the front of the store had to notify the whole team via walkie talkie if they saw someone like that come into the store.
If it helps, it likely wasn't cause you were trans. A lot of ""classy"" places like that have a policy of kicking out anyone who doesn't support the store's image. So if you're not either hot or rich looking you'll get herded out.

Really sorry this happened to you though, that's so not okay on so many levels.
I'm not sure they r allowed to do that, we couldn't do that when I worked retail even if we saw then steal something this clerk is obviously in thr wrong and should be reported
Fuck that place. Try MAC or Sephora. They’re both usually really welcoming. Sephora even hosts (or used to it got squashed like everything by the pandemic not sure if it a restarted yet) a class called Bold Beauty purely for transgender people to learn makeup and skin care.
> I absolutely hate being seen as a sneaking teen boy who's probably going to steal something.

Even if you were a teen boy, why is that a problem? They shouldn't discriminate against you based on your age or gender. That's horrible.

If you're able to, please leave a negative review for their business on Google. Or if you happen to be on Twitter, name and shame them.
Imagine literally giving up business just to be an asshole
Sephora is 100% trans inclusive, to the point that they have a hands-on (normally, they're doing them online during the pandemic) beauty class called Bold Beauty for the Transgender Community. All the girls there were super welcoming and helpful the first time I went to get help picking out a good foundation.
Drop the store name so we can avoid their transphobic asses
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I don’t know what the store clerk was thinking, but it’s absolutely not your fault, and not because you looked like a horrible sneaky dude. 

Whatever he was thinking, it was because of his preconceived biases and assumptions, not a reflection on who you actually are. 

I sincerely hope your day gets better. ❤️❤️❤️
Omfg leave them a terribly review if you can. They absolutely deserve to get called out and shamed for this sort of discrimination.
Ring their head office. That's beyond bullshit.
They probably broke the store's shoplifting policy by doing that so I would definitely write a review or contact their district manager if you have the time and patience but its totally understandable if you want to forget the whole situation. Stores generally dont approach shoplifters because they risk their reputation and lose a sale because even shoplifters buy something while they're stealing.
Even if you were a cis boy, this is still bs.
I don't know if this will make you feel any better but; I have also been kicked out of a make-up store before, even though I'm AFAB and I was presenting feminine at the time. The store clerk probably thought I was a broke teen going in to steal things and kicked me out with no explanation. It was probably the case for you too. 

I know it is pretty upsetting and it was for me too but I'd say try not to dwell on it too much and try going to another store when you have the courage. It would be best if you could go in with a supportive friend but if you don't have any, you can simply tell the clerk that you are looking for a gift for your girlfriend (even if you don't have one) and have them help you to find one for your supposed, totally real, 'girlfriend' lol

Sending you much love and support :) <3
What in the living fuck?  I live in Nebraska which is far better than Texas but also far from the most progressive state.    


As a pretty clearly non passing transwoman, most cosmetologists are tripping over themselves to give me great customer service because they know they can sell me the expensive stuff!   


This is what the transphobes and the terfs want though.  They want jim crow laws for queer people.
sorry to hear that, idk why theyd do that, people suck, maybe try again with a trusted friend or something?
Report that ahole! Very unprofessional and clearly discriminatory. Nobody should be brought to the point of tears because they wanna shop somewhere! Fuck that guy.
That clerk was in the wrong entirely. Especially if you felt you were physically intimidated into leaving. Asking you to leave is one thing but herding you out is beyond any sort of logical reasoning. 

If you can, contact the store or the company and file a complaint. If they don't take you seriously make your complaint known via reviews/word of mouth. 

Hope you feel better soon ❤
What the hell? So he just kicked you out for no reason? That’s fucking ridiculous. You should’ve asked to speak to his manager - no Karen joke intended, I mean that seriously. Also, try to see if they have a corporate number, and if they do contact someone about what happened. That bullshit is completely unfair.
Is that legal?
what an old fart. ""yup, you're done here""??? Is it even possible to be that narcissistic
All genders are allowed to learn about beauty, so it is terrible on so many levels.  This is really sad.  I’m so sorry.  For what it is worth, I have heard that Sephora tends to be better about this (I see a number of others said the same).  But anything can happen anywhere.  I hope very much that you will find these incidences to become increasingly isolated the more you do things as your true self.
For sure leave a bad review, maybe even email someone in the chain of command if you think that something would change. Especially since it was unwarranted and he talked to you about the products beforehand.
I'm sorry that happened. That clerk should be fired. He's most likely a transphobic ass.
Call corporate
Seriously you should anonymously call that store and ask for a manager then explain everything that happened including how it made you feel. They need to know they just harassed a trans kid and not a thief.
That’s absolutely awful I not long ago build up this courage too I know how you must feel, I suggest going there a different time in more fem clothing and see the same person and explain the situation to them, a lot of beauty and cosmetics stores get plenty of trans fems visit and are always happy to help them feel affirmed
Could it have been the hoodie? Me and my friends were kicked out of a pub once for wearing beanies. Citing the security cameras can't see our faces. About 5 meters away there were two very old ww2 vets in naval uniform,  complete with hats, in wheel chairs.

Jokingly I said to the person throwing us out ""what about them in their hats"". Without skipping a beat, the bar steward proceeds to walk over and asks them to leave too.

Some people are just C U Next TuesdayS.
Email or otherwise contact the owner/manager of that store and file a complaint of discrimination.
What the fuck even a grown cis man could walk into a makeup store and buy whatever the fuck he wants. What does that even mean. They're nuts. You better stay as far from that shithole as possible
That's so damn terrible, sorry you had to go through that!

I personally think that clerk should have been arrested. And that if you're going to be a trans girl, just go to a different beauty store than what you got kicked out of.

If there's a Sephora inside one of the big department stores near your residence, try there. Sephora carries makeup made by even LGBT supportive companies.
This is awful and I'm really sorry to hear that. And as someone who's worked retail that's not an okay thing to do to a customer and I would report them to the stores owner/manager
That's terrible.  I wish I was there to walk back in there with you and help you pick out the perfect lashes, and then ask for another clerk to get the commission instead of that dickhead.
omg there is so much to unpack here ☹️ first of all i am so sorry this happened to you - and i hope you’re able to access other stores with nicer employees. what i’m genuinely extremely confused about is why is there a 50yrs old bigoted man doing working at a beauty store????? isn’t there like a garage where he’d rather work at or something??
Girl I’m so sorry that happened. What happened to you was very bizarre and not ok. If you ever want to talk about it give me a DM! I can’t solve your problems but I can listen.
In my country selecting customer is an Infraction (deny selling), you need to caught someone stealing to exit them out.

The store are public place, so as long as you are there in the open hours nobody can push you out.
(Some racist store owner have try on my friend tough....)

And as a AMAB (lot older though) people just assume I'm buying for my wife....
Go back in and steal as much stuff as you can /j
[removed]
If I were in your place, I'd leave a Google review telling your story. A similar thing happened to me, and I did exactly that. It was out of rage and I didn't think it would actually be useful, but every once in a while Google notifies me my review has been read by 2k+ people (and counting), so, there's that.
Name and shame this place because I'm sure they can't kick someone out because of whatever dumb reasoning they had. Time to go because what? You don't look like their usual clientele? Fuck them, that's not how you treat potential customers. I'd have challenged him and I'm not a confrontational person, especially if he pushed me towards the exit for no reason.
That's so shitty!! I'd go in there and make a scene for you 🤬
That's awful. I'd speak to the store manager if I were you
Follow the formal complaints process and try to blow it up as much as possible. 

Companies shit their pants when this stuff happens because reputational damage is so bad for business.
In what country did that happen? I'm not sure that kind of behaviour would be legal where I am from.
Wow, you have more courage than me when I was your age. You’re incredible 💖

Don’t feel disheartened. It’s terrible that you had to go through that. You’re great. That clerk was a jerk!
They're not allowed to physically remove you from the store, that's battery. Report it.
I'm so sorry.  This was rude and you didn't deserve it.

When I was first experimenting, I had the benefit of friends to help me shopping.  2 people are less likely to casually shoplift than one, and harder to pressure out.  

Most of my early solo trips for feminine stuff were at big box stores like Walmart.  Nobody cares what you do there, what you buy, how you look, nothing.  (At least, nobody cared about me). 

I wouldn't go back there, but if you decide to, I would intend to buy something.  It could be the eyeliner he was showing you.  Don't shop alone like you usually would, go talk to the guy first and tell him you would like to buy that eyeliner.  

If you want to turn it around, wear it the next day and check if he is free, show him you are wearing it, and tell him if you like it.  

He doesn't deserve that kind of effort, but you could think of it as practice, for someone who does, or a future situation you can't avoid.  

A passive ""fuck you"" would be to show up full femme, skirt, blouse, makeup, and ask him about the eyeliner he was showing you.  Again, only if you want to actually buy it.  

Whatever you do, I wish you the best.
This. I was forced out of a restaurant because I was wearing shorts… apparently it wasn’t appropriate attire?

Joke was on him though cause his manager noticed they were Balenciaga and suddenly said I was allowed in to which I swiftly told them to fuck off.
Ahhhh capitalism...
Yeah, I agree with this.

A lot of trans people will immediately blame their transness as the source of their problems. In many cases it's not that at all, rather something else entirely.

Is being trans completely neutral? Not right now. It does make life harder, depending on where you go. But not everything is about being trans.
I second this definitely report it
[removed]
I go into Sephora all the time while in fem and they always welcome me so warmly. I always feel so good.
That's horrible. I'm sorry that happened. 

Edit: My phone auto corrected. I fixed it.
I accompanied a there mtf friend there and the lady was super nice and did some makeup for my friend right before we bought it
Yeah, I think any place like this should be named and shamed. And, for our own protection to avoid it as well.
Exactly! I am so sorry about this situation. Whatever this asshole was thinking is unclear, but he was biased for sure and you DO have the right to look around ANY store! Hope you can find other stores were the workers are gentle and kind 💖✨
Unfortunately yes, if the company is privately owned they are allowed to decide who can or cannot shop in Their stores.
Lol cringe transphobe
Only the nicest restaurants that I've heard of have dress codes. It's a weird thing.
I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that ""I, a baby trans, was forcefully escorted out of a makeup shop the first time I got up the courage to enter"" was about them being trans.

There's a good chance it wasn't but when one of you're first steps into the areas that feel like rheyre exclusively for your identified gender go that wrong it's hard not to feel like it was cause you're trans.
I third this as a former manager, married to a manager from a different company. Report it. He might get fired. He needs to learn better. Boomers are often closed minded asshats.
Companies might but employess don't. Having worked for many retail places you can't do that
and flammable shit burns yet some of us wake up in the morning and decide not to be that person
On legal grounds, yeah, a business can deem someone a trespasser, but on a company level, that dude's probably going to get \*fucked\* by Loss Prevention for that if it gets reported in a complaint.
Awesome isn’t it? Love that place.
If the clerk is 50 he'd be a genX wouldn't he?
I wasn't saying it was a good thing by any means, I just replied to a comment with what I thought was helpful information. I'm sorry.
Oh yea he is screwed to hell, hopefully gets fired.
Its amazing
Right in the middle of GenX. I'm 40 and a millenial.
At this point I interpret boomer as a general concept of “middle aged entitled/judgemental/regressive asshole,” not strictly a generational divide
Dunno. My mom is 58, and a boomer. 🤷
That's not the issue. While companies are well within their right to choose who they sell to, and by extension - in retail settings - who is allowed in their stores, this generally comes with a checklist of characteristics, or behaviours that need to be displayed for it to be justified. Someone walking into a shop in a hoodie, with a backpack, and looking suspicious because they're fidgeting isn't enough, and shouldn't be enough to kick someone out of a shop for being perceived to be either out of place, or a threat; to others or too the store. Creepy ain't a crime.
I'm sorry too!
The fact that major chains like that can become safe spaces… it really gives you hope.
Nice
Yes.
Once again, not what I was saying. I replied to the comment which Sayed that they thought people weren't allowed to be kicked out.
Yeah it really does, to be able to ask for help with make up and having someone patiently explain the differences between two kinds is very helpful. While also recommending ones for me since i dont know a lot about makeup
Ah, see I misunderstood you. Sorry if I sounded like I was standing against you. You're right, places of business can pick and choose their customers as they see fit. It's just a shame that it can lead to events like OP went through"	tyj4aa	trans	939	0.98	2022-04-07 18:15:36
Today I taught my brother about transphobia	"My 13yo brother found a video on TikTok about a guy Googling ""72 genders"". The man pulled up this photo: 

https://preview.redd.it/86n0f6png7p61.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b632aba2001b8bc22699309d2640948ad8a01a9

And he found the attack helicopter one very amusing. He thought it was hilarious and showed it to me, joking that he was gonna be an AH from now on.

I didn't laugh, I didn't even pretend, I only gave him this cold and disappointed look.

Since our parents are strict and religious, I decided to text him in private and wanted to explain to him why these types of jokes aren't funny.

Me: \_brother,\_ (don't tell mom or dad, they are going to flip), There are people who are not necessarily male or female and their gender is different, but people like that (in de TikTok) are going to joke about them. And the worst people kill people like that (trans people) on the street. The attack helicopter joke is 40 years old or something. It really sucks.

I tried to use easy terminology that he's familiar with, but that's not cis-normative and still factual.

He replied with ""Ooh, sorry""

I replied ""thank you"" before I continued: please just be respectful, okay? It's not difficult, those people are terribly horrible. Also remove that like please, if you like videos like that, they will appear more often on the 'for you page' and will be promoted. That's not supposed to happen, you know?

He replied to both with ""alright"" and ""yeah"".

They may look like simple responses, but knowing my brother, if he didn't mean it he'd say something sarcastic or not reply at all. He's 13 after all. But even tho I'm 19 now, I've always been able to communicate with my siblings easier than my parents can communicate with them.

When I try to explain something, I use language that I know is easy for them to get, and we're able to get on the same wavelength. 

My brother is a young teen, but he can be really kind despite his outbursts sometimes. And he accepted me when I came out as bi 2yrs ago. I know he'll support me once I come out as non-binary eventually.

&#x200B;

Teach kids to be kind while they're young!! It gets harder when they get older. <3"	"Okay some of those are offensive as hell. but a couple of those symbols should totally be adopted by our community, especially the “A TURN OFF” that ones just funny and it’s probably the actual symbol for the people who make attack helicopter jokes!!!!
Good lord some of those images are offensive
Kinda wish trump deleted Tik tok lol
""Is mayonnaise a gender?""

that’s really cool, good job for telling him :) by the way you might want to censor the image if it’s possible since it has transphobia and some bad symbols in it when it was making fun of the genders
Mayonnaise
Yay transphobia and racism
“But kids won’t UNDERSTAND trans people!” my youngest sister was the first in my house to start using my preferred name. Kids will almost always get it if you explain it to them respectfully and informatively. Kudos to you and I’m proud you were brave enough to tell him! (My dad had to tell my middle sister lol I was too anxious)
Thank you for the award, kind stranger! ❤️💜
Yes this sort of thing isn't funny, you're right to help him understand that this line of mockery trivialises us in a big way.
(Side note: in a fictional setting, I would be a Tzeentch Cultist but I love and play Warhammer 40k)
I did that with my sister today, she’s always made attack helicopter jokes and i finally told her to stop. She took it well so that’s nice
my pronouns are ‘it’ and ‘ew wtf is that’
I’m “curse of hatred” thank you.
I taught my brother about transphobia because he used the same ""attack helicopter"" argument once and now he's a trans man and I love him.
Wait why are the four chaos gods on there?
Ok, but can we talk about how they butch ""Butch"" as a sexuality?

As if the whole point wasn't that they're women and not men.
Woah bottom-right could have used a censor. That's some concentrated bigotry.
1 right 3 down ought to be cavetown
Might want to tag this in some way due to slurs including a rather nasty racial slur.
Some of these are actually kinda funny but that last one is a ✨ yikes ✨
Some of them made me laugh but that’s awful
Anything that includes the n-word like that should automatically be thrown in the trash. You might want to also teach him to look for signs that that.
God I hate when people make up genders/pronouns. Multiple people in my small discord server (of 30 people) had their pronouns as ""bad/bitch"" or ""crack/addict"", one was even "" Fuck/you"" And I tried so hard not to fucking rage. It's not funny and certainly not a joke.
>The man pulled up this photo: 

As soon as i read this, the image poped up, i got scared so badly because it wasn't expecting it to pop up at that moment LMAO.

Btw, proud of you for educating your sibling in these types of topics, i actually had to learn about LGBTQ topics by myself, glad to see that he is open-minded about these topics, i hope the best for you and your brother, also, wish you luck on coming out.
You are fantastic, and he's clearly a good kid!!
Well done!

I was gonna say I don't like when people talk about transphobia usually cause their really mean and completely just don't understand half of the things. But this was a decent approach
That last one put me over the edge, enough internet for today. Thank you for educating your brother, you're appreciated
That's so good that he actually understood. You can get swept up into that mindset so quickly. Then it's a lot harder to change your mind.
i genuinely searched up 4 of these to find that they were memes, the symblos tho
I identify as the mayonnaise gender. Also, is mayonnaise an instrument?
Ok but what’s going on with “transnigger” on the bottom right?
I feel like creating funny genders, when they aren’t made to discredit trans people are kinda funny.
wait i though this was the chart everyone followed??
Its just a joke
Idk it was pretty funny

A lot of that is super awful but I think I could vibe with Slannesh.  Chaotic, undetermined gender, tits and blades out, out to kill some transphobes.  That sounds sick.
I kind of like the rate of genderfluidity!  I also kinda think it's funny how this list of anti-trans cliches has become a ""Tag yourself!  I'm \_\_\_\_""-style meme, lmao!
I was just looking for the list of Unknown Pokémon symbols!

Also ngl some of these are hilarious- hellboy and will of fire made me laugh
I hate to admit it, but I chuckled at Australian male. Sorry everone, I couldn't help myself.
Lmao agree
The math nerd in me enjoyed the rate of genderfluidity

Remember: laughter is the point. 

Ideologies of hate like the one that created this use humor to both disguise their malicious intentions and make it more palatable for people on the fringes, folks that don’t know or understand for example. 

You take a nuanced subject and point fun at how the truth of reality is hard to understand without looking deeply and for a long time by spicing in pictures of Prince’s symbol or an attack helicopter, and then sprinkle in a swastika and a “transni&$er” in there too. “Well it’s just jokes.” 

This is how you normalize hate-speech. Attack helicopters ARE hate-speech, and our laughter is exactly what the monsters want.

Laugh, because you were meant to. 

Laugh, because it’s better than hurting. 

Laugh, because THAT is exactly how to win against these animals; they can’t stand being clowned out of a room. 

Y’all, don’t. ever. look. away. 

Your own life and the lives of every trans, non-binary, intersex, ace, +++ kid after us still waiting yet to be born is counting on you all to see the real. Together we are strong. 

All my love! 💕

Yeah i mean its about intent, of this was made by some weirdo who hates everything its kinda cringe but if its just for fun joke its fine
Yep :,(
\*ahem ahem\* last one \*ahem ahem\*
Tiktok can be a great platform. I follow a lot of talented and creative people on the anime and art side of tiktok. There are also a lot of fun tiktoks on lgbt tiktok.
We need to try and remove hateful content like this tho
I'm glad he didn't, the same thing would happen as with Vine.
All social media apps have shit like tik tok just like Reddit it stereotyped to be full of fedora wearing nice guys that say “ma lady” and Twitter is just toxic waste, and tik tok is cringe kids
I love these comments 😭
Horse radish is not a gender either.
Yeah.... Very fucked up. 💀
No gender just chaos

Thanks!! And how do I censor the picture?? I didn't know you could do that :0
no patrick, mayoniase is not a gender.
You said it 💀
What a lovely story :')
Kids can be so sweet if you explain it right and don't poison them with negativity
That's great :DD
😂😂😂
Aww, that's such a sweet turn-around!
Wooww what a plot twist! I'm happy for him for discovering himself. :))
🤷🏻‍♂️ This whole chart is a bunch of wtf (except for the valid genders that were thrown in)
Oh, right, where do I put the tags??
Thank you so much, and sorry that the picture jumps cared you :'DD
Thank you, you're too sweet ^\\^
Probably the most fucked one
So sorry you had to read that :(❤️
You don't 'make' genders tho
7 downvotes holy shit u guys get offended in a matter of seconds lmao
From your post history, you aren't even part of this community mate, what say do you have in this matter? I'll tell you what's lame. Your existence.
It's not though, it perpetuates the idea that trans people aren't valid and that it's all just a silly game. This is people's lives, their rights at stake here. A lot of us have made the mistake of making that joke when we were younger due to the lack of education given in schools but most people when told understand that it's harmful and are compassionate to how it hurts people.
Your previous comment said ""Lol grow up and learn how to take a joke ""
So right off the bat we can tell what kind of person you are.
Second of all, siblings can connect with one another without being assholes. It was in no way an innocent joke. And it's only normal that siblings of all people should respect each other. As a trans person I don't enjoy or appreciate fucked up jokes like these.

He at least can learn about respect, unlike you.
""Does it make you feel special to think of yourself as ""non-binary""?""

I just feel like any regular person, it's just more difficult for people to accept my gender as is. :)
You obviously aren't here to be civil, but on the off chance that someone needs to hear it, I'll say it. Being trans is not, not never has been about attention. The amount of people who hate your guts for being trans, especially Non-binary, is insane. It would be so much easier to do literally anything else. People are trans because that's how they're born. Most trans have to transition to live. Why would you attack someone who's hurting? What a horrible thing to do. Be better.
Vocal percussion on a whole nother level coming from my mind
I laughed at mayo :(
It's good to laugh at things, as long as you're not doing it offensively. Hell, look at Russel Peters. He's not racist, but he makes tons of jokes about race.

Not everything has to be 100% serious 100% of the time. It's okay to laugh. And you obviously didn't mean it offensively. Some of these obviously are intended to be offensive.

But if ""Asexual, Model: Dragon"" were in there? I'd be laughing my ass off.
So did I “the derivative of masculinity with respect to femininity” was absolutely hilarious.
That's the problem. It's not a joke or funny if it's harmful (and intentionally meant to offend). This picture is both.
[removed]
no problem! I think one way that you can do it is by putting [SPOILER] in the title
😌😌😌
If you are on mobile there are three dots above the post, in a browser there should be a similar context menu around the top of the post, I think.
It's ok lol

Well said. I took a peek at their profile, they're just here to spread chaos. Don't give them any attention lol
[removed]
I see a person of culture here. 🌚🌚🌚
I did too. And at Prince. I’m a bad trans.
So Mayonnaise is not an instrument. That we knew. But it’s clear to us now that it is a gender. Patrick can finally relax. Now what about Horseradish?
I didn't even see the obvious chromosome pun! Shame on me
The person who made it, sure. But exclude that, because death of the author, and because take away their fucking voice and make it our own. Some select elements here offensive. Some can definitely be laughed at shame-free.

Not everything has to be serious. It's okay to laugh at yourself sometimes. If you exclude the ones clearly intended to unambiguously offend, the picture only has the power you give it.
What do you even mean by this? What specifiic harmful content are you talking about here?
I mean, if anyone's marginalizing minorities, remove them. We shouldn't give a platform to such hatred.
Thanks!!
No, just say you’re transphobic and go lol. What are you even doing here?
Why are you on this subreddit if your only aim is to harass trans people who genuinely feel ostracized for being trans?
i laughed at all of them, and trans-am, since I came out to one of my best friends by saying ""that's my favorite car because I am-trans"" lol
Lol. I’ve changed majors a few times. It jumped right out to me.
I see where you are coming from. However, promoting such images is only going to cause further harm.

Well yeah, I wouldn't go around promoting this.

It Finally Happened.	"My worst fear has finally come to show its ugly face to me. After the festivities of Thanksgiving, my Grandmother has Christmas celebration at her place every year on the 24th, where the extended family exchanges gifts between everybody. Iv been transitioning for about 6 months and recently, just scored an amazing boyfriend. 

Before I left the house to go home, I asked her if it was cool if my boyfriend came for Christmas. I thought it would be totally cool since my brother brings his girlfriend every year, including when she was new as well. She then asked me to call her later about it. Thus, I did. And what I heard over the phone was genuinely heart breaking. Iv never been so hysterically crying this hard before. She said that she doesn't want that stuff in her house. It bothers the family and she doesn't want it around kids. Both me being trans and the fact I have a boyfriend. She said if I want to have him there, I'd have to call all the family members and get a vote from them. She then went on to explain that she doesn't have to have ""that"" in her house if she doesn't want to when I explained she will have to deal with it or risk losing me there. 

So yeah! My badass mother proceeds to call her and absolutely RAGES at her. It was the best thing in my life if I wasn't having a panic attack over being the core cause of a rift opening in the family. She defended me every step of the way. She called her obscene and everything. It was truly awesome. It just sucks because now, I won't be able to see my extended family anymore. 

At least. The bright side. My Mother, Father, Brother, Sister in Law, and of course my loving boyfriend are staying behind with me. And we are having our own celebration. I feel truly loved by them and I'm going to hold them close in this difficult time. They are my light. They are why I'm alive. I love them so much. 

Hold the ones closest to you friends. We are all the same sized soul.

*EDIT*: Thanks y'all for the love and support! Honestly means a lot. The stuff i read in the comments are both hilarious and true. My mom is amazing! I was sure to spoil her for xmas because today i shopped for her <3."	"You have one of those cartoon mom's and I love it lol
No offense, but fuck anyone that thinks like your grandma. I know she was born in a different time, but only simple minded fools are incapable of adapting with the times.

My grandfather shortly before he died, slipped a, “we should have let hitler finish killing all the Jews before we invaded Berlin.”…

It was at that time I realized that people for their own good probably shouldn’t live to their 90s.
Your mom is an absolute BAMF. Yay for super accepting parents willing to defend their child to the death from anyone, including their own parents!! Your grandmother sucks ass, doesn’t deserve you, and be glad her wrinkly, transphobic ass is gone from your life. I know how it feels to worry about being the cause of a rift in your family, but it is ultimately for the better. Good for you OP and YAY for your awesome mom!
:T thats not a wholesome grandma.
Momma badger got mad!
I understand 😔 for my part my father for whom I was his only ""son"" hardly speaks to me since I announced to him to be non-binary under treatment, his first reaction was to say to me ""I don’t want talk about it and then I have no questions ""I had never felt so bad. Fortunately for me my sisters, my brothers-in-law and my mother understood me accepted as I was, 😊🥰
Family is what you make, not necessarily what you're born into. Your Grandmother decided to make a different family but you have supportive people there for you.

Enjoy your holiday with the people who matter.
Wish I had that kind of family... But good on them for backing you up!
I would open invite your extended family to stop by your celebration. You might be surprised at how many family members do not hold your grandmas opinion. Maybe do it at a different time than grandma so family could go to both gatherings but at least give your peeps the chance to support you. Grandma doesn’t speak for everyone.

> if I wasn't having a panic attack over being the core cause of a rift opening in the family

You aren't. Your grandma and her bigotry are. You being your true self and loving who you love aren't causing any rift. She's the one who made the choice to break the family apart by humiliating and hurting you.

Please don't see yourself in those terms. Hope things get better 💕
[deleted]
Your extended family doesn’t deserve you. If they choose hate over you, hate over their family, that says something very pathetic about them.

I’m sorry you’re hurt by this. It is good your immediate family are supportive and will defend you!
You should enact some good old r/maliciouscompliance and do exactly what she said. Call up your family and tell them what happened, that if they disagree with that kind of bigotry they are more than welcome to spend the holiday with you and yours.
Fantastic mom.
I actually teared up a bit, reading this; your mom is amazing 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Family isn't always blood. Family is those who love and cherish your existence. Don't vex yourself about losing family, because 8f they were Family they'd support and love you.
Sounds like you will have a much better time with your family rather than playing ""fit-in"" with a bunch of goons.

Hope your celebrations go well.
Families can really suck. I love how some think it’s inappropriate for us to be around children. What, are we contagious or something? If your extended family doesn’t accept you fir who you are, what good is seeing them. Scrape off anyone who is toxic and you’ll feel better about yourself.
I'd suggest having your close family do a party at your house without the extended family and when the extended family asks about why let the grandma explain. That situation sucks so bad but so happy to hear that your close family loves you for you.
Teach me your boyfriend finding ways!

I have no idea where to start... how did you two meet?
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that, but I'm so happy you have people who love you and show it as they should.  You deserve that love and more.
Oh tell your mother she should have this 👑
friendo you didn't cause the rift in your family, your grandma and anyone who thinks alike did. This ain't your fault, this is a mess that was waiting to escalate and wouldn't have happened if your grandma touched a blade of grass in her life and dropped the bigotry.
Don't blame yourself
Aww, we stan a wholesome and supportive mum :D
When I came out to my grandma she told me she never wants to see me again. According to my sister, my uncle tore her a new asshole after that went down. 

Tell your mom I think she's wonderful
Sorry that happened with your grandma but the outcome in the end and the people close to you seem truly amazing.
I’m so glad you have a supportive mum. You owe grandma nothing. Retirement home for her, methinks
Also, remember you're not the cause of this rift, it's your grandmother.
About 2 years ago I came out, and I've been on estrogen for one year. (Quick TL;DR, left the ball in everyone else's court so I didn't have to shoulder the weight of my entire family and step on egg shells, made it completely up to them if they wanted to be apart of my life or not)

 Made a Facebook post that was public, announcing my new name, along with photos of me all dressed up, and a small explanation. I basically said right then and there, if anyone made any attempt to be negative towards me on this matter, they would be instantly dropped. If someone didn't contact me about it, I would take it as them being neutral/not caring either way, and if they were positive and supportive, then horray! You could stay in my life as someone I consider true family. Though, I worded it differently, in a much more nice way lmao, but since then I just have my Grandma, Mom, Grandpa, Two aunts, one uncle, my mom, and little bro
Your mom is my hero! Your whole immediate family is too!

I had a similar experience this fall. I was purposely not invited to a family event. Mind you I’ve been married into the family for 38 years. My immediate family as well as my in-laws all said they’d proteas the party if I wasn’t invited, which I was eventually included.

I went to the party but it felt so awkward. The person that didn’t want me there was cordial but feelings were hurt and relationships strained.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, after the funeral for that person’s closet uncle, this person sincerely apologized and asked for my forgiveness. I bawled in their arms. I never allowed myself to feel that rejection until that moment. Rejection hurts so much.

Celebrate Christmas with the people that matter. Some of my best memories is when it was just us and our kids.

A friend shared this with me:

> Be your authentic self
and speak your mind.
For those that matter,
they won’t mind,
and for those that mind,
they don’t matter

I have to keep telling myself that.

Hugs!
Im reading this...and im crying.thats so damn nice of her!!i really hope my parents wont change anthing in the family after i come out.but there is one thing im scared of..
My grandparents are muslims,and im scared to come out to them,even tho they live in a other country.im just scared that they wont accept me.
shes truly amazing
Before I even saw this comment, when I read that bit of the story, I literally imagined like some angry anime mom with a huge, heated red, head and that anger square on the side of the forehead. Totally a cartoon mom.
My dad is 71 years old and completely accepted me as I am the day I came out. He even cried some happy tears because I’ve been in such a horrible place and he was so happy I discovered something that lifted such a huge weight off my shoulders, that’s all he cared about. He said he had a daughter for 27 years and she was unhappy, angry, and overall just miserable and now he has a son who (I will say “will soon be” seeing as I’m still struggling with a lot more things than just transitioning) will soon be happy and comfortable as he is and that’s all he cares about. 

I can’t be more thankful for this. Both of my parents are boomers who were raised in what we of course know as a homophobic, transphobic, gross era of time, but they both dodged the bigot bullet 🙏🏻

Edit: also, oh wow…that statement from your grandfather made me vomit in my mouth a little.
Perhaps you are right. And dont worry I feel the same way, fuck em
I recently hung out with my grandparents on my mothers side. They’re in they’re 90s. Both of them never deadnamed or misgendered me.

For thanksgiving, I visited my dad’s dad and his wife. Apparently they didn’t get my email about changing my name and pronouns. When we told them, they didn’t deadname or misgender me. They’re in their 80s.

Different time my ass. I love my grandparents so much
<3 c:
0/10 not wholesome :c
she was ready to throw hands and snarl!!
hang in there <3
It's just hard to not see it that way. Like what if I was just born cis you know? This crap wouldnt have happened. I know that's toxic thinking. But I can't help but think it sometimes
Shes the exact kind of boss ass bitch i aspire to be <3
yeah, always gotta look at the bright side
Oh trust me, we are going to get to the bottom of it and figure out who exactly was in on it. So far it is Grandma and Uncle. We will see what else comes out.
aweeeeee you are too <3
Tinder actually! We are both very awkward. Way into cars and anime and the same music taste. We just clicked!! Kind of a love at first sight kind of deal.

I actually sent him a message first when we matched asking for his Discord, and right then, he knew i was the one LMFAO
A wonderful story! I hope they will come around too. But yeah, that party will be weird, even if i am included. 

TYSM! <3
Yeahhh I get it. Religion is the bane of my existence xc
I’m also thankful enough to have the best ally I could have ever asked for for a mother who goes FULL ON GRIZZLY BEAR whenever she hears or reads any transphobia directed my or anyone else’s way. Your mom is an absolute ruby. I’m so glad she stuck up for you so well.

You’re grandmother is a sad lump of coal.
I imagined the mom from Amazing World of Gumball
My dad is 63. When I came out to him earlier this year one of the first things he said was “I won’t pretend like I fully understand everything that entails. But I love you and I’ll always be there for you no matter what.”  

Later in that conversation he also said (and I’m paraphrasing) that he always had a feeling I fell under the LGBTQ umbrella. He just wasn’t sure exactly where.
your comment made me tear up, I wish more parents felt that way, more invested in their kids’ mental health than their own fears
I know. I don't blame you for feeling like that, it's a hard thing to shake off.

Just wanted to remind you that you being you isn't the problem nor should it ever be for those who truly love you - as your wonderful parents clearly understand.
And you are too 😘 I wish you a long and happy life full of blessings 🙌✨🙏💖
I was thinking of setting up a Tinder tbh.

Feel free to not answer as I know this is kinda personal but how did you label your profile? I know they added more gender choices and all that but I'm not sure how to present myself on Tinder.
I guess im not alone there then T-T
My mom is the same way. My grandmother messaged her shortly after I came out being like ""I'm so sorry this is happening to you, hes just confused"" and my mom snapped back at her. They dont talk anymore 😅

Glad to have the no nonsense parents that I do
She would really do anything for her kids like she dumped granny jojo for telling her shes no good mother :,)
So do I friend, so do I ♥️♥️♥️
Right c:  thanks for helping me see that!!
i did trans female MTF. They have everything so people know exactly what they are getting into.
I wish more than anything that this could be the case for everyone 😞 It’s just not fair.

Edit: my mom said she’ll be a surrogate for anyone in here who doesn’t have the support they deserve from their own parents ♥️ She has Reddit too.

That’s just how she is and I couldn’t be more grateful.
Sounds like you have a great, supportive mother. I'm jealous. But seriously, that is awesome. I don't know how old your mother is, but my boomer mother is full Trump, and since she doesn't live in the same state as me, I don't dare tell her.

Then again, I probably shouldn't give a shit."	r2nx6j	trans	896	0.99	2021-11-26 13:50:47
My fiancé gets extremely upset and mad at me because of things I can’t do normally because I’m trans.	"The title basically says it all but I will elaborate.
I am ftm and I’ve been with my partner for over 3 years. I love her to death and she is my whole world. But sometimes I feel horrible because of things that hinder me because I am not cis…and tbh, she’s the one making me feel horrible. While she is so supportive otherwise I’m every other aspect, when it comes to anything that puts a damper on her plans, it’s like the whole world is ending and I have to pay for it. For instance, recently I wasn’t able to go to a gathering where some of her friends were because I was having really horrible anxiety about not passing and not being accepted. Instead of comforting her, she acted as though I was hindering her from going because she wanted to go with me. She got all upset and shut down.

The same thing happened again today. Her dad and stepmom wanted to go on a trip to out of the country…a country where being trans is criminalized… I told her I’d need to do some research to make sure it was okay for me to go too but I wasn’t sure and that I was really sorry that she has to deal with this. She completely shut down and when I tried to explain it to her again and how sorry I was she got so upset and said she wasn’t stupid and she understood. She then proceeded to not talk to me and we still haven’t spoken.

Idk what to do, I feel like I am just constantly disappointing her and this isn’t something she would have to deal with if I was cis. It is honestly making me feel so dysphoric and I hate myself even more and can’t bear to look at myself. I just wish Things were different."	"That doesn’t sound very supportive or like she knows how to communicate at all. You should definitely not be forced to go to a country where it’s illegal to be trans or she throws a temper tantrum and ignores you. 

You gotta take care of your own safety first. I feel you on the anxiety portion though, I almost never leave my apartment now due to it
If my partner got pissy at me for not wanting to go to a country where I might be killed just for existing, I'd have a hand on the Eject button ready to run.
I just tried to talk to her about it. She completely flipped out. We got into a huge fight and now we won’t be sleeping in the same room. My heart is so broken. She just doesn’t think the way she acts is wrong. I don’t even know how to convey myself to her. I am so unbelievably upset.
Well... if she doesn't care about your mental well-being or literal physical and legal safety... things could change, with a change of partner :/

I'm so sorry you're going through this.
This is emotional abuse. Also, not worrying about your safety first in a country where being trans is criminalized is a HUGE red flag. There are plenty of wonderful places to visit where you won't be jailed or killed. 

Lastly, even cis people get anxiety. Her complete lack of empathy is astounding. Sorry, OP.
Dafuq man. My fiancée legit just let me bail on a gathering of her friends because she knows it makes me anxious to be around people I don't know for fear of passing. Yours doesn't sound super supportive... she's using emotional blackmail. You should really reevaluate the relationship if she can't respect your boundaries.
This relationship sounds kinda toxic. I think you might need to talk it out with them since they do not seem to really care about you and your mental health.
Sounds like abusive ex....
Fiance you say? So there's still time to break things off with her before the government knows you two dated? I honestly think you should break up with her if she wants you to go with her to a country that is physically unsafe for you and refuses to comfort you or support you when you have concerns about being accepted and passing. It shows that she cares more about her wants than your life and safety. I think that can be categorized as some level of emotional abuse or manipulation...
Leave. Just leave. Doesn't matter how much you care about her rn, she's manipulating, gaslighting and emotionally abusing you here. You deserve someone better than her.
This is sounding very much so like the situation I had with my now ex. She was very supportive in theory, but there were so many issues over minor things and gaslighting that began to happen. Things I couldn't do began to grate on her and she started blaming issues we were having on my being trans -- eventually starting to accuse me that I was going to leave her for a man when I started hormones (still almost exclusively into women.) Ultimately I realized this was emotional abuse.

Getting dysphoria and having to cancel plans is super normal, *especially* early on. And worrying about your safety is extremely valid. Her not understanding these things is a huge red flag. I don't know enough about you both and your relationship to give solid advice, but TBH the snapshot you just told everyone here is giving me strong GTFO vibes.
Honestly she seems like a closeted transphobic if that makes sense, my ex boyfriend who was ftm wouldn’t let me even try to look femm claiming me trying to lessen my dysphoria made his worse , he basically shoved me back in the closet all while claiming to support me
I feel like you did nothing wrong. I'm not calling her a bad person though either. It sounds like she is just not able to be supportive of you right now. Maybe she could grow and change and learn how to be a more supportive partner though. The best advice I can give is to be honest with her, try to help her understand you.
Just gonna float this out there, that if a country/area isn't favourable to trans-rights, let alone criminalizes us, it's not a country that I would want to go to as a CIS person either. There are plenty of great countries that you can go to as a tourist that will be warm, accepting and nice places: why waste money in one that disrespects basic human rights?

&#x200B;

If my partner had a problem with me refusing to go to one of these countries, I'd have a very serious problem with how they were viewing our relationship.
""baby I can't come with you, they might literally kill me...""

""I can't believe you're ruining our getaway!""

Doesn't sound like a healthy relationship, but then again I wouldn't  know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
She isn't supportive, sounds like that she only care about herself, maybe she doesn't see you as her partner, instead more like a puppet with out will or feelings.
Get out of there, you deserve better, she is not supporting you
She seems like a narcissist putting the fact she's kinda disappointed about you nit going on vacation to somewhere you could fucking die ahead of the concern that you could. Yknow. Fucking die. 

Sorry to tell you but if ""I have to ensure my safety over going on this vacation with you"" is a problem u aren't dealing w a reasonable person, you're dealing w someone who blames you for being trans and hates it but knows she's ""supposed"" to support you. Acting like you're the problem for having anxiety is disgusting and personally i hope you break up and get with someone who respects you and doesn't try to manipulate you into thinking being trans is the problem when it's the fact her family decided to take their trans soon to be kid in law to a country where it's criminalized. It sounds like a ""they'll have to come to their senses and stop this trans nonsense once we're there!"" With no other thought about what that would mean or how it would effect you or if you would literally get fucking murdered for existing as yourself. Sincerely, get the fuck out of there. I know it's hard, but in no world is this not a manipulation tactic to get you to treat her being upset as more important than your actual life or who you are. Whether they realize it or not, everything about this is transphobic, manipulative,  and dangerous as hell.
On the second point, absolutely. You need to be safe. On the first point - is this something you do often? Worry so much about passing that you don't get involved with any of her social occasions? In that case, yeah, maybe you need to be more willing to let other people's opinions of you go. What does it matter if a total stranger isn't sure about you? Doesn't like you? It's a hard lesson but once you've learned that you are NOT responsible for how other people think and feel about you, and that's ok - then it's very, very freeing. I'm on the spectrum and am used to people either liking me or just plain not liking me ON SIGHT! All through my school years etc it really bothered me. Now I just accept it. Can't be friends with everyone. And that's ok. Focus on those tht like you for who you are.
This sounds JUST like my ex.. who is my ex for good reason. 😅
She's being completely fucking unreasonable, trying to get you to visit a country with anti-trans laws is basically asking for you to get arrested or killed
This might not be what you want to hear, but she most definitely is NOT supportive of you, OP. Although you may not wanna do it, I think it may be best to go your separate ways. If she really threw a fit over your safety, she most definitely doesn’t care about it. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, bro.
I have a very supportive family and extended family but some of my grandparents didn’t understand or just sucked at getting my name and pronouns right. This lead to me deciding to stay home from family gatherings to avoid getting misgendered and the mental anguish that was sure to fallow until 3am when I could finally fall asleep. Although it made my parents a bit sad a my extended family too they didn’t say anything and my mom always made sure to tell me she understands and hopes that someday I’ll feel comfortable and happy to hang out with them. That is being supportive. I understand your fiancé’s feelings but it’s not her place to blame you and punish you by not talking to you. I would put tell her how you feel and tell her that if she feels bad then she can feel sad with you and not at you. Being trans sucks you I’m sure you don’t enjoy missing out on the things you would have been able to do if you were cis. I think if you can learn to be sad or disappointed with you then you guys could both feel a lot better and learn to work things out together. After all being in a relationship whether with family or a romantic one means your work together and solve things together.
The first one, while unpleasant, is understandable. It's possible you needed to do a better job of communicating the issue you were having, and it's possible she was the one having communication issues. It's possible both were true. Without having been there I couldn't say. But either way I'd want to remind you, both of you, that you're human. That sort of problem is going to come up in any relationship, the fact that the issue that started it related to you being trans is what's unique, but that's a problem that you can work through.

The second one made me completely reconsider. I don't know which country you're talking about, so I don't know what laws or punishments could happen there. But telling her you need to do some research for your own safety is not something she should be getting upset about. A vacation is not worth jail time in a foreign country, or worse.

Just from what you described here it sounds like you two are having communication issues, and that's something that can be worked through. You should talk to her about feeling like you're disappointing her. But for the vacation thing in particular, you need to be very clear that that's your life she's asking you to put on the line. Asking to be able to do research is not unreasonable.
Sounds like gaslighting to me, maybe she does it unintentionally, but still isn't healthy.

Your could try forcing yourself to go and not care about passing or not. Practice can kill anxiety.
She needs therapy. It’s a great way to learn communication. These shut downs sound like tantrums for not getting her way immediately.  Red flag in any relationship. Maybe couples therapy could help you both learn to communicate effectively together.
god this sounds like my ex

leave her, she doesn't deserve you
This does not sound like a healthy/supportive relationship my dude. You may want to seriously consider dropping her cause she sounds like an absolute nightmare to deal with.
OP,  that's called emotional blackmail. She doesn't sound very supportive, especially if she throws a tantrum cause you don't want to go somewhere you might be murdered.

I don't know your situation so only you can make this decision, but I'd critically examine your relationship and see if this is something you really want to stay in. Ask yourself, do you want to stay because you've been with her for three years and being with her is comfortable and familiar, or do you want to stay because you think this can work.

You can't change her. You can help teach her but only if she's willing to learn. Ask yourself, is she open to understanding your position and adjusting her behavior to make you comfortable? You can't control that so if the answer is no, there's nothing you can do to improve the situation. You can just stay and put up with it, or you can leave.
She sounds like she is getting upset that you are pointing these things out which may or may not make her feel like a bad person. Try saying “I’m not saying you’re being transphobic or not supportive of me, these are just my concerns” 
Possibly try to educate her a little more without making her feel guilty for not knowing. Most people get hostile because they just don’t know. It’s normal though!
I'm sorry but this person is meant to be your fiancee, not a source of your pain. Seems like she has no interest in the most basic bits of your transition or really any part of you. You asked for the absolute bare minimum and got zilch. Re-your comments, unless something really big changes really fast, it's over.
Dump her.
I'm no professional, but she sounds like an honestly horrible girlfriend.
Dont ever go to a country where being trans is criminalized they are allowed to prosecute you.
Ok, going to be a differing option, as a lot of the replies sound like r/relationshipadvise where any hitch is ""omfg that is manipulative break up now"".

First one, your anxiety and fear of not passing is keeping you, and potentially her, from going to social events. Is this a common occurrence? Is this something that she has expressed wanting you to work on? As someone who's had a relationship with someone with depression and anxiety, no matter how much support you give, it can also be frustrating and difficult on yourself. 

Is this something you are actively working on conquering? Are you getting your anxiety treated?

As for the travel, this sounds like to her a continuation of the above; may be perceived as your anxiety restricting social and life events, making her miss out on them too as she doesn't want to ditch you.

 Does she end up feeling guilty if she goes to events without you?

You mentioned issues not passing; would that mean you pass fine as your AGAB, so travel isn't going to be a real big deal as no one will peg you? And are we talking Iran, or USA when saying being trans is outlawed?
Sometimes people are unable to express themselves fully, nor may their communication be super honest when they are doing something they’re not proud of. Putting you in difficult/dangerous situations or blaming you sounds like someone struggling to not take ownership of how they are feeling and making you the problem.

I feel bad saying this but it could be they are unable to say this relationship is not working and over for them and creating an environment where you are unable to continue …and you become the one that does what they are unable to do and say and end the relationship. Sort of doing the dirty work for them.

If this is a possibility you can try couple therapy and see if it could be worked out? But you may need to do what’s best for you first.

Please understand all the comments are well meaning, including mine, but you’ll need to process them only the way you can and do what’s right for you.
Sounds like it's her problem, not yours. I'd say sit down & have a conversation about how these things make you feel, how her reactions make you feel and about *why* she gets so upset over these things: is she mad at the world? Is she mad about this stuff on your behalf? Is she mad that you're apologising for things beyond your control? Is she mad that she can't just snap her fingers and make everything easier for you? Or is she mad that you're trans? Every answer *except* the last one is OK & good, and something that you can build on together. If it's the last one then it's time to reconsider whether this is the type of relationship you want with a partner.
You may just be incompatible. If you are communicating and she just gets upset and won't budge, you are a stalemate. 

You can try to talk it out trying to see if you can salvage her but most likely she has already made up her mind. If she views your gender as troublesome to her, there's not much you can do.
she honestly doesn't sound very supportive if she's saying these kind of things and refusing to listen properly when you try to explain your situation. this sounds like a toxic relationship, and if it's taking a toll on your mental health i would suggest either taking a break from the relationship and taking sometime for yourself or end it. you don't need those kind of people on your life. hope you can work something out and best of luck. <3
I'm sorry but this is manipulation 

She is being selfish and inconsiderate. She is throwing temper tantrums because you are not literally risking your life for her field trip, and it's stupid that she really wants it that bad that she doesn't care that you can literally get killed just because of who you are.

Tbh I say that you need another person in your life that doesn't drain it and your energy/happiness and that you deserve someone who understands and ACTUALLY supports you 

Good luck dude I hope you can soon find that person and get better
You deserve better! You deserve understanding and support and love, not getting emotionally damaged every time you have anxiety or stressed about something. It doesn’t seem fair she’s doing this to you. You need to tell her things need to change or you should leave her she sounds like she’s hurting you in more ways then you realize and will cause more issues for you later in life. Please be safe and don’t let anyone make you feel that way you do now. Life is too short to let those that “love” take us down when we need to be lifted.
Sounds to me like narcissistic abuse, to be honest! I’m a survivor of that also! I’ve never felt accepted, never felt truly loved by family. They were never happy with my ‘results’ or accomplishments! It’s like a rollercoaster of bad feelings. Day in Day out! I hope you are safe now?
Yeah um idk if the rings lookin to be a good fit. Keep trying. Obvi but the fact that u feel that she feels annoyed means ur probaly right. And she shouldnt feel that way if she plans on spending the rest of her life with u
Shes behaving like a spoilt brat
Your fiance doesn't really seem to have the personality type and lifestyle that conforms to a healthy relationship ever blossoming with a trans person.  Sorry OP but you should seriously reconsider marriage.
Yo dude, I'm pretty sure you pass if you have a girl it means they're attracted
I could kind of understand the first story. But as soon as I read that she got angry because you didn't know about going to a country where you could be arrested and killed just for being you. I'm sorry, but that is a huge red flag and she is using emotional abuse against you.
Aroace here but that seems kinda toxic
She clearly cannot communicate her feelings in a healthy way for a relationship. I would try to be as open as possible and tell her how you feel as much as you can and tell her that she needs to work on communicating her feelings as well (don't put it as bluntly as that I just couldn't think of another way to say it). But in the end if you've done all you can and she isn't making you feel good, you may have to end it.
It's not good that she shuts down when confronted with challenges, that is a very childish way to process problems. I initially wrote handle instead of process, but she's not handling anything if she's shutting down. People that do this don't just get over it one day either, if she's not working on this either on her own or with a therapist of some kind then it's not going to get better. 

I had a fiance like this myself at one point, I didn't go through with it because that behavior really got to me after a while. Shutting down is a manipulation tactic, instead of wanting to work it out, they want you to feel so bad inside that you capitulate to their desires, that's frankly really fucked up, they don't care about your position, your feelings, how you see things, they will not re-engage until they get their way or they've moved past it emotionally enough to pretend it never happened but the second you come back to the issue it'll happen all over again.

If this person is shutting down when it comes to an issue of potential life and death for you, they are not a good partner. If something happened in that country because you're trans, they'd probably be mad at you for being trans/being caught and wouldn't have your back. I'm sorry you're faced with this situation it sounds truly miserable, I hope you can find a decision that makes you happy.
sounds like you're dating a child, time to move on
man she should feel lucky she found you. shes being a twit for nothing and inconsiderate as fuck
Dump her. Dump her now, and she will have plenty of time to arrange her trip. It's clearly very important to her, and the best way to be supportive of her dreams is to set her free. Love is hard like that sometimes. It's really best for the both of you to go separate ways now, and just be glad you figured it out before you have three kids and a geriatric cat together. I'm sorry. That sucks a lot.
What you're describing seems to be the opposite of supportive. And even a little childish. When children can get things to go **their** way, they get upset and throw a tantrum. That's seems to be what your fiancé does as well.

I can't tell you what to do. But **I** wouldn't keep a relationship with someone that isn't supportive and makes me feel bad. There are enough people in the world trying to bring me down already.
My friend, this is not what real love and acceptance look like. There will be difficult topics to navigate in any relationship, maybe a few more in a relationship where one of you is trans, but these are NOT those issues. Trying to figure out kids in the future can be complicated when you aren't both cis, but throwing a tantrum because your fiance is scared to enter a country where they could be jailed on sight is so fucked up I don't have adequate words for it.

Genuine love is unselfish. Be unselfish and keep looking until you find someone unselfish. Compatibility matters of course, attraction, all that; but if you're both unselfish it builds a relationship where you each take each other into account ALWAYS. I wasted years of my life throwing all my love and time into people who were black holes; I cared about their happiness and gave them everything I had assuming they would do the same, but they didn't. For years I thought that was just how it was, or that it was all I deserved so I settled.

When I met my husband (we're nearing the ten year mark) I realized that no one before him had ever loved me, not really. Turned out he'd been drowning in the black holes as well.

Another note, the constant ""shutting down"" is unfair to you both. If she has things to say that she's swallowing they will fester and cause much worse problems later; it also stops both of you from continuing to try and resolve the situation. Only you truly know your relationship, but at the very least I would recommend couples counseling (if she'll agree to it) or solo counseling to get help on opening the lines of communication. If you can't talk about your problems you will never be able to get past them.

I really hope things turn out well for you; you deserve to be loved and cared for, don't ever doubt or forget that.

Edit: holy cow that was longer than intended. TLDR: no relationship can survive without good communication and you deserve to be with someone who will take your needs into account as much as their own.
Genuinely consider couples therapy. It simply sounds like some communication issues that can be pretty easily resolved. Too many people here seem to think the solution is always ""leave them"" when that isn't really the case.
I know it’s scary being alone, especially if there are some aspects of the relationship you do enjoy and treasure. But your partner is being emotionally abusive, and absolutely NOT supporting you. The way I see it you have four options:

1) Break it off now. The simplest and probably best option, but also easy for us on the internet who aren’t in a committed 3-year long relationship to flippantly suggest.

2) Spend the rest of your life in an emotionally abusive marriage where your identity as a transgender person is not respected.

3) Eventual divorce, which is step 1 with more pain and wasted time.

4) Tell her how you feel, not as a suggestion, but as a fact. Tell her she has been invalidating you and treating you poorly and you won’t accept it- either she comes to couples counseling with you and grows and becomes a better partner, or you can’t be with her anymore.

4 would be swell…if she’s mature enough to accept her flaws and try to grow.
Wtf… does she not realise how difficult being trans is for YOU? I’m so sorry that she treats you like a hinderance.. you deserve to be treated better, you didn’t ask to be trans (or ask for the things that, unfortunately, come with it.)

You’re a man. You’re a man no matter if you’re cis or trans. I hope she sees that!
Ummm… RUN!! And quickly!!
Just dump her honestly lol
Maybe be like “you want me to go because you love me right? And you care about me? Well I really would love to go but I need to make sure I’d be safe so we can enjoy the vacation. In some countries I can get killed for being myself and I need to look after myself too. Idk maybe say smthn like that..?
If she's giving you the cold shoulder that's actually emotional abuse...

Edit: Just read the bit where she wanted to go to a country where being trans is criminalized and then threw a fit when you were like ""Idk I'm not sure about that""...?! Why are you still with her? She is going to put in danger one way or another! Not only that but she keeps acting like a child and her communication skills are piss poor!
Why can't she go alone? I mean ye it sucks to not have ur partner with u when going out but she's her own person and can go alone when u r not comfortable
Okay a lot of people are advising you to end the relationship here but I get the feeling that's not what you want. Especially because people are reading that she s throwing temper tantrums when the reality is that she's withdrawing from you. 

What this sounds like to me is that she feels like she can't talk about her feelings when your identity makes her life harder. She feels like those reactions on her part aren't valid and isn't willing to express them for fear of sounding like a bigot or like she doesn't care. Problem is, you're an attentive enough partner to notice the pattern. When you bring it up, she gets defensive because she's doing her best to not have you notice how she feels.

While both of your actions here are rooted in caring about each other's feelings, the lack of communication is poison and has already caused conflict. What I would suggest first is reassuring her that you aren't angry at her for being sad about the trip, you're worried that she won't talk to you. Maybe go to couple's counselling if you think it's needed. But just forcing her to talk about how she feels will only result in more fights.

And to y'all in the comments, cut the fiancee some slack. Being a supportive cis partner is hard, particularly if your family doesn't get it and does things like plan a trip for you and your partner to bigoted countries. I played that role before coming out myself.
I know you said you love this person, so I’ll refrain from being an ass about it. 

However, I fail to see how any of this is your fault, your partner should be there for you through hell or high water (of course there is more nuance than that but I hope most get the gist of that statement). 

This is where I’m might actually get offensive and if I do offend then my apologies, but your relationship has been going for three. f*ing. years. It’s not like this fucking cropped up out of no where, she fucking knew there was going to be more nuance to dating a trans  ftm person, because as much as I hate to say it, we are not accepted by many even in more progressive areas.

Like if I was ever in a relationship for that long, and a person started gaslighting me about not going to a place where I might LITERALLY FUCKING BE EXECUTED OR PUT IN PRISON, I would start reevaluating that relationship immediately.

Also communication is part of the relationship, if she shuts you down and tries to make it a you problem every time you try to communicate a concern then it’s time for some self reflection on her part. 

Not gonna lie, I’m a lot more angry than the above words let on so Imma stop here.
I'm really sorry you're going through this I've had my fair share of experience with abuse in relationships unfortunately and it's never easy to get out you always feel like you need to be better for them or that their abuse is justified somehow the only advice I can give is to do what I did just tell someone you trust about the situation and let them help you in whatever ways they can maybe not the ways my friends helped me get out lol but still it's a good start to just reach out you don't even have to ask specifically for help usually people hear that shit and they're the ones who offer to help
No, your partner is NOT being at all supportive here. This is ridiculous and your partner is an entitled self absorbed piece of shit.

They aren’t allowed to be upset because you are concerned about your LIFE in a country that is hostile to you.

I can’t stand everyone who jumps to “your partner is bad just leave them” but your partner is getting upset about your concern for your life. That is disgusting and I am sorry your fiancé is a horrible inconsiderate person.
OP this sounds similar to one of those scenarios where a parent says I support the LGBTQ+ community and then abuses their queer child. She sounds toxic and not emotionally ready to deal with the world. Maybe “spoiled” or “brat” is the word. You need to run bro! Your mental well being ain’t worth sacrificing for a bitch.
Hun that doesn’t sound like a partner. I’m not sure what you’d call a person like that but your last point was terrifying to read. I sincerely hope that your fiancé gets help and that you do no go on that trip. That trip is more like a trap. pls stay safe
i would try to talk to her about it in a civilized manner, about how shes making you feel. and if she doesn’t understand.. go from there.. from what i’ve read here it sounds like she doesn’t really support you emotionally when it comes to trans and mental health issues. 3 years is a long time to be with someone, but if theres more issues down the line this will just pile up. then when you’ve been dating for even longer it’ll be harder to let go. if it comes to that. 

this is coming from someone who is FTM and has been dating the same cis woman for 6 years. early in my transition when i had more passing anxiety, she always understood. shes been with me since i was pre everything (long hair, forced to wear dresses, etc). if she discovered that the vacation spot was in a country illegal to be trans? there is no way either one of us would want to go. no ifs, ands, or buts. 
i’m sorry you’re going through this, i know it’s hard to realize that you’re not being supported by someone you love. i hope you two can talk this out and meet in the middle here. feel free to reach out if you need support!
She's wrong to act like that. None of this is your fault. She's either struggling with expressing disappointment in an appropriate manner, or she's a selfish asshole.

Actually, it reminds me of my autistic friends somewhat. Trouble anticipating someone's concerns, and stress when changing plans. Although it could be a coincidence.

Whatever the problem is, it's a problem coming from her, not you. Does she see someone for mental health support? She seems to have a high baseline stress level.

And does she do other toxic behaviour? You might want to think hard about what the purpose of partnership is.

Sorry you're dealing with such stressful things.
If she throws a fit because you are scared of going to a country where being trans can GET YOU LANDED IN JAIL, if not worse - that’s not a healthy relationship. That is your girlfriend being entitled and selfish, and not taking YOUR needs into consideration.

I can’t tell you what to do, but from the outside looking in - there are red flags going up all over the place. And you deserve better than this.
This relationship sounds wrong for you. Even if you WERE cis, she should respect you not feeling comfortable going out. You have to make sacrifices in a relationship sure but if you’re fearing for your safety she should understand.
The lack of adding any ages isn't helping me think that the SO is young and very immature in terms if emotional intelligence.
Yeah the first one I was like 

""Yeah ok sure it sucks when someone is having a tough time and can't go out I can see her getting a bit mad even if she handled it poorly""

The second one? Are you fucking stupid, why are you trying to bring a trans person somewhere they could be arrested and killed. That's just grade A idiocy
This chick gets it!
Ok I said I would stop writing, now I’m fucking infuriated even further, this isn’t just fucking gaslighting you for your concerns, the gas was already lit and now 5 tons of gasoline has been dumped on top of it.

Stop feeling horrible because you are trying to communicate your concerns and she’s being a fucking child about it. SHE IS LITERALLY talking about you all going to a country where you being you IS CRIMINALIZED, and she has the fucking audacity to say she isn’t wrong. Fuck that noise.
Get out of that relationship NOW. This person is going to get you killed.
Imo she doesn't sound like she is trying to be kind to you at all. I am not trans but my fiancé is and I have seen lots of posts like this talking about how a partner feels like that have it hard because they're dating someone who is trans. Tbh I think that's bs. There have been times when maybe I wanted to go to a restaurant or something as a date with my gf, but she didn't feel comfortable because she felt she wouldn't be able to pass well without a mask. I was never once upset with her because she felt uncomfortable being in public. I just found it upsetting that all we wanted to do was go on a date but the world we live in makes her feel like she can't do that. It never was and never will be her fault that things like this happen. I can't think of any other situation where people would agree that being uncomfortable is upsetting or annoying. I wouldn't force you to play with my dog if you said you were scared of dogs, I wouldn't force you to let me be intimate with you if you said you were uncomfortable, and I wouldn't force you to go anywhere with me if you said you didn't want to. When someone is in love with you they should want to do things that would make you happy. Love isn't supposed to be selfish. Hopefully this made sense and I hope in the future you aren't made to feel like you're the problem, because you are not.
OP, PLEASE break up with her! Even though she says she's supportive, She isn't.
This is abusive and gaslighting.

I would encourage you to rethink whether this relationship is healthy and worth staying in
This person is so wrapped up in their own negative feelings that they can't consider anyone else, it's not healthy. I'm sorry you have to go through this. If you stay with her there is a good chance she will continue shutting down/flipping out over smaller and smaller perceived disappointments as time goes on until there's no room left to breathe in the relationship.
I know a lot of people have responded to you, but if i can give you one takeaway: your mental well-being is  important. 

It may be hard to hear and do, but she sounds abusive, manipulative, and selfish and you should probably consider breaking up. She doesn't sound understanding of your feelings; there is no reciprocation. Please evaluate your own worth hun!
i’d finish that relation if it were me. she sounds all but supportive
OP, you deserve better. Please reevaluate if you wanna deal with this for the rest of your life.
Yo so I had a fiance that would do the thing. I won't say if I'm Trans or not, but the issues weren't about Trans issues. But sounds like the same thing. They might not be intentionally being manipulative but they are non the less being it. If they shut down or make how you feel about them. That's when you gotta end it. I went two years with that. I'd suggest you dip while you can
Blessed and beloved. Please don’t let yourself get killed. I am very upset that your fiancée is throwing a fit that you won’t travel someplace that is a literal hazard to your life.

You are precious and valuable and deserve to be cherished and protected.  Your fiancée is not looking after your best interests.

Please be safe and well 💜🙏
She's self-centered and whether she means it or not, she's abusive. If she won't change her tune, you should leave her.
That sounds really painful for you. Having been one to see dysfunctional relationships up close, I give you this. If you feel she loves you truly, then there’s probably something else wrong that is getting triggered by your particular needs. For example, is she always the one supporting your anxieties? Do you support her in similar ways? The best thing before you hit eject is to find a couples therapist you both like. Even if it doesn’t heal things between you, you’re guaranteed to come out of it with personal growth
as the cis wife of a trans woman, I COMPLETELY AGREE. I don't understand how anyone could look at the person they cherish most and think ""huh. I think ill pressure them to cross into a place that has a real chance of killing them"" and when they say ""wait, I am uncomfortable!"" Blowing up.

I am SPEECHLESS. Never, in all my time with my wife (and I dated her for 4 years before she came out) and during any part of her transition did I decide that my wants and desires outweighed her own happiness and more importantly, HER SAFETY. 

AND THIS WAS FOR A VACATION. Mother of god. Just how nauseatingly apathetic can one person get?

Just...what the fuck. I am so furious at this partner. This is NOT a partner. This is a selfish person with so little regard for someone they love that convenience trumps their very survival. the true selfish apathy in that is just...horrific.

OP I hope you leave her. This relationship cannot move forward. Not with this kind of sheer lack of empathy, care, or regard for your own life at even the most fundamental of levels.
Thats so many levels of fucked.
That sucks.

I was in transmasc-transfem relationship that started pre-transition. Before our eggs cracked, we tried to live vicariously through eachother (she tried to make me grow my hair out and I tried to make her get a haircut for instance)...

But once we knew we were trans, we supported eachother. We had opposite needs and there was a lot of ""I can't believe you actually enjoy xyz"" but we never tried to impede eachother! We even did our shots together and traded clothes...

Basically I'm trying to say you were right to expect better treatment.
>I’m not calling her a bad person though either.

I am. It’s not just that she’s sad and disappointed her fiancé might not be able to go to a country where being trans is criminalized; she’s angry at OP instead of the laws oppressing him and has shown absolutely no understanding nor empathy toward a situation that is much worse for him. Decent people don’t do that. Even if she has the ability to change and become more supportive, something she’s seemingly shown no signs of possibly doing, at this point she is a bad, abusive person OP should remove from his life.
This. So much this.
A little update. I spoke to her again and tried to explain myself. I told her I was concerned because this has happened in the past and it’s concerning that this is an issue we have. She got upset and said that I was bringing up old fights and throwing them in her face and that I was rude/mean and manipulative. 
I really don’t know where to go from here tbh. I love her deeply but this hurts me a lot.

For those asking, I don’t often get anxiety when we are going out with people. It did earlier in my transition. I mainly got anxious because someone there hasn’t seen me since my transition, and I got a bit overwhelmed.

The reason this has happened often is because her family loves going on trips and does often. We have even went to some states where I have gotten death stares and upsetting comments from people. This kind of thing would bring me anxiety and essentially ruin a good day or two of my trip and upset me and she just doesn’t understand. She acts like I’m a burden when this happens and I don’t know how to navigate it.

As for passing, I do pass pretty well now, but I don’t have top surgery and if you stare long enough, you’d know.
Yup. Reebaluate what you want and need out ofthat relationship. 

Before this here I would have recomended writing letters to order your own thought, but fliping out because you look out for your own life is just not ok.
It's sad that this extreme of a statement isn't hyperbole. Literally she might get you killed OP. What if she wants to go somewhere in the US full of religious hicks? There are tons of places in the south I would not feel safe. If she gives you the same reaction and forces you to go to places that are obviously dangerous it might not end well for both of you when Y'alqaeda decides to pull a hate crime.

OP, she's completely ignoring your feelings, which is bad enough on its own, but also ignoring reality.
THIS⬆️THIS IS WHAT A SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE! This is what everyone deserves OP, don't settle for less because someone says they love you when their actions don't say the same.
Best comment on all of reddit, right there. Even if it wasn't focusing on trans people, EVERYONE looking to get in a relationship, or who is already in one, needs to read this and be more like you.

Not having empathy does not equal bad person. It means struggling to have empathy. People can change, and sometimes they just need a wake up call. Maybe they don't even realize how much their actions are hurting anther person. 

I am an alcoholic (which is certainly not the same as my gender identity, but I also am nonbinary, I just want to use this as an example) and I find most people have either 0 ability to empathize with someone with addiction, or they ...literally don't believe that anyone with addiction isn't like...a moral failure or something. It can be really frustrating when my friends cannot understand when I say I don't want to drink but I also undertand they probably ...just aren't alcoholics, or don't struggle with addiction. It's difficult. Empathy is difficult. 

Listen, I get your idea. Breaking up would be a way to escape this situation, but I am assuming the OP loves this person. We don't know how much they have talked to this person or tried to help their fiance understand them better. My own partner did not understand my alcoholism I mentioned. She also didn't understand some aspects fo my sexuality. I had to teach her. I had to walk her through stuff. It's complicated and messy. But in the end, she knows me better now. she is better able to empathize with me, and our love has grown because of it. Finding some ""ideal"" person who understands you perfectly sound great, but in reality that is pretty hard, especially for trans and queer people. I think its a lot easier to find someone who is openminded and willing to listen (I don't think we know from this explaination whether the OPs fiance will be wililng to hear him or not). 

Listen I don't know what will happen when the OP tries to talk to his fiance. It might go badly. But this person is his fiance, I assume there is a reason they got to this point. Maybe this fiance could change, could come through, come learn to empathize. I don't know your age (as in the person I'm replying to), but I'll say this : I know a lot of very very lonely people in their mid thirties and fourties who are still looking for some ""perfect partner"". Some of them had pretty deep relationships they gave up on...without even attempting to talk to that person or help them understand them. I don't think giving up is always the right solution. Relationships are hard, messy, and complicated. Deep lifelong ones 10x or 100x more so. I don't think we (as in you and me) know enough about this situation to recommend break up. I see a lot of ""just break up with them"" or ""just remove them from your life"" on forums like this, and I'm just not sure that is always the best solution. I'm sure if I'd brought issues I had with my partner to forums like this, people would have recommended the same. But I am madly in love with her. She has continued and continued and continued to become a better partner to me, and I believe I have done the same for her. It has been messy. It has not always been pretty. But the person who once dismissed my alcoholism as essentially not real now actively tries to help me resist temptation. The person dismissed some aspects of my gender expression as ""odd"" now gets actively angry at others who treat me that way, and is hella supportive.
Dude, for real, she sounds awful. Brother to brother here, don't stay with this spoiled brat of a girl. She isn't worth it. There's so many better women out there that will respect, protect, and honor your boundaries like the king you are. Go find your queen. Because this girl ain't it.
If this is a relationship you aren't ready to end, I would seriously suggest professional help. It sounds like you're trying to talk things out but the communication on one or both sides just isn't going well. Sometimes just having a neutral third party to mediate can make a world of difference and help you both learn how to express yourselves more clearly and to truly hear each other without the emotional lenses in place from prior arguments.
Hope this helps♥️
This is really upsetting to hear. 
Personally if I got invited on a trip where trans people are hated and criminalized I would not want to go either. I’d be so scared for my safety. And even if I weren’t attacked or had rude comments and stares, I’d still feel so out of place and anxious anyways. 
So honestly you’re the rational one here. She as your girlfriend should be a lot more empathetic towards you and your safety and your mental well-being.
Thank you, I feel very lucky to be able to be with an amazing woman who sees love the same way I do. I wish real healthy relationships could be portrayed more often in the media so people wouldn't have to feel like it's normal to be treated like something is wrong with them for being themselves.
For real. I go out of my way to affirm my fiancée and help her feel fem. I even paint her nails and do her hair for her. Hearing how you got treated really irks me.
I understand what you’re getting at, and I also suppose I didn’t phrase things all that well. I consider there to be different forms of empathy… I have a friend with ASPD who may not *feel* empathy the same way but has clearly learned to how to *show* it; they have morals and care about justice for the oppressed in this world. However, there *are* people who simply will never change for the better. I know some people who are that self centered and stubborn, and a therapist or psychologist can’t make someone change unless they want to change (saying this as someone whose parents are psychologists/former therapists). Also, while I agree that breaking up isn’t always the first thing people should jump to, OP’s relationship is clearly causing him severe distress so he should at the least remove her from his life for his own good for the time being. Addiction, despite being hard have a partner going through it is a disease and I have very severe, treatment-resistant OCD that causes me to be, well, really annoying to people around me, but there’s a difference between having a partner going through a rough thing like addiction or OCD and a partner being abusive…OP’s fiancé is being abusive and OP shouldn’t have to put up with that abuse. Couples therapy isn’t even suggested for abusive relationships as it tends to do more harm than good. He won’t be the one to fix her. He’s already given her all help she could get for him in this area and now staying is just torturing OP.
It’s a normal occurrence in my life tbh , I just hope to be better then those who hurt me"	vlmr0f	trans	868	0.98	2022-06-27 04:15:34
My sister is transphobic	"so me and my sister come from a toxic family environment, and she has been my support system for a year now

and today we got into the topic of lgbt and she told me that shes bi, and i was like yeah im in the community too but i couldn't find the right label and i cant really explain it so i just go by queer

wich she says that it cant be that complicated because i can eighter like none both or one of the genders

and i was like waht about enby ppl? aaaannd i shouldnt have said that, because then she says that all non binary people should find a therapist because the only reason they are enby is because they want to detach themselves from the world because of their problems 

or that they didnt like the gender norms and didnt follow them so they thought that they were enby and she also said that trans ppl should find a therapist too to make sure they're actually trans

WICH IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
she also said that only mentally ill people will not feel like a man or a woman and that ""a lot of statistics say that trans people are mentally ill"" (because yeah because people like you dismiss their identity)  and obv i dont go around looking for reasons to not beileve stuff thats basic common sense to me , so i had no back argument so i just said that it doesn't hurt anybody and its just respecting peoples boundaries

wich she said that its actually harmful to say that cuz its like when people say that they dont need to vaccinate themselves because other people get vaccinated( even tho thats a completely different thing) but then she says that it doesn't hurt anybody else but it hurts them cuz they're separating themselves from the world wich is also ridiculous 

but i am enby myself and it hurt so much i was crying while looking at my only support system fucking destroying me in the dms it hurt so much that the only person i could trust from my family invalidating me and my identity saying that im mentally ill and i should seek a therapist

and it hurt so much... and it still hurts, and i just... idk? i just feel like shit. so i thought maybe this subreddit could help me get some sympathy so uh yea here i am.

edit: thank you so much for the support here it really made my day better"	"I'm sorry to hear this has happened to you, big hug from me
So is my brother. I haven’t told him yet that I’m 99.9% certain his wife is a closeted trans man.
I am gender fluid myself and my partner is non-binary but personally I would recommend that everyone get a therapist, especially trans people. Obviously not to ""convert"" you but to help you through the difficult prosses of internal being someone most of the world won't accept by looking at you. I hope you find some more support systems and I hope your sister comes around.
Maybe she's just uneducated and would understand better if learned more about what being trans actually means, doesn't excuse her behavior but maybe she has a chance to become better, it's not our job to educate people on this but maybe it could help to give her some trustworthy recourses to learn
Cis community: abuse and gaslight us

Also the cis community: why are so many of you trans people crazy?
You hate to see it :/ sorry you gotta go through all that, no one deserves it
Everyone should see a therapist because mental health is important. Wtf. No one but you should confirm your gender. And if you are a certain gender because of trauma then that's completely valid too. Wtf. I feel this deep in my soul
Every time I see a post like this, I’m more and more glad I never relied on my family w/ LGBT+ support. They’ve literally NEVER been ok with it, and I’ve been out for almost 8 years now. They’re part of the reason I tried stuffing it down for nearly all that time. Mom, dad, and sister. I was lucky enough to have very supportive friends. I hope you do/will have some of your own soon! Sending good vibes 💛
I know it sucks to lose your support system, but the greatest support system you have is yourself.  Especially when you're feeling destroyed or alone, please remember you are not alone, however you feel is valid and as long as you love yourself and are kind to others you'll find good supportive people.
I’m sorry to have read about your situation. It’s difficult at times to find a real support person. Someone you can trust and be there for you. Tell your sister there are therapist out there for her too. Anyway love yourself first and stay safe.
I’ve been down this road as well…it’s rough and takes years of doubling down on yourself and setting things up for you to really move past it…

Best of luck (work) with it! In my experience family issues tied with this stuff is more complex and difficult than many other types of social interactions…

My advice is similar to some others…double down on you and find a way to build your life in such a way that props you up and holds you together.
Hey.  She might not understand it, she may even have a harmful view of it right now.  As you said, you both come from a toxic background, so you will both be carrying emotional and behavioral baggage from that.  I know she hurt you, but let go of it and when you have relaxed and healed a little, try calmly explaining to her how you love her, trust her, but because of that something she said hurt you very deeply.  Explain that you are hoping for her to support you without judgment and that you would like her to learn about you as you go through your journey, but that her current perspective is harmful, hurtful and painful to you.

I am sure she loves you as well.  I think this is your strongest approach to heal the divide between you before it grows too much.

Good luck.

My brother is the same way and it’s really a shame cause you get to know your siblings so well and they seem like good people until the ol’ boomer transphobic/homophobic side shows up. It’s the worst. 💕**hugs** 💕
Oof, that's a lot OP. Hugs for you. Your sister's take is nuts.
How would she be the expert if she is had never experienced it, or a part of the community. Same goes for any minority. Definitely uneducated or led down wrong thinking. My older sister is also bi but she’s so cool and accepting,y biggest transition supporter, so I’m sad to hear that :( it may take a lot of time and hard efforts to go through a process together so she can come to terms with not only your identity and thoughts, but of real people who exist that are non-binary. I would feel they are kind of rude no matter who they are if I heard that, I’m not non-binary so who am I to have opinions on whether they exist or are some mythological unicorns?!? But they definitely do.
I mean being trans and getting a therapist to figure things out isn't the worst idea-- but yeah she crazy xD
Oh, I'm so sorry for you, I hope you are getting over it! Much love ❤️ from me 🥰
Plenty of enby people have therapists........ and will always be enby because that's who they are
Coming from a genderfluid individual who hates being in therapy: Therapists are good for your mental health in general, it has nothing to do with “conversion” or whatever tf.

Also, I’m non-binary *and* mentally ill but they necessarily connected. So your entire family is absolutely ridiculous. (My mom is queerphobic, so I get it. It really sucks.)
I’m your sister now not her
""You didn't say they were from the undercity!""

""What difference does that make?""

""??? They're dangerous!""

""*I'm* from the undercity.""
For starters, I'm really sorry to hear about this. I hope things get better in your relationship with your sister, and or I hope you can find a new healthy supporter. 

Otherwise, there's a lot going on here, but the only thing I would like to say is this. I believe all people who are questioning themselves should find a therapist or counselor. But absolutely make sure they're knowledgeable and have dealt with others in the LGBTQ+ community first. You have no idea how greatly it can impact you. You will learn more about yourself, why you feel certain things, etc. 

When I came out to my dad, he politely asked me to seek a therapist or counselor, which I already wanted to do. I haven't talked with her a crazy amount, but the handful of sessions we have had really helped me a lot.
Oml I will be a support system if you need it bro I hate it when that happens and if you’re comfortable you could talk to me (sorry if it seems creepy, I just don’t want anyone to not have someone to support them or someone to listen)
I want to drop-kick her a$$
My dad is like that, super homophobic and, this was when I was still exploring my gender, when I tentatively breached the topic of me being trans he was like ""so you think you're a boy, huh?"" and I pretty much had to abort mission. So I can definitely relate, and I'm sorry your sister is Like That. Sending massive amounts of support your way!!
Absolutely ridiculous that she's bi and doesn't realize how stupid that is. There are still people who say that about anyone in the lgbtq community. Really childish.
>or that they didnt like the gender norms and didnt follow them so they thought that they were enby

😬... Yeah that one hurts because I used to actually think that. Kinda embarrassing, really.

I'm sorry to hear your sister is transphobic op. I hope she grows out of it for your sake.
🫂
TW: Curse words

Please, go to your bitchy sister and tell her that the only person that needs a therapist here is her and that she's cis so she should shut the fuck up, and mind her own fucking business. Tell her that being non-binary is valid and it's not up for debate. She should do a deep dive and think ,,Hmm, I wonder why trans people have mental issues"" and actually do her research and maybe start thinking critically about her actions and mindset.

If you don't feel comfortable confronting her, then that's fine. It's not your job nor responsibility to educate anyone. I'm enby too and my family is pretty fucked up so think I can understand the frustration and sadness that you might feel. I am really sorry that this has happened to you. I hope that your situation will get better soon.

And remember, this community is a safe space and you can tell us about your struggles. We can be an internet support system for you. I hope I helped. Have a nice day <3
Send this to her: https://youtu.be/N89SAwXVK7Y

When she asks if you're nonbinary, ask her if she's an ally. Don't answer her question until she answers yours. She's not entitled to your coming out if she's going to be an asshole about it.
Kiddo, I am your new sibling now. Fuck her, she ain’t worth it.
thank you so much really needed this today haha!
Really?!?!?
I'm sorry, I'm probably misreading your post, but it sounds like if you were 100% sure they were a closeted transman, you're saying you would tell your brother, who is a transphobe, that in fact his wife is a closeted transman?
Have you ever seen signs of him being bi-curious?
yea your right ngl if everyone got a therapist the world whould be a better place haha!
I'm currently going to see someone so I can get a diagnosis for my dysphoria. Like, I've self diagnosed it long ago, but I can't get in to see an Endocrinologist for hrt without the diagnosis and I think it will just be easier going forward if I have it to point to like ""yes I'm trans AND I'm medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria"" in case the US healthcare system tries to fuck me over for medical treatments in the future.
In germany it's mandatory for a trans person to get a therapeutic assessment
yeah i get your point but i tried to explain it i her but she didnt listen and then saidthat people who are genderfluid are just attention seeker's so i stopped trying to explain it to her after that haha
cis ally here, those types of people are making it harder for me to do what I want, which is make people happy

c'mon people, just let trans people live their lives
THATS WHAT IM SAYING LIKE-
its okay , thank you tho! i was really upset about this you (and the people who liked/commented this post) really cheered me up so i thank you fro that haha!
fucking exactly
thank you
thank you
yeah i guess youre right its just funny to me that me at 13 needs to be the mature one in an argument with a 23 y.o. but yea thank you
thanks for the support srs im getting overwhelmed by everyone being so kind to me haha-
ok hello big sis haha!
thats kinda how that went (i mean i didn't tell her that i was non binary cuz she would go nuts but yea)
No dont worry not creepy at all! thank you so much i would appreciate some support haha- so when you have time just dm' me and we could talk if you want to [:
No problem, glad to help
No. Just that he wife is probably a trans man and separately that they hadn’t told him
What I meant: he's openly transphobic but at the same time he's married to a closeted trans person. And no  I won't tell him. I don't want to mess with his life the way he messes with mine. Plus none of this is his wife's fault. I just hope he doesn't make transphobic comments to her as well.
Not really, no tbh
That would be awesome but could you imagine how many people would have to be therapists
pretty sure its the same in the uk, you need to see a therapist in order to get hormones

pretty sure its just so someone doesnt start hormones and then regret it
Not for ""conversion"" right? Because that would be pretty fucked up
Sometimes people don't back down in an argument even if they are losing a lot. But some people think about it afterwards and can change opinion after that and some research. I may be projecting but i used to be a little like that. I was mostly influenced by bigoted people and if your sister is a good person which she probably is, she may be influenced as well. Or not. You surely know better than me. I hope the best!
Honestly, I've found people like this change most readily when they know they are hurting you. I don't mean to say you should come out to her or anything, but she has no reason to consider any other views now because she had learned somewhere that the testimony of enby folks is untrustworthy. Hearing from a trusted source hits very different.

I guess I'm just being hopeful, it seems hard to believe that someone who has been so supportive and is also LGBT won't at least keep an open mind when their reality conflicts with their bigotry.
That sucks, hope you're doing alright though <3
You're absolutely welcome!
Welcome to being gender non-conforming.  We always have to be the adults in the room.
Cool, I’m glad I could help a little
Gotcha! Thanks for clarifying, I appreciate it. Well all the best to them, and you :)
Especially cause most therapists need therapy themselves
yeahhhh that whouldnt work that much whould it? also like what whould the therapists do like therapise themselves or just go to other therapists? its kinda the: great in theory bad in reality (ik thats probably not the saying but i forgot it lmao)
No, definitely not. That would be even more fucked up if you think about that the therapists would have to be in on it, which now that I write this seems kinda obvious
No, but they get to decide whether to give you an indication for HRT or not, which is almost the only way to get hormones in Germany.
i mean i think shes a good person but also there was probably a reason why i always felt uncomfortable around her so i don't really know
ig yea haha
Thank you
A surprising number of people go into psychology to figure out what’s wrong with themselves, so yeah….
They would go to other therapists. Like how physicians should also be seen by other physicians. Everyone needs medical help sometimes, including the doctors themselves
Good, I had figured Germany was pretty accepting but whenever I hear the phrase ""trans people are required too..."" I immediately assume the worst
A thing that is not recommended by specialists as far as I know
AI can bé therapists.
Yeah, same."	sfmurl	trans	860	0.99	2022-01-29 17:23:34
I got a 3-day ban for reporting transphobic comments	"A few days ago, I saw a comment on Reddit that referred to transgender people as “godless degenerates” and I reported it for hate speech. Instead of removing this comment, Reddit gave me a warning for making a “false report”. This warning specifically mentioned that one comment, so there’s no mistaking the reason I got this. I’ve had this account since 2017 and I had never gotten any sort of sanction from Reddit on it. I reached out to Reddit support explaining the situation and asking that the warning be removed from my account, but I never heard back from them. 

A couple of days later, I reported another comment for hate speech, this one literally said “I’m kinda transphobic”. This time I got a three-day ban from Reddit for false report (again citing this specific comment as the reason). I appealed this ban, but my appeal was denied. 

This is not an isolated incident. There was recently a thread on the AgainstHateSubbredits sub where other users also told of how they got warnings or bans from Reddit after reporting hate speech on this platform. (I’m not linking directly to that thread cause I don’t know if it’s against the rules here). However, it seems to be a recent change. In my years using Reddit I have reported many posts and comments that were attacking LGBTQ+ people, and while this content wasn’t always removed by admins, at least I had never been accused of abusing the report button before. It was assumed that reporters were acting in good faith. But not anymore. Reddit now seems willing to shoot the messenger instead of actually dealing with the spread of transphobia in this service. 

So I wanted to let you all know that you can now get banned from Reddit for reporting content that attacks transgender people."	"Your post has been filtered to our queue while we handle brigade issues. If your post has ANYTHING to do with the shooter situation in Tennessee, we ask that you please redirect whatever it is to our [current megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1244szy/on_the_nashville_shooting/).

reddit is rlly transphobic
i got a three day ban too on my old account for reporting hate speech against the LGBT community, especially trans community. it sucks
I got a 3 day ban for “inciting political violence” for saying “politicians have not been tar and feathered in a long time and it shows”  in a thread discussing the ridiculous anti trans laws they keep trying to pass..........Since writing this I got a direct message from some throwaway account saying all kinds of shitty things to me that i am not a woman and I will always be a man in a dress and im an abominiation etc etc etc.....reported it, got word back from reddit that ""they were given a warning"".......real interesting that bigots directly harass you and they only get warnings but if you make an arbitrary comment as a trans person you get a 3 day ban.
If it makes you feel any better, I saw a transphobic post a few days ago so I reported it and the dude got banned and the post was removed
Reddit is run by fascist sympathizers after all. Pretty much all big social media sites are. Fuck the admins.
Reddit hates trans people. Simple as that.
This is outrageous

Its time to start building offline networks

I am trans in TX. my inbox is open to other trans Texans.
I reported comments that advocated for physically harming minors by denying them medical care… 7 day ban… then after it, I got msg saying that the comments were still removed anyway.
I have to be careful then. I reported much smaller stuff. I reported a pic of a trans woman the other day where they found it to be funny to all point out that she had a visible bulge. That was the whole purpose of the “meme”. I’ll keep reporting regardless whenever I feel that this needs to be done.
First, I’m sorry this happened to you OP. I think at one point or another all have been where you are, unless we are leaning with right wing groups, who are allowed to say whatever they want.

Reddit and all existing social media that I have experienced is not safe for most people. It is all a giant circle j*rk. 

Please don’t let this get to you. The world took a wrong turn in Albuquerque about 40 years ago and there is no going back.
Haven’t had a response yet but I reported someone for saying that being trans is a fetish, that we are a fetish, and that we should be removed, basically, and this was sadly from a gay man who believes that we’re behind all these mass shootings going on. Makes me wonder what kind of a response I’ll get, if I get any sort of response or if anything will happen to him.
Well that sucks.
I got the same for reporting a comment that got another redditor banned from the site
Read my profile. Says it all.
Hell, I got permabanned from the literal LGBT subreddit for saying that queer safety is more important than cishet feelings and that cishet men who use polyamory as an excuse to fetishise their queer female partners and any women they hook up with are not real allies and do not belong in queer spaces. I think there's just a reddit wide rule of ""you get banned if you don't think cishet people are superior always and in all regards""
Shoutout to the mods at /r/unitedkingdom for getting my main account a temp ban when I reported transphobic comments on their sub.
I reported a guy for using the T slur a week ago and his account got suspended
Meanwhile, I once got a 3 day ban for commenting the the navy seals copypasta. Thanks reddit.
Same thing happened to me about a month ago.

I used to be a very heavy Reddit user and now I rarely come on the site, and stopped making any purchases of coins.
I got a 7 day one for saying our ( l ea. der )
Was unfit to work.

Heres to hoping I don't get another one.....

It's the algorithm
Same
This is really weird; every time I’ve reported something transphobic, it’s been taken down - but then again, I’ve reported it as misinformation rather than hate speech, so idk if that makes a difference
How does it work? 

Is it reddit itself doing the banning or particular mods for each subreddit?

Either way, this is so shitty.
That sucks and is very unfair. If this becomes a trend, I’ll leave REDDIT in a hot minute.
That's infuriating. I got permanently suspended from Twitter for the same thing only to be reinstated 8 months later. I deleted the app because I never heard shit about my appeal. The internet is so transphobic, fucking people have declared war on us.
Soo at some point in recent history I infiltrated a facebook group that disseminated and bombed all types of ""woke"" content, but mostly trans focused. I reported internally shared memes ranging from trans suicide to outright nazi gas chambers(big surprise they are the same people) Every single meme was O.K'd. 

Honestly its epidemic, across platforms.
I’ve had similar problems with tik tok. There was people saying transphobic shit and all atheists are schizophrenic and people being nude or doing obvious sexual stuff on lives and tik tok doesn’t do anything
Mods on Reddit are nobodies on a power trip
I got permanently banned for the same thing but my appeal was granted.
I still get the ""We think you're suicidal"" automated messages every time I rip into a transphobe on here. It's ridiculous and actually kinda harmful because I'm recovering from being suicidal, and having it shoved in my face constantly isn't helping. I'm less suicidal now that I'm out. My being trans wasn't the reason, reddit stop trying to claim that it was.
You are doing great work! Please take care of yourself as well.
I saved this post 3 days ago while I was also banned for the same thing. Took a trip through everybody’s favorite conservative hellhole (stupid of me, I know) and of course saw a slew of reportable comments, most of which I later received notifications that they’d been acted upon and resulted in people being temp or perma banned. 

I thought everything was going swimmingly until a week ago when I got a notification that one of my reports resulted in one commenter being permanently banned, then 3 hours later, I got a 7 day ban for “report abuse” linking the *exact same comment* that they earlier told me they had reviewed, deemed hate speech, and perma banned the commenter.

My question is how the fuck is it considered report abuse if the comments I’m reporting are actually reportable and are resulting in action? How am I abusing the system if the comments are being reviewed and deemed a valid-report?

I literally got banned for 7 days for reporting a comment that was deemed hate speech, deleted, and the commenter permanently banned?

That’s like calling the cops for a legitimate reason, them coming out, arresting the threat, and then also arresting me too for calling them. Like, what sense does that make?

Reddit claims that it’s abuse to be reporting hella comments, but when the comments are actually indeed reportable, what the fuck are you supposed to do? Report one and ignore the rest? Fuck that. That subreddit is a verifiable hate-sub at this point and needs to be removed from Reddit. Maybe instead of punishing the people reporting comments that are blatant hate speech, Reddit needs to crack down on the subreddits allowing these kinds of hate speech to flourish on their platform.
Be careful love. Don’t ever expect the best out of people. As a Christian LGBTQ Transgender woman, I know God loves me. I’m
Meanwhile I got 3 day ban for self identifying as a tranny

I’m trans, let me reclaim words jfc

Reddit is transphobic as an institution.

I'm sure when they call us godless degenerates, they're just calling us that because we don't worship *them* cuz redditers
Oof. ”We are under attack!”
Call their toll free customer support line for help. Hahahahaha oh yeah I forgot the Internet is garbage.
Well I am in fact a godless degenerate, so technically that's not wrong, but it's not very nice.
Everywhere is really transphobic
Username checks out.
It seems our intolerance of intolerance shall not be tolerated...

That's not supposed to be a joke but honestly, this policy is a joke.
conservative politicians should be treated like trans people are treated right now ;)
We need heroes like you
Its funny, my dad makes the same argument but in the opposite side of it
I got perma banned for saying something similar on r/politics
It's really a coin flip wether you get good moderation or not when reporting. Almost all social media moderation is outsourced to 3rd parties around the world. So you could get a chill dude in SF in an office with strickter rules on moderation, or a overworked and underpaid dude in Bangladesh in an office that just churns through reports.       
          
(For claritys sake, moderation anywhere is a hellhole when it comes to rules. I use SF as an example of a ""good"" environment because of better labour rights)
Thank you for your service! It feels good when that happens doesn’t it hahaha
You should see Twitter
Im a trans tech head... very much considering making a trans focused forum.  After all, what is reddit but a fancy (un)controlled forum...

EDIT: I'm gonna set something up in the next day or so.  I've reached out to the moderators to see if any collaboration could exist, but even if it remains completely disconnected, I'm gonna set it up.
Wow, that's so messed up. I'm really sorry you got banned. 😔 I'm glad the comment was removed. I've been reporting stuff myself. I. Worried I'll get a ban too but honestly it's worth if I can try to reduce the hate.
I think I know the exact picture you're talking about, also reported that.
Thank you for your kind words :)
That really makes zero sense from Reddit.
My experience with reporting transphobic content here is extremely inconsistent. I often report the exact same phrase or meme at different occasions (because transphobes often just repeat the same stuff over and over), and sometimes it gets taken down as hate speech but other times it is ruled to not be against Reddit rules. I guess it just depends on what admin gets your report.
As I understand it, bans from specific subs are handled by the mods of that sub, who are unpaid volunteers, while site-wide bans (like mine) are handled by admins who are Reddit employees/contractors.
I got that suicide message for this post too. Hope you’re doing better now!
Happy cake day :)
Wow that really makes no sense. I wonder if this is some kind of bug on their system or if somone inside is acting in bad faith.
Thank you :)
That's such a terrible word, please don't try to reclaim it.
PLEASE explain to me how calling trans people ""godless degenerates"" isn't hate speech? are you out of your mind?
“Remember the human. Reddit is a place for **creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people.** Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.”  SO.. what about calling an entire group of people “godless degenerates” doesn’t fit there? (Quote copy and pasted literally [from their website](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy))
I agree that familiarity with Reddit’s definition of hate speech, and any other reporting options, is a good idea.  Using a variety of reasons for reports probably looks better in the long run, as long as the reasons appear to fit.  It’s best to report based on their definitions and use whatever is most accurate.
Here's the thing you can say almost whatever you want as long as it's true. But when they turn their blind eye to out right lies about any LGBT and turn around and ban us instead...
To steer way from being too doomer, at least in the US, the majority of people in nearly every metric support trans people across most of the currently debated subjects (including a weird number of republicans). 

Then again I suppose you could still consider 3-4 in 10 people hating you to be pretty transphobic. But the the good news is, they’re outnumbered.
That’s a good one. I’ve been using “I want for <insert transphobic political commentator of the week> what they want for us :)”. They literally cannot ban you for that without admitting that transphobic political commentator wants to do things that would violate IRL TOS.
It really does indeed  !
Agree. But I don’t venture out there. At least here there’s some respite.
pets and tech side of twitter is okay imo
Oh wow... I cant believe no one has tried to do this before... Maybe before we didnt feel a need to bc so much of the movement has been building on these platforms. But something that is just ours? Like ao3 for trans stuff?!?!?
Do it. If literal “not sees” can make their own forums to threaten us, we should be able to organize our own to defend ourselves.
That would be awesome!
Yeah I guess so :/ at least that means there are some good admins ig?
I don’t claim to fully understand how Reddit’s report system works, but I *think* the way it works is that all my reports initially get sent to the mods of that subreddit and since they saw so many reports from me, regardless of the validity of said reports, them being members of the conservative subreddit, they wanted to stick it to me and they reported me for “report abuse”

So basically, it’s probably mods from that subreddit acting in bad faith because they’re upset I’m reporting conservative comments that they probably agree with themselves.

Again, I don’t know for sure that that’s how the report system works. It’s just my best guess.
No?

I am and do reclaim it. There’s no reason not to. It’s literally a shortening of transgender, don’t let transphobes dictate your feelings.

In real life I found reclaiming it made me more resistant to people yelling it at me in the street. Same with the word faggot. I’m a tranny faggot and will not let you or anyone else dictate how I identify myself or the words I use about myself.

This is similar to people getting irritated about it/it’s pronouns

Not to mention the ubiquity of tranny in car mechanics as referencing transmission. There’s nothing in the word tranny itself that is degrading or negative, only transphobes use of it. I refuse to let them win on this front. I’m queer. I’m a faggot. I’m a punk. I’m a tranny.

Edit: reminds me of teens on tiktok getting mad at people using the word homosexual

Those who threaten us aren't those who hate us, but those who'll do nothing to help us because they don't care enough. A person can be the nicest to you personally, respect your pronouns and see you as your gender, but if they vote for people who pass transphobic policies, even if only only due to other issues, their ""support"" is ultimately meaningless
Still alot of people tho, and those are the ones who usually have guns
I love pets and tech, but even-though I'm not trans, transphobia was getting to me quite a lot there.
Sadly it would get legislated out of existence fast and not reach where it needs to. That's why other mutual aid organisations are important.
I don’t think it’s a good idea. Being queer is used because people started to be prouder and prouder within the community and truly reclaimed the word. 

But we are too deep into fascism and LGBTQphobia to use the f-word or the t-word. Only transphobes use it, you said it yourself. That’s why it’s an insult. That’s why they need to stop saying it, and we can start reclaiming it slowly. 

It’s like the n-word. We don’t say that word anymore. At least normal people don’t, if they’re not a black person. Because it’s stupid, hateful and full of history. They are slowly reclaiming it by healing from the bad it has made to them in society. 

We, at another level obviously since those are two different types of word meaning and hate, are not in that process yet. 

If we start to use it too soon, the transphobes will keep on doing so, because some of us do too. And they will even have an excuse. 

Please, I know those words are hateful, but now isn’t the time to reclaim them. Taking our time is the best medicine in this situation.
But I feel like the difference of definition you’re pointing out would be something that explains Reddit simply doing nothing. For Reddit to instead take administrative action against OP seems far more sinister in my mind. Which feels like OP’s point.
Debate bro-ing hate speech. Letting the fascists dictate us now?
No shit it isn’t the only thing, but you didn’t specify.
I’ve met plenty of people who are polite to my face but who eventually at some point start telling me about their concerns about how kids are being forced into having surgeries (this is a lie, no child anywhere is being forced to have trans surgeries, and the vast majority of surgeries are completely unavailable to people under the age of 18 to begin with)
Fair. That’s why we need to have guns and be armed to the teeth (if it can be done responsibly on an individual basis). I literally have a stockpile to handout to queer friends if shit hits the fan.

We should be prepared to defend ourselves from harm. To quote Doom (2016):

*They are rage, brutal, without mercy… but you… you will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done.*
Hmm? how so?

EDIT: also, not sure how a forum is a ""mutual aid organization""....

Unfathomably Based 👍
True can repate
If we're to learn anything from the case of Mermaids, or how anti-lgbt generic nonprofits operating within the system are, it is simply safer to stay under the radar. Sadly it means only helping adults often. 

A forum doesn't need to be, but a separate platform will simply be raided and taken down by transphobes, sued to hell from every angle by people who have the money. 

Discord has been the best platform so far.
I interpreted OPs point as “even if this isn’t hate speech, it’s close enough that it warrants investigating. If you aren’t going to delete the comment or take down the post, fine. But to instead say that I’m abusing the report tool to the point of needing a ban is extreme and concerning” 

And, yeah, there’s always the chance that OP is misrepresenting the facts or is omitting relevant information. But I still would agree with the general sentiment. In my mind, someone being overzealous with the report tool might warrant a warning for creating an administrative burden. But not a ban. I think bans should be saved for those who are doing the “Reddit cares” bot abuse kind of thing. Where it is blatantly obvious that nothing hate speech adjacent is happening and that the individual is just being targeted because of the views they are expressing.
um... so as a sysadmin who's dealt with hostile actors, there are plenty of was of stopping attacks.  Like, you realize the ""raiding"" issue is something forums have dealt with long before reddit came around, right?  Reddit is public first, but most servers are private first.  Raiding can be shut down with a single switch, without compromising existing users.  Raids dont work if you cant make an account.

I reallly get the impression you don't know what a forum actually is, since all these concerns apply to public platforms, not private ones.

EDIT: I also get the impression there's some doomsaying here.  I'm talking about setting up some resiliency for *if* Reddit stops being a safe platform all together.  Discord is *not* the same a Reddit, and doesn't serve the same purpose.  Given Reddit is just a set of public forums, a forum is a perfect replacement should something happen.  If the concern is ""what if they sue you"", well then I'll deal with that when it comes.  Simply throwing our arms up and giving up is the worst possible option.  My hope is Reddit leans to being trans positive, but public companies are... well companies.  Trust isn't exactly something you can build with something that isn't a person, and the people of Reddit come and go.  A backup plan is a good idea, no matter how you slice it.

I think you're a bit too combative, and I am sorry if it came out as doomerism, I don't mean that. 

While I don't know anything about dys admin stuff, I'm from the compliance and kyc side, and I've been seeing it more from the side of verification - how do you make absolutely sure that someone signing up is not a TERF looking to sabotage an already vulnerable community, while making sure to not store and collect said community's extremely personal data that could be used against them easily?

What is the method of exclusion, if anyone can learn some basic talking points and pose as anyone, assuming it would be anonymous? If not anonymous, if you don't have a massive budget, how do you safeguard the data and make sure everyone you employ has no ulterior motives. 

End of the day, you can't see into people's heads, and this is why verification based on views and social groups is very, very difficult. 

How do you make a forum that offers any actual value beyond just what we already have on other platforms  (things that can be used against the community, discussions of DIY hrt for example, safety of it, discussion of treatment options, photos if someone's posting, making sure they don't get leaked and used by terfs again, surgery reviews, etc) while remaining compliant on both the privacy side and legalities side? What do you do in case of baseless accusations, if you can't reveal the conversations that go on because it would be dangerous, but need to defend the entire thing from getting shut down?

We've been dealing with putting up a discord for grassroots help for other trans people and that's where the mutual-aid idea came from. It is far from doomerism and those are all questions to be answered, not points against it. But it's very, very difficult to make sure no bad actors get in. 

As for shutting down a raid, there was a recent data leak in a server I know of - a very harshly and keenly guarded one, i mean really, it's almost invite only with additional checks in place - and the intruder still managed to get user data out. They can screenshot, they can download, they can write your username or whatever else they can get down on a napkin - it doesn't matter, it's never 100%. It's far more complicated than ""you can just shut it down"", as it's more so about keeping the place sterile from the get go.
search for ""ICANN disputes FDA’s assertions about Whois"" to see article how subpoenas are about to be levied at whim by government agencies. now take into consideration what Florida implementing with ""from ANY state""... and it's a stretch but you see how one can not simply spin up an EC2 and register a Route 53 with Cloudflare to protect site owner's info from attack.

it's not just about defending the site from denial of service or cost prohibitive wasted heroku compute cycles from nefarious actors... it's about the lack of anonymity and real life violence threat to the individuals who participate in hosting, developing, and moderating/running.
Reddit admins for the most part don’t care
Ok, I'm kinda done arguing this point, given it's the same thing over and over.  I'm offering an alternative, one that I will be glad to take the hosting role of, one where if some government does decide to go after it, they come to me \*first\*.  I've spent 23 years in the industry, I'm well aware that as a host, I'm 100% on the hook should they start advancing.  I'm willing to take that bullet.  I can't offer much else, but as a tech head, I can offer alternatives.  Places for when the major sites decide we are a threat.  You don't have to come, and while I've reached out to the mods, I have no expectance of it being an ""r/trans"" official thing or anything.  


Oh, and your Whois concern?  yeah, whois was \*never\* private.  Domain Guard is for spam, not privacy. always has been.  Site owners have to do a lot of illegal stuff to hide when they use the DNS system.  By the time they come for the little server I run, it will be the least of my concern.
genuinely confused by the angry hostility over my suggestion... seems to be related to this ""arguing"" ... ""over and over"" part.

this is first I've seen such proposition - didn't realize it was some sort of never ending debate somewhere out there in Reddit land.

if you're willing to do it and the risks then by all means that's good for everyone!

I was only commenting caution because my own hopes and dreams have been smashed to smithereens for the very reasons I listed above (which, as news to me, aren't as profound and unique to my own experience as I previously believed if this is an ""over and over"" argument)
Sorry... This has just already been a stressful thread that spent a \*lot\* of time saying things that very much read as attempts to prevent this all from happening at all.  Feels like despite clearly stating my intention and providing a background, I was still being shoved aside and acted like I was a child who needed to be taken away from the grownups conversation.  As someone who was summarily removed from IT for the reason of ""being a woman"", it just felt very dismissive.
thank you for sharing. I see how our messages could be taken that way, looking back over it now that you mentioned it.

Having been told ""anecdotal evidence isn't evidence and doesn't count"" so many times is probably why I have the bad habit of stating things in a matter-of-fact way.

Maybe I should have led with my personal story / situation instead of trying to frame it as a ""generic"" warning - just laziness on my part, for that I apologize.

Finally, there's something to be said about the addicting power begging for commiseration - I'm so upset at the lack of control and state of the world when it comes to mesh networks not taking off, monopolistic power held by ISPs registrars etc. and overarching power of DMCA and other silly laws wielded like a priest of Helm over Neverwinter....

my anger in it all fuels bias making me completely certain there's no hope for anything good and ""where I've tried and failed others surely will too""... which I acknowledge is incorrect of course and I can't wait to be proven wrong if it means something good and great comes out of it all... but I _will_ be a bit jealous is all."	12i35ed	trans	829	0.97	2023-04-11 01:04:56
"Tonight I explained to my 11 year old sister the term ""Transgender"" and asked her a few questions, showed her some beauties on here, and finally told her that I was trans. She didn't have a single problem in understanding or in acceptance. Transphobes, you move."	"She was a gem. We spoke about what she understood about the term ""Transgender"". I showed her some really cute trans babes and asked her to tell me if she thought they were pretty, which she universally did, and then I asked her if she thought that although they were born as boys, if she thought they were now girls. She had no problem. ""it doesn't matter how they were born, they are girls to me"".

Then I told her that I was like those girls, I was trans. She said initially ""ahh, I really like you as my brother, but boys suck so okay"". Which, is acceptance to me. We spoke about bathrooms and if she would feel comfortable if any of the girls I showed her were in the same public bathroom and she said ""of course, they have to pee"".

Finally, I showed her a photo of me in makeup and she was like ""she's pretty"". I then revealed that was me and she was really suprised and told me I was sooo pretty. I couldn't be more proud of my little princess. I wish someone had this conversation with me at her age. I think it's an absolutely vital conversation to have with little children, when you deem them ready to understand.

Love you sooo much, my lil princess warrior 💖"	"I'm not crying, you're crying
Humans aren't made to hate, they're raised to, the earlier kids learn about different types of people, the better they are at understanding and excepting, she's lucky to have a sister like you!
Imagining an 11 year old saying, “she’s pretty” and getting shocked Pikachu face when she finds out it’s her older sister is melting my flippin heart ❤️
[deleted]
When we talked to our 11 year old. Her biggest concern was that mama was happy. And could she go shopping. Kids are great.
Absolutely beautiful to hear this love. Thank you so much for sharing. It brought a tear to my eye, and a smile to my face. All the best for you and your sister!
You’re lucky to have such an amazing family! My heart swelled with joy reading your story. Thanks so much for sharing!
My little sister is mad accepting of me being trans. She doesn’t fully get it but she’s interested by it. If someone says something bad about trans people she’ll call them out on it and tell them the right way of saying it. I got a dog a while back and called her Bailey, my sister said Bailey is a boys name, I said it’s a unisex name, she wanted to call her “princess” but I (a pre-T trans man) am not going to start shouting princess down the street, her response: 
“We’ve already got one unisex person in the house we don’t need another one!” 
She’s 11 now and honestly I cried of laughter.
I had the same kind of talk with my 10 year old brother. I didn’t tell him I’m a trans guy yet, just that I’m gay but he took it so well. Plus he told me he wanted to try nail polish. Kids are really too good for this world.
This is the wholesome content we need <3
When I came out to my now brother, he was super accepting. Turns out, he's also trans so now my mum has a full family of boys ahahha
No no. I'm just chopping onions. Nothing to see here.
Oh my gosh that is wonderful... I swear I'm not crying...
Gives me so much hope about talking to my kiddos. My wife is like, “tell them when you are ready” and I’ve just been waiting. They aren’t stupid. They see me come home from work and change into my ‘comfortable clothes’ which are usually leggings, bra, and top. One asked why I was wearing panties, and I said “because I like them best”. I should tell them and record their responses. 😂 ❤️
Beautiful
this is so wholesome i– 🥺💕
I told my 6 year old brother what transgender meant and he said “I think I’m transgender because part of mom and part of dad made me” and me and my mom were just sitting there like “how did we mess up so bad but also not?”
>""of course, they have to pee"".

Awww. from the mouths of babes....
I mean, I'm trans but you can tell an 11 year old just about anything and they'll roll with it.
I'm so glad it went well! Also this made me cry. Which I'm OK with.
My daughter was 7 when I came out and she had 0 issue with it at all. She understood what was happening and had completely and totally accepted me. She has misgendered me less than I’ve misgendered myself. And when anyone does misgender me, she is the first one to jump to my defense. 

We have grown so much closer. She is a girly girl, and I trend that way too. My wife on the other hand is a Tom boy. So my daughter and I get to bond over all the girly things my wife isn’t into.  I’m so proud of how accepting she has been. And she is so proud of me too. She isn’t ashamed at all. She will just randomly tell her friends I’m trans unprompted and has all the girls in her day care asking my wife about me (wifey works at the day care).
This is so endearing, kids are the best allies sometimes. It reminds me of another post a while back where a mom explained to her daughter about gay couples. The kid’s first reaction was, “No, it’s weird!” 

Five minutes of further explanation later, the kid was already planning out her entire wedding with her future bride.
So wholesome
so cute.
Did you see a therapist or just figured out that you're trans?
Understanding always helps. We hate and attack things we don't understand but the more we learn the more accept.
Kids are wildly accepting
See this is what everyone should be like! I have three daughters, two cis and one trans. We all except and treat each other with love and understanding so why can't everyone else!  

Beautiful story sweetheart!
I wanted to cry a little, stupid tear ducts not working.
Agreed. Phobias are either created in genetics or in training. Genetic phobias are related to life-threatening issues such as things which cause pain or distress. One of those phobias is fear of the unknown. In this context, other phobias are taught by not teaching at all. Humans are afraid of and hate the things they don't understand or cannot naturally recognize and will perceive those things as threats, even if it's entirely irrational. 

But we are a new generation. We have the chance to teach future generations how to accept, not hate. We are pioneers to this idea and practice.
Preach.
It was even cuter than you could ever imagine. There was this momentary look of just like ""Damn, that's my sister. I like this. This is cool"" and then it was gone.
I knowwwww!!! I lost it at that 😭
Someone in another post put it really well. For the parents, it's a social standing sorta thing. And, having a trans kid reflects negatively on that social standing. It's just a shame where their priorities fall.
Kids are little bundles of innocent, wrapped neatly in a small package of cute...well, most of them.
You're welcome. It was too wholesome not to share. This little girl is my world, and her acceptance, although fully expected all along, gives me more strength than she could ever know.
You're more than welcome.
Having a dog called ""Princess"", just makes you even more manly, didn't you know.
I don't personally use nail polish, but I can see the allure for a small child.
This is the wholesome content you deserve, and you are welcome x
I would guess that you coming out helped him gain the courage to come out. You're a role-model, use your new found power responsibly.
The ol' chopping of the onions. It's a classic tale, as old as time.
I believe you. ""Press X to doubt""
Now, that is the wholesome content we all need in our lives.
I know right.
you are wholesome. I guess wholesome attracts wholesome?
Enby in the making?
She's a beauty.
They're so accepting.
A flood of tears, created it has.
This is soo cute. Sending love to you and yours x
All they require is a little explanation and they understand.
Good question
For the last 9ish years, I developed a lot of self-hate. About 4-5 years ago, I started getting this radical idea that I wished I was born a girl. I had no idea what the concept of trans was at the time, and that thought of wanting to be a girl was, to me, a very dirty secret that I planned to take to my grave. A year after I met my girlfriend, so early 2019, I told my girlfriend my ""dirty"" little secret and she just laughed and told me that many people thought this way. This immediate and absolute acceptance lead me on a journey of exploring both this idea and what was causing this internal pain I had had for all of my teenage years and into early adulthood. Which in turn, lead me to the concept of transgender and my eventual realisation that I was in fact trans. The pain I was feeling was gender dysphoria. I then inevitably went back through my memories and started linking pieces together and I became certain that I was trans. I have spoken to a GP about my gender after this and they referred me specialist gender clinic but, as any of my UK redditors will tell you, there is a 2 year waiting list. I am about one year out for my appointment with a therapist.

Hope that answers your question x
Absolutely.
Kids are just wild.
I totally agree. Thank you for your comment.
Wait what's this liquid pouring out of my eyes? Am I okay? Wait.... I've heard of this before it's called.... A cry? Crying that's it! Oh god.... I'm crying! Wait how do I stop it? Do I just plug my eyes? I gosh now I have an urge to hug someone! 🤗❤️
I absolutely agree, well written.
True some are...interesting. Lol
i guess so☺️
Thank you!  Love to you and yours as well!
Great question.

Partner is TOO supportive	"I’m 35 mtf, pre HRT (but my appointment is this week, so excited!)

I love my wife, and she is completely on board with my transition. The problem is, as soon as we talked and I explained everything (from my past, feelings etc) she decided I was a woman. No this isn’t bad at home, we have a great life. But I have yet to socially transition.

I absolutely encouraged her to talk to her therapist about everything. I would never take that away, that is her safe space to explore her feelings. Likewise, she asked if I would mind her talking to one of her friends IRL. I was totally okay with it and gave her my absolute blessing (I rarely see this friend anyway).

But when we go shopping she has no filter. I’ll be discreetly trying to shop and she’ll just hold something up to me and go “oh my god you have to get that, it’ll look SOO good on you!”

I had a talk with her about it and she felt really bad. Then I felt bad for making her feel bad.

But today, I went to get a full body wax (ouch, but totally worth it, I am sooooooo smooth). And I find out she told the woman who did her eyebrows about me!! Again, I got really angry and explained that it was NOT her information to share. I mean yes, I told my waxer, but that’s my choice. I was essentially outed by her without my permission. 

Now she feels bad again, and I feel bad for making her feel bad. She’s so happy for me, but I’m just not there yet. Does anyone else have this problem? I really don’t know what to do besides keep reigning her in when she gets too excited.

EDIT: I want to thank you all for your heartfelt advice. Having this community to come to makes everything just a little bit easier.

To clarify, my wife has never intentionally made me feel bad. But after 15 years of being married to my best friend, if I ever make her feel bad, I’m going to feel bad. It’s just the way our relationship works. We cry together and get through it…together.

For those who have had the opposite reaction from a spouse, you have my abject sympathy. To be forced to choose between the person you love and your happiness is heartbreaking and you will always have my support.

And about the situation at hand; we had a long talk, very open and honest. She needs to be able to share her joy so I’ve given the go ahead to talk to a few more people she knows well. I’ve also put her on Reddit to join some spouse of trans people subs so she can get extra support from people in her situation.

Again, thank you all so much. I never expected this outpouring of love and support. It just goes to prove that the family we choose is as good or sometimes better than the one we’re given 💖🏳️‍⚧️💖🏳️‍⚧️💖"	"While her behavior is …very sweet(?), I feel like you’re gonna have to continually remind her until it stops. Or have a very serious sit down and express how bad it makes you feel and all of that, because sometimes people take things less seriously if not actually sat down with and made aware that you’re very dead serious.
Don’t feel bad about setting boundaries 🤗
No one should out us without talking to us first.  

That being said, my wife did similar things.  I told her that I forgave her because I will always forgive her.  She did it once or twice more before starting to ask first.  At this point pretty much everyone knows so it’s a non-issue now.

Anyway, in my experience it comes from a place of love and they are trying to be accepting and supportive.  Clearly your wife is bi and wants to stay with you so it’s great that she is supportive.  Honestly though, just forgive her and move on.  Don’t let it bother you long term or get on your nerves.  The coming out process sucks but it’s short compared to the rest of our lives and you have a great life head of you with your wife.
Tell her keeping this secrete is about security.

That will maybe change her view on this 

If she outs you to the wrong person shit can get dangerous
I understand how it is making you uncomfortable and I dont mean to invalidate that, but I kinda wish someone was that excited about my transition. I dont think shes being malicious, I think shes just really excited. Just communicate with her, and make sure she knows how much you appreciate her support.
So I think she is very sweet and excited. But she also needs to understand that outing you to everyone is going to hurt you.
I'm sorry but am I the only one who got a liiiittle giggle from this? 🙂
Maybe approach it as ""It's my transition, let me come out at my speed."" Or to put a slightly more upbeat amused spin on it: ""I'm the one who gets to tell people!""

Depending on your area, you could say it's potentially dangerous for you not knowing who knows but that is likely to make her feel worse.
100%.
My wife is the one that kind of told everyone in our lives. She even told my parents, my siblings, my extended family, her family, our friends, her co-workers.
She did not take the news very well at first and in a way I think she might have been reaching out to her friends and family for support but who knows

I can be mad at her or I can be happy.
I choose to be happy and view it as one less thing I need to do and this was all pre HRT and before growing my hair out sooo that was fun. 

It got the ball rolling much faster and even though she did struggle at first me and her could never be better 😊
It has to be on your timeline, not hers.

I have no doubt she's an absolute sweetheart. This is a huge life change for both of you, and it's going to take a lot of long conversations for both of you to understand this new territory! When I first started evolving into my own, I would often feel ""mad"", but later realized I was actually just feeling very vulnerable.
I would remind her how dangerous it is to out people without their consent, and she can literally be putting you in danger by telling strangers your business. I’m glad she so supportive, but if she wants to be an ally to the trans community, she needs to do better to understand the danger that comes along with it as well
You are so totally blessed. I wish my wife and daughter could have half of her acceptance. If I were in a position to transition, I wouldn’t care if she was so open. Instead, I have a wife and daughter who know my desires and want nothing to do with me in that respect. Try to enjoy your blessings.
You don't need to feel bad for setting boundaries. In fact, if you feel bad for setting boundaries, that's a red flag for toxic relationship and you should think about why.

It is your decision alone when and with whom you share your trans-ness. If you are still passing as your assigned gender, then people who know and you being trans need to switch pronouns/name/anything else depending on context. If you're passing as your actual gender, then they need to be silent about you being trans. You have shared something that makes you vulnerable, and the people you trusted should respect it. 

Like, you shared a secret with your wife, and she just tells everyone? Wtf? Even if she thinks everyone will be okay (sometimes cis people are naive), she still shouldn't share it.

When I came out, my trans then-gf was really excited about the fact that she was now with another trans woman - and shared this with everyone before I even talked to any friends about it, without me knowing about her sharing, and with me having explicitly told her that I don't want to come out (yet). She even told her transphobic parents. I was... Not amused. She somehow made it completely about herself. SHE was now in a t4t relationship. SHE was now in a wlw relationship. SHE was soooo supportive by outing me and getting to talk to other people about me being trans. It was such an exciting time for HER! Ugh. Actually, that was a point where I realised how self-centered she actually was.

I hope your marriage will survive this, and I hope she's not as bad as my ex. But what you described reminds me of my ex, abs I wanted to share.
I tried to come out once (as ftm, though now I'd say I'm NB) and the way people reacted made me so uncomfortable that I actually gave up. Either they tried to be super supportive and immediately told people without asking me, or they cried to me about how it would affect them. When I stopped talking about it, everyone acted as if it never happened. And these were all people who are in general supportive of trans folks. It was such a weird experience.

I know other people experience much worse and prioritize living out of the closet and transitioning over everything else, but I couldn't handle it.
She's got the right spirit she just needs to slow down to your pace. You need to remind her that this is your journey, and it can put you in danger. I can tell she loves you a lot, and I hope you can improve this situation in the long run. But knowing you have her support makes it all the better, once she's settled down per say, I know it will be smooth sailing for everything in your control.
My partner constantly does the same thing, about all aspects of my sexuality and gender. She broadcasts personal details to friends, family, co-workers, and strangers.
I suppose the real issue, for me, is that I constantly feel like the butt of a joke she is telling. Then I argue (within myself) that if I was comfortable with who I want to be/(am?) Then I wouldn't feel discomfort about being put on display.

The honest truth is that we (by we I mean whatever the fuck it is me/myself/I Am) have always felt laughed at. We've always felt like a joke, and we've always attempted to stay in the shadows.

Being thrust out into the open by our partner feels like a betrayal, and we (me/myself/I/The Borg) can't tell the difference between betrayal and Love.)
If I may, my wife is more mildly the same way, she came to accept that I can transition within a few weeks of me even mentioning it might be a desire. I have yet to fully decide but when we go shopping for anything feminine she will just walk right up and put it against me to see how it will look. 

However, it’s a huge blessing in disguise because I’ve been in a depression for 9 months and her consistently being happy for me has slowly improved my self esteem…I would be much better off the other way around.

In fact at the suggestion of my therapist I tried socially transitioning in some ways for the weekend. We dressed up in all fem clothing, put on make up, she made me shave my beard and straightened my hair and then told the ladys at VS and other store we were there to buy for me…I ended up loving the relief from it. Never would have done it without her.

34 mtf in progress, lol. Hope you have a good one and you two will surely find the right boundaries and support for each other!
She loves you; she’s excited about your transition.  Give the woman a chance to get used to the new you
i think you should maybe let go a little bit. she’s so excited for you and needs to talk about it with people, so she’s doing it with randos, and those two specific people she asked for permission. i dunno. the worst thing would be for you to stamp out her excitement for you and make it an awkward or negative topic for both of you. i think you can gently let her know how it makes you feel when she outs you like that though
I totally understand where you’re coming from! That being said, I do think that you need to understand that her feelings are also valid and her trying to be supportive in any way she can is her way of showing her love for you. I understand that you’re not at the level of excitement that she is yet, but you should appreciate that she’s there for you and is trying to support you regardless of circumstances.
My mum does this, shes really nice and supportive she does thus too, im sorry i dont really have any advice for you
She confused but she got the spirit
[deleted]
Your either in or out buttercup, be mindful of those who do this all alone
This isn’t being supportive, this is putting you in danger and crossing your boundaries. she needs to realise how much she puts you at risk doing that, it’s rly not okay. Part why I’m t4t, cis ppl don’t care about how we could get beat up or killed,  they think it’s fun and only want to brag and to feel “woke”
My fiancé would do the same thing. She never noticed but I would get “looks”. I have fully transitioned now so it’s no longer an issue but she never toned it down. Probably something I should have said but never did
I'm in the same boat sorta, but I just started social transition. Feels odd having a partner that is seemingly unbothered by my transition. I feel like it should at least cause a *little* discomfort or something, it is a big change after all. I guess that is my my own problem. and this intense optimism is maybe my partner's way of processing the transition and all.
You definitely need to sit down with her and set some firm boundaries.
I’d just tell her that it’s fine but just ask her to check in with you before telling anybody
boundaries are important, however, i think your wife is truly just trying her best to make you feel comfortable. i don’t believe she has any bad intentions
I was this partner to my ex who is a trans woman. Her transition and journey felt so important to me and it was always so exciting to see her become happier and explore who she was. Something we failed to realize until it was too late for the relationship is that, while her transition does mean that our relationship is changing and growing and that part requires a group effort and support, it is also HER transition, and there are important parts of that process that need to be just for her. 

This was so important to understand, but neither of us realized it and she never had the words to express to me her need to go through parts of this with support that still allows her to experience parts of her life as an individual, not as part of a relationship. Because when we transition, we're learning so much new stuff about ourselves, and applying that to a relationship can be a tricky line that can eclipse the important parts of figuring out who we are transitioning into. 

Turns out, the reason I was so obsessed with her transition is because I'm actually trans myself and I figured this out shortly after things ended. I don't want to scare you with the talk of exes, our situation has some similarities but the differences are pretty intense too, so please don't let my outcome worry you! It sounds like you're able to have decent conversations with your partner, and I'd just keep encouraging you to keep talking. It's probably difficult to understand and may be hurtful to hear, but it's important for her to understand that your transition involves important private experiences that she wont be a part of or should not be sharing with others. Best of luck, friend, and if you ever want to chat about the parallels we may have experienced, my DMs and replies are always open!
Well this is the other extreme to the partner freaking out and leaving you. Realize she has issues also and this is a growing and learning process for the both of you actually between this and her freaking out and leaving you and running her mouth wherever she thinks would do the most damage this is far more workable. At least she doesn't intend to harm you.
It sounds like she might need a relationship therapist or coach who can look at things from her perspective. I’m sensing there’s more about her feelings that she needs help unpacking.
Wow ...I didnt realize there was an opposite end of the spectrum here 😳. Not to make this about me, promise! Just thought Id share the other end, please tell me if you dont appreciate it and I'll delete. My partner is pansexual and doesnt treat her partners any differently regardless of sex, gender, orisntation, race, or anything. So ... I want to be treated more like a woman, and have her encouragement, but she just literally doesnt know what that means or how to operate any different. Its great that she still loves me for me, but I just dont feel any different, or like she sees me any different (because .. Well .. She doesnt). I feel for you though; that sounds very stressful and I hope that you two can reach a good middle ground of understanding 😊
Oof yeah, glad she's supportive but gonna need to sit down with her and tell her to dial it back. On the other note,oooh how smooth? We talking baby's butt? Btw you're gonna be IRRITATED once/if the stubble grows back
Awee I get it. She’s trying to be supportive but it seems like she’s almost overcompensating. Just tell her to take a breather and maybe let you have some more agency over who knows about it ❤️
Not exactly but talking about how open you are about your gender is probably good, readjusting expectations and all, for me at least this communication style helps (a bit with my mother cause she does not really listen but she misgenders me less and knows more what subjects I feel open about this way).
I wonder how often this happens to trans people


I’ve had this issue with my wife for a few years now. She cares about me enough to see me as a woman, but she’s oblivious to the chaos calling me a woman, or even insinuating my femininity, in public can cause. It’s a double-edged sword. Her confidence in me is helping me get my own, but I’m constantly scared of what’ll happen if someone overhears and disagrees with what I identify as. I live in Louisiana, so it’s not exactly an accepting state.


I need her confidence to build my own, I just hope that no one is so transphobic that they hurt her (or me, but I care more for her safety) just for being with me.
Yeah when I came out to my close friend and family they essentially outed me to everyone (friends, family, whoever). Now everyone knows but they don't really take it seriously.
Hiya, my spouse is 28MtF, only out to me etc. Similar to you and your partner, I have been able to tell 2 people for different reasons (one dated a trans woman a couple of years ago, one is my best friend), we haven't even told our children.

ANYWAY. 

I have worried that I am 'too supportive', I want my spouse to discover their own feelings, style, likes and dislikes without influence from me and at the same time I don't want to feel disconnected from the person I love and their experiences. 

When we shop we have a bit of a code, ""do you think I should buy this?"" Basically just means ""hey, do you want this?"" It gets tricky because I am short and they are tall so, for example, it is a little obvious if I ask for long leg jeans and size 11 shoes. To combat this we created an imaginary sister. It makes my spouse more comfortable if we discuss their equally tall sister, who needs to just feel more feminine and is sick of mens shoes etc.

I have no real concerns about my spouse coming out to everyone, I know it won't be easy but sometimes I feel impatient for it to just be done but I have to respect that it makes them anxious, and people won't be reacting to me, they will be reacting to my spouse (positive or negative, it can all be overwhelming as I am sure you know). 

It is so important to do regular little check ins and debriefs. Don't feel any guilt about telling your partner that their actions have made you uncomfortable, holding back could make it seem less sincere.

Before you go anywhere, explain your desired level of visibility, who you do/do not want to know etc 

 After each trip out somewhere, thank her for the things she did that specifically put you at ease, and remind her of your boundaries if she walked the line or crossed them. 

Let her know that you want to take this slightly more bitesize approach so it isn't some big overwhelming conversation that carries more weight than it needs to just to make yourself heard. 

Be gentle with eachother, you are both starting a new chapter in your lives together and things won't always go the way you want/expect. As long as you co tinge to strengthen your mutual respect for eachother it will all be okay
That’s the talk we had today. She was almost in tears realizing how upset I was. Which of course made me feel horrible. But maybe it’ll get better going forward, at least I hope so
I am so sorry. 

And believe me, I understand how insensitive this title may sound, I wish you the best my friend
This. I feel like not respecting your wishes is really just not respecting you. 
""I don't want a party."" ""Hey, for your birthday I invited everyone from your work and extended family, surprise~!"" Then you're the a-hole for being mad haha.
I think OP understands this as she has said that she loves her wife and that she can talk about her feelings to her therapist and friend. 
The problem isn't the excitement in itself or the oversupportiveness but that she is outing OP to people without her consent, and making it public when she's not ready yet.
Obviously this is not the worst case scenario and wife sounds really sweet but she still needs to respect OP's boundaries and wishes.
""Women can't keep a secret either. Benjamin Franklin once said three can keep a secret if 2 are dead""

What the fuck?
Don’t feel horrible or bad! This isn’t your fault, you’re just setting boundaries. That’s a totally normal and okay thing to do. One day she’ll have to set boundaries with you, that’s just how a healthy relationship works.

I hope from here on out then that she is more aware of what she says and to whom.
Do not feel guilty for being honest with her. She clearly wasn’t understanding how fearful and anxiety inducing this whole process can be. 

Being supportive means she helps you go at your pace (not hers) and does not talk about your transition with anyone without your express permission. An insane amount of sensitivity is required, and amount that just doesn’t occur to some people without making it abundantly clear.

But it sounds like she was receptive to your concerns. So that’s good.
Make sure to use positive affirmations, like thanking her when she doesn’t do it, some people react well to those
The most important thing to do is remind her that you're happy she's so excited for you, but that you are only ready to share with very very few people you absolutely trust, which is where the hurt is coming from. Constant communication and reassurance that she's totally good to be excited for you, but to try to reign it in when in public.
I'm gonna tell you something I wish someone had told me. If she makes you feel bad every time she'd upset that's emotional manipulation

I’ve got restricted of visiting women’s restroom in college	"First of all, I’m sorry for my bad English!!
I’m MTF, but I haven’t changed any of my documents yet.
A few days ago, during the classes (the time when usually no one’s there) I went to the restroom. I opened the door and a woman from my faculty was there, she looked at me and loudly deadnamed me, I ignored her and went on. When’s I was walking out of the room, I saw a head teacher of my faculty sitting in front of the restroom, waiting for me. She asked me to sit down and asked me if I remember what she told me last time (the time when I’ve got restricted of wearing skirts). I immediately burst into tears, i felt so helpless at that moment. Teachers an other students were passing by and looking at me, and it was so terrible. She said that there were complaints from other girls because of me using this restroom. She told me that I should use the restroom according to my birth gender, and when I’m done with changing my documents, only then I would be able to use women’s restroom. After that I felt so disgusted, why should I explain to a stranger what restroom I want to use? I also felt so dysphoric at that moment, because during the conversation she kept on using my dead name…
I’m sorry if this post is stupid, I just don’t have much people to talk about it 😩"	"Your English is very good! And I’m sorry that happened, do you have any female friends that could escort you there to make sure you’re safe? That might help
check the schools dress code. it probably says nothing that prohibits you from wearing a skirt. if your teacher has a problem with it tell her it doesn’t violate any rule and she has no authority to tell you what to wear. sorry about the bathroom though. sounds tough.
I'm so sorry that happened. Why do people make such a big deal of what bathroom we're using anyway? We're there to use the bathroom, wash our hands, and leave. Let us do that in peace!
Depending on your country check if they are allowed to do that, in many countries they could be prosecuted for it.
If that is the case talk about it to your parents and to the director of your school, they can certainly come to an arrangement about it.
This post isn’t stupid and she sounds like a transphobic asshole who thinks discrimination is okay. I’m really sorry, girl. You shouldn’t have to go through any of this
This post is not stupid. I’m so sorry that happened to you OP, you deserve to use the women’s restroom in peace. The fact that they got complaints is absurd, everyone’s just trying to use the bathroom so they can mind their business.
""Oh no! A boy in the girl's restroom""

*Changes the papers*

""Ok you're fine""
Get out of Russia if you can. Spain is good,apparently.
[deleted]
It ocurred to me on the end of college, I was so sad and angry, I just stopped using the school bathroom until the year end, but, on my country, now it's transphobia and the law punishes people that discriminate like this, check your laws and perhaps you are protected and can use any restroom
Out her to the public about being a transphobe. Actively misgender her to show her how it feels. Protest against her. Flat out just spread word of her being a shitty person.
It's not a stupid thing to talk about. Luckily in California they legally can't do shit. If a cis girl came do it they can't stop me. If you live in California, which I doubt by the whole talk about your English being bad, you can totally take them up on this. Yes I go fucking full Karen at my highschool. AS I SHOULD. And I look good doing it 💅
WHY would they prohibit you from wearing skirts ? Why should they care what you wear as long as it's comfortable for you ? And why the fk would they tell you what bathroom to use ? That shit is so messed up jfc
Which country is this?
Dont you mean MtF?
Because Men aren’t going to complain about a woman going in their restroom
Is there a LGBT club on campus? You can go to them for help on figuring out what you can do.
How is this even allowed? Someone make a law against stuff that restricts trans people like this already!
Damn that must really suck :/ Had a similar problem back in secondary school. Is there a disabled/gender-neutral toilet you can access? If so then use em, honestly you'll feel glad you got the privacy and not have to deal with that shit. Otherwise complain to your shool about it.
That’s so horrible! I am so sorry for you. You definetely have right to jse whatever pathroom you feel suits you the best. What law says you cannot? I think there should be people who’s job is to take care of transkids and their rights. At least in my country, my teachers have to use the name I want to and I am allowed to use any bathroom
So sorry to hear about your troubles I absolutely agree with the others get escorted in and out of the ladies room and I don’t understand why you can’t wear skirts if you are transgender so sad all the way around stay strong sweetie
I'm so sorry that happened. Is there anyone you can turn to who could escort you so that you'd be safe with using the women's restroom?
I am so sorry for you going through this. Is it possible for you to find a friend girl who would escort you around? It would maybe make a difference
[removed]
If you don't present as female, and your documents aren't female, I am of the opinion that you shouldn't **be** in the women's restroom.  I'm sure I'll be downvoted into obscurity for this comment but if you look like a man and present as a man and have **M** on your legal documents, you should be in the man's restroom.  The teacher does have a valid point on this matter.  I did not start using the women's restroom at all until I could pass as female while presenting that way, and I did not start using the women's restroom where I worked until I had the gender marker on my ID changed.  There comes a point where your own personal dysphoria needs to take a backseat to other people's concerns about sharing their space with someone who obviously doesn't look like they belong there.  Repeatedly violating your school's policies doesn't make you a brave hero soldiering on, it makes you an asshole.
Oh god im so sorry about that. Thankfully my college has genderless restrooms in every buildings so i don't have to deal with gendered ones, but everytime i'm in a place where there's no genderless ones i always feel so horrible :/
You could use this experience as evidence to prove a case for asylum. Go to rainbowrailroad.org to get started.
God damn, what sort of college has rules like that.
yes, I have, but I guess it wouldn’t be such a big issue for the head teacher to call me out in front of her…😣
It’s a pretext to harass trans people. Simple as that.
I live in Russia, and I didn’t find any info on that. I also live in dorm in another city + I haven’t come out to my parents, so I guess there’s nothing I can do at this moment
you know the ""change the docs first"" thing is just a way to kick the can down the road. it's just an ad-hoc excuse added on to make it look like you're not being intolerant, while still getting to say ""no"". they'd likely still find an excuse either way.
Some countries have laws against that kind of behaviour, some other don't. But in none of them is it enforced, maybe once a year in the entire country...
No, I haven’t yet, I might talk to them, but I guess it won’t be helpful 😩
She's from Russia. It's not easy to oust a transphobe there...
They said in a comment responding to someone else that they live in Russia.
Which country is this?

Edit: i saw Russia in another comment. It’s probably better to just escape before you get hate crimed im sorry the world is like this.
omg yes, im so sorry lol 🥺
unfortunately no, there isn’t :(
She is in Russia so that is very unlikely to happen
In Russia there’s no such laws, moreover, there could be some laws against our rights, but fortunately, they were not approved by the government
Reported
looks like your head isnt a chick then mate
That's true, but i'd say it'd be much easier to confront her with a friend.
Yeah, just another way they try to strip the humanity from us...
That might explain their transphobic views, Russia is most definitely not the greatest when it comes to lgbtq+ rights.
I am sorry to hear that sister 😔 good luck then, stay strong and reach out of you need any emotional support ☺️ we are all here to support each other ❤️
Ну ты конечно храбрая, сестра. К сожалению страна вообще не готова нас принять…
I understand.  But the fact that the laws exist makes life difficult. Also,if the public is not supporting you,then it becomes unpleasant  living there. Nobody deserves to be treated like that.

Oh shit that's almost the opposite, yeah...... that sucks.
Don't be sorry :3
Oh nooooo :(
Ah, you live in Russia. Shit. I’m finnish, hey neighbour! Just come to us
Thank u so much ❤️
понимаю, но и я не могу принять тот факт, что страна не может принять нас…😣
She’s in Russia
Yeah, it’s very unfortunate.

what's an egg?	I don't understand the term, an egg? Is everyone that's considered transgender today an egg? What is the metaphor explain?	"The egg metaphor when referring to transgender people is used kinda as just a cute nickname, and when you eventually come out as trans, you ""break out of your egg."" It's just a cuter form of saying you're closeted I guess? Correct me if I'm wrong please
When you are figuring out that you are trans you are breaking your egg, so it's like the closet but more for yourself getting through layers of dissociation.
So when I first heard the metaphor several years ago it was a specific reference to new trans women… “*egg cracked and a chick popped out*“.  I think it’s been extended to include all trans folks now.
It‘s because of r/egg_irl  
It refers to trans people who don‘t know that they are trans yet and those in denial.  

Edit: thanks for the comment- apparently this term is older than the egg sub.
The joke is that usually an amab person is an egg as in they’re probably trans, and then when they accept that they hatch into a chick(get it?)

Now the term is basically anyone who is currently identifying as cis but knows they’re trans
An excellent source of protein
It's kind of just a metaphor for someone who is trans but doesn't know it yet, I literally knew my gender identity from as early as I can remember but I had no way of describing it and I didn't know what the word ""transgender"" meant until I was 17, so idk if that means I was an egg or somethin else idk
The egg is a simpler version of Plato's metaphor of the cave.  The shell of one's egg is comprised of all of the things that stand between someone understanding their identity.

My own egg was comprised of a mix of transphobia, ignorance, and *well-trained* and very necessary acting skills.
I had to resist the urge of giving you the Wikipedia definition
“Eggs” are trans people in denial of being trans, typically despite obvious signs. A lot of trans people have difficulty accepting being trans at first due to internalized transphobia, fear of transitioning, transphobia of others around them, perceived attachment to their birth sex, etc etc etc

Recently this term has become a bit problematic as GNC (gender non-conforming) people are often called “eggs” despite not being trans. It’s not always GNC people but that’s the most common.

Generally it’s fine to use if you’re referring to yourself or someone else who is ok with the term.
An egg is someone questioning their gender or thinking about if their gender even could be different than the one they were born with

You could question yourself and find out you are the same gender you were born like that, it's totally fine.
omelette
egg moment
[deleted]
A thing you either fry, boil, make into omelet or scramble, or add to other foods.

I'm kidding. It is when a person who represses their inner self, their true self. They deny being transgender.
It’s just another way of saying closeting tbh. Like when someone says “I wanna be the other gender so bad for *reasons*” is considered an ‘egg’. It’s like being closeted but not knowing you’re transgender yet, at least that’s what I’ve gotten from it
It's the new hip way to say you're in the closet
The state before you become transgender and transition.  


technically anyone can be an egg
Yeah... 🤔 I kinda don't get the metaphor. I came out. I didn't hatch.
It’s a metaphor.. l when you realise you’re trans it’s like an egg is cracking
AFAIK  an ""egg"" is someone who hasn't realised that they are trans yet, and that moment of realisation is their ""egg cracking"".
egg is like before you come out
I had to resist the urge of giving you the Wikipedia definition
Well it has two different meanings depending on where you are for example the most popular term is to refer to trans people that aren't really out, or in countries like new Zealand (and Australia I'm not sure if they use it that's why it's in parentheses)it can refer to idiot
The closet for trans peoples
At this point it’s an overused trope.
It's someone who hasn't yet realised they're trans
what im in rn :'(
[deleted]
someone that doesn't know they are trans and cracking the egg means someone realizing they are trans
basically just means trans people that don’t realize they’re trans yet
The thing that comes out of a chicken
An egg is the thing that birds, amphibians, reptiles and for some reason Platypuses lay to hatch their young in
An egg is a baby trans! 🏳️‍⚧️💕
I hope i hatch soon
r/egg_irl
That's bloody weird. I'm from New Zealand and we use egg in another way lol how confusing LOL
an egg is an egg
An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg results from fertilization of an egg cell. Most arthropods, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not.
More or less, yeah. If you're in the questioning phase, you might be an egg.

Not all eggs hatch.
Explain this to me like I'm a two-year-old. If I came out gay and felt I was trans when I was 14 does my egg break at 14? Does it break when I start taking female hormones? Does it break when I start living full time as female?

I personally feel like I came out gay at fourteen and felt transgender before that time, but lacked the words to explain it?
Im an Egg rn

gonna hatch in 16 years I feel it
I think it’s more about being in denial/not knowing that you are trans yet, and the egg cracks when you accept yourself
You're wrong. An egg is a trans person who doesn't realize/accept that they are trans. A trans person that knows they are trans but has to hide it is called closeted.
An egg is also like a person that’s trans but doesn’t know it yet or deny it (like me). And when you eventually decide you’re trans, you break out of the egg.

At least as far as I know.
It’s not about the closet, eggs are trans people who haven’t found out they are trans yet, or who are questioning.
Thanks that makes a lot of sense!  Contrary to what someone else explained, I think if I've been told about it when I was five, I would have very much been pleased. It's not as ideal as being born the sex you were meant to be, but it's better to be like Jazz Jennings than to go through childhood blind.
I don't think I ever denied it? I just didn't know there was such thing as transgender or transsexual until I was 15.
The term egg has been around a lot longer than that.
yea I think another way that often gets overlooked is not just those people who haven't yet connected the dots, but ALSO people who are in denial...
It's cute!

Things were different back when I was young in San Francisco. I worked at a restaurant when I was a teen and I wore mostly female clothes, but I wasn't even trying to pass as a girl. I didn't really know for sure, if I could do it?
Are you older like me I found out about Christine Jorgensen around 1969, I think I was 15 or 16? I never denied the feeling of wanting to be female, but I didn't know the name for it before that, or if it was possible to change sex?
I think their definitions are probably short-sighted. Like I don't think I've ever been an egg, but I also think I've never  been straight either! Straight is more than just being heterosexual; it's also being congruent with mainstream society's values and I've always been very incongruent.
I think you have it down pretty well. If you always accepted yourself for what you are you're hatched.
There wasn't any images of trans people when I was a kid. There were were gay people who were, in the 60s, were considered to be deviant and mentally ill. That didn't bother me at all. I figured that anybody that was born male and real feminine was probably a gay?
( I know this isn't true now, but when I was 16 years old this is how the world appeared to me)
Probably because of my generation, I relate to the term closeted when applied to gay and lesbians, when they do not accept their homosexuality. I don't really know about it pertaining to trans persons because I've never met a closeted trans person, or one admitting to being so. does that make sense?
I'm beginning to think it has more to do with an ego dystonic experience of your own gender identity.
not all eggs hatch.

some get eaten >:)

/j
Well all eggs hatch, just sometimes they hatch into a cis person.
I got bludgeoned with the hammer of cute anime girls, not hatched
You “break your egg” when you accept you are trans. So if that was 14 for you then 14
In addition to what the other poster said, the ""egg"" label can only be applied with certainty in retrospect, after they've cracked. Otherwise it's really more like an endearing term for discussing actions and thoughts of people during their questioning and denial cycle when all the signs seem to be pointing to ""yes, trans."" There are unwritten rules, I.e. you never tell a supposed egg that they are an egg unless they openly ask if they are trans and never without explaining the concept, and you never try to convince somebody that is questioning that they are an egg. It's unethical as heck to try to convince somebody they are trans, they have to discover that for themselves.
The simplest way I can explain it is ""an egg is a person who doesn't yet realise they're trans."" Note that in this context ""trans"" just means ""non-cis"" i.e. enby people are included.
Your egg breaks the moment you know that you're trans.
most people who are eggs make it a habit to deny themselves enjoyment because of external pressure.
So, feel free to call <15yo you an egg, if you like.  
If not, don‘t bother. :-)
Oh thx, didn‘t know. Thanks!
I'm only about 24 years old, but I do know of Christine Jorgensen, and similarly I knew that I wanted to be female from as early as I could remember but I didn't know the name of that feeling to begin with, I can't actually remember who the first trans person I learned of was, it wasn't Christine Jorgenson, but I probably would've found out about them near the same time I learned what being trans was.

Unfortunately I grew up in rural conservative Australia so I was abused quite often at school and at home for expressing myself in a feminine way and tried to suppress a lot of my femme behaviors and gender identity so people would accept me, but even then I don't think the people who were harassing me believed I was trans either, that was just general homophobia at the time.

> I think their definitions are probably short-sighted. Like I don't think I've ever been an egg

Just because you've never been a thing doesn't mean the thing doesn't exist...

I've never been a neurosurgeon but I know who do go to for a brain tumor.
People really like labels and finding their groups

That's why there are so many terms for people who are queer in so many different ways

There are trans people and homosexuals and a lot of other stuff and I am sure no one knows ALL the definitions. But it's really heartwarming being on this subreddit and seeing people figure themselves out and supporting others who may need validations

Marry me 😂

Edit: laughing at the idea of you marrying me not the joke
I never really heard of trans (Christine Jorgensen), until I was 15. Before that time, I always thought it was being gay? It was the 1960s and there wasn't much understanding of feminine men, other than being homosexual?

 It could be argued that I didn't really have a trans identity until I was 18; It could also be argued that I knew I was transgender(gender non-conforming) when I was 8 years old? I guess I could say that I accepted myself is trans, rather than gay when I was eighteen, so I came out as trans when I was 18.

I don't find the metaphor informative?
Idk, I'm guessing here that if you told me when I was 5 years old, I could push a button and be a female I would definitely push it!  I had some understanding that I was not the same as a female when I was five, it disturbed me. At eight I would definitely wanted to be female! I talked about it all the time. When I found out it was possible I was 15, I didn't understand the difference between being gay and being trans? I thought all gay men would rather be women if they had the choice? I also understood more about gender permanence and probably would have been a little more frightened about then when I was a child. I finally came to terms with it when I was around 16 or 17 and knew I wanted HRT when I was 18.
I was a sis not a cis. 

I think the whole concept of cis is just another dividing tool; if I were younger today, I would object to it. 
I always knew I was like a female even though I knew by the time I was five that I was born different.

 It's just that there was no such thing to my knowledge as trans until I was aware of Christine Jorgensen when I was either 15 or 16? Once I knew that sex-change was available I said ""that's me, I want one."" I really didn't understand the whole process at that time.

 I think the term relates to a previous period of gender diffusion or uncertainty?
What I was trying to describe here was that I was an outcast hippie gay kid who never really had much affinity for straight people. Straight boys were mean to me in school and I didn't socialize with anybody straight until I was much older.
[deleted]
My point is that it doesn't really make sense if you've always identified as the gender that would make you trans.
If I knew about being trans at 15 and didn't really feel identified as trans, but identified as gay until I was 18, then it might make sense. The thing is, I did identify with being trans; it's the process was confusing to me.
I'm figuring the term means more if you repressed desire itself?
Rural Australia that must be really different. I grew up a long time before you but in a liberal city San Francisco. There was a lot of gay tolerance and yet there were conservatives trying to pass laws to prevent gays from teaching in schools. There's always been assholes running around trying to hurt people because of their sexuality. If it weren't for religion I don't think none of this would make any sense?
You missed a good rick rolling opportunity :')
I'm sure there's some of that that I'm just not going to understand? 

Just like it's apparently difficult for people today to understand how much someone like me would have depended on the gay community for any kind of social support. There wasn't really our trans community when I came out. There was was a small group at Stanford that had about a dozen members and then there was the street queens (prostitutes), which I wouldn't want to identify with?
The egg phase is a retrospective one, where a trans person looks back on their life at all the moments that signaled they weren't cis, but didn't realize they were trans until later. An AFAB kid that doesn't get along with girls and dresses in more boyish clothes, prefers short hair, etc. may look back on these experiences and say, ""of course, being trans explains this so well.""

Basically being an egg is someone who displays clear signs of not being cisgender or hetero, but hasn't connected any of the dots. Trans people often look back on their lives after they realize that they are trans, and call that phase of their life their egg phase.
Being gay is your sexuality being trans is about your gender.
It's a metaphor, it's not meant to be informative.
Sounds like your self-discovery was pretty immediate and definitive; I would say there really wasn't much of an ""egg"" phase for you if you were sure as soon as you were old enough to possess object permanence. If you were actually questioning and not sure until 16, then you might have been an egg until that point.

For me, all I knew was that I hated my voice dropping and hair growing in weird places after I had a surgery done to lower my testes at 10, and in hindsight I exhibited many tells that should have given me an epiphany but didn't until I shocked myself with it at 15, then reburied it until 30 with questioning the entire time. I am a pretty textbook egg.
“Cis” is a dry, academic term. It comes from Latin, just like the word “trans.” Trans means “across from,” and cis means “on the same side as.” So, a cis gender person has a gender identity “on the same side as” their body. There needs to be a term to distinguish cis people from trans people in certain contexts.

Trans people have existed in some form across many cultures for as long as there have been people; the only thing that is new is the technology that allows us to modify our bodies to reflect our perception of ourselves.
Cisgender isn't a dividing term any more than ""green apple"" is. It just means a person who identifies with the gender and sex they were assigned at birth. It's not some tribalist kind of word like democrat or republican, but a useful word when talking about people who aren't trans in when the distinction is needed. Ideally we'll get to a point when most of the time nobody puts the word trans before woman, just as we don't put cis before woman unless we're talking about transgender concepts.

Cisgender is to gender what Heterosexual is to sexuality.
We all deal with it differently, being an egg in the past doesn't make you less of a person. It's okay to try new things and the coming out is just that feeling of being comfortable with yourself.

I was a self-loathing monster when I was an egg, but people change and that's okay. Don't let anyone tell you what to like. Keep going you beautiful person you❤
What you are describing isn't an egg, it's a loudly dressed person.

People aren't perfect, the only thing that makes an egg is that tiny voice in your head begging you to try it. Not saying that's you, just speaking from experience.

The difference is those with confidence vs those without it. Nothing you described sounds remotely like an egg.
Uhm, no idea. Does it matter? It‘s just a funny word one can use or not.
Exactly, religion has a lot to answer for, it brings people together occasionally but it's done a lot of damage and caused a great deal of division more often than not.
I didn't really hate boy clothes so much but I hated the short hair, I called it a boy head and I hated that look! I hated anything to do with male (boy) long before I ever knew what gay or transgender meant. I thought male was a hateful punishment. I think it had something to do with inhibiting emotional expression?
What's your point?
I'm pretty much sure that I never second-guessed wanting being a female when I was 5 years, or 8 years old.

It wasn't an objection so much to boys toys, or having to wear pants, or not being allowed to wear a skirt. It was like they were trying to tell me that there was something bad about me. And it had something to do with emotional expression. The I hated being told to act like a boy! it didn't come natural to me!

I've had some regrets over the consequences of transitioning, never idenity-expression, rather being accepted in relationships. Whenever I get questioning myself, I always think back about how much I wanted to be a girl when I was a small child.
I'm just suggesting it's problematic for some people like me because I do not consider trans to be my identity it was a descriptive term for what I went through when I changed but it no longer applies because I'm just a female now.
Well I disagree with you and your negging me because I disagree with you! I'm trying to tell you that for me, saying cis is just another way for being divisive against trans people. Especially nowadays.
Exactly, I always knew I was feminine as a child and at 12 years old, I knew I  was attracted to boys and didn't fut my birth sex. Then discovered there were people in the city who were very accepting of my femininity and homosexuality. I felt at home with them, wanted to be part of them, to identify with them. It's that simple. 

What made it complex is that unlike most of them, who were content with their sexuality and their bodies, I felt I was female and should be physically a female. 

This difference separated me from these people because they thought I was rejecting being gay in favor of wanting to be straight, which wasn't the truth at all! It would be a lot easier to live is gay than to deal with the difficulties I've faced, during transition.

To compensate for this, I moved to the Santa Cruz mountains on a commune as a health food hippie chick until 1979. This wasn't the most secure time in my life, but it was definitely the most fun period of my life.
It's something interesting to discuss? I could argue that I hatched when I was 18, but I have to include that before I hatched, I wore mostly older thrift shop dresses, even though I didn't wear girls underwear?
Sounds like normal egg stuff to me :). Often eggs don't know being trans is a possible thing that exists, or that because of how they were taught to think, they know trans people exist but it never crosses their mind that they themselves are trans. In my case, I discovered inklings of what being trans meant as I began my ""i just want to be a girl so much"" phase, but due to it feeling taboo (raised christian) I didn't even let myself consider it until I was free from the faith.

Self exploration is just exploration when you're young, and often you do or discover things about yourself that you don't get the real meaning of until later, when you realize there are great explanations of those exact experiences. Only since about the 2010s have we gotten *some* trans representation in the media. Even the bad rep has boosted our visibility because it's sparked debate and makes people look it up. Eggs nowadays are more likely to come across people they relate to and find counselling with a community that has been through what they are feeling.
Yeah, I'd say you skipped being an egg; you were born a chick and owned it. I think if you continue to own it, you'll find that acceptance you seek.
Okay, good for you, then
Edelaan wasn't negging you, they were explaining what the term meant because I guess people are confused as to how you think it's being divisive against trans people. Are you saying that there should be no distinction between trans and non-trans people, period?
It would have crossed my mind immediately if I had known about it, but I never heard it mentioned in 1966 or 1967? I knew about hippies by then. I didn't ever hear of a transsexual until 1969 when somebody told me about Christine Jorgensen and the sex change operation, I was fascinated about it!

I also assume that it was part of being gay? I had an older friend who told me all gay men wanted to be women. Things were different in 1969 when I was a teenager.
How do I continue to own it, or continue not to own it? I'm confused what I do to own it or not? please explain?
Now we know that gender and sexuality aren't correlated, a gay man is a man by definition, so they can't be a girl, if they want to be a girl, they are not a man but a woman, and the gay part change to be straight, because if a girl likes a boy she is straight, but even now some people don't understand this, I can only imagine how it was on 60s
What's confusing? You own being female because you were certain of it at 5, on the edge of when most people can remember anything about themselves at all, and didn't doubt it. Not all of us have that conviction, some of us doubt that aspect of ourselves almost daily. That strong sense of your true self that you have sounds like it gives you strength to get through your other struggles, struggles that would include acceptance in relationships by your own word. I merely make the confusion explicit that it will also give you what you need to navigate tacceptance in relationships. How? Only you can know how you you interact with the people in your life.
I can see what you're saying if you change from male and gay to a female you'd be heterosexual. 



 Once I went through a sexual coming as gay I was happy with my sexual orientation, which was not the same as being a straight female. Then when I transitioned for congruence of sex idenity, I felt less secure dating straight men because they were too like the boys from school. 

 If there were gay men who liked me as a female body, I'd choose them because they would more likely understand me.
I'm beginning believe--contrary to what EVERYONE else thinks--that sexuality and gender ARE indeed related. I DO have the sense that an effeminate gay male likely, in many respects, IS an iiteration of a transgender female and vice versa. . Not  exactly so, but on the spectrum. 

I may be totally of full of shit on this, and I'm sure someone will totally tell me that, but as a ""gay"" male since the age of 13, and now a soon to be be post op trans woman, my ideations as a young male and those of me as a trans chick, are absolutely intertwined. Not the same, but tied loosely together.

When I meet a really fem gay male, I often consider that person to be my ""sister""--- NOT my brother. We like the same things, talk the same way, often dress compatibly and we more or less want the same things in life and in partners we choose. 

Obviously, this is not ALWAYS the case, but I do believe--in my heart of hearts--that many of us (fem gay men/ trans women) are very close to each other on our fabulous sliding scale of queer humanity. 

Okay. The barrage of hate and outrage may begin. I'm armored up for it...
I don't get why you would say I'm not living as a female? I'm a post-op going on 50 years what else would I have to do? Basically lived more as female since I've been 16, but I wasn't really trying to pass this female until I was 18. They wouldn't give out hormones until you're 18 in those days and I actually had to get a special permission start at 18.
… what
It sounds to me like you are defining this by people who have come out with a certain label (gay, bi, trans woman, trans man) and not by the qualities the label describes.

If a gay man is attracted to a woman just because he perceives her as a man, he is still gay, but he just isn't respecting the woman for who she is, rather as whoever he thinks she used to be. It would just make him transphobic and gay.

Coming out as gay isn't becoming an 'other', and I'm not sure what you really mean by other in this case. How a straight girl who has never questioned her sexuality sees her sexuality doesn't have anything to do with a gay man who has questioned his.

You can be a straight woman who has questioned her sexuality while she identified as a man. There's nothing less straight about that. If you question your sexuality as a man and discover you like men, that makes you gay, as a man who likes men. If later you become trans, you are a woman (or enby) who likes men, and therefore are no longer gay. Of course you won't be like the cisgender woman who is straight and has never questioned it, but that has nothing to do with your attraction to men or validity as a woman. Both are women attracted to men, no matter the difference in the way they experience that or see themselves.
I get what you are saying and many trans people feel that way *about themselves*, but I thought you might appreciate an explanation for why you have some downvotes.

You just have to remember that your view is informed by your history and experiences, and those aren't shared by everyone.

For sure, there are lots of heterosexual trans people who still feel like they are ""queer"" because the queer identity itself means something to them. But there are also lots of heterosexual trans folks, even back in 1960, who explicitly consider themselves straight and *not queer in any way*. Being trans was just a process for them and they identify most strongly with cishet culture.

So yeah, I totally get what you are saying, but you sounds a bit like you are projecting your own understanding into other people. Identities are personal and complicated, so it is better to just assume that every possible combination of identities does exist somewhere, and if someone tells you they are a particular way, just believe them.
I'll not bring hate to you, you are valid, I just discord with your opinion, I'm a trans woman that never related to gay males, I am boyish as fuchs, and a lot of trans femmes don't fall on the gay male web before transition, the same way I saw so much trans males that don't fall on the butch lesbian web before transition, there is a reason to gender and sexuality be saparetad things, but if you are good realizing you share a lot with affeminate gay males and they don't mind being called sisters all is good.
Read it again and read it closer.
IT makes a lot more sense if you replace their usage of Gay with Queer. I know a lot of people in the 60s used Gay as an all encompassing term for anyone not Cishet.
You're over-analyzing it! And yet you're being too topical, as if you're analyzing it from the standpoint of a text book that explains all sexuality. You got to look at the personal factors

If a person comes out as gay it takes a certain amount of self exploration and self discovery to deal with being different han is somebody who is straight. This is extremely true when you think about the time factor, the 1960s.

There is no way that I would feel the same way about my sexuality as a female who was born in the early 50s and came to understand herself as an ordinary straight woman in the 1960s. I guarantee you they're not the same.

To go from the experiences I had with wild sexual life the city, being a hippie, being a gay hippie being part of a bizarre theater troupe and then trying to play a straight girl would be extremely pretentious. I was nothing like an average straight 20 year old female, when I was 20 years old.
Oh no I’ve read it five times already. Still doesn’t make much sense
It makes sense op, dating straight men is rough lol. But on the broader convo, you don’t have to have an egg phase. You get to write your own story. :)
To understand this you have to get the idea that there was no other community that accepted an extremely feminine boy as anything other than a punching bag, other than the gay community.

 Even if I hadn't been gay it would have been the only community thst tolerated me enough to hire me to work in a restaurant, or work in a retail shop. At that time, unfortunately, people had no awareness of anyone who was a feminine male and hetero?
At the risk of being downvoted, i was born in 1995, in a small town that up until the 90's was still chasing ""colored people"" out.  Sexuality was ecpected to be heterosexual (had some problems over that) and transgender was not a thing.  We had seen the ocasional transgender charecter in movies or whatever, always overwhelmingly meant to look like their AGAB.  Which is disheartening, because a lot of people think that is what being transgender is (Trans people are basically just crossdressers in their eyes).

So i understand why what they said technically made no sense based on todays terminology (they also said transexual, which is outdated), but growing up in such a bigoted place i can actually relate hardcore.  I used such inapropriate terminology, said things that were downright insulting and had no clue, because i had never experienced LGBTQ individuals or the problems they face in 25 years out of 27.

I just told myself i couldn't possibly be part of the LGBTQ community, for no other reason then i didn't want to be a target, and knew nothing about LGBTQ individuals or ideals.  All i knew is that the vast majority of people in my school were ""completely fine with black, brown and gay people.  Just so long as i dont ever have to deal with them personally.
So is it correct then that you don’t see yourself as being an “egg”? Like this phase wasn’t you being ignorant of being trans, it was you living your life in a different context. (?) I think that’s perfectly fine, and some people can relate or not relate to the term when it comes to their own lives."	ua8gf2	trans	686	0.98	2022-04-23 15:56:04
Amy Schneider	"
Amy Schneider, is the current leader on ""Jeopardy!"", an American TV trivia quiz show.  She has won $897,600 so far.  Amy is also a transgender woman and that is publicly known.  

Since Jeopardy has so much popularity across the U.S., she has been subject to significant attacks over her gender.
In her Tweet she said:

""I'd like to thank all the people who have taken the time, during this busy holiday season, to reach out and explain to me that, actually, I'm a man.

“Every single one of you is the first person to make that very clever point, which had never once before crossed my mind.”

Dripping with sarcasm, her response, I felt, was perfect.  She has shown both poise and strength particularly since was also robbed at gun point in her home town of Oakland, California over the New Years weekend.  

Tough woman, Amy!"	"It's kind of absurd how good she is at Jeopardy. Talk about a really smart individual with nerves of steel.
Amy is amazing, and helped me understand first hand, the importance of positive representation. Her continued success has helped my grandparents get over some of their transphobia which is wonderful.

My grandpa literally went from, ""wow look at that man in a dress, what's he doing up there? "" to ""huh I guess those transsexuals can be intelligent and successful, good for her."" all within like a week. Amy is out here literally saving families across America, there's no way my boomer grandparents are the only ones feeling the wave.
I once saw some jerk spouting the same crap towards a trans woman, who responded with the same kind of sarcasm and how much of an eyeopener this comment was for her. I kid you not, the guy says ""well that's because you're a woman and don't understand these kind of things"". Just blank stares after that one.
Love her ❣️
You gotta love it cause all the transphobes can do is get mad. There's no argument for trans women having an advantage in jeopardy. No way to diminish her accomplishments. She is objectively amazing, and she is trans. And they *haaaaate* that.
Up to $950k now. 950k reasons for transphobes to cry.
I love the idea that all those transphobes are just seething that she’s smarter than them and also now rich so all they can come up with is “Yeah? Well, you’re a boyyyy and boys are gross!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭”
Stylin on them transphobes
Considering her obvious intelligence, it makes sense that she wouldn't concern herself with the opinions of random bigots. It would still be very disheartening though what's happened to her lately, so it's great she's remaining so stoic through it all.
Just saw a Kotaku article about this
I mean if I had won almost $900k and counting I doubt I would give half a fuck what any number of random transphobes think.
Imagine being fucking braindead enough that you think you can explain to debatably one of the smartest people alive that they are in fact not the gender that they are because you definitely know more than her
Not trans but just Tweeted at Amy about a Yahoo article referencing her growing up in Ohio where she  stated (indirect wording) trans people were thought of as drag queens and prostitutes. Later going on to say I wanted to be a positive role model. I told her I thought the comments were out of character and seemed insensitive. She seemed indifferent to the plight of trans people when she was younger. That for some SW was done as a means of survival

gigastacy
This is really great, I hadn’t even thought of that. Thank you for sharing that story, it might’ve made me day.
*""Your gender identity is what I say it is based on what I think will make my insults land better!""*
mans gotta up his sexism quote aswell as his transphobia quota for the day so i get it
She was stating a simple fact about how a lot of people in middle America perceive trans people. I doubt there was anything malicious in meant by the comment and sadly SW is an unfortunate reality that too many trans women end up in because of biases and transphobia and it would be nice of her to have taken the opportunity to use her platform to speak out against that reality but we can only guess at her reasoning for not expounding further on her comments.
It's almost like people are allowed to change and grow as they get older 🤔 Also a lot of trans people have to fight through a lot of internalized transphobia from childhoods in less than accepting environments.
The fuck?
Get a life <3

I told my GF, I couldn't wait any longer!	"

Last night I just told her, the need to say something became so strong I couldn't breathe. I posted some stuff asking for help or validation yesterday but it turned out when you know, you know. I showed her my post from yesterday because I was already trying not to freak out before I told her so I didn't think I could explain things properly with words (check my post history if you fancy a read, be warned it's long) 

She's so accepting of me and I love her so much. She had questions but far less than I thought she would. I couldn't have hoped for a better response from the first person in my life I've told

Today she's going to help me shave, try makeup and some of her clothes! I'm so lucky"	"Congratulations!!! that's such a huge step for both your and your relationship for communicating openly with one another I'm really happy to hear it went well <3

That's awesome! Make sure to keep talking to each other. It's a big change, but love and trust are powerful forces. I'm so happy for you!
I recently told my girlfriend too and it's a similar situation, no matter how bad things get at least we have her ❤️❤️
That's wonderful and lovely to hear, sounds like you have a great gril.there!
Always love reading positive stories like this ❤
I told my GF last weekend and she took it really well. I’ve just started HRT so I knew I couldn’t put it off any longer. We talked about everything, a very emotionally draining weekend to say the least. There were a lot of tears, as she had hopes of us getting married someday, but we’re both heterosexual women so that dream died and I feel terrible about that. I’m glad she’s accepting it, and we’ll continue to live together and maybe even grow old together, but as sisters rather than a couple, and that hurts her more than I can say. From my point of view, the relief of not having to keep myself hidden is close to euphoric, and I make sure to show her my true self everyday so she doesn’t get confused, we agreed I can’t bounce back and forth in gender as that would upset her even more. Good luck to all the couples that have to deal with this, it’s not an easy road and our girls get crushed when they learn the truth, there’s no getting around that.
Trans supportive partners save lives and its not something we talk about enough
Aww this kinda reminds me when my gf came out to me 😍 I'm so happy for you guys
I wish I could get my partner to help me shave my back. That's the only part I can't reach -.-
Congratulations
I did the exact same a few nights ago, I sent her an essay only to find out she fell asleep, longest 30 mins of my life! 

But I woke her up and sat with her as she read the text and she is also supportive and thinks we can make it work (we have 2 children together).

We seem to have both got the best scenario out of this and I am so happy for you and myself and anyone else who is currently lost but building up the courage!

It is so liberating! 

Much love 🖤
that is awesome, i am very happy for you, and i do hope you two have a very happy life together sharing this. ;-)
That’s awesome! My partner and I are both bi and it’s honestly a huge comfort. We’ve both questioned our gender before and it’s so nice to know that if one of us (or both of us!) turn out to be genderqueer in some way, we’re still going to love each other.
Awesome!!

Awesome! I'm happy for u
Congrats, that’s great!
EEEEEEEEE thats amazing.
Good for you! Sometimes the anticipation and anxiety is so much worse than the result. I'm so glad your partner is so supportive!
Yesssss that's the best! I'm so happy for you!
I think you’ve been handed a golden ticket lifeline.  A supportive partner is something many people don’t get.  I’m so pleased for you on so many levels, well done for coming out to her!  It took guts.  
And how awesome is it thy she’s literally getting involved and helping you?  My GF and I do little make up evenings a couple days a week.  
I get pretty bad dysphoria so I’d probably avoid looking at my face so much and in so much detail if she didn’t encourage me like that

I think a huge appreciation post is in order for all the supportive partners. If mods agree, I might try to organise something on r/mypartneristrans when they open back up x
YOUR GF will need time to process and learn about what you have shared. Be considerate of her feelings and her need to talk to you and maybe someone else  about your coming out. I wish you both happiness
So glad to hear your relationship's going stronger (tbh who would feel happy neglecting themselves) so glad to hear this, imma be happy all day for u2 :')

So happy for u!! ❤❤

Madness
You are a thoughtful person and I did not have to presume you  needed my advice, however, I am happy to know you and GF a d doing well.  Be Safe
Thank you very much ❤️ it's something I've been wanting to tell someone for at least 15 years. I'm so happy with how she reacted, I spent until 3am crying with happiness and it looks like I'm not done yet today either haha
😁😁😁
We've been speaking about it for hours, I'm worried I'm annoying her with how much I have to say but I know she's just happy for me. Thank you I'm so happy for me too
I'm so happy for us, we're lucky to have girls like them :D even if my family and friends don't accept me (I'm sure most of them will though) I'll still have her
I really do, thank you so much. I'll probably be posting more over the next few weeks haha I'm hoping to get to a point I can swap back to my usual reddit account too so I can stop using this throwaway. I'll get there eventually
I'm happy you are finally yourself and sad that's how things ended up. It's great that she's supportive of you though and I hope you are both the best people you can be and that you both find someone else ❤️
I think without her acceptance of other trans people I wouldn't have had the courage to come out. I can't wait to tell everyone and start being the true me. It'll take a little while though, it's still incredibly scary despite being so relieving
That's so sweet, thank you. I'm happy for you two too :D
Just ask girl haha that's what I did :D
Thank you very much ❤️
I'm so happy for you! It's such a weight that's been lifted I can't even begin to explain. Sorry for the late reply apparently I stopped getting notifications haha
Thank you very much and I hope so too :D
My partner is Bi too, I'm sure that helped her accept me haha personally I'm only in to women, I guess that makes me a lesbian then
Thank you :D
I can't wait to :D
Thank you very much :D
Thank you :D
Thank you so much :D
It definitely was, I was so relieved after. More relieved than I think I ever have been
Thank you so much :)
I'm so lucky, I know for sure my coming out to my family will be better than most people's experience and I'm grateful for that

She's the best, we went shopping today and she bought me lipstick, deodorant and a nightgown so I can feel comfortable in bed. I'd be totally down for that too, if a post pops up I'll leave a comment x
Of course however so far she's taken it in stride. She can't wait to do girly things with me. I'm completely aware that it could be shock and I'm ready for anything negative in the future but I'm happy being happy for now :D thank you and I hope you are happy too
Thank you very much and exactly that haha I've wanted to tell someone for years. I wanted to tell her when we met a couple of years ago. I guess I resigned myself to just being a guy. I'm done with that though, time for the real me :D
I'm so happy, I feel like I've spent 3 days crying haha oh wait I have. Happy tears of course
Thank you :) ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
Thank you very much, I'm so lucky to have her in my life :D
It has been a hectic couple of days haha
Thank you for commenting and we're doing great. In fact I'm going to post a picture on reddit soon :D I'm feeling so damn happy
Oya. Definitely pace yourself at the start. If you see signs of her getting burnt out, let her ears rest.
Yea for sure, I felt the same when I came out to my partner
We say thank you 😍
[removed]
hecc yes, no more over-conforming- and after all, at the end of the day the real change will be your mood <3 nothing else has really changed
Definitely will but so far she's loved speaking about it with me :D
Thank deities my wife and I know how to handle my rambling. She'll very politely let me know when I need to shut up for a bit so she can think. It's gotten worse after coming out, apparently I'm bubbly now. Not used to being so happy.
I've only been out less than a day and already getting creepy messages. Love it xD
I said that earlier to her haha I feel completely different but nothing's changed
Perfect. Oh, and even if she needs a rest, find other people to yap to. Online or otherwise. Talking helps process complicated thoughts and emotions.
Hehehe Nice Work Chic lol It Sounds like you have Truly Found your INNER SEALF and are Definitely doing the right thing?
Will definitely be posting and commenting more over the next few weeks haha are there any places off reddit you can recommend?
100%
Try searching for your local (or the nearest) LGBT center! Many have health services, counseling, events, and groups specifically for trans folx, I know mine has been super helpful.
Thank you very much, I'll look in to that over the weekend. For a couple of days I'm going to try and present as feminine at home to see how I feel. Honestly excited to try :D"	m7nrf5	trans	690	0.99	2021-03-18 10:17:28
Got called a “boy-girl”	"  My friend (f) introduced me (mtf) to someone as a “boy-girl.” As in a girl who is a boy. I then had to awkwardly explain to this person that I’m trans. I felt so embarrassed. Am I wrong for feeling disrespected? I know they didn’t mean anything by it, but still.

Edit: 
  Some people got a little confused. If it was just like 1 then I would let it be, but like there’s a pattern now. I am a male to female, not a female to male. 

  Thank you for all the advice though! It really means a lot to be in such a positive and helpful community. Definitely helped me get over my own denial of my right to request respect and belief that my feelings don’t matter in regards to the situation."	"What but that’s literally transphobic! That’s a transphobic term I’m pretty sure… maybe they didn’t mean to but that’s really disrespectful
At best, a teachable moment for your friend

At worst, a teachable moment for your former friend
Yeah, that sounds transphobic and you have every right to be upset. Your friend may not have intended it to come across that way, so I'd talk to them and have them introduce you in a way that's comfortable for you.
Its the intent for me. If it was ment to be mean then its mean. If she didnt understand then its just unfortunately poor choices of words or lack of understanding of the meaning. Id just tell her politely the correct terms and then if she continues then its an issue. If she makes a conscious effort to do the right thing and say the right thing then thats all the matters.
You’re not wrong.  No one should out anyone else without their consent.
you have every right to be upset. i dont think ""boy-girl"" is any different from being called ""he-she"" which is very offensive and transphobic. you are ***not*** ""a girl thats a boy,"" you are just a girl! 

im ftm, and ive had to explain several times to my younger sister (shes only 8) that she doesnt have to tell every single person that we talk to ""yeah, [deadname] is a girl, but she thinks shes a boy."" she doesnt get it, and shes still little so i dont blame her for having trouble understanding that im her brother. but its still so uncomfortable and frustrating when anybody says something like that, and i completely get it.

i would ask your friend if they know thats a hurtful term to use, and tell them that they should introduce you as a regular person, not ""a trans person."" and how its actually super super dangerous to out you to people, and especially disrespectful to do without your consent.

((edit: i got the letters mixed up in your post, thought you said ftm- i fixed it, and im so sorry for the mess-up))
Don’t worry, you’re not wrong. I feel disrespected when I’m continuously “girl-boy”. (I’m ftm)
You are not in the wrong in the slightest for feeling disrespected because that's so fucking disrespectful to you, blatantly untrue and dangerous for you to be described to other people in that manner. Even if you didn't think they meant to be hurtful they need to understand that talking about trans people like that is incredibly demeaning and harmful. Just because you are trans does not mean you have to let ignorant people hurt you to seem polite about your identity. You are truly valued and loved and if your friend can't respect you, there are so many more people that will.
 Be safe out there !!!
Never feel bad how you feel

But also just want to say I am trully amazed by all the words and names we are give…
Unless your friend is a little kid that doesn't understand what being trans means, you are right to feel disrespected
That’s transphobic whether they meant it or not. Cis people (and even other trans people) should only use terms for us if we say we’re comfortable with them.
Malevolence requires intent.

If they did not intend to disrespect, then it was by accident and therefore a good opportunity to teach.

Despite what it may seem like, the vast majority of the world really doesn't know us or our culture, and it's up to us to teach them with love and respect.
My grandma called me that before having srs but she isn‘t transphobic she just doesn‘t know much about it, but in your story it very much sounds like she is.
This is awful. Had similar situations and I’ve cut contact with my friend who did this. If it’s worth it, explain this is horribly transphobic and to never introduce u like that again because u are female not a boy tryna be female or any of that bull. If they get mad, drop them. They don’t deserve ur time
Don't let people call you that. Super not cool.
[deleted]
I'm so sorry that happened, I remember being called a ""fifty-fifty"" once..
Boy-girl is a term that is usually used as a transphobic slur for trans women, but I could also just be lack of information and they are just trying to simplify it. My advice is educate your friend on proper terms and their meanings so that this sort of misunderstanding can be avoided in the future.
Maybe your friend isn't very informed but... But intentional or not the way your friend did it is pretty disrespectful. And they could have just left it at ""this is [name] she is a girl and uses she/her"" instead in trying to insert the immediate explanation of oh they are trans.
Maybe she didn't intend to harm you but she did. You're not a boy, period. She shouldn't say this. Also, if you want to tell people your story that's your choice not hers to deliver. Yeah she should know better.
Oh no, it the mid 2000s all over again. Where heshe was used as a slur. Im am so sorry you have to deal with this kind of bull shit
“boy girl”
Is this what we’re doing now? We REALLY deserve better.
You got to correct people 💯
Ita never okay to out a trans person in any context. This should always be left up to you to decide who gets to know. Regardless of whether you are open and proudly trans or not. Your friend should've introduced you as a female friend and left it up to you to tell them you are trans.
talk to ur friend about it. i can only imagine how embarrassing that was. make sure she understands that’s it’s probably not a good idea to out u to anyone anyway much less to say it like that. it might come from a place of not understanding but that seemed a bit transphobic so definitely talk to her and let her knows it’s disrespectful and ur not gonna tolerate it bc u shouldn’t have to.
That was hella disrespectful. No one that calls me a friend would introduce me like that.
\>Am I wrong for feeling disrespected?

No and I'm so sorry this happened. I would have been mortified and angry.
Pretty sure that’s a slur..
You are absolutely not wrong for feeling disrespected. 

This sort of behavior is honestly pretty not okay. I'd talk to your friend about their vernacular with regards to trans people and explain to them that, while there are SOME trans people MAY refer to themselves with that term, not everyone is okay with that, and express that you ABSOLUTELY are not okay with that. Reading through this thread, it seems like you don't even want to out yourself as trans at all irl unless you're in a romantic relationship. 

Yeah no, if that's the case I'd definitely sit your friend down and have a firm chat with them.
All I know is the last time I got called ""boy-girl"" it was in the middle of a string of slurs from some guy on a dating app who 'just wanted to talk about trans women in sports' or something.

You are not wrong, and you should make sure she doesn't introduce you that way again. I'm not saying bite her head off or anything, but be your own advocate that's all.
She didn't mean anything wrong tbh.
Don't overreact, and explain to her and correct her
That's mad disrespectful. Have you expressed to them how you feel about this?
Yeah, just had to check. Everytime I want to stand up for myself, it’s like I’m playing a gameshow of “Is that disrespectful or do you just need to stop being so sensitive?” There are no winners.
Omfg!! This 100%!!!! My boyfriend's mom tells literally EVERYONE before they meet me. I hate it sooooo freaking bad!! Like, you are setting them up to have predetermined ideas of who I am and making it so I'm transgender before I'm even human. That shit is absolutely REPULSIVE!

*fixed typo
She's a girl, actually.
Yeah, definitely gonna talk to them about it later!
The obligation to teach doesn’t fall on the person who suffered, and people who are good allies understand that pain is pain and that impact is more important than intent.
Nah fuck that. Not knowing any better isn't an excuse. It's not like we're some crazy new phenomenon, there is clear evidence we have existed for longer than humans have had written language.

It is not ""on us"" to teach with love and respect. If we choose to do that, we can. But the way trans people are expected to bear the responsibility and emotional labor of educating everyone we meet on basic decency is fucking bullshit.

If op WANTS to educate this friend, that's fine. But let's leave obligation out of it. Our only obligation to society is to live our lives in whatever way we choose. Expecting the oppressed to bear the burden of change is another small act of genocide, and one we all face on a daily basis.

Also, to be clear: I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at the fucking ridiculous expectations that are deliberately placed on us by the systems of oppression we live under, and at the way we all seem to just take those expectations and believe and internalize them, harming our own communities in the process. We are _better_ than that.
Yeah, I’m going to talk to them about it. I don’t really tell anyone unless I get into a romantic relationship with that person. This person only knew because they had known before I even transitioned.
Damn, that’s terrible!
game is rigged because 99% of the time it’s disrespect
Yeah whenever i stand up for myself I get the whole “omg transgenders are so sensitive” even though you would never say this kind of stuff to anyone else its so disrespectful.
I feel that, I often just don't stand up fot myself when i get misgendered or mos named. I don't want to be ""an annoying sensitive transgender"" if they genuinely didn't mean to misgender me. And it honestly sucks we feel that sort of way
it's incredibly transphobic to out someone without their consent
sorry to hear that <3
oh shoot!!!!!! my brain mixed up the letters when she said mtf and i thought she said ftm 😖😖 ill edit and fix it
Can I ask then, and forgive me for there is some fury here, who will teach them? And how should you react? It would be lovely for everyone to be fully understanding, for it to be taught in schools, but it isn't, and if it were, it would likely still have to be one of us teaching. It'd be lovely if folks educated themselves on this, and they should, but odds, realities at the moment are that most won't. So yeah, it does still fall on our shoulders to help educate and teach, just because at the moment it's probably the best way to get folks treating us better. Is it right, not necessarily, but someone has to and no-one else is at the moment so it's gonna have to be us, hopefully this changes, but for now it is.
Yeah.
But everyone keeps telling us it’s because we’re sensitive, all thethe while we have to walk on eggshells to avoid upsetting others by our existence
Ugh, ridiculous trans people trying to be treated like everyone else 🙄🙄🙄

Whats next? Are they gonna complain about employment discrimination?? Cmon what is this world coming to smfh my head 😒

/s
I fully agree. Nobody will free us but ourselves. Where we disagree, however, is context.

We can _choose_ to take on the work of trans liberation. I do so every day. But to come to a post where someone is expressing anguish at the pain a ""friend"" caused and immediately shift the burden of emotional labor _onto the trans person who was harmed_, and in the process actively excuse the harm done by this ""friend"" is, in my mind, inappropriate."	wqc77k	trans	676	0.98	2022-08-17 01:50:55
“Transsexual”	"Hi 👋 

So, for my sociology class, we’ve been reading a lot about gender studies and issues. The reading for today was over the concepts between sex and gender. The study was really good about explaining the differences between the two and the sociology behind visual concepts of gender, but there was something that seemed a little off about the way they addressed a transgender woman in the study.

The trans woman, whom the author used as an example of visual notions of gender, wasn’t described as “transgender”. She was referred to as “transsexual”. As a trans man, I’d rather not be described as “transsexual” because my gender has nothing to do with my sexuality or sexual desires. But I also know that often the term “transsexual” is thrown around when regarding trans women, not trans men.

The rest of the study was great, they even used the woman’s correct pronouns and perspectives of “feminine pressures”.

My question here is really your thoughts on the term “transsexual”, specifically from trans women because they’re the main target when the term is used. Is it offensive? Is it “meh”? Is it something you prefer? Lemme know ✌️"	"Transsexual is a word that's not as widely used today by younger trans people, but it was widespread historically. Generally, using the labels that historical queer figures used for themselves is best practice, so I wouldn't find it inappropriate to use the term in many historical contexts. That being said, it would be nice to have a disclaimer in a course like this, letting students know that, while transsexual is still a term some people use, it's a term many trans people now prefer to avoid for themselves.
Transexual doesn't have anything to do with your sexuality, but instead your sex. Trans men and women both have used the phrase historically and continue to today.
Theres nothing wrong with people identifying with the label but its generally seen as a bit outdated for cis people to refer to us as transexuals as far as i know

I personally identify with transgender but thats just because thats how this was all introduced to me probably
Just a guess, but i think the term ""transsexual"" comes from a time in which the word ""gender"" wasn't really that much used
For me, at 50+, I remember a time when Being Trans meant being Transsexual and Transgender was used for Cross Dressers and Drag performers. Then about 25...30 years ago things started to shift. Drag and Transvestite groups didn't like being called Transgender, and Transsexualism became a slur. In fact the whole idea of an ""ism"" being used for the trans community was discouraged. But the medical community didn't shift until around 2012. My Medical records still say I'm ""Transsexual"".  As a base meaning, and descriptor for Trans people Transsexual is more accurate, as my gender has never moved, it's always been in the same place my whole life. My Physical Sexual characteristics and outward expression have moved from the forced masculine places to a more Feminine and neutral place.

&#x200B;

But the stigma of the ""ism"" prevents transsexual from being used by us. Because being trans isn't a way of life, philosophy, or any idea that can be passed from one person to another, if you are trans, odds are it has an internal start. All we as a community can due is communicate that funny feeling you had your whole life is shared by all of us.
I’m a trans woman and I’ve really come to prefer the term transexual. I don’t know why but it just feels a lot more rooted in my reality about my body and mind than the term transgender. I know some people don’t prefer it but it’s silly to be outright offended by it in my opinion
transsexual is just a silly outdated term to me. doesnt mean anything bad, or anything good imo.
Personally always been weirded out by ""transsexual"", probably bc it doesn't fit the typical setup for most labels as ""sexual"" at the end of our labels usually implies sexual attraction not gender identity. So it feels odd.

That and the fact a lot of transphobes use ""transsexual(s)"" as an insults and that's most places people hear it nowadays bc most lgbt+ people use ""transgender"" now. I don't mind if a trans person wants to use the label for themselves, but when a cis person does it, I know how they mean it.
It's an older term, older trans people tend to use it and just older people in general
It’s mostly an older term that was used to specify trans people who had medically transitioned (therefore changing their sex/sexual anatomy, hence transsexual) however it’s considered outdated and is mostly only used in studies that need to separate trans people who have medically transitioned and those that haven’t, and even then the term is pretty rare to come across from what I’ve seen. I don’t know if it’s good or bad per se, but people don’t use it much anymore
It might be remnants of old/outdated terminology from before the separation between sex/gender was as known, maybe even an old version of DSM. I’ve seen it around occasionally, but primarily in those contexts.

_Just my best guess though!_
The term disambiguates sex and gender. Transgender people transition their genders (social and gender expression) while transsexual people transition their sex at the hormonal or gonadal level by undergoing HRT or SRS. Most transsexual people are transgender but one can be one without the other.

 It's a legit term with a legit purpose but has a negative history and many don't like it for that reason.
I call myself a transsexual because it means someone who uses hormones, surgery, etc to alter their bodies to live more comfortably as their true gender. Of course I am also transgender, which means I am not the gender I was assigned at birth. So why do I prefer to call myself transsexual, even if it's out of style? I like it because am proud of how I am transitioning my body to sync with my mind and my heart. It's also edgier and sexier, maybe? lol
For some reason, older straight men are just more comfortable saying “transsexual”. 

Not sure why.
There was a time when it was the norm, like ""transgender"" is today. Some older trans folks still refer to themselves as ""transsexual"" and it also appears in all sorts of legalese (at least in my country).  
But the term is outdated, inaccurate, and I'm offended when people call me that.
 A very dated previously used term, however the emphasis on 'sexual' makes it seem not what it is and the connotations associated are not fitting with transition. Transition is about becoming overall the person you are, physically, socially. Not just for the aspect of sex.

 Somewhat offensive. I am a woman; I'm just not cis. I'm not transitioning for a kink, I'm finally being myself I tried masculinity and it was impossible for me. I can't be that. Always I've been feminine in my mind heart and soul and I live that openly as I transition.
Agreed. ""Transsexual"" is a terrible (and outdated) term precisely because the word ""sex"" is too overloaded with meanings that refer ambiguously to both the configuration of your anatomy, acts you do with your anatomy, and orientation.

It's a mess, and as you say, your gender identity has nothing to do with your sexual desires. 

I don't think, honestly, it matters whether someone is using ""transsexual"" to refer to a trans man or a trans women. It's equally broken either way.

I don't think I would consider it personally *offensive* as such, but would take it more as an indication that the person using it is just uneducated about these issues.
Always feels like an outdated icky medical term to me
In my opinion it's a lot to do with context. A lot of the time, I've heard the term used in a derogatory way to address transgender people. 

On the other hand, I remember reading that transsexual meant the person was either planning on having or had already had sexual reaffirmation surgery. So that's the concept I prefer adopting.
As others have said, it's historical.

Also I believe some preferred it because there was a huge process to ""earn"" the right to transition previously, and you basically had to get a medical diagnosis as transexual or something?

So it's a dated term, but for some it might have special significance where it was a major part of their lives and difficult, and practically a legal battle to transition.

I'd never throw the word around unless it's very clear someone prefers it for themselves. It's dated.
Transexual is more a medical term than anything. Bc I haven’t transitioned I wouldn’t call myself transexual, but it doesn’t mean I’m trans. It’s kinda just meant for people who medically transition :D
[deleted]
Personally I dislike it cause being trans has nothing to do with sex at all, so it’s not a word I like
personally i don't like it? just seems weird to use that label when it's nothig to do with sexuality, and isn't necessarily to do with sex. but i don't have a problem with it.
So I’m not a transfem so my opinion isn’t as Important but I have decided if I choose to medicalize my transition I will use the term for myself. I like it’s resurgence with gen z but it’s not a term for everyone. Maybe in a few years we will be more acquainted and comfortable with it tho
Depends on the person, it’s for someone who wants a sex change, but even then it’s up to that persons preference. I don’t mind it, but I’m sure there are some that do.
Transsexual is and old concept that only describes once you have started, or you are medical transitioning. It’s entirely posible to be transgender and not to be transsexual, I will review how old is the bibliography used by your teacher, sounds like middle 90’s beginning of 2000’s , now it is use the therm transgender cause is more inclusive and less associated to the wrong concepts of the past!
I am definitely transsexual in the Definition of my Sex.

I don't care about my gender at all. So the term transgender simply wouldn't fit me.

I am just born in the wrong body. And no I am not trolling if someone would think that.
I've always seen transsexual to mean a transgender person who has had bottom surgery so their sex is changed. I think transgender is just more of an umbrella term nowadays.
Transsexual is often considered a slur these days and has largely fallen out of favour due to negative connotations but all it really means is somebody whose sex is different from their sex at birth i.e. someone who has transitioned medically.

Originally it simply meant SRS (a “sex change” as it was known back in the day) but we now know that there’s much more to sex than genitals. 

It’s pretty safe to assume that all transsexual people are transgender, but not all transgender people are transsexual.

As I say, the word has some pretty negative connotations these days; it was often used in a derogatory manner, it’s often used as a noun in order to be dehumanising, it’s associated with truscum/ the transmed community and it can be seen as exclusive of trans people who don’t want to/ can’t medically transition.

Fundamentally, though, it simply means that your sex is now different than it was at birth
Heck, I only hear it whenever Tim Curry uses it in Rocky Horror Picture Show, so I don't know.
Back in the heady days of 200X, when I was in the thick of all this in my own life, I insisted on ""transsexual"" instead of ""transgender"" because my gender isn't what I wanted to put under the knife. I recall people arguing that ""transsexual"" meant that cis people would forever be creeped out by the reminder that some of us have bottom surgery. I also recall being terrified back in the day that if ""transgender"" won as a term, then insurance companies would ultimately prevail in labeling SRS ""cosmetic.""

Either way, I think the adoption of ""trans"" as an umbrella term happened explicitly because there was no reconciling the opinions of the two camps. Back in the day it got written ""trans*"" so everyone knew everyone was included, and then later the asterisk got dropped.
i like transsexual but only when trans people say it lol. the cis can use trans or transgender
When I hear transsexual I don't associate it with sexuality but with the reproductive and hormonal differences between humans, you know biological sex.

I like the term transsexual it is an adequate description of some trans experiences, although i know not everyone likes it or feels represented by it, and that's okey too.
I always thought the term referred to someone who's had bottom surgery? Idk maybe the term has changed since
I do not and will not refer to myself as a transsexual. To me, that word is a slur with negative connotations.
I use transsexual. Lots of people do! Truscum tried to claim the term, but it has deep roots in the trans community and it’s time to claim it back! ☺️☺️
I use the term transsexual to describe myself sometimes and I don't consider it offensive in the slightest.  It used to be that 'transgender' referred to someone that identified as a gender that was not their sex.  Once a person did the transition to their desired gender they were no longer identifying as a gender other than their sex and therefore were no longer transgender, they were transsexual.  The definition of 'transsexual' that I use is someone who is living as their preferred gender, post transition.  It seems over the last 15 years the term 'transsexual' has lost favor and dropped out of the common parlance and 'transgender' now refers to everyone pre, post, and in the middle of transitioning.
Well let's just say my sex will align with gender, so transcendent... lol either is fine both are claimed... no Cis-Het going to knock what I  claim proudly ⚧️🏳️‍🌈🦄🐛🐚🦋♾❤
I actually hate it. I don't care about its ""history"" or whatever. I *know* that people are going to get the wrong idea if I'm labelled as ""transsexual"".

The ""sexual"" suffix makes it seem like it has to do with sexuality (homosexual, asexual etc.) but ""transsexual"" clearly doesn't fit that description. It's a dated term with negative connotations that has no use in our progressive society, and I don't ever want to be referred to by it. ""Trans"" is a perfectly okay umbrella term in my opinion.
Being in the medical field, I see the term used in research during a given period. 

So In that context it bothers me, (kind of jolting) but I’ve come to understand that it shows that we’ve progressed. That we’ve finally reached a point where people are starting to accept that sexuality and gender are not the same thing. don’t like it if it is used now as a description of me for example. While I’m not fond of the term, back then that was the accepted wording.
I hate the word transsexual. The word brings with it a connotation of sexuality and sexual desire.
Transsexual is still used a lot in the medical world, but considered pretty outdated outside it. I'm personally not really comfortable with it, partially because it's not a sexual thing and I'm sick of people looking at it that way, and partially because transsexual is a very old school diagnosis term, associated with ""transvestite"" and ""gender identity disorder"". I think it's pretty obvious why I don't like a term associated with those.

It also kind of feels exclusionary towards NB people and other trans people who don't want medical transition. I don't like being so exclusionary.
We don't call cismen ""malesexuals"" or ciswomen ""womensexuals""
So I don't like it.

I believe the brain often forms other connections with known words. I don't want people to see me as ""transsexual"" and think about ""sexual"" or ""sex"" unless I want them too. I want people to think ""person"" or ""woman""

I don't think society as a whole is mature enough to hear the word ""sexual"" without objectifying me.

That's my two cents.
I despise that term
I can't transition my sex, I can transition my gender. So I'm not transsexual, I'm transgender.

That said, it's about context. If someone I care about asks me what it's like to be transsexual, I'll know there's a way to steer the conversation to correct them. If some hater calls me a transsexual to dismiss or degrade me, they're gonna catch some poetically crafted shade.
Fuck that word tbh
I hate it personally.
Transexual is just an old word. Nobody really uses it anymore except old people, and you only tend to see it in older studies. It's not really an accurate term, but it's the kinda thing you just have to look past on occasion
Its weird and i honestly think its better used for someone who just likes trans ppl
I don't mind being called transsexaul, that is what I am, so long as it's in the correct context and not used abusively. However, that's not my gender and to me it's the equivalent of going around calling every woman a female instead of woman. 

""What did that female say to you?"" ""That female is really cool.""  

It may be accurate, but just sounds strange to address everyone that way.
The word transexual just feels really hateful to me. Probably cause it's typically used by cis people
I think this is pretty common when the british were writing about india during the 1900’s, there were a group of transgender women who were important to their culture and had religious prescence. I forgot what they were called but there are still temples like this today. 

It was a term coined because they really didn’t know how to describe this back then. Now it’s not used but many old documents use this term
That’s an interesting point, along with the responses to this comment. And although I understand that in a historical text this would be a common phrase to use, this study was conducted in the 2010s. That’s why I found it so strange. 

I also agree that the terminology should have been addressed in the class, but the school I’m attending is actually a private Christian university that has policies against lgbtq persons (which I am currently trying to transfer from, there were a lot of things I didn’t have control over when applying because of my being a minor at the time of application and my parents’ beliefs). Therefore, it was more progressive to include a study like this that included the division of sex and gender and the fact that the class was mainly about addressing the fact that sex is a brute fact while gender is an institutionalized fact, but I could never see it being progressive in the way that they would address certain terminologies especially when addressing trans persons such as myself and the woman in the text. (If that makes sense)
To add to your excellent explanation: ""transexual"" was historically used to describe trans people who wanted to have or received ""sex change"" surgeries. The reasoning being that they wanted to ""change their sex,"" not just their gender (their physical sex vs their perceived gender). This was a trend to at least 2008, if not longer.

Interestingly, the term ""transgender"" was an umbrella term that included not only ""transexuals"" but also cross-dressers, drag queens, GNC people, and anyone who didn't fit into the normative gender/sex categories of society.

As an aside, ""transvestite"" was used to describe what were later called ""transsexuals."" The former term was then used to describe ""not trans enough"" trans people; the latter to describe people who were allowed to officially transition (this tendency is at the root of trans medicalism).

To put it in Blanchard's terms: ""true transexuals"" were ""HSTSs,"" while ""transvestites"" were ""AGPs,"" more or less. ""HSTSs"" were allowed to medically transition and ""AGPs"" were not. This medical practice has been in use until fairly recently (2012 in some places, including parts of the US) or is still in use in some countries (also including some parts of the US).

Back to the topic of terms used to describe trans people, in some circles, ""trans"" is used to describe what ""transgender"" had described before: an umbrella term for all GNC people, etc. And ""transgender"" is used to describe people who don't identify as their AGAB.

The whole history of the terms (from ""transexual"" to ""transgender"" to ""transvestite"") is so confusing... They've gone through a lot of changes.

This was all from memory, so the exact details may be off. I got most of this info from Susan Stryker's *Transgender History* and *The Transgender Studies Reader* and Julia Serano's *Whipping Girl*.

All of the above are great books! I recommend reading them, especially *Whipping Girl* as it's told in a mixture of personal anecdotes of Serano and scientific-based arguments (she was trained as a biologist and it shows!)

Thanks for reading my long ass comment! I guess I had a lot to say about the topic!
I don't know. If history books used the N word to describe enslaved Africans because it was used in historical contexts, it would still be wrong. This is too. Transsexual is like the R word, once a legitimate medical term, but now an outdated slur, and I am not a medical condition; I am a woman.
Great, thank you for letting me know!
It has a lot of negative connotation, though, and needs to be a self-claimed label, and not one imposed on trans people by others.

Like, I can call myself a dyke and that’s ok, but if someone else calls me one without knowing I claim that label, it’s not ok.
The thing is, ""trans"" isn't short for transition, it just means ""other side of"" so I'd argue it's more accurate to say transgender because our gender is different, or other than the one we were assigned at birth. I can agree that ""transsexual"" could be used to refer to someone who is or has already medically transitioned, but that sounds a bit too much like truscum rhetoric of ""you're only trans if you hate yourself and get surgery"" so I think it's problematic even without the historical negative connotation.
That makes sense, thank you for sharing!
That’s probably true, but my main point is more focused on a more current point of view. The study was conducted and published in the 2010s, and that’s why I wanted to know if other people in the trans community would be especially bothered by something more current using a term like that.
\^\^\^\^ This.

The Transsexual term was still in wide use in the community in the mid 2000s, and transgender was usually used to refer to the entire community, that included CD/TV, Drag, etc.

If you were transitioning with hormones and/or surgery, and living full-time, you were transsexual. A lot of the TS girls were quite elitist and gatekeepery to those that weren't intending to transition and live full-time. It became a sort of peer-pressure in the community.  
As a result everybody just sorta claimed that they were planning to transition, but just hadn't gotten around to it yet for reasons...

We also had a term GG for cis women, which may have been short for Genuine Girl, or Genetic Girl, depending on who you asked. Eventually folks objected to this as it implied that TG were not really female, and ignored the possibilities of intersex conditions.

We also used the word ""Tranny"" as a playful diminutive to refer to ourselves. I was so disappointed to lose that one! But I guess cis women turned it into a slur...

My (very recent) HRT paperwork says ""Reason: Male-to-female Transsexual"" on it, so it is still in use medically.
Thanks for mentioning this. There have been several shifts in vocabulary throughout the decades. When I first started learning a little about trans history, that was the biggest initial hurdle.
That’s interesting, and something I wanted to know more about when posting. I know that there are some people who prefer the use of the term transsexual, but wanted to dive deeper into why because there is so much controversy surrounding it. Thank you for sharing your perspective, I really appreciate it
Thank you for sharing, that makes perfect sense
I feel like I’m also not comfortable when the term is targeted towards me, but I’ve definitely found that some people prefer to use it. I think what I’m coming to realization of is that the term shouldn’t be used unless the person targeted has expressed that they’re comfortable with the label. Thank you for your response, I appreciate it!
Mhm. Especially with places like work or whatever.

Like, 'Hi! I'm transgender! You don't need to know anything other than my ***gender*** to interact with me!'
I agree, and thank you for sharing!
I feel like that’s something I’m learning as I read the responses as well. I appreciate the commentary, it means a lot to learn more from people in the community. Thank you!
>Like they aren't transitioning genders, they're more transitioning the gential part.

The thing is, ""trans"" isn't short for transition, it just means ""other side of"" so I'd argue it's more accurate to say transgender because our gender is different, or other than the one we were assigned at birth. I can agree that ""transsexual"" could be used to refer to someone who is or has already medically transitioned, but that sounds a bit too much like truscum rhetoric of ""you're only trans if you hate yourself and get surgery"" so I think it's problematic even without the historical negative connotation.
So like how transvestite (crossdresser) doesn't mean either transgender OR transsexual?

Interesting.
So you’re saying that you don’t identify with your sex at birth, but you don’t identify with another gender label? (This is a genuine question so I can understand, I don’t mean any offense whatsoever)
What do you mean by ""not caring about your gender""?
I’ve noticed that a lot of people hold this view, and I appreciate the explanations for the term. It helps me come to understand more persons in the community. Thank you!
“Poetically crafted shade” is now going to be my catchphrase.

And thank you for sharing, I also had the same thought process about transitioning sex versus gender in regards to the terms.
>I can't transition my sex,

That's what transition is for , sex is not a monolith it's just another social construct we made , a one made to taxonomy animals over reproductive capabilities but that failed a los of times not only in humans . What's sex  ? Cromosomes ? Beeast? Genitals? Hormones? As intersex person this seen a just a badly made term . It should be just just guideline not a monolith. So yes you can change you sex just noe every aspect of it , actually doesn't matter.
I’ve noticed this is a viewpoint a lot of people hold, but I’ve also seen other people who hold the view that transsexual means that of someone who has undergone a bottom surgery. I appreciate hearing everyone’s points of view, it really helps me come to understand the terminology better in the eyes of the community. Thank you!
Female is often used as gender too.
Hijra is the term in india. but you have to realize it's not that the british just wrote about them. they had an anti-hijra campaign. read up on wikipedia if you wanna but i give out a trigger warning.
Early 2010's the term was still used fairly often, I knew people at the time who ID'd with that term.
Well said. ""Transvestite"" is still a diagnosis in the dsm-5, which is totally outrageous.
I would never use the term to describe myself either, but I also know older trans people who've been out longer than I've been alive who still use the term to describe themselves, and I think that's valid. I certainly don't think it's a term that should be used to describe anyone who hasn't claimed the term for themself.
Lots of trans women use the term transsexual to self ID. I prefer it in fact! ☺️☺️
That makes perfect sense, and I agree. As I stated in my response to the original comment, I believe that using a term only because it’s historically used doesn’t mean it is theoretically correct.
I think it really depends on how the individual identifies! The safest route is just to use “trans”
I always find it odd when a word changes meaning, because sometimes it feels like it's overnight. I try and keep up, but honestly, at some point I fear I'll revert to 1992 vocabulary, and no one will understand me.
Yeah I think for me it’s that I tend to view my trans identity through a medical lens and not so much a psychological one (though of course that is a factor as well). For me it feels very much like a hardware issue and not a software issue, my gender isn’t the problem my sex is. On top of that it makes me feel connected to our communities ancestors who would’ve described themselves as transexuals. The term transgender doesn’t bother me at all it just doesn’t feel like it describes my experience as wholly
Oh yeah no, I disagree with truscum rhetoric and everything, I was just pointing out that there are some trans people who exist that prefer that term over transgender. They prefer that term *because* they're truscum and think in order to be trans you either have to medically/physically transition or at least must *deeply* desire to. I disagree with this concept, and prefer the term transgender and think it's the best and safest one to use, especially for education /lh  
Definitely problematic, I just spent like a couple days a while ago exploring the transmed community to sort of, get to know the other side to see if there was any middle ground. I didn't want it to go to waste so thought I'd use some of the knowledge I acquired for this discussion.

Again, I disagree with truscums, and agree with you :\]  
I think the rhetoric and main concepts they follow do more harm than good. I agree the term is problematic due to both current truscum overlap and historic connotations :\]
Transvestism, do not relate to being trans nor transexual, nor transgender. Look for example a trasvesti will feel fine when using women clothes, a transsexual may try transvestism as part of self discovery, but will not feel ok mostly with what see on the mirror. Mostly mtf, may even have a dysphoric attack when they see on the mirror.  Also based in general in the fact that transvestis get some sort of sexual gratification which trans do not get. The most positive a trans can get it may be gender euphoria if it happens to help them.
That's very common. I don't know their situation but a lot of people identify as a-gender, meaning they have no gender, or are gender apathetic and don't care how they're seen or addressed.
I don't understand gender at all. Why we even need it. Sure society kinda is stuck on it and there is a big history with it.

But I don't see the need for it. Aren't we all humans in the end? And I don't even see why we have to gender stuff like colours, clothes etc. Cool if you wanna associate that with it, but in the end I just don't see the need for it the way we use it right now. If it is sth you identify with and wanna have a feeling of the group that is fine. But why trying to force even kids into stereotypical roles based what is in their pants? Everyone should have the right to Set it for themself and what they see right and should in my eyes start as human and having all the basic rights as other. What you so or how you wanna live your life is your thing.

But yeah, I hope I didn't offend or disrespected anyone. And anyone who likes and identify with it has my respect. I just don't understand why society is using it like that in the past and currently. And try everything to find differences between other, even if we should be all the ""same"" and evolved enough to not care about the body Feature of other.

Sry if I wrote it still confusing. I am still not good in putting it into perfect words.
It was my understanding that Hijra were not trans people per se but more of an altogether different third sex, like the Kathoey of Thailand, but without the hormones.
Great, thank you for letting me know. That really helps broaden my view
Yeah it is totally outrageous. I just looked it up, distress in the individual over their own behavior's a necessary condition for diagnosis, but it's still pretty messed up that it's even in the DSM 5.

I can see it as a means to deny that someone's trans. I mean, if the therapist's anti-trans enough they might just diagnose them with transvestic disorder and call it a day. You know, instead of helping them comes to terms with their identity.

Thanks for telling me about that! I love learning new things :)
I'm already there.  I'm too damn old to learn new terms for the words that people have decided are offensive and now must be stricken from the books.
“…a hardware issue and not a software issue…” is one of the best ways you could’ve described it, that really helped me understand more. Thank you again for sharing, and I’m open to any more conversation about learning about different experiences such as yours. I’d like to be as educated as possible to fully understand the people in my community, and again, I appreciate the commentary.
Wait. This is the first I've heard of transvestism being correlated to sexual gratification outside a derogatory sense. Are you sure they're related like that?
That seems to conflate gender with societal perception of gender.

Two very different things. Not saying that's what you're saying, I'm just saying I think there's more down this rabbit hole we can learn.
Nah, It just seems you're hyperfocused on societal perceptions and gender roles. Which TBH, is where a lot of people are today so you're not alone there. 

I'm in the same boat as you, where I think forcing gender roles on people is an arbitrary and unnecessary practice.

I personally have an understanding of the feminine and masculine, that concept BEHIND the gender roles. It's not dresses and makeup that I identify with, but that which drives those societal constructs.
That concept that I identify with is currently called Femininity. 

I don't know if that's similar to your concept of lack of gender, or even if the ideas are comparable. I just know that we're looking at different things, and would like to understand more.
It's complicated. They're called a ""third gender"", but plenty of hijra *do* consider themselves just trans nowadays, some are intersex and some would be called feminine gay men in Western terms (etc).
Of course, I generally enjoy talking about my views and experiences as a trans woman with people who aren’t asking just to try to pick a fight or try to make me sound ridiculous
In short, yes... but  more research is needed, the difference is that transvestism as a disorder, is consider a paraphilia, without digging deep a paraphilia is when the object of sexual desire get displaces on to another object,  there is a loot of debate thou..  that even reach the DSM-5... Something I do not like of the justification is that they are using the term autogenophillia??, which I consider a bad also a mystical representation or a very debatable idea probably from psychoanalysis school , but if we focus more in the paraphilia is kind of less strong and debatable, look in short a paraphilia is what people call colloquially a fetish or a kink, and as long as do not distress the live of anyone it shouldn't be a problem for anyone. So yes they are actually related, but not always, and one think do not mean the other... so very much up to debate... but i think it depend from were it comes, a trans women wearing women clothes is not a transvestite... Is a women using women clothes. A Drag may or may not be a transvestite... for most I know is an art... and I cannot imagine then tucked and erected... so yep... that is my undertanding...

&#x200B;

I edit a bit I think I may made to much confussion...
Yip. Because sure there is sex.  And yeah there is gender, but why is it so important to everyone?  


And hey, that is totally okay. And sure I have some labels that fit to me. For me personal the individual most of the time is in the foreground. Like yeah I am kinda ace, I am kinda bisexual. But yeah what you described with masculine or feminine is more understandable to me, than the other stuff.   


But even that I would call myself also androygnous. So yeah, sry I feel now way too special!
And thank you a lot! For the first time I feel valid over the internet by someone. Because I even had in this community ppl that bash me. Thank you a lot
I completely understand that, it’s always nice to learn rather than lecture or be lectured at. Thanks again!
I think there's a dilineating factor between transvestite disorder and transvestism. But TBF, the conflation is derogatory AF.

There's also the potential that ttansvestic disorder is just a trans person that represses their trans-ness, which would create the cycle denoted in that disorder. And the urge to express that by those means specifically.
I've been doing a lot in trying to understand these things and why I feel the way I do, along with why I felt the need to repress it in general. Along with the political and social concepts among other things. Cuz I like learning, and there definitely seems to be a large gap in language in knowledge that just void waiting to be filled.
I feel like that is an extremely low-bar, and I'm sorry about that.

But I do know that most of us are trying to understand these concepts without the language to express them, and so it causes frustration in everybody that is trying to feel valid in a society that inherently doesn't think they exist.

I won't say I haven't made mistakes, I've several comments that could be as awful on this account, but we all learn through mistakes.
I agreed with that... I openly think the DSM is a good example of old and new... and that most of it require to be more research, and they are making research btw... but yeah,,, foe me the term is not to welcome. but if you know many symptoms repeat in much of the disorder's... so basically the were it come from make the differential diagnose. I will refer in the case of a trans person or an not aware trans person... it will be better to have another term, like for example £( in search of identity... i don't know), but sadly ""transvestism episode"" is what is used sometimes in the inform to refer to that period in which you were looking for yourself cause dysphoria in order to get the GD diagnoise...  so yes is weird....
Thank you, you are a great person. My DM's are always open to you if you wanna discuss or understand more
I mean being autistic doesn't help I guess. Because I rly try to understand. And hey don't worry, everyone maybe was at a bad place. But as long as we try to learn everyday, it should be fine!
People trying to explain stuff from the outside looking in often miss the human aspect, and that causes confusion. 

I wonder why it's commonplace to forget that humans are emotional creatures, and to impose logic devoid of that driving factor.
ditto
Well to be honest the dsm categorisation's are for professionals... a Client shouldn't really being explained like that, the disciplines try to look for biopsychosocial... but yes... is not that they forget we are humans... is like more like a code that allow them to say a loot in not to many words...  they actually take gender dysphoria out of the disorders... cause all the new research pointed to a human condition not a sickness... look this stages in society are kind of an always come back, its important under my eyes to be able to expolain something without your heart in it, and also doing with your heart, so we can reach the most people, and achieve the trans liberation. Sometimes is important to omit the human part to be able to open the human questioning in some of the population that is less empathic... that has work for me... We need to be accepted as a human condition, so they see us as human, cause whatever that sound sick they gonna make inhuman, and whatever they do not known sound sick to them...  so i am not sure if at this point we are talking about the same, but wanna let you know that is not derogatory in my words... and I am also trans... yeahhh you let me thinking... do you want to add something so i catch better what is in your heart??
I think that scientists and doctors are not immune to human bias and societal influence. And because of this, that understanding from them goes to the general public and to future doctors and scientists.

You've inspired me to dig deeper though:

I think that Freud did a disservice to the human race by suggesting that almost every single thing can be explained by ""psycho-sexual disorder"". And that is the hurdle we try to overcome in respect to understanding mental health.

Since then EVERY mental disorder, or minority group has been classified as some sort of sexual predator. This is even influenced our scientific understanding of the natural world, where every thing only has one purpose: reproduce. And nothing else matters.

They forget that humans admire the world and play games. They don't understand that animals do the same thing.
Take my like!!!!!!!!!!! 100% agree!!!!"	ubo3vv	trans	654	0.97	2022-04-25 15:44:11
is my trans identity valid even though I don't experience bottom dysphoria?	"Me and my mom got in an argument over my transition, I came out about 6 monts ago and she is REALLY against it. I just want to look like a girl, and play a female social role, but I have no intent of having bottom surgery, and I don't experience bottom dysphoria; my mom however says that since I don't want bottom surgery that I'm fakeing it for attention, or, I just want to dress up sometimes and I'm not really trans. 

I'm fairly certain that she's wrong, but I don't quite know how to explain how I feel, or how being trans works. I also have this pent up anxiety that she's right, and I need a second opinion."	"The only necessary part of being trans is gender euphoria from a gender not assigned at birth. Is your quality of life better as a girl? If yes, then you are trans and valid :)
yes it is. dysphoria is not something all trans people deal with, nor is it required to be trans. if she's still iffy about it you could link her some articles on the subject matter. one for reference: https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/is-suffering-from-gender-dysphoria-necessary-to-be-transgender-c6de811f89c
Yes, you are valid. You do not need bottom dysphoria to be trans.
Being dysphoric with what you were given isn’t what makes you trans. Being happier with what you *become* is what does.
you don’t need *any* dysphoria to be trans! literally whatever combo of dysphoria and/or no dysphoria you may have is *perfectly fine* and there’s NO “right” way to experience transness!!!!
Your good. Dysphoria, even if it is how most trans people figure out they are trans, is not really necessary to feel to be trans, and you definitely will not feel dysphoria over every little bit of yourself. Feeling euphoria over your gender is a much more clear sign for if your really trans or not.
Pain does not equal validation. Those who tell you otherwise do not feel good enough about themselves. You are always, ALWAYS, good enough. There's no reason to believe otherwise. Stay positive, love yourself, and ignore those who try to make your life that much more difficult
[deleted]
There is no “minimum suffering required” to be trans. You can love every part of your body and still want to transition. The persistent myth that we HAVE to suffer to EARN this is, in my opinion, one of the biggest harms to trans folk both in making their existence hell AND in stopping people from ever coming to terms with who they really are. 

TLDR: your mother is wrong. Tell her I said so.
Let me answer that woth another question that has the same answer.

Do you exist?

Again, the answer to this question also is the answer to your question.
I don’t experience much bottom dysphoria compares to everywhere else
You are completely valid, there's no one way to be trans and if she's not trans she wouldn't know that at all. No-one understands trans people more then trans people so we as a community decide what it's like and whether someone is trans. I'm non-binary but I sometimes have bottom dysphoria and that's completely fine because no matter what you feel or who you are you will always have the right to validation. 
I hope it ends well and she tries to understand:)
You see most people have this stupid idea of genitals = gender.  If you want to be the girl you are but still keep what's down there, it's totally fine.  For me, it more depends if you feel gender euphoria from being trans and accepting who you are and not so much about dysphoria
Just going to put [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vcg2oj/a_helpful_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here as a friendly reminder
If I don't get bottom dysphoria and I am valid then so are you! You are valid!

You don't need dysphoria to be valid, just be you! For you are amazing!
No human existence and identity is defined by suffering, misery and self-hatred.

If you don't supress your emotions, you're not a real man, if you don't or didn't suffer from absurd and impossible beauty standards, you're not a real woman and if you aren't miserable from dysphoria, you're not really trans.  

/s
Others do not get to police your dysphoria.
Yes. You are who you are.
You don’t need bttm dysphoria to be transgender. If you aren’t comfortable being the gender you were born with. I’d say non binary or genderfluid is different and had their own labels . But I can see why she would think certain things aren’t true . This one person for instance. Asks me if I like ftm because they’re ftm . I look at their profile and they have non binary with they pronouns. Ftm is female to male and I don’t see anything of their part to try to make besides they them pronouns. So if you’re a certain label own it and don’t change for others
You. Are. Valid.
I've been really afraid of this as well tbh lol
TBH that part of your transition is none of your mother’s business
100% valid
you don't need gender euphoria or dysphoria to be trans, both ideas are medicalist. both can be signs but your trans identity is yours and always valid, whether you have them or not
You're still totally valid. If anyone says you aren't trans because you don't have bottom dysphoria they're just wrong.
I read the title and instantly went YES!!! I barely have any bottom dysphoria at alllllll and it’s not like there’s just one way to be trans, you can be trans and not even experience dysphoria because everyone is different
mane you just are who you are
Are you afraid that because you don't feel bottom dysphoria you are faking it? Are you afraid you are faking it for the attention? If so, what kind of attention would faking it give you and do you want that?
Trans does require gender dysphoria but it does not require bottom dysphoria. Just dysphoria for your assigned at birth sex. If you have dysphoria for that you are still Trans. Gender dysphoria and euphoria are required for being Trans. So yes you are trans don't worry about it. Imposter syndrome is totally a thing.
You are valid regardless of anything. You are a human deserving of respect. Love yourself, love each other.
yea
This is pretty much how I feel. I ain't even doing HRT, because I like my dick so much. Hoping laser, ffs and a boob job, will do everything I need and want it to.
Screw labels! Just be who you are and be happy.  What anybody else says doesn't invalidated you.  To hell with words this is your journey.
Honestly, your mom has no idea what she's talking about.  You can be trans without any dysphoria of any sort. Now, I suspect that the vast majority of us do experience it over one facet of ourselves (or many!) but it's a very individual thing. General rule of thumb for whether you are 'really trans' or 'trans enough' is, ""Do YOU believe that you are trans? If that's a yes, then you probably are. Being  different in society is never easy and we're under an especially nasty wave of hate at the moment. If your heart and brain tells you that this is your truth despite all that, then honey you are trans.
So as someone who’s dealing with this issue from the other side as my sister is trying to transition to a guy and I’m having a super hard time with it I’m gonna give my advice but by no means am I saying it’s right because I don’t fucking know what to think but I will say this… and i hope I don’t offend… I mostly don’t understand the need so many people feel to transition because I truly have plenty of self image issues and had depression for a while and still do sometimes because I don’t look the way I want or feel I should especially because I went bald early which really sucked for years but I think most people except for the truly aesthetically blessed model type people we all struggle with self image issues which k think for most(just how I see it) that’s what it boils down to and k believe acceptance is definitely good and important but being brutally honest I think many people think they have gender dysmorphia when they do t and it’s just struggling with self image and not being the pesos. We want to be and it makes us desperate for change in many ways which some people they feel like that’s a transitions. Now trying to speak from maybe how your mom is feeling a bit or at least maybe something you should think about,at least how i feel about my sister is… your mom truly probably lives and respects you as you are naturally and the person you’ve already grown tk be and wishes you would see more of your good traits in who you are in the inside and it probably hurts he that you feel you need to change who you are physically just to feel better when it’s such a drastic change and if your doing hormones or surgery it’s mostly permanent or semi permanent. How I feel about my sister is I’ve spent 28 years growing with her and live who she is right now and hate that she doesn’t live herself on the outside as much as k live her in the jnside and Ben g honest I think her feel g the need to transition is more about other issues about herself she doesn’t know how to cope with and conquer and also wants to be apart of the whole community because it’s a very accepting community but acceptance and short lived acceptance from strangers doesn’t typically help the core issue. I won’t rant but my honest advice… try and be who you want to be 💯 but don’t dk the hormones or make and permanent decisions esprit your younger like 20s and definitely not if your under 18. You have plenty of time to truly decide if that’s what you want and if you look wierd or off tk some people in “society” who fucking cares… it may be tough sometime moment tk moment but society’s opion means jack shit… for most people your close family and friend are the ones that truly live you respect you and know the person you truly are… strangers don’t and will say a lot of things to be nice but it’s not a genuine love like your mom probs it has. Just my advice
Yes. Totally yes. I am engaged to a person who I think is both male and female. Totally male when male. Totally female when female. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Doesn’t matter to me either way but zero genital change and zero confusion. 

Be who you are baby. You are female even if it’s just your insides and you change nothing else.
Your valid! There's nothing wrong with being happy with yourself and you don't have to have major surgery to fit in anyone's definition. I have no plans for any surgeries, dental implants sucked enough
the belief that a trans woman needs to get bottom surgery to be truly trans seems to be a cis centered mentality/ideology. you don’t need to conform to cis women to be a woman or to be trans in general. cis women are not the “standard”. there are plenty of trans girls that never get bottom surgery and don’t experience bottom dysphoria, so do what makes you happy and feel comfortable in YOUR body!
You are valid no matter where you are at and what you have figured out.  We are all trying to figure out who, what, and where we are in our journey.  I don't think it ever really stops.
I'm ftm and I also don't experience bottom dysphoria, I also don't want surgery down there. It is common that trans people don't want  surgery or don't have dysphoria in some parts of their bodies
I think that’s actually not uncommon. A lot of people don’t experience bottom dysphoria specifically
ofc it is darling <33
I know, personally, so so so many trans people who are undeniably men/women/enbies who don't have bottom dysphoria or want bottom surgery. I've lived in a female social role for almost a decade and personally I could go either way with how I feel about my junk. Ill probably end up wanting bottom surgery in the near future but I don't have like hyperventilating, crippling reactions towards my privates, I more just feel inconvenienced by it.
She is wrong.

I have a cishet friend who dresses exactly like my brother in law. Khaki cargo pants or shorts and a big shirt. Always. Is she less female somehow? Ugh. This hurts and infuriates.


I had no *awareness* of bottom dysphoria until I began my transition last Feb. Now I'd be on a table tomorrow if I could.

Your brain can only take so much trauma and as you relieve some of the layers, others come into mind view.

And by began my transition I mean having the conversation with my not soon enough ex wife and actually beginning to try acting and dressing as I felt instead of as a boybot using ""movement macros"".
The dysphoria I get is more like detachment or apathy. I neglected myself because I don't identify with my (AMAB) body. 

Now I get euphoria from every new change I notice.

Already have a few bras. Can't wait till I follow them out more.

Never noticed my dysphoria for many years specifically because it was so a typical.

Also dysphoria might hit you later. Or not at all.

Either way it is your decision not hers.

Thank your mom for challenging you and asking you to do some introspection. Then explain how you feel again.
Absolutely! Having any sort of dysphoria isn't required to be trans, and anyone who says otherwise is stuck in a really old way of thinking. Hell, I don't have a ton of bottom dysphoria, at least not as much anymore
You don't have to have any dysphoria. My girlfriend doesn't, but she's still very much trans.
Of course it is! I don’t experience bottom dysphoria either!
Yes. Period.
Valid
Yes. It never bothered me and I’m never getting it ✂️
Of course it is! Gender dysphoria is still gender dysphoria, even if you don't experience dysphoria about your private parts! You are still valid! Being trans is different for everyone and not everyone will experience dysphoria around different parts of their body! No matter where or what your dysphoria is or isn't focused around doesn't matter because it's still gender dysphoria! I wish you the best of luck with any and all steps you take in your transition and always remember that you and your identity are valid!
No type of dysphoria is ""required"" to be trans, even though it is commonly talked about. The most important thing is gender euphoria. Does being a girl make you happier than being a boy? Yes? Then you're trans! And that's all there is to it :D
I'm the same, just FTM. I don't really think about my genitals like that, I guess. I don't have that kinda connection to it. It's just there and as long as everything is healthy amd not trying to reproduce, I'm good. Also, with how FTM bottom surgery is rn, I don't wanna rush it. I sadly feel like my top surgery was a rushes mistake, so I'm taking my time on this one.

There's not *one way* of being trans. We're all on different paths
Dysphoria when it comes to your gender is typically in relation to how you want yourself to be seen in the context of gender identity vs how others choose to see you based of societal fuckery. Not every trans person is going to have bottom dysphoria; uniformity in relation to such a complex situation and journey is Foolish™️
Yes.
Yeah
100% you're still trans
I’m the same way tbh. You’re perfectly valid, gender=/=genitals
She's wrong.
Totally valid :) i only have testicle dysphoria and thats the only part i wish was gone which will be soon i hope.

Dysphoria isnt the end all be all. If you feel incongruent with your gender identity. Basically still dysphoria but the bits dont matter. Most of us are trying to normalize girls with the penis, not everyone fights for that but i think its fine since it puts people in boxes by forcing all of us to have bits that all match others that have the same gender identity to bits. But i dont think its right to force us to cut our bodies to fit that narrative. I dont need surgery to be loved.
I had heavy bottom dysphoria before I was on hrt and then it completely went away after being on it for a while. I still plan on getting bottom surgery eventually, but by your mum's logic I wouldn't be trans because I don't constantly feel displeasure at what's in my pants. 

Frankly it's a stupid opinion, because I know for a fact that if I stopped taking hormones I would be too miserable to live, and not hating my crotch doesn't make me less trans.
Fuck yeah! If you wanna be a girl with a dick, you go be a girl with a dick!
Yup. You're valid. 

I'm boutta go into something deeply personal that involves sexuality, please skip if it makes you uncomfortable.

I don't know if I experience bottom dysphoria or not. I have trouble telling, because I love masturbation and am used to that with female genitalia. It is quite possible that I am simply afraid of not knowing how to do that. I definitely wish I had a dick, but it's just weird for me to think about masturbating with one. I'm stupidly horny, and I'm sure that when I'm older, I'll have a better time figuring it out. 

Sorry for divulging into something weird like that, I just needed to share it.
Absolutely you are valid I don’t experience bottom dysphoria at all. I actually like that part about being AMAB 🤦🏻‍♀️
Yea

It’s valid

You’re real, met many other non op people who very much like having a dick, have one as a partner
I (ftm) don’t have bottom dysphoria either, you don’t need bottom dysphoria (or any dysphoria for that matter) to be trans
Incoming r/truscum users “uM aCtUaLlY yOu nEeD dYsPhOrIa tO bE tRaNs sO uR jUsT a TrEnDeR”
This is a message to all my brothers, sisters and nb siblings. For all of you who don’t have bottom dysphoria I am really glad. It is such a terrible experience that I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemies. You don’t need any form of dysphoria to be trans. As long as you are not satisfied with your agab that is kinda the only “requirement”. I want you to know that you don’t need to have a debilitating incongruences with your body, ie you don’t need dysphoria. The worst of all I would say is bottom dysphoria: basically falling into a depressive state for an hour or so cause I needed to go to the bathroom, that is what that feels like. Being trans is just a feeling and it doesn’t need to be caused by negative feelings surrounding your body. You are valid no matter what. All you need is just pursue what makes you happiest.
To me, yes
yep
Is my trans identify valid..YES! Next question pls
Dysphoria can be *a* sign, but not *the* sign. Because gender and sex (and pretty much everything else about the body come to think of it) are completely unrelated, you can be perfectly content without bottom surgery and still be trans. I get the feeling, correct me if I’m wrong, that your mother doesn’t know jack shit about trans issues and will never have to experience what you and lots of others here have.  
  
Long story short, your mom is just trying to cause you guilt and grief for being who you are.
I never thought of it this way! I've also never heard the term gender euphoria, thank you for the different perspective (^-^*)
Thank you so much! I'll be sure to check out these articles :)
Saving this comment to look back on when I feel unsure of my identity <3
[removed]
And you certainly don't need bottom surgery to 'complete' or fully be trans.
Fascinating, why do so many people have a differing mentality? This idea of what you become makes sense to me, but my mom can't seem to grasp it :/
Literaly all of this ^^^^ ❤️❤️❤️
[removed]
Thank you for your words! I appreciate the support, but, how am I to ignore my own mom? She's basically my only friend, and regardless of her transphobia, I don't know what id do without her
Thank you for this perspective! However, I find the words ""girldick"" and ""boypussy"" to be extremely humorous haha maybe it's my internal 12 year old...
[removed]
Well it's good to know I'm not the only one! But no Russians? I'm Russian though :(
Thank you for the kind words! I do have a quick question, how do you get the little flag under your username? I've seen a couple people with them and Im so curious!!!
Haha I love this! You are a good person random internet stranger! :)
You don’t need to be miserable or self-hating to have dysphoria. That’s a really gross generalization over something people can’t help.
Same
euphoria is the only measure of transness
no you don't.
Hard to say. Maybe she has an outdated view on what trans people are (very possible, given how little the overwhelming majority of the population understands trans issues). 

She may also be moving the goalposts to avoid admitting (either to you or to herself) that you’re trans. 

I can’t really say for sure, but putting your foot down and declaring your identity, not as something for her to question (because that’s not something she can do. Your identity is your own), hopefully would get her to come around. I can’t say for sure though.
People fear change, and transition is such a *radical* change that even people not experiencing fear it.

To them, they can't conceive making such a huge change without there being something untenable otherwise driving it.

To most cis people, I think the idea of an existential agony (dysphoria) gives them *kind* of an idea why. So many people have said ""VaeVictoria, you were *so* sad and miserable before, and we see that you're *so* much happier now. We don't understand the specific pain, but we saw the pain it caused. Your transition makes sense"".

And some people (conservatives) lack empathy so much that they just can't believe it at *all*.
This ^
I'd say that you should agree to disagree, just make sure both of you understand that you disagree, and won't let it get in the way. For example; regardless of your beliefs, if a serious problem arises like a nuke (as an extreme but obvious example), it doesn't matter how she feels about it if she's out of the blast radius. See it's a problem for you because you're the one dealing with it, all she has to do is help a little. Like, say you want underwear. All she has to do is buy it for you, what does it matter if she likes the underwear?
Also, even if you were just a crossdresser, then you still want the underwear, and she can help. Once again, she doesn't need to be thrilled by the idea. I'd say you tell her that if she really disagrees or doesn't like it, then she should think of it as a form of dedicated hobby to make it easier.
Most of all, whatever you do, don't be impolite. It's not that you're trying to get her sympathy or empathy by coming off as pleading, it's just important that she knows you're not attacking her or demeaning her. If she gets offended that you disagree, then... well, there's no easy solution.
Unless of course you bribe her by making a deal where she gets something out of it, but save that for if she's stubborn in not helping.
I wish you luck, and I hope she's trying to understand you and not change you. Good luck 🌈
You are 100% valid. You feel how you feel. I have had zero surgeries and not on HRT, with few plans for either. I still feel 100% like a woman, and I'll allow no one to tell me otherwise.
That's ok too! The language around people's parts can differ from how they feel about those parts of their bodies too :) Like maybe, the words might not be comfortable to use even if the actual part of the body doesn't cause dysphoria
Excuse me? That's so harsh, why are you saying that?
Dw its just a reference to a fucked up mission in a call of duty game from over a decade ago
You go to the r/trans subreddit, then click on the 3 dots next to the search bar and go to: ""change user flair"". I do it on an Android phone so I don't know if it works the same on another device but I hope it does.

You’re the one that understands the situation though. Just know that you *are* valid and you *are* trans (or even if you aren’t, that’s fine, you should just be able to be happy. It’s just that that points towards being trans), that’s not for her to question, especially if she doesn’t have an open view to how a trans person can go about their life.
Fascinating, thank you for this perspective! Is there a way I can describe my need to transition?
I see! Thank you for the advice. Hopefully in due time I can repair our relationship, I just don't like to choose between two things I love (her or my identity). Till next time kind internet person
[removed]
That makes sense haha, I just thought it was funny
Lucky, I have an Android too! And now I have a little flag :) how cool
not true
you don't.
Thank you so much! This is an interesting perspective, and a lot to ponder about. I have trouble processing emotional/social information, so perspectives like this really help me to understand the situation, and handle it in a way I can understand. I really appreciate it
I think others have nailed it. It makes you feel *better*. You feel *more* like you, and that's what matters.

Because in the end, it's *your* body, and you should have the autonomy to be who *you* are.
Well, you don't know anything about me, you haven't even asked if I'm trans. I'm not just some cis person lurking around trans forums. I would never use those terms to describe an individual trans persons body unless they asked me to, I used them here because they are terms that some trans people find empowering. Obviously, if someone does experience bottom dysphoria then these terms aren't going to work, but that wasn't the context of this post.

PLEASE tell me you’re joking. i don’t actively have bottom dysphoria but it feels really good to pack. you don’t get to tell people they aren’t trans just because they don’t fit into your little mold
why are you trying to force dysphoria on people? why do you WANT trans people to experience that? not everyone is gonna experience it, and trying to make them seem like they're faking it is bullshit.
Language that helps people is not disgusting, and I never refered to genitals in a sexual context.
[removed]
no you're not. you can be trans without dysphoria. you're trying to force dysphoria on people and it's disgusting.

My friend is transphobic	"I came out as a demi boy to my friends today and one of them didn't take it too well. First he said he was confused and after a LONG time explaining it to him, he said ""Sometimes I think a nuclear apocalypse wouldn't be so bad after all."" He always acted like the stereotypical cishet straight white boy that likes guns and thinks gay is an insult, but I didnt think he actually was... 

The rest of my friends are bi and pan and he's cool with them so i guess its just trans people he hates. Now I regret the whole thing and I'm dreading going to school tomorrow."	"unfriend him. he is not a good person.
I get being confused at first. It takes some time to proccess sometimes but that comment... Damn! He definitely doesn't sound like a good friend.
Ahem. 
My former friend***
What kinda brainless dickhead has such a vast emptiness in his head that he thinks a nuclear fucking apocalypse is a better alternative to having to think for more than 5 seconds about something he hasn't known about before? And how similarly atrocious are these other people that hang out with a guy like that WHILE BEING QUEER THEMSELVES?? Overall, horrible situation, please consider taking these people out of your life ASAP.
What a shitty thing to say! I would've just been like ""well damn fuck you too then"" people like him do not understand the gravity of what they saying in ""jest"" and aren't worth spending time with. I hope you can stop being friends without it causing too much drama. I remember unfriending people in high school lmao it wasn't always pretty but always made me feel a lot better. Keep your chin up kid and fuck that guy
i agree with urkittyprincess. don’t continue to associate with him or your “friends” compliant with his hate. they aren’t real friends if they aren’t willing to stick up for you. i’m sorry you have to deal with this; i hope you find your people soon. you should feel safe around your friends, not regret for sharing something personal about yourself.
Sorry you have to deal with that 💜 ur identity is totally valid and he's a dumbdumb :)
Kick his ass.
He just showed you who he is. It's up to you, but I'd end that ""friendship"".
He does realise that everyone suffers not just from a nuclear apocalypse but also from ignorance. You will always limit your own potential by taking in negativity like this. Be proud to be yourself and don’t let anyone think they are important enough to stop you. You are the most important person in your life and you’ve got to make sure your being treated fairly.
Op you don't have to feel bad about the experience, unfortunately we all come across 1 person who will be like that, to be fair that is there problem as they are damaging a very good friendship, it dose not matter to them who you are true friends rise above that, when I came out as trans I had 2 people who were so negative towards me thennthey went there own way, I look at it as its there loss, my true friends stick by you xx

I wouldn't loose sleep over it, I do understand that you have to have contact with this person maybe just let them know that your life has no bearing or impact on there life and life itself is too short xx
Maybe, just maybe, his parents are pretty right and have instilled some transphobia in him. 

Otherwise, I'd definitely unfriend him.
The laboratory nurse in the clinic I go to became friendly with me and get used to my new name and always makes a compliment on my look but there’s one thing - she keeps saying “good boy”. She’s such a cute lady I don’t even mind.
Man what a sack of shit
That's definitely not someone who should be your friend. If your other friends can't kick that asshole to the curb, then you'll definitely need new friends.

I know it sucks breaking off from friends, but you're better off alone than with people who aren't interested in being kind to you.
I personally would talk with him but that's because i'm an idiot, soooo just unfriend him, talk with your other friends, tell them what happened and don't dread going to school, all will go well :)  
It's just a terrible person no worries, many more will come and many more will go
If you explained this to him and he's still saying transphobic stuff then I would honestly just cut him out of your life.  It's mentally draining to have negative people around all the time,  especially those who think trans people don't have a right to exsist or those who think something is ""wrong"" with us.   They won't change their mind most of the time and it just gets worse.  

I hope things work out for you though.  Stay safe.
My friend kinda just did the same thing, I kinda hinted at being trans and I've never seen him look at anyone with such disgust. I know hr loves and cares about me, so I'll come out to him when I feel like he is ready to accept me.
It's really up to you and how you want to deal with it. If you want to try and salvage it, maybe educate him or send him some videos. Contra Points is a good resource especially if you're trying to convert someone like him. If he's too resistant or just unwilling, or hateful then whatever friends come and go it's not worth keeping around people that are unwilling to learn and grow.
i rly hope your whole friend group expresses their stance against transphobia with this other friend… otherwise, i know it’s hard (i’ve been in a similar situation) but for your own mental health going forward, i think you should cut them all off :(
i think you should definitely cut him off and any other friend that enables him. you dont want people like that in your life. if you ever (i really hope not) get hatecrimed they will most likely not help you or might even make it worse. i would think about the long run and how its beneficial or not to stay friends with them. theres 8 billion people in this world and a whole bunch of people that will accept you with open arms. dont settle for crap friends because its more convenient. you deserve a good support circle and i dont think youre gonna get that from your current friends.
If your friend is transphobic he's not your friend. Simple as that.
Don't let his ignorance affect your happiness!!  Easier said then done I know, but you are valid and he's just a jerk 💜💕💜
This his problem, not yours! Are you sure he’s not gay? Sounds like a drama queen to me.
[removed]
He doesn’t know how to take it!
To quote everyone else, and to reiterate the most important part of the whole thing: ""no, that's not your friend""
might be that he thinks gender fluid is “too far” or something. definitely tell him it’s not cool and it made you feel shit, communication is key if we want people to stop acting shitty
41 per..... Aaaaaghhhkkk
I was so shocked at his comment I hurt my jaw😂 but I'd just throw the whole friendship out. When I came out as genderfluid I had some friends who didn't support me which I really didn't expect but as hard as it was I just couldn't let people get away with treating me like that to my face. I also had a friend who had always supported the LGBTQ+ community but said something homophobic and when I tried to tell them that it was offensive they said I was wrong cos they were friends with a gay guy and he said it was fine, eventhough I'm gay but apparently my opinion didn't matter and it got to the point that I couldn't be friends with him. Just shows you how anyone can be offensive no matter how supportive you thought they were.
Unfriend
“I think all of us dying in one of the most horrific ways possible is preferable to other people asking me to think about the feelings of other human beings for one second”

Sounds like an asshole
Doesn’t sound like much of a freind
I say this quote from my friend with as much niceness as possible: F that guy and his horse and anyone who looks like him or his horse!
As an avid pro2A white cishet (not entirely sure what that is but im assuming it has something to do with being cis and straight) American I can say without a doubt that it's a very vocal minority that are actually like this. I am currently talking to a girl who I found out was trans, and am working on building a relationship with her because she is amazing, she makes me feel like I matter, and if it wouldn't be weird to say it (and if I thought that it wasn't just my poor past with relationships and feeling that if I don't say the 3 word phrase early and first it'll never be said) I'd tell her the magical 3 word phrase

ETA: fuck him. He's a bad friend, but if you'd like a pro2a friend who isn't an ass 👋🏻 I could always use another friend
You shouldn't regret learning that he's not your friend.  That's s very good thing to know.  Now your life can move on without him as an impediment.
I love you exactly the way u are.
I'll have to talk to the friend group cause apperantly they knew that he was transphobic from the start. Or at least 1 of them did.
He was definitely the one to say some controversial stuff but I always thought he was joking in the end. Now I look back and think mabye he wasn't joking...
In their defense, I dont think some of them knew he was transphobic. He was kind of a sketchy person when it came to talking about the LGBT community cause he never gave a clear standing on weather he supported us or not. Also, I'm not trying to defend the person who knew cause I do think that was kinda fucked up that she didn't tell me before hand.
""I think I would prefer untold billions suffer and die in unimaginably terrible ways to empathizing with someone I know and doing the bare minimum to help them be more comfortable and happy in life.""   


Absolute garbage-fire of a person.
Anti intellectualism and its consequences
From what I've heard. His mom is an asshole so she might have ""brainwashed"" him into thinking that is true. I'm waiting to see how my friends react tomorrow but I'm definitely not talking to him anymore.
Tf does that even mean?
if they’re all ok with him being transphobic you need to get rid of all of them. idk why people are willing friends/side with their oppressors.
There's Difference between knowing and suspecting. If they suspected, maybe time to see where there loyalties lie moving forward. If they knew, time to move forward without them.

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It sucks. All of us here know just how bad it can be. Being any form of trans is incredibly harrowing even with a support system. But if you have a great group of friends and or family, it can make life easier.

Let me be VERY clear when I say that IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING TO CHANGE THEM! YOU WON'T CHANGE THEM! I promise you won't. For people to change and become accepting of trans folks takes a very long road of self reflection.

I'll share my story briefly even though I've hidden it from everyone until now. I used to be transphobic. Now, mind you, I was never ""nuclear apocalypse"" transphobic, but I was in the ""you can't change biology, but as long as you're not around me then whatever"" crowd. It took me making a stupid comment on Facebook about trans youth (sub 10 years old) and my aunt breaking it to me that if she was born 10 years later, I would be talking to my uncle instead for me to actually start thinking about it critically.

So I spent years deliberately seeking out trans people on forums and speaking to them and learning their experiences to learn that my transphobia was internalized. It's kinda like back in the day (I'm old lol) they used to say if you were homophobic that you were closeted, and in my case, I was egged.

Point is, dude's not gonna change anytime soon. You're best to move on, and if your friendship was important to him, he'll do the work himself and find you later. Chances are he won't though. People like that have very little want or capability for change.
I am not defending him or taking any side. I don’t know you. But in my experience if you have a group and one person says it’s them or me it usually goes the way you don’t want.
Ignore them.  They're trolling.
Sometimes you can quite tell until directly confronted with it. I thought one of my friends was vaguely transphobic, but he’s otherwise a solid guy. When I came out, his reaction was “well, you know I’m sceptical of the whole thing, but if it makes you happy, it’s none of my business”, and I can live with that.
I was transphobic in highschool too. Im a tad younger (I think) so I was in 10th grade right around the gamergate anti-sjw thing, and as someone who cared a lot about video games and grew up in a very small, very white, very conservative town, I got sucked in.

Same sort of deal with you, my opinions on trans people were basically ""I think its silly, but you do you I guess."" I got off the pipeline when they started taking shots at immigrants and POC. I was young so it was easy to colour my thoughts about things I hadn't thought about, but I knew at my core that these were bad people once I started seeing that.

Uni gave me the chance to be better. It took another year of really being exposed to the right ideas and people to actually become supportive. Then another year and a bit to get into a situation where I was finally fulfilled. Then... uh oh. Uh oh. Something isn't right. Whats wrong? I finally have everything, why am I not happy? Why have I never been happy?

Surprise, Im trans! So thats been a fun realization in my last year of school lmao. I think about the fact that 10th grade me would outwardly hate me but silently envy me a lot. A part of me totally knew back then, I just repressed the heck out of it. 

But again, keep in mind OP, it took 3-ish years for me to actually be supportive from a place that seems way less radical than your friend. Maybe you or someone else could point him in the right direction to have his mind changed, but the only person who can really take him on that journey is himself.
Had a very similar experience recently with someone I’ve played Table top games with for years who I felt would be a problem. 

After coming out publicly the first thing I heard regarding him was how he was worried I wouldn’t want to game with him anymore. I think his biggest problem is he’s never been around a trans person with any regularity.

When I talked with him after hearing that I decided I could work with this. He said a few things that I’m filling away and potential issues, but it’s that thing where someone’s nebulous ideals you never actually have to apply to reality gets tested by the reality of having a friend who’s openly trans. Thor ideals start to falter because you now have to apply these ideals to someone you actually know and care about and it feels real bad.

That or he shows he’s not actually a good person and the friendship is over. Win/win for me haha."	tsqdst	trans	644	0.98	2022-03-31 03:09:34
I Cut off my Mom	"Hi. This is long. I just needed to get it out.

A little background, my mother and I have always been close. We rarely went 2 weeks without talking. I've lived all over the world, and we have always kept in touch regularly. When she comes to visit (she's out of state), she stays with me. She visited in late April 2022...

She's the first person I came out to, end of April 2022. I cried and asked if she would still love me if I was a man. She cried and said ""I see your soul, I will always love you."" I hadn't come to accept that I was a trans man yet, I thought maybe NB? I started to explore my transition options (binder, haircut, masc nickname). We still talked regularly.

FF to end of May. I'm shopping for clothes and not having a great time. Called my mom for support, she says, ""you could just be a woman with short hair and men's pants."" All I could think was, No, I cant. I'm not a woman. If I needed another ah-ha moment... there it was.

We stopped talking as much, definitely didn't talk about my transition bc she seemed uncomfortable with it. She did say that if I tell anyone, I should tell them in person, its respectful.

Beginning of July, I call her. She's a couple states away so in person isn't really viable, so video chat instead. I tell her, I'm a trans man. I go by Davis. I use he/him pronouns. She cries. Says it will be an adjustment, but she loves me and wants to be supportive. In the same conversation my step dad walks in, asks who she's talking to... I get deadnamed and misgendered. She didn't even attempt to explain that I have a new name.

Throughout July, I come out to my family. My brothers and my father. Two brothers are fine, then one refuses to acknowledge it at all. Not denial but refusal. I cut him out of my life. He called our mom. Mom called me. We had a huge argument. It ended with her needing time to 'mourn her daughter'. And I figured I'd just give her space.

I told my dad 2 days later. He was surprisingly ok? Like he doesn't agree, but he'd rather have a relationship with me this way than no relationship. To him, I ""used to be his daughter but thinks he's a guy now"" (quoting my sister in law from a conversation yesterday). And considering my very conservative father... I'll take it. He at least gets my name and pronouns right. Yes, its a very low bar.

I was surprised my mother didn't call me to see how it went with my dad (dad and I have never had a great relationship), but figured she's still upset so let it go.

4 weeks and 1 day from our argument, she contacts me.

She said my dad has been trying to call me all month but I keep blocking his calls. (aside: I'm not blocking his calls, I talked to him, he has 2 numbers stored for me and keeps calling the wrong one.. I've had the same number for 8 years). And she says that she was afraid to contact me because my dad having blocked calls must mean that I've blocked everyone. And here's the run down of her discussion with my dad:

Dad: deadname blocks my calls

Mom: I don't know why she would do that

Me listening to this from her: I don't know why \*she\* would do that either... I thought \*she\* was dead, since you are mourning \*her\*.

Mom: what?

Me: You are mourning \*her\*, you said so. I'm not sure how a dead person is blocking calls.

Mom: I'm talking about you!

Me: I get that, but I'm a guy.

Mom: You are a woman.

Me: Ok, <moms legal first name here>

Mom: Don't disrespect me like that! I am your mother!

Me: Don't disrespect me like that! I am a man!

Mom: You cant make me change my core beliefs!

Me: I wish you a happy life Mrs. <moms legal last name here>.

Then I hung up.

\---

So TLDR: She said she will always mourn her daughter. And that I am a woman and cannot change that and cannot change her core beliefs. She said its disrespectful to try to force this on her and change her beliefs. I'm guessing she doesn't see the irony that she's disrespecting me at every turn.

I was wondering, AITA? But I don't think I care anymore, I'm mostly I'm just tired of her shit.

Edited for formatting."	"This triggered something within me because I recently came out as trans and have had similar experiences with my family. I am so sorry that you are going through this, it is never easy to cut off someone, especially immediate family. 

I want to tell you that I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself and setting boundaries. You did the right thing, and even though it's difficult, please stand in your strength. You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother. If she cannot respect you and your identity, she does not need to be in your life. You deserve to be surrounded by people who accept you for who you are. Lots of love from a fellow trans 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
You're not the AH here. I had to cut of my so called ""father"", but more a lack of question. Kinda similar like what you told. He just refused to use my proper name and she/her. We haven't talked in soon 5 years.

VERY much on your side in this. Our sides in this.
Fucking hell. Somewhere along the line she forgot you weren't her property.
I don't think you're an AH. You didn't ask her to completely come around. You gave everyone leniency and patience. And even those not accepting you, you continued to give time and space so they might eventually fully come around. Your boundary is that they have to at least try to respect you. And your mother refused that. So you cut her off.   

I came out to my dad 7 weeks ago. I asked him to start using my name and pronouns about 3 weeks ago. He hasn't yet. But he's getting a therapist to work through all of this. He keeps telling me ""I'm not ok with this."" And it sucks because he and I were close. But I always knew he was transphobic, though he of course didn't think he was. And if he doesn't come around in the next few weeks, I'll be cutting him off as well.  

I'm out to almost everyone in my life now and I'm not going to spend time with people who won't respect me for who I am. I don't care what their excuses are. By not using my name or pronouns, you're reminding me of how I was born. Something I can't control, but something that hurts to think about. I need to move forward and I need to be the woman I should have been born as. And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.  

Being trans is hard enough without people being casual bigots around us.
You’re not the a**hole here. You can’t choose how they handle their stuff, but that doesn’t mean you have to just sit there and take the bull. I went through something similar with my mom a few weeks ago. They’re going to be in pain because we’re setting the boundaries we need, but there’s nothing to do except violate our own boundaries and mental health for them. Honestly kudos to you for being able to tell them that stuff over the phone 😂 I literally couldn’t and had to mail them a letter telling them I’d only talk to them on mail for now.
You must find the courage to leave the table
If respect is no longer being served

—Tene Edwards


I’m proud of you.
Very similar to how it went with my mom, apart from the last bit where she fully denied that you're a man and refused to change her core beliefs. But I did recently hear from my older brother (who accepts me completely), that our mom had said to him something along the lines of ""no wonder he's having mental health issues with the stuff (testosterone) he's he's putting in his body."" The mental health issues are completely unrelated to my transition and are something I've struggled with for years, even before I knew I was trans, and additionally tried to get help for in high school, but my mom kept me from seeing a therapist.

Suffice to say, it added to the pile of reasons to cease contact with her. I don't think I've fully decided and/or committed to it, but it's been well over a month since I last talked to her and whenever I think of calling I'm none too eager.

Good on you for making that call for yourself. Plenty of people will tell you that it was the wrong choice or that they would have done differently or that you should forgive her, but ultimately it's your life and you should not sacrifice your happiness for the sake of someone who does not respect you. If you feel your life would be better without her in it, then you made the right choice.
I cut my mother (and soon it’ll be all my family) out of my life completely years ago and I have no regrets, nobody should have to put up with being belittled, abused or whatever it is just because you share some stupid dna. I personally have much less anxiety and shit to worry about now and nothing will make me go back.
Fuck im sorry you had to deal with that. Its never good whenever either parents that aren't supportive. Whenever I came out to my mom she told my dad and then did nothing to help me. They didn't try to call me by the name i felt more comfortable with or gender me correctly. They wanted to act like I never said it
You have been patient and reasonable.

If people won't accept who you are and are happy to cause you pain and suffering in the process, cutting them out of your life is a completely valid way of dealing with that.

Maybe they'll learn from it, maybe they won't. You have to do what's right for you.

You don't know me, but I'm proud of you for standing strong.
i don't have much to add, but it was kind of jarring seeing your name because it was my deadname lmao. never met anyone else with it, its fun :)
‘Mourn her daughter?’ Huge red flag already just from that eesh. I hate people like that
Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning. It sounds like they have been pushed through their own transitions faster than they can either individually or collectively cope with. A month or so is just not remotely enough time. Hell, a couple of years at least is needed. Sadly, it sounds like these relationships have broken down badly.

For what it's worth, even giving family years doesn't ensure a better outcome. I was estranged from my father right up to his death and I'm now estranged from the rest of my family too. So happy endings are not the norm or even common.

Wishing you peace of mind with your decision to transition. That's the best you can hope for. Hugs.
>You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother.

Thank you. <3
🤣
>And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.

I keep being told that I'm choosing this. I'm choosing to be trans. I'm choosing this and making everyone else get in line or get out. \*sigh\*. 

Like, I didn't choose to be trans. I chose to start living as my true self, and you know BE HAPPY.

Good luck with your dad. I'm glad he's seeing someone. Its hard for us and its hard for them.
Yeah, I'm transitioning quickly. But I shouldn't have to sit thru purposeful disrespect just so they can have more time. I get that it's a change... but I'm being told they won't change at all and I don't see a reason to keep someone like that in my life. If in the future they can remember it's He not She, my door is always open.
""Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning.""

Not in my experience. My brother, who I fully expected to react badly, just started crying and apologising for all the hurtful things he probably said to me growing up. Five minutes later I was his sister who he would love, support and defend.

So the whole family requiring extra time because they are family is just bullshit. You're either accepting and love someone unconditionally or you aren't and would rather guard your own insecurities than support someone who really needs you.
I would even argue ""especially"" your mother. Sending you lots of love ❤️
Thanks.   

Yeah, I see the same situation constantly. Even those who support me often think I'm ""choosing"" something. Like, I'm really not. I'm just trying to be myself without extra stress and anxiety. It must be nice being totally comfortable in your own skin and having the right hormones coursing through your body. But I don't get that luxury. So I have to medically intervene.  

If legitimate medical treatment upsets you, then maybe you shouldn't have that pacemaker or that tumor removed? Maybe you shouldn't be on depression or anti-anxiety meds and take your chances with your blood pressure?  

I'm not ""making"" anyone do anything. I'm *asking* for the people who claim to love me to just respect me. Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss *you* off. Like, what a selfish thought pattern.
Remember to keep reiterating that to them... It's important. But you also need to give them a reason to want to make the transition too. No one accepts unwanted change willingly. After about 7 years I was able to talk with my mother again. My entire family blanked me for years after my transition. Unfortunately, the superficial vaneer she had painted over who I really am wasn't enough for me and the relationship subsequently broken down when I got married because she wouldn't attend my marriage. Same went for the rest of my family. Not a single family member attended my wedding. Zoe and I have been together since 2006 and married for the last 5 of those years. Yet my family can't accept who I really am even though I transitioned in 2003. That's a long, long time to accept who I am if they gave a shit. My point is, it's a tough road to walk and there just may not be enough between you and your family to pull you together again. I hope there is though because it's a cold stone in your heart if it isn't.
If you are in a supportive family... That is truly awesome for you! Sadly, the statistics put that as exceptional rather than the norm. Perhaps do some background research on family integration of transitioning family members.

Books like [this](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003001881-10/transitioning-families-butch-losey) for example.

Supportive families are becoming more 'common' but family transitions are still very much a thing. Typically with rejection of the transitioning family member so that the family unit can retain its world views.
>Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss you off.

Yep. In hindsight, I think my mom saying I should tell everyone in person, was almost a dare. Like, OH, they wont really do this. They wont REALLY tell their dad. And then I did. And I started on T.

I told her about T, she didn't ask about how it would affect me, she asks, have you had any side effects yet? Like, wtf? I'm thinking she might have read that terf book about FtMs.

Like if someone is getting medical treatment, you ask, how are you feeling? not, any side effects yet?
>give them a reason to want to make the transition too.

How about, they love me?
But I’m not in a supportive family. I will likely never speak to my parents again. My point was that whether or not a relationship is familial has no relevance for how long they need to adapt. 

People either love and accept us unconditionally or they don’t - its that simple.

I also don’t require education on transitioning and family. I have lived it thanks.
My dad has yet to ask me if I'm happy. If I feel better. How the transition is going. It's just about how he can't accept it and can't call me his daughter and is worried what his parents will think.  

Luckily, he's pretty much alone so far. Him and his parents are likely to be the only ones in my life who aren't supportive. His wife (my stepmom), my sister, the rest of the family, my wife and her family, and all of my friends fully support me. So he can sit in a corner and mope alone when the holidays roll around I guess.
Yeah, if people 'actually' had unconditional love in the first place that would be a given. The truth is sadly, that unconditional love really means that you continue to live within the social framework that they live by. Transitioning throws that out of the window, so in their eyes, you broke the unwritten clauses in that 'unconditional love' contract. Also, very few parents and siblings actually do love unconditionally, even by their own terms of reference! Mostly, it's a veneer of convenience... Make of that what you will.
Then I can only wish the best for the future!
They really do think that we just drop a nuke into the center of our lives, for funsies. For the lolz. Because we were bored on a Tuesday. 

Wake up. Make Coffee. Be trans just to piss everyone off. LOL!
I prefer to be trans BEFORE my coffee bc then I'm extra moody about it.
I told my partner that coffee makes me less stabby. He was like, you're not functional before coffee (ie you cant be stabby). I was like, ok, it makes me more stabby? hahahahahaaaaaaaa!"	wo923r	trans	637	0.98	2022-08-14 15:30:24
MTF did I just start my period how is this possible	So yesterday my chest was super sensitive and it hasn't been like that in quite a while it's actually slightly painful now around 2:00 a.m. last night I suddenly started getting cramps that really were kind of weird they did not feel anything like constipation pain it wasn't the same sharp terrible pain it was like weird it was lighter but still noticeable it lasted for like 30 minutes and it did it again at work today this time the company with a headache I know it's not constipation it doesn't feel the same and I am quite regular am I I was talking to some girls and they're like saying I started my period And I think they're joking around but I can't explain it I think I'm really having a period but not bleeding is this possible	"I've been getting periods every month now, so yup its very possible, talked with my endo to make sure I was okay, and yeah everything's fine, just period cramps lol

You go girl! It sucks sometimes cuz pain but, I dunno if it's just me, but euphoria central when it happens :D
Some girls on HRT do experience period-like symptoms, so yeah it very much could be that that's the case.
For real? I could’ve sworn I noticed my mood change a little and my tits start hurting more then usual.  I asked my mom, she’s a nurse and is also taking estrogen for her historechtomy, but she said it probably isn’t possible 🤷‍♀️ 
Guess she’s wrong
For the folks who are skeptical, the hormone that causes period cramps isn’t made in a uterus, it’s made in the actual cells of the body, so for clarity, it isn’t produced by a gland. In addition, abdominal muscles play a huge role in period cramps. So, trans people on Estrogen, can have their bodies signal that it’s time for a period, and thusly get cramps. For me, the first day is terrible, but the consecutive days are bearable. 

I kinda panicked when it first happened, until I told my symptoms to my mother, partner, and doctor who all confirmed that they’re period cramps.
For me this is what I wanted since I was a very young child so literally sitting here with period Pains I could care less this is literally being a woman
Yup. Estrogen side effects On it currently. Was much milder pre hrt; have intersex characteristics but now it's intense. Before I felt more tired nauseated but could cope little to no issue felt 80 out of 100% for a few days once a month.

Last couple of days cramping, irritated, emotional, just want to sit eat chocolate/ice cream and cry because it's worse than usual and I feel fucking awful. Big girl pants on though because I need to work in a couple of hours and have to go.

I went yesterday it was hard. Had to lay down partly pms symptoms partly hernia causing hell. Chill evening fortunately. Hernia better today, pms symptoms calming but today won't be a cakewalk either.

I really feel for women now.
I mean, it makes sense from a biological standpoint. For estrogen producing people with a uterus, ovaries etc it's our hormones that determine when we get our periods and which trigger our muscles to constrict and for the uterine lining to fall off, so it would be too far off to imagine that your hormone levels changing and shifting could mimic that, and that in response your hormones would also trigger those muscles to cramp up because that's just how the body is wired, regardless of being amab or afab.

Take all this with a grain of salt though. I'm just making connections, I have no actual proof or anything to back it up.
That probably is the case, but you should check with a doctor just to be sure
awesome!  
curious though, cause i do kinda want period like symptoms (weird, ik) but about how long on E are you?
Damn girl, I empathise with the pains but I can’t help smiling as I’m waiting to join Team E myself, so happy for you! 💜
Right on ladies!!
Wow, that's wild! I never knew that could happen!
Periods are made up of multiple parts like PMS, intestinal cramping, uterine bleeding and I feel like I'm forgetting more. Not everyone gets every symptom, and each symptom can vary in intensity.
Welcome to girlhood! Meet Aunt Flo. She's a bitch. Lol
Yep, I have em every month, been happening since I started progesterone.
Can I just say that I hope I also experience this??? 

Hearing from all the other folx in the comments who apparently have had the same, and confirmed that they are indeed period cramps; I have weirdly wanted this for a long time. Ever since I came out when one of my gal friends or coworkers tells me they're on their period, I often say something like ""I'm really sorry, and as weird as this sounds, I wish I could relate."" 

A couple of times I've gotten back, ""You really don't."" To which I'm like. You have *no idea* how much I do. 

Does the pain suck? Absolutely. And I will not make light of it or try to downplay anyone's experience. But I so desperately want that affirmation of the experience only women (and FtM/FtXs) can have. I do not care that it'll hurt; I *want* to experience that pain because it'll be another point of euphoric affirmation that I'm in the *right body.* 

Grats to those of you who experience period symptoms and feel euphoric through it! Sorry about the pain; hope you're getting along okay. \^\^'
I’m actually afab so I don’t know much about this but I’ve heard that MTF people on HRT at some point might start experiencing period symotoms, so yes I think that’s normal
[deleted]
Yes it is possible if you're on hormones https://curvyandtrans.com/p/C4BD87/cycle-dynamics/
cramps can happen in pretty much any part of the body that has muscle. theres a lot of people who dont believe trans girls can have a period simply because we generally dont have a uterine lining, but thats only one part of uterus owners periods, and is largely a moot point in this situation. despite the fact that so many dont believe it, everyone has rough monthly hormonal cycles, including cis men, and with estrogen as your main hormone, thus affecting your body the way estrogen does, you can absolutely get many/most period symptoms.

it may be worth it to check in with a doctor to make sure theres nothing else more serious going on (completely random pains for no reason generally arent a good thing), but anyone who tells you trans women cant have periods are misinformed.
Yup, that’s HRT for you, periods are regulated by estrogens, and are now close to having typical level of those, so…
Having the pms bit of a cycle is possible yeah, its linked to hormones I heard and not really to the bottom anatomy, for a few months now (since starting hrt) been getting pms myself.
For me i get bloated af , and get liquid retention , and I just feel miserable, also my boobs get extra sensitive
Hit the nail on the head dear, welcome to the pain club.
Probably going to get down voted but, it's more like PMS and a cycle, a period/menstration is the actual act of shedding the lining of the uterus where blood would be involved. Tender breasts, cramps, mood swings are all PMS symptoms, so pre period symptoms essentially.  

Cycle, period, potato, patato. It's so cool trans girls have cycles and sync up with other folks tho, HRT really is amazing.
I was AFAB but for various reasons I can’t medically transition so I find myself in the weird position where I’m actually taking female hormones in the form of the pill solely to stop my periods as I was able to get hold of that. It’s very weird that each month I get all my usual period symptoms but no period, for me this is a huge help. So I think it’s perfectly possible that you are having a period!
Here I am a trans man who doesn’t even WANT cramps and somebody is celebrating it (totally light hearted) maybe I should just send mine over to you? 

Also congrats :)
Update: I started my second period
It's a little early about 2 days early my chest was a little sensitive prior bad pain on the first day nauseous took three Tylenol all I really had
You’re not on your period. It’s just coincidental things all concurring that are similar to period based things. Dont worry. Unless you are on those hormone things thst can produce estrogen in your body or reduce testosterone. Then you might be.
You get used to the cramps hun don't worry about it, get an old sock, fill it with rice, microwave it for a minute and put it on ur tummy
I'm almost a year in and have had a couple of periods, I'm tracking now to see if it's becoming a consistent cycle (I fucking hope not tbh xD) the abdominal pain I get is in my lower abdomen, just above the pubic region; bottom of my belly and it extends to my lower back. The pain itself is like being electrocuted for me. If you've ever had a TENS machine put on you and set too high, you know what my period pain feels like. No blood. Just insane pain and mood swings.
Yes estrogen therapy can lead to getting period symptoms each months (maybe contraceptive pills might prevent these as it sometimes works for cis women) 

Bleeding out shouldn't happen tho of course
Yes I checked with my doctor and she said it's reported to her by 15 percent of her MTF patients and she told me to get a heating pad some Motrin and just ride it out
Guess this is going to happen to me from now on weirdly I'm kind of smiling just thinking that pain or not this is euphoric as hell
I haven't had cramps but happened twice, 4-5 weeks apart that i had insane emotional fluctuations, being easily irritated, crying for nothing, feeling more socially starved than normal to the point of desperation and after a few days it just goes away. I can't say for sure it's pms symptoms, i need to keep track for longer, also only been on hrt for 6 months. My respect for cis women only goes up, going through that roller coaster every month for their entire life + pain I'm not feeling right now/yet? Holy shit these women are made of steel
Yeah my doctor flat out confirmed it she even gave me advice on how to deal
Meanwhile there is me, having my period cramps before even starting hrt idk why... (I might be intersex) the doctor who prescribed me the eustrogen said that it was just psychological (i started hrt and they are a bit more regular (less random) and less painful now)
I’m glad you’re feeling more feminine from this! The happiness transfems feel from period pains reminds me that such a commonly legitimately horrific and life ruining experience can be literally euphoric for some people
Free euphoria :D
mine used to be bad enough pre-hrt that i'd have two days a month most months where i wouldn't want to have sex (my fiancee didn't particularly believe me for some reason), but after on hrt, its different.  every month is some cramps... no partner so no idea if it would be even harder to have sex.  but i do now maybe 3 times a month need to lay down all day with a heating pad.
I have lol
She flat-out confirmed it even gave me some resources
5 months now
I'm more than ok sweetie
 one of the things that always bothered me was that I thought I would never get a period yes I know it's painful but it's part of being a woman it was just another reminder much more painful reminder I'm Trans but yes I'll take this for the rest of my life My name is legally Rebecca gender on my license is Female and now I'm having periods XD that person I never was that 'man' my family tried to force me to be is getting more and more farther away I have not felt this amazing in a long time
My doctor gave me a run down told me to get a a heating pad some Motrin or Tylenol and ride it out I can't believe I get to experience this XD why does this make me happy and tear up gender euphoria is awesome
I've been on estrogen injections progesterone finasteride for 5 months at 3 months my hormone levels were 309 e 15 t
Yeah my boobs got super sore which ended a few months ago and I had cramps i did feel a little gross feeling but also happy when my doctor confirmed this
Yeah I was really shocked by this but I'm actually pretty happy as weird as that sounds this is pretty euphoric
Read the other comments my doctor confirmed it there's actual evidence of this so sorry this is actually a hormone based thing and yes it is a period for all intensive purposes you even will get cycles the same way and can even sync with other cis women
She actually just emailed me some reading material about this I really am having periods holy crap
Euphoria gurls :D
most months the cramping is mild... 3 times a year (like a couple days ago) its worse and i need a heat pad and a good book.

i used a period tracker to confirm that i wasn't imagining things... still find it hard to believe even after confirming dates and reading the (fairly simple) science explaining why it happens.
I had pretty much that same thing last week, and it went away after a bit. I'm not sure if that's going to happen regularly though because it's the first time it's happened. I've been on estrogen for 3 months and spiro for 6 ish.
Cooool, science!!
Same. I started getting them at 11, and hrt made them more regular (and so much worse).
Wait, this is a thing!?

I have been getting regular monthly cramps since freaking middle school and I only started HRT last year at 30.
One person's trash is another person's treasure, etc.! :D
Could you share those resources?
Nice, i just hit 2 months a few days ago.
Hell yeah girl! Rock that euphoria!! So happy for you! 😄💕 I'm just a bit behind, hoping to join you soon. 😊

Same here. I've kind of heard it from a couple places but:  
""I'd rather be in pain than numb like I was before.""
Yeah, I posted that, then scrolled down, then felt really dumb lol. Congratulations. That’s means you’re pretty much having a real period
Let's go gamers
XD as much as that sucks its pritty validating, try some midol. It was what my sister recommended when I explained my symptoms and she was saying i had morning sickness or my period and thought it would be really interesting if it was the first one. LoL.
my guy may you never experience a period again! 

Let us trans gals take em instead xp
I got to be honest I am actually happy with this pain it's pretty dull it's not bad but I was told my other trans girls I was talking to that it can get heavier just like you know a normal cis period I downloaded a tracker and I'm going to start watching cuz I'm very curious as this is just fascinating that this is happening"	uhu048	trans	615	0.96	2022-05-04 00:19:08
i don't like it when my mom watches TV shows featuring trans characters	"it may sound a little weird, but let me explain

before my coming out my mom did not know too much about trans people, only the basic info most people her age possess.

i came out only a few months ago and realized that i am trans, or to be more specific was able to label what had felt so off about my existence all those years, only 2-3 years ago. i am ftm and as a kid i liked the typical ""girl activities"", didn't mind wearing dresses until middle school and also liked dressing up and being pretty. and that's why my mom is confused. how come her child that perfectly fit into the girl standard in her eyes, how can that child possibly be a boy?

she still doesn't fully grasp the concept yet that what you like to wear, what you do and what you enjoy has nothing to do with your gender identity.

now, back to the whole TV shows featuring trans people thing. oftentimes in those TV shows or even documentaries, those ftm people realized that they're trans at a young age. and every time my mom sees these TV shows or documentaries, she starts comparing it to me.

and i absolutely hate it.

because that's just not similar in any way to my story and sometimes i feel like she thinks i am less trans just because things didn't go for me like they do for most trans ftm people.

it's so frustrating and i am happy that she kinda wants to educate herself on all of that and gain more information about trans people, but it's not at all beneficial for my situation and just makes me feel like shit."	"every journey is different, she just needs to understand that everyone around her lives a life just as complex if not more so than her own.
My suggestion would be to find something you do relate with to share with her. If all she wants to learn from is media, then that's what will teach her.

That being said, there's a severe shortage of trans male representation in media.
Does your mom have short hair, wear pants, do anything ""masculine"" at all? Point out that people can enjoy things that stereotypically are aligned with the opposite gender, or which historically were considered the domain of the opposite gender.
My mom also started consuming LGBTQIA+ media trying to understand a little more about what we are facing/ have faced in our lives.

It was good in concept, but sometimes I have to explain to her the 'glorified tv version' of my struggle is not always in line with what I experience.

And what one person in our community experiences, is not what I experience.
I mean honestly trans YouTubers are better I feel. Like I learned when I was 12. Keep in mind that I didn’t know what trans was before then, but like there are people that learn at 70. You can learn at any age
Talking to your mom is key. See her educating herself as a positive but explain how comparing others journeys to yours is affecting you. I'm a parent whose son has recently come out as trans and I'm trying to educate myself as I want to be the best support I can be.  I'm trying to understand what it all means without putting pressure on them to educate me but I rely on them to put it into context for me as to what it means to them.  Hope it all works out well for you 💕
Have you tried telling her this makes you uncomfortable? ""Mom, please stop comparing me to fictional trans people. It makes me feel really invalidated. The fact that you would rather listen to the TV than to me is really hurtful.""

It sounds she is trying to accept you and is genuinely misguided. Though I might add, her behavior is very strange.
Just want to take a moment to say your frustration is valid. My little brother came out as trans ftm years before I even started questioning and while our parents were relatively supportive, they would do the same thing to him that you are dealing with right now.

It can be exhausting being both invalidated and somewhat supported by one person at the same time. Sometimes the best we can do with stubborn parents is gently remind them that the experience they are watching in media is not yours, and that people who are trans are not a monolithic hive-mind that experience transness in the same way. 

Personally, I find the older the person, the more difficulty they have separating being wrong or misunderstanding something with their worth as a person. So when correcting or explaining or educating, we have to be as explicitly clear as possible that it’s ok that they don’t understand yet, and that you appreciate their trying. 

Which, is honestly a shitty feeling trying to be patient and gentle with someone who doesn’t seem to want to understand, but they often only act that way as a defense because they don’t want to feel dumb. So be patient and share your own experiences if you have the spoons for it. Try to be reassuring and welcoming within those conversations, and hopefully with time she will come around.
""she still doesn't fully grasp the concept yet that what you like to wear, what you do and what you enjoy has nothing to do with your gender identity.""  
Assuming she has / had those same hobbies, I'd ask her if she would stop being a woman if you took those traits away from her.  
Presumably she understands her identity isn't tied to those things.  
Then you can follow up with ""So why does liking those thing mean one IS a woman?""
This isn’t helpful for you at all, but my dad once denied my transness because “but as a kid, you always wanted to play tea party!” I’m ftnb, but for a while I believed I was ftm.
It took my mom awhile to understand that we all find out we’re trans at different ages because she first started learning about trans stuff through documentaries featuring very young trans kids. What helped her was talking to a professional who worked with trans kids (my old counselor). She became more open minded after awhile of learning, it didn’t change instantly.

I don’t know if your mom is objective or more subjective but that could help dictate how you can talk to her about being trans.
OP you need to have a conversation instead of resenting a parent actively attempting to learn about your choices. If there are trans characters you've related to (for me Jamie Clayton in Sense8 was a big wonderful revelation of a trans character treated well, and its from the wachowskis to boot) or if that just isn't out there, ask her to talk with *you* instead of going to documentaries and the like.
You have a very unique and unfortunately confusing situation and I’m sorry you’re going through it. It’s definitely a process and I’m sure you’ll find a way in time. At the very least mother seems open to something and just the smallest opening is all it takes sometimes. I really hope the best for you. Take care. ~Enjoy
You could open to some transpeople on social media that have a different story to tel learn it comes to their gender. I would have to agree I would be pretty annoyed as well if someone was constantly comparing me to the only few media stars out there.
Lots of trans people didn't really get that about themselves until they were older. I definitely have some moments I can look back on from childhood that might have been hints, but I didn't really start considering anything until I was 21, and didn't really accept it until I was 27. Media that tries to be supportive tends to focus on those that knew very early on because it helps to push forward the concept that it's not a choice in a way that's more accessible to cis people, but it does push those of us that don't fit that same model to the side in pursuit of that.
OP, umbrella academy's next season is supposed to have a trans guy in it who wasn't out at the start of the show, you can try to watch that with her!
Honestly, 'glorified tv version' sums up a lot of depictions of anything and some people struggle to wrap their head around this idea.  
I do mean A LOT by the way, the way someone talks can be totally different from a normal human being! (Any Japanese speaker, for instance, will ASSURE you that anime does not follow the guidelines of real communication.)

Any doctor will point out 7 inconsistencies in any medical show!  
Lawyers will at some point declare that a case would be thrown out!  
Romance shows are just generally nonsense with a plethora of tropes I could personally list for why it doesn't work out that way in real life!

People need to understand that ANYTHING you see on TV is up for further investigation on how poorly it reflects any one topic because chances are, it butchers it!
it may be a bit of a surprise, but i already tried that. told her how it makes me feel when she compares those people she sees on TV to me. but she still does it. that's why it's so frustrating

and she doesn't really like to listen to me when i try to explain things
>choices

oh so it's a choice now
Repetition, continue to explain it and force her to actually listen whenever she starts doing that.
I can see how that's tough. If I can share from my own shortcomings when reflecting back on how I wish I had done better when dealing with my mom, I first off hope you find the strength within yourself to not let your mom wear you down. I hope you continue to have the strength to do the opposite, and keep countering what she's consuming when what she watches doesn't apply to you by restating that the experiences she sees people share on the internet are not the circumstances that apply to you. I know that's easier said than done because it actually hurts, and sometimes it's easier to avoid then it is to confront. My mom simply couldn't wrap my head around it because I did so many ""boy things"" growing up.  Unfortunately I chose to avoid after a while. I wish I had the confidence I have now, but back then. I wish I could've stuck to it until she did come around and acknowledge who I truly am and how I feel."	ue2nxn	trans	613	0.99	2022-04-28 19:09:56
