I hate how cis women always have to make trans-inclusive language about *them*	"I don't have the energy to elaborate much, but basically- my existance as a trans man does not ""erase"" the ""female experience"" or whatever the fuck

Acknowledging that I have a uterus, am capable of becoming pregnant, that I still need to access """"female"""" healthcare (cervical cancer screenings and the like) does not ""invalidate"" your identity as a mother or as woman, because *women are also people*, and *being a woman is not defined by your ability to bear or raise children. This is basic feminism for the love of GOD*

I don't *care* if you call yourself a mother. I don't care if you make groups for mothers. I don't care if you casually refer to pregnancy as something that happens to women. I care if the acknowledgement that uterus-haver != woman is treated as stupid, or worse, ***oppressive***, *somehow*, to the point where a legally transitioned trans man can't even access the right type of healthcare because of it. It's not *about* you, for fucks sake

Seriously, there's so much *actual* shit that women have to face for being women and being pregnant. ""Pregnant people"" as a phrase is not one of them"	"So. True. And then some will have the audacity to be like ""why can't we just keep it as 'women' in these legislative papers, it's not like it's hurting anybody!"" As if trans men and nonbinary people with that anatomy aren't literally being turned away from healthcare that can prevent diseases and save lives because they don't fit in that definition. Of course insurance won't cover it if you don't match what's on paper exactly -_-
What winds me up even more about the cis women who complain about this is that often the official guidelines on these alternatives is only to provide the neutral terms so that *if* they happen to treat a trans man or non-binary person then they have those terms already.

Like the whole chest-feeding thing, people ran with it and said that they're ""banning"" the use of ""breastfeeding"" when actually they never did that, they just said ""hey, if your patient isn't a woman, here's the alternative term to use""
oh while we‚Äôre at it I hate the fact I‚Äôve have multiple cis women ask when i‚Äôm getting ‚Äúthe surgery‚Äù like It‚Äôs 20k, risky, and i‚Äôm only 3 and 1/2 months on hormones I couldn‚Äôt even If I wanted to. idk it annoys the f out of me when I get asked this
I am reminded of a joke (bear with me, I'm not making light of your complaints, I'm treating them very seriously):

It's the middle of the night. A guy is standing under a street lamp, looking around with a worried expression on his face.

Another dude walks up to him.

""Hey, is something wrong?""  
""Uh, yeah, actually. I think I lost my watch.""  
""Aw man, that's too bad. Maybe I can help you look for it. Where'd you drop it?""

""Oh, over there,"" the guy points to the distance, ""in the forest.""

""Why would you look for your watch here, then?""

""It's brighter over here.""

\----------  
In terms of oppression and systemic or societal problems and looking for solutions, many people - and that very much includes transphobic people - tend to take a ""it's brighter over here"" approach. Will trans women in bathrooms somehow lead to more sexual assault? No - if anything, the opposite. Is referring to a person as an uterus-haver or a pregnant person going to make healthcare related to pregnancy worse? Again - no, probably the opposite in the long run.

Why say awful things about trans people, then, when it helps no-one in a tangible way and doesn't even make much sense? Why make up oppression where none seems to exist? Well, it's brighter over here. Cis people don't have to wander to that dark forest to look for things that would \*actually\* benefit them.

This is not exclusive to trans people, I'm pretty sure this misplaced hostility happens to any oppressed, marginalised or disenfranchised group. But it sure as heck is prominent in the context of trans people, recently.
Just want to say you're right, and your voice deserves to be heard.
It's really unacceptable too, the number of people who think this is all somehow designed to spare trans women's feelings when there are trans men literally suffering and even dying because of the lack of appropriate medical care.
My aunt was talking to my mom about this. Ugh it made me so mad, it was a conversation about periods and how trans masculine or nonbinary people that have periods or something are erasing her experience as a cis woman. I don‚Äôt know her exact words or what it was all about, but it was something along the lines of that.

I‚Äôm done with that crap, I don‚Äôt know how trans people having other terms for things effects her at all. That was like the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced a bit of transphobia from someone close to me.
Just sexism boiled down
Big huge hugs, this is one of those things my wife struggles with.  One of the harder reasons is woman in their 50+ were still fighting hard for ""Womens rights"" like the right to own a credit card in their name separate from their husbands.   And Women (or people) are still fighting for the right for choice over their body and pregnancy.  And that's a HUGE deal in many parts of the world still.  It shouldn't be but it absolutely is.

So unfortunately some woman are afraid of angry patriarchal men taking away these rights (and others).  And they fear any change in the wording of ""Women's XYZ"" is a potential slip against the male patriarchy.  

I don't know how you solve this problem in the short term.  Trans people deserve to have the right to be people in all aspects of their lives.  But unfortunately hateful patriarchal men (and women willing to stand behind them) have created an absolute shit show for all of us.  We're all fighting for our rights, but getting written and embraced in law together has become an exercise in fear for any step back on either sides problems vs the patriarchy.

I really hate it, but all we can do is say and fight for what's right for all people.
fr tho. go to r/TrueOffMyChest and there are soo many posts from cis women complaining about trans-inclusive language like wtf.
I really just gave up on them a long time ago.
Just more reason to keep it to yourself whenever possible.
I feel like I might know what triggered this. That post was a bunch of TERFs and closet TERFs finding another excuse to complain about trans people. Because somehow the existence of us, whether masc or femme, is DEstRoyInG BIoLoGIcaL fEmAlEs.
Agreed - as a trans woman, I find it ridiculous that my health insurance keeps spamming me with reminders to get my pap-smear ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The healthcare system really needs to wake up and provide better integration and support for groups other than cis white men and cis white women.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve had this experience ü´Çü´Çü´Ç
I wonder how much of it is a subconscious reaction to patriarchy. Like, we trans men always existed of course, but the social expectation until very, very recently (and let's be honest, still is), was that only women can get pregnant and be mothers. I wonder if to a subconscious level it feels like men are trying to intrude in a space that traditionally is one of the few fields where women can shine and get attention and recognition.
I have the opposite problem, as a trans women, people exclude me from conversations about male reproduction and female ones too lol. I will probably be having my kids with my better half with my own tools since I have little desire to medically transition but regardless, i often have to remind people that i deserve an opinion in such things too
[deleted]
I once took part in a ""Diversity in Public Health"" conversation where this came up. The person running the event said they decided to default to ""pregnant women"" because ""In our focus groups, we found that women resisted gendered language like 'pregnant people.'""

And then there's me sitting there dumbfounded, trying to figure out why they called ""people"" gendered language, but not ""women.""
The trans experience is basically just a footnote to cis people problems. People insist on misgendering me, it happens most places I go. But the poor cis people can't use 2 word think of the children!!

Sorry had to get that of my chest üòÇüòÇ
JK Rowling is shaking.

No but you are a 3000% correct, honestly it‚Äôs just straight up stupid. They get defensive before being attacked. IN SPITE of being attacked, rather.
I feel this as someone who uses ‚Äúpregnant person‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthing person‚Äù and gets accused all the time for erasing women, like no I‚Äôm literally just trying to be inclusive of my and other trans mascs birth experience but go off
THANK YOU!
So true, unfortunately. I'm a cis woman who is still a virgin and I feel you. I will be more careful about this.
Well said.
Jesus christ I am so tired of this! I am soooo fucking tired of this. I absolutely 10000% agree.
Some people make everything about themselves. You can only shake your head and move on. Not to excuse it, but people often feel these ways because they themselves are closeted trans people. It sounds a lot to me like ""I'm not totally satisfied with my gender, but some aspects are comforting to me. If this person wasn't satisfied and they transitioned, it erases my struggle because I'm not transmasc""
yeah, i remember a post on r/trueoffmychest that was about language surrounding people who have the ability to bear children. it sucks and I hate the fact that subreddit has a negative post about trans people almost everyday, and the comments are always burning dumpster fire. at this point they have to be karma farming troll posts; i'm sure these people don't actually wanna have genuine and understanding conversations about trans people. 

I thought that argument was stupid and all people who can have kids should be comfortable during the pregnancy and birth, according to their health needs and their gender. I feel like women feel like something is being ""taken away"", but thats a foolish thought because trans masculine people and trans men having babies doesn't change the fact that most babies are made by cis women. We deserve to have inclusive language, comfortable terminology and a happy experience if we choose to have children as people with uteruses, and it is unfair we do not get that chance.
since it seems most other people have responded better answers than i could come up with.

&#x200B;

isnt it != not =! ? (also isnt it funny most people who have transitioned or transitioning are programmers :P)
This reminded me how TERFS boycotted a cancer charity for saying people instead of women üíÄ

Apparently to them women aren't people lol
As a cis woman...I have to admit that I find this ultra stupid because those people care only about one certain version of womanhood. 

Women =|= baby-machine 
Not everyone who can have a baby must be what they perceive as a woman. 
Not everyone who corresponds to their definition of a woman needs to be able to or want to have babies. 

A person with cancer is a cancer-patient. We don't call prostate cancer-patients ""men"" as a whole either, do we? 
A person with a bun in the oven is a pregnant person. Easy. It's a fact. 

To me, all of this sounds like fake-outrage from some people. Detailed and specific language is for the better...we don't call any non-white person ""a savage"" anymore either. 
üôÑüôÑüôÑ
This is what lat√≠n American TERFs have been screeching about recently, I saw one of them missgendering a trans dude when he explained her why those terms exist.
Literally. I just HATE when they say ,,female healthcare"" ,,women experience"" or ,,female struggles"". Why they always refuse to include trans people. We share the same struggles, yet they act like it's just theirs. That's just unfair.
this is so hard to follow im a bit confused what the real issue is here that is being expressed
Bunch of self centered scared manipulated people running around on this planet right now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Fuck transphobes and TERFs. They are not feminists, by definition. Just transphobes pretending to speak from feminism, the bunch of covert narcissists who always want to be perceived as the victims, while their only binding goal is perpetuating gender-based *abuse*. Transphobes calling themselves feminists is a serious insult and at this point, injury, to feminism.

And obviously to us. But their false pretense of feminism is too much. They are exactly like ""pro lifers"" who say their goal is protecting babies, when it's really harming women. Terfs say their goal is protecting women, when it's really harming trans people.

They wear costumes of decency to commit acts of harm. 

The costume is there not just to inflate their influence, but to assist their control tactic of keeping the 'good person/innocent/victim' role squarely on themselves in the public eye. It's a version of DARVO (Deny wrongdoing, and Accuse the person who called them out of being the ""real"" wrongdoer, Reversing Victim and Offender.)

Accusing real victims of being the real abusers is abhorrent, which is exactly what they are doing to us, then DARVOing onto us, in order to claim that such abhorrent things are *only really* being done to THEM by the Bad Trans.

They are textbook **covert narcissists**, as in clinical **narcissistic personality disorder**, displaying common behavioral results of narcissistic thinking patterns. I think it would benefit anybody's social defenses to look up info sources that dig deep into those bolded terms (there are many!) to learn to spot each part of their universally similar sets of manipulation tactics, in order to learn to understand them for what they are when you encounter them!  Studying this topic, and joining various ""dealing with narcissists"" subreddits (...there are too many to list), has helped me more than I can briefly say.)

TL;DRish: Don't believe TERF's good-guy costumes, words, or self-applied labels, especially the 'feminist' one, and anything to do with having scientific or medical expertise, nor with having the support of feminism or of other women in general. It's all just triangulation manipulation. 

Believe their actions, and the intended real-world consequences of these actions. That makes their true goals clear, despite all the bullshit. And applying this to TERFs shows just what they are: a single-issue hate group who wishes to cause harm to trans individuals.

Under all the smoke and mirrors, TERFs deserve no more legitimacy in debate than the KKK, who differ mainly in who they target for harm. They are no less full of shit than a klansman trying to explain why they are good and people of [race] are inherently bad, trying to give their bigotry false merit via triangulation of pretending to be backed by studies and research from prestigious institutions (which actually destroy their arguments, had they fully read or understood them).
I understand your point. 
But in my point of view it also has a sense: Law-Stuff. When it is needed to refer to the (ex)pregnant-people. Then the term 'Mother' terrifies me.
It fucking IS hurting people that‚Äôs why! But my favorite argument is: ‚Äùshould be change it just for a few people?‚Äù Uhhhh so you WANT minorities to be treated like shit, huh? Is that it? You just fucking HATE minorities and having to accomodate ANYTHING for them to feel even a LITTLE bit more included. Maybe we should just go back to calling everyone a man then? And not give a crap about women again? Fuck. You. It drives me insane. Stop being so triggered that there are other minorities that ALSO have issues. Jesus.
Not to mention that they're also implying I'm not a real woman because I *don't* have a uterus.

God IKR

They're acting like they're oppressed because SOME people use neutral language

litcherally 1984 /s
And while we're still at it I've seen some of them (talking about MtFs in this case) saying TERFy shit and going ""less than half of them ever get tHe SuRgErY and that should tell you all you need to know"". Yeah, that it's expensive, inaccessible, and highly uncertain, and that for some people social transition is good enough?
Did you get the surgery yet?
Put another way, trans people are much easier targets than the actual oppressors.
As a cis ally, I will take this to heart. I, too, am a marginalized person (I was given a bogus medical diagnosis at the age of 2).
Thank you
Yes, TERFs especially seem to think this all the time. I think it's because they have a much easier time hating on trans women (who they see as predatory men) while pretending they pity trans men (who they see as naive, misled girls). All their talking points boil down to ""the sort of sexism feminists were fighting in the 70s"".
I had to explain to a room full of cis health professionals at a talk that pregnancy is not a personal concern for me as a trans woman. A large number legitimately didn't even know that I couldn't get pregnant because they didn't know what ""trans woman"" meant; that's the level of ignorance in the room.
I will say it: burn the patriarchy!
There was one trending a few days ago, that's what this is partially in response to
TBF I haven't actually had any *direct* experiences with cis women saying this to me, I've just seen a lot of cis women online repeat the same BS (like that post on trueoffmychest that was trending a while back)
But I thought trans men were supposed to be poor confused little autistic girls, not scary male invaders! /s

Oh, right. Their portrayal of us shifts to whichever makes us a more convenient target. Not to mention the number of people who think this is for trans women's sake, somehow

(Not saying I disagree with you, your point is valid and it's an understandable (?) gut reaction for a cis woman to have. key word being ""gut reaction"")
it's interesting that you say you're excluded from both discussions, while trans men are often lumped into women's spaces. Reminds me of [this essay](https://nothorses.tumblr.com/post/665231771105902592/embed)

Dunno if the link works, but it's about how manhood is viewed as a competition, whereas womanhood is viewed as an obligation, which is why trans people (""failed"" men/women) are treated differently
Absolutely! Enby afab, although my ability to safely carry a pregnancy is negated by my uterus and tubes throwing a tantrum (yay endometriosis üôÑ). I'm not a walking baby factory and this terf shite needs to find its way into a black hole, taking JK with it.
[deleted]
the mental gymnastics you have to do to think ""woman"" is less gendered than ""person""...
Occasionally when someone says that I am this ü§è close to snapping and being like ""oh you think the word people is erasing women? So you don't think women are people? Thats kind of sexist."" It's not very nice and a deliberate misinterpretation of what i know they're trying to say, but I'm tempted sometimes.
Yeah that‚Äôs‚Ä¶weird of them. They‚Äôre *literally* included in ‚Äúpregnant person‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthing person‚Äù.
üëä You‚Äôre a real one ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
Oh, it probably is lmao, I'm not a programmer I just use it because I don't have a symbol for the crossed-out equals sign
A lot of cis women wrongly believe saying ""pregnant people"" erases and oppresses women. They insist on language that excludes AFAB people who aren't women. That's a major problem because it increases the risk that a trans man with M as his gender record might be denied important services by ignorant doctors and insurance companies.
Yeah, sorry if it's hard to read. I wrote this as a rant, I didn't expect it to get as much attention as it did
you have some good points, but I feel like straight-up armchair diagnosing them with NPD is shitty. Most abusers are neurotypical
Wdym? I'm not sure I get your point
Many people don't really think through their political beliefs, they just go by whatever they have a strong emotional reaction to. Whether or not its contradictory or leads to bad outcomes doesn't matter.
You're so right, and that makes it even worse. They're really sprinkling a little bit of ""let's just invalidate and hurt everybody in the trans community"" in, huh?
Because governments have demonstrated good judgment, the ability to take in new information and react and be accountable to those they represent.     

What has government done to earn such trust and devotion?
I just dont like surgery at all. The idea of being out and under a knife for like half a day and then the recovery process scares the shit out of me. I would never consider it tbh.

(I've also put off getting my wisdom teeth removed for this same reason, I just hate surgery and anesthetic)
In simple words, yes.  


It's easier to punch down and make oneself feel a little better for a while, and even feel like one is Making a Difference For the Better.  


It's a lie, and an insidious one, but it's clear where it sometimes comes from.
agreed
> health professionals

Geez, that's concerning
[deleted]
They didn't push their ideals on anyone. They said we shouldn't reduce *all women* to their potential or actual pregnancy. Nobody said ""No woman should want to be a mother or stay home.""
you wanting to be a mother (good on you!) does not equal your worth being directly connected to your potential babymaking. you're fighting the wrong people here honey
Wtf you really got that internal misogynist vibes üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I mean what other implications are there to them thinking the word ‚Äúperson‚Äù excludes women? I think it‚Äôs just the natural progression of their hypocritical bs lol you would be NTA for pointing that out to them
A real what? I don't understand.
ok thanks yea that is not a good thing to happen. I always wondered about the whole gender neutral terminology in reference to health care typically used for women like as in who it applied too. I never thought about it being for trans men who still might do those things or need that type of care and the word women doesn't apply to them. I always love to learn new things.
Lol u good i am dyslexic so lol üòÇ
FARTs really do make everything worse.
When I was a kid I was so terrified of surgery I used to say that if I had a life threatening condition requiring surgery, I would just let it take me. I also put off my wisdom teeth surgery for years (got it in my early 30s) because I was so scared I‚Äôd never wake up. I hadn‚Äôt been under general at that point but I sucked it up and let me tell you, it was awesome! I had the most beautiful dream/hallucinations that when I woke up I told the nurse that she and I had been walking up a mountain in the sun set and everything was pink and purple and beautiful and we were in the clouds‚Ä¶ and then I burst out crying because I would never see purple mountain again. I cried and hugged all the staff when I was leaving and in the Uber on the way home I asked my partner why we can‚Äôt take general anaesthetic every night before bed because it‚Äôs AWESOME! 

However, they only gave me a few days worth of pain killers and I was in massive pain for two weeks. I had to go back for more *and* use some spares I had. This was for an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù surgery that removed all four teeth in less than 30 minutes (but left a large shard of tooth in my gums that was fighting its way out). Everyone reacts to surgery differently but I hate pain and it was such a crap recovery, especially as I was told I‚Äôd be fine by day 5 and I was still calling in sick by day 10. (I have fibromyalgia though so everything hurts more.) Currently I don‚Äôt have health insurance but I was recently told I have a deviated septum, nose polyps and the only way I‚Äôll be able to breathe normally is surgery. I don‚Äôt have any prospects for that now and it‚Äôs still terrifying even though it might solve a bunch of health issues for me, so I guess until then I‚Äôll just struggle to breathe.

So yeah, in our society of nip/tucking and excessive surgery people think it‚Äôs no big deal but it‚Äôs a big decision to go under the knife, especially if something isn‚Äôt life threatening (though I know for many people not getting top/bottom surgery *is* life threatening). It‚Äôs not a decision to be taken lightly, plus on top of that I understand that many surgeons require hormone therapy cessation temporarily (for 6 weeks?) before surgery, which can be scary. And if anyone makes a judgement about not having surgery, I mean are they going to fucking pay for it? Again, people act like it‚Äôs no big deal to have 20K lying around or like taking out credit or a loan for that much is easy. 

Surgery is scary. People who opt for it are very brave, have the means, often have/need good support systems for afterwards, have job security or prospects that they can look forward to afterwards etc. Not everyone is in that position. You do you and screw what anyone else says. I know that‚Äôs easier said than done, but people need to mind their own goddamn business.

Oh God please no don't let this types of people have children üíÄ

The governor of Utah‚Äôs response to a ban on transgender people in Utah sports is encouraging and positive	"It‚Äôs not perfect, but a lot of it obviously comes from a place of kindness. He vetoed a bill banning transgender kids from competing in women‚Äôs sports when, at the last minute, the commission overhauled the bill that originally proposed inclusion after review. A bill that was built with the LGBTQ community where everyone found a compromise together and agreed to tweak the system continuously instead became a blanket ban at the 11th hour. The pull quote below is exactly the kind of thing I wish more people would realize, and it‚Äôs coming from the republican governor of a red state. Maybe there is hope for the trans community. I encourage everyone to read the whole statement. There is some transphobic language, but it seems to come more from a place of ignorance, not hatred.

https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/03/22/gov-spencer-coxs/

‚ÄúFour kids and only one of them playing girls sports. That‚Äôs what all of this is about. Four kids who aren‚Äôt dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don‚Äôt understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce suicidality significantly. For that reason, as much as any other, I have taken this action in the hope that we can continue to work together and find a better way. If a veto override occurs, I hope we can work to find ways to show these four kids that we love them and they have a place in our state.‚Äù"	"Wow. Just read the whole thing and I have a couple of thoughts on this. 

1) It initially sounded like ""don't pass this because people will sue and we don't have the money to deal with that."" Just goes to show how short sighted their transphobia makes these legislators.

2) Towards the end of his statement, he does seem super sincere and as if he had given some thought into this decision that comes, as OP mentioned, a place of kindness. The excerpt you chose really captures that well, OP.

I guess one last thought, or hope rather, is that more of our political leaders, and equally as important, their constituents, can learn from this man and put as much thought (not that it takes all that much, let's be honest) as he has.
It‚Äôs encouraging for sure.  I hope other republicans take a fucking moment and consider what the fuck they are doing.  But I‚Äôm not very hopeful.
Sadly, I just heard that the veto was just over-ridden :(
I'm proud of him for taking a stand against his party and being compassionate, but unfortunately the party still outnumbers him and they're still going ahead with the ban, fuck America right now.
As someone who lived in Utah for a while, I think this message is more important than whether or not the law goes through. The law will probably go through, but I think everybody anticipated that. What people did not anticipate is a republican governor in a conservative state standing up for the rights of trans youth, and I think for a lot of kids who have grown up in an area where if you assume people want you dead you'll be right most of the time, seeing a prominent leader take a stand for you will mean a lot.
Yes, it's good that one Republican did the right thing. But then they decided to override his veto. So yeah.

I can't get that excited about one guy being decent, I guess, because he really is just doing the minimum in terms of being an ally.
You can tell that he doesn't really understand us, but he genuinely seems to want what's best for us. This honestly made my day
[deleted]
I'm impressed. There's a shadow theocracy in Utah, I almost can't believe this
This is America where people at least pretend to care about fairness. Everyone deserves a place at the table, it can just take some time to slide around the seating chart for a new friend.
The end of his statement got to me. It shouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see empathy like that but it was
This was just for show.  Maybe he's looking at a presidential bid.  

Whatever his real intentions, I don't know how any of you can trust a Utah Republican even a little.  You **can not** get to be the Republican governor of Utah with a clean conscience.

Look at loads and loads of our history.  These bastards only extend olive branches just to use our own compassion against us.  If you don't know your history, and know it from queer/black/indigenous sources, then just trust me this motherfucker is up to no good, but also, get read.

I read through these threads and always see y‚Äôall bitching about transphobia. It‚Äôs not transphobia. There are many actions taken towards you folk that is hateful and menacing and horrible, but this isn‚Äôt one. Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. It‚Äôs not fair. I support your right to be who you are and live your life free from hate but physical competition is an area where I disagree on inclusion
Cox‚Äôs statement doesn‚Äôt surprise me.  He‚Äôs done it before.  At a 2016 vigil for the victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre, he made an equally incisive statement.  

Cox is far from perfect.  But unlike almost every other conservative politician at the state or national level, he‚Äôs a decent human being.  Sadly, he‚Äôs probably 10-20 years before his time.  

The crusade against us will continue for the foreseeable future.  The Republicans want to exterminate us, and have shown they will do whatever it takes to make it happen.  

But what many in our community don‚Äôt realize is this crusade is a last-gasp effort to maintain the patriarchal Christian white-male status quo.  To be sure, it'll be rough going.  But they‚Äôre too late.  Their crusade is bound to fail.  We‚Äôre too big and too powerful.  Younger generations are far more accepting as a whole.  We‚Äôll eventually see more politicians like Cox, even if they‚Äôre Republican.  Things will get better.
""Because there are logical and passionate arguments by many parties...""

Oh, have there been? /s
... Yeah I don't like this, one bit. I respect he's a politician but I just flat out disagree with some of what he says, especially talking about how this issue turns ""allies into opponents"". 

Yes, it does turn allies into your opponents, because the allies believe in fairness. He also talked about Lia Thomas and... as usual, a republican completely neglects the context as to why she performed so well, citing it as an ""egregious example"". I agree with his points on finance since that's seemingly the only thing republicans start conversations with, but I dislike how it's the forefront of his discussion. 

I'm just saying, if they really want to ban trans people from sports divisions that align with their identity, they should make Transmasc's play in the womens leagues too. I'd love to see the hilarity that ensues from that as long as the Transmasc's consent to playing in womens leagues at least to make a point.
Despite not being conservative, as a Utahn, Cox is not bad at all. Plenty of democrats in Utah actually registered as Republicans to vote for him in the primaries, as this being Utah we always swing red, but he was one of the best candidates they put forward, and actually seems to care about this state and the people in it, regardless of race, sex, gender, religion, or sexuality. If the democrats don‚Äôt put any good candidates forward this next election I‚Äôll probobaly be voting for him tbh.
Human decency. What a rare sight to behold in this day and age.
I live in Utah, and this gives me at least a little bit of hope. I just want to be myself and be happy. Maybe someday, things will turn out ok, I really hope they will. I just wish everyone could be accepting towards me, especially my family. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll come around. this give me hope that they might.
As a Utahn I‚Äôm proud to have this wonderful man to be our governor, he is the only governor I‚Äôve only heard good things about, h gives me so much hope
I live in texas and I‚Äôm VERY envious of a leader who seems to give a shit about their constituents. And, sadly, a budgetary problem probably resonates more with other legislators than a human rights issue.
The governor is providing multiple reasons why it is a bad bill. It starts with the most simple and logical reason and ends with a powerful appeal to emotion because emotion is what m drives behavior change. It's a very common and powerful rhetorical device used to sway opinion.

The end result is the reader or listener comes away from the speech with the logical reasons cemented into the argument by the emotional bond created by the ending. So the reader or listener is now on the side of the speaker emotionally and morally.
I lived in Utah for 13 years, and while the legislature is bought and paid for by the church there have been some suprisingly open governors.  Huntsman, and Cox were both better than expected.  I do feel like he has to hit point #1 you mentioned because he (and all of us know) that the only thing that might move the Utah state legislature is not humanity, but $$.  To me it shows both that he is a good person, and that he understands where the only levers he really can pull to effect any change exist.
He doesn't sound like he will support trans people BUT cares about life and with a pro life stance that he has he equate the sacrificing his beliefs for the greater good if preventing suicide with trans people using straight logic of trans people are a minority and wouldn't change much
They don't care what they're doing. They just know the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

Politicians will do any say literally anything to get/stay in office
For most the cruelty is the point. They‚Äôre desperate to have an under class they can absolutely shit on.
[removed]
Of course it was‚Ä¶
They‚Äôre trying to gather votes they haven‚Äôt yet edit: nope, they did it like last night, fuck.
This is the kind of politician that makes primaries SO important. The dream is to have a liberal governor, but many places that‚Äôs highly unlikely. If you know you‚Äôre in a red state that will very likely vote in a republican, we want more people like this rather than Abbott or his ilk.
I‚Äôm grateful he at least tried. I live in Utah, and it‚Äôs at least a little bit comforting that there are some who are accepting of me. I‚Äôve lived here all my life, there are a lot of good people here. I‚Äôd say the majority of the hate is fueled by ignorance, A lot of people here live in their own sheltered bubble, I did too for the longest time. I feel extremely lucky that I‚Äôve found a support system, even if my family isn‚Äôt the most supportive. Maybe someday things will be better, I really hope so.
My thoughts exactly.
Exactly. I‚Äôve lived in Utah my whole life. Between all the disgusted looks and hurtful jokes,  this is a nice change.
It felt like more than the minimum, especially releasing a statement like this. As political statements go, this one is pretty solidly pro trans kids. But I‚Äôm in texas, so maybe I‚Äôm just pining for some compassion here.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs being an ally at all. He‚Äôs not supporting the community. All he did was point out that trans people are human and deserve to be treated with dignity. It feels very much the same as ‚Äúhate the sin, love the sinner‚Äù.
And he seems to defer to people who DO know and seems to have tried to educate himself.
That‚Äôs pretty awesome. A politician keeping their word. *sigh*
Agility dogs should compete against cis men. 

Horses should compete against cis men. 

F1 cars should compete against cis men.
To paraphrase a great author, if you think trans women are women except when it comes to sports, you don't really think trans women are women. You just allow them to be women some of the time.
Across sports? The effect of trans athletes on sports and performance records is statistically insignificant.
>  Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. 

This is just not true. There's a handful of subcategories where trans women have a small advantage over cis women, and they don't compete enough (and likely never will) to ""shatter records across sports."" Trans women occasionally win, but that's reasonable to expect across 1000s of competitions. You are couching your transphobia in logic but it's clear you have no actual understanding of the science or statistics, you're just being transphobic. 

> It‚Äôs not fair.

This is the weirdest take because sport already is dominated by people with the right genetics and upbringing. Competitive sports is never fair, but you're targeting trans women because you are transphobic rather than finding much more significant ways to make sports fair. 

If you care about fair women's sports so much, increasing funding for research and marketing is a way better way to make it fair than banning trans women. You're not making sports fairer by banning trans kids from playing sports with their peers. Which is what this bill does.

Educate yourself: https://youtu.be/HdT1PvJDRo4
I would pay. I would buy memberships. I would print pink and blue foam (middle) fingers. I would support my trans bros while they just flex on the cis.
It shouldn‚Äôt be a ban as much as just common sense
>the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

...which is in turn mainly true because the politicians and their pundit pals have *told* them to hate trans people so the politicians can always score an easy win when their numbers are down.
Fuck off. We are not mentally ill, and we sure as Hell don‚Äôt need or deserve to be thrown in prison or *ENSLAVED* (and yes, that is exactly what you just advocated for) just because we‚Äôre trans.
It is well known among democrats in Utah that they need to be registered as republicans.  The republican primaries are closed in Utah, but the democratic primaries are not.  All of my friends that are democrats in Utah are registered republican so that they can push more liberal republicans through the primaries.
True, in my experience it's pretty rare to even meet another trans person IRL (I'm in Australia though) and I guess it's easy for transphobia to spread when there's more people who have opinions on trans people than people who actually know trans people personally. Sorry your state is treating you like shit.
Not only that, this was the second time he vetoed this bill.
Yeah, I don't see how anyone can be anti-kids and hold a position of power. But that's just me. He didn't say he supports trans kids' right to take blockers to delay puberty or anything like that. He said he doesn't want them to kill themselves. So... Yeah.
Intersex and hermaphroditic athletes present interesting edge cases. It is not all b&w.
So because it‚Äôs insignificant, in your mind that means all the girls and women who are currently losing to trans men don‚Äôt matter. Gotcha. Like always it‚Äôs always about men.. nothing truly changes.
You want to defend womens sports from a fake threat? Sure, but by definition these bulky hot men need to now play against cis women, because after all, ‚Äúit‚Äôs how you were born‚Äù that‚Äôs the most important, not years of hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery when deeming who can and can‚Äôt play.

I‚Äôd pay real money to watch this too
Who are you guys voting for? Becky Edwards is the popular choice right? At least, that's the vibe that I get. If Mike lee wins the primaries, the next favorite would be McMullin in the generals, right? (I have no one irl rn to ask these questions) I really hope we can unseat mike lee
You literally don't even understand what trans men means.

How did you get to this sub? Did you intentionally come here to be transphobic?

The owner of GayPrideShop UK, the largest LGBTQ+ store in the UK, told me to get used to being misgendered.	"This is a cross-post from r/transgenderuk
I've read the rules, but I'm not clear on the etiquette, so I'm sorry if I have not followed correctly. 

When i worked there from June - December, customers often misgendered me, but during halloween, when it was particularly busy, it happened a lot more. One guy looked me right in the eyes, and at the huge ""She/Her"" patch on my beanie and said ""see ya later fella"", which, obviously, made me feel disgusting. I told the owner of the store about this, and he said the exact words:

""you'd better get over it, because I make most of my money this time of year"".

He said that to me at the start of the first day of the Halloween rush, and I then, for three days, served most of the customers during the rush. Almost all of them misgendered me, and this period was awful for my mental health.

My first day off after those three days, I went to my GP and was prescribed anti-depressants. This was because of a mental health crisis I was having because of what the owner had said to me. 

In November, he -actually- misgendered me, in front of a customer, who then consequently misgendered me. He'd also make light of what had happened during halloween and would double down on what he'd said. 

They appear inclusive, because they include neopronouns, and they cover a lot of different identities. But from my experience with the two owners, any support they show for trans rights is just virtue signalling. 

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, this has sat with me for a while and I felt the need to say something."	"i feel that alot of ""lgbtq+ friendly"" companies are actually very queerphobic.
Unfortunately there is a surprisingly large amount of transphobia in the LGBTQ+ community from those who aren‚Äôt trans.
This is rainbow capitalism. Nothing about a business selling pride merch is liberators. I'm sorry you went through that OP
Well I straight-up would have told him that some people are going to need to get used to getting punched in the nose then
He wants money. I don't think he actually cares about advocating or misgendering.
I've heard of companies profiting off of pride before but an entire store DEDICATED to profiting off of pride without actually caring about LGBT people? Holy fuck.
Ugh. Where in the UK is the shop?
I swear to god this country is just the earth's butthole
I don‚Äôt support gays who don‚Äôt support me
Wtf :( I am soooo sorry to hear that.
Unfortunately alot of the ""support"" from companies regarding lgbtq+ is purely financially motivated. It's a shame they don't always care but atleast it's some progress, exposure can help normalise our culture but we still have a far way to go.
Only commenting because now they're mad so I want to get this post some karma boosting powers....
this.  this kind of shit is proof the pride flag and the term ""LGBT"" doesn't actually include transgender rights at all.
Fact is. Most people are too busy to care about anything other than their own ego‚Ä¶.
All capitalists are bastards. They would sell out their communities for profit in a heartbeat. The ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù they give us is just a ploy to squeeze more money out of the most exploited sections of the working class.
Terf island strikes again üòî
time to boycott
Well this is one shop to never give money to.

What really bothers me is that you mention *multiple* customers misgendering you. Why would there be any need to use gender specific terms at all? That seems malicious in intent to me.
Sorry that happened to you Estelle, I hope you‚Äôre in a much better place now.
that was brutal, they didn't even pull their punches they just went nuclear on you, like damn.
I would just misgender your boss and customers and ask them why they get mad
That‚Äôs so disheartening because they should know better. I‚Äôm sorry you went through this. Your employer doesn‚Äôt value you, they value profit. You need to work for a company that does values you, because you deserve it. Surround yourself with people who support your authentic self. It‚Äôs critical to do this when you‚Äôre trans or non-binary.
Being fair, and 100% playing devils advocate; sometimes you do just have to get used to it bc there will always be shitty people both above, below, and on the same level as you. It sucks for real, but focusing on it only hurts more.

Personally, I just decry them as dickheads who can‚Äôt be better.

Sorry about the abuse you faced, but thanks for the heads-up, I now know where *not* to shop!
You should post this to r/antiwork
like Disney they have been saying forever they are supporters then turn around and cancel all of Pixar's queer content and support the people behind the Don't Say Gay bill.
Their level of friendliness is directly correlated to how much money you have to spend with them.
That‚Äôs because companies don‚Äôt have beliefs, they aren‚Äôt people. They only have one interest: profit, and will seek this by any means necessary. ‚ÄúLGBT positive‚Äù companies are only using that label to commodify our community and cater to those who may be fooled by their aesthetic. The second we aren‚Äôt profitable anymore, they‚Äôll go right back to hating us.
hannaford (a local supermarket chain) is genuinely really good though :)) im really happy they are actually super nice and just really kind..
YEP.

Capitalism is the enemy.
The bourgeois class will be liquidated someday, my trans brothers and sisters.
Despite what people say, violence sometimes IS the answer.
Odd how he did all that misgendering personally for free then

He's transphobic.
Based in Manchester, they ship globally.
Not just your country. There's a wrong way to be in every place you can go.
People in the UK tend to use gendered terms naturally, to my dismay üòÖ

I wore signage (sold by the store) constantly to try and get people to take a hint, the entire building is meant to be trans positive (there are signs saying ""no transphobia"" and a huge trans day of visibility mural) so I feel like it's fair to expect people to respect it.
What
Jesus Christ homegirl was just venting and warning us about this place. If you never feel shitty about this sort of thing then great for you, other people can use some support and that's perfectly OK too.
>That‚Äôs the reality of our choice.

What choice?
Choice? Just because your experience soured your outlook doesn't mean everybody has to be as jaded as you. If you need to talk, my DMs are open for all, but don't spread your misery and try bringing everyone down to how fucked up you feel inside. Jesus Christ.
sounds like someone could use some therapy and antidepressants. hope you get better soon!
Thats depressing me rn
walmart too!
I'm so fed up of these large media corporations that are just slightly ""technically not *too* big to be considered a monopoly"" limiting their creators, mainly when these limitations are because of bigotry...
In Maine? How trans-friendly is Maine in general, would you say?
Unfortunately for some people I am a scrapper more unfortunate for some people my brother is an insane person who loves to fight and will fight anyone who is transphobic. The older I get the less scrappy I've become but I will defend myself and more importantly anyone in the community. Sometimes some loud mouth transphobic jerk needs a nice jarring slap or a punch to the gut. Be safe out there everyone
Violence is never the answer!
Its the question, and the answer is always YES
it‚Äôs always a solution
The one if affleks? If so I'll avoid it and just use QueerLit
Based here in Manchester you say! Disgraceful. Have the owner come down to Wythenshawe, we'll show him a ""good time"" üòá

Side note if you're ever in need of a South Manchester friend just DM me and say hi, I myself don't know a lot of people from the community here! ^-^
That must be regional because I'm from UK and never used gendered terms to refer to people I didn't know since long before I knew about anything LGBT.
LMAO it's like tell me you have internalized transphobia without telling me you have internalized transphobia
uhhh no not maine but new england. idk abt maine but where i live is really nice honestly.
I feel this on a spiritual level.
Any time is go time, and these hands are rated E for Everyone! lol In all honesty I've lost a lot of my fight (physically) but I grew up in the ghetto so the savagery still remains if I ever need it.
It is that one yes, they actually have beef with QueerLit.
Dm me of you want a link to a Manchester based social group for 18-35 year old trans people! ^_^ it's a lovely group.
Ohh, I just looked it up and apparently hannaford‚Äôs exists outside of Maine lol. My bad. I‚Äôm in Mass and it seems pretty friendly, but I‚Äôm still scared shitless to come out tbh
All the more reason to support queer lit then!
Oh my days yes, I went there to ask about books that might help my parents get their heads round the trans of it all. They recommended the transgender issue and coming out stories, both of which my mum has now read and is helping my dad get used to gendering me correctly now üòä
Also, the staff there were lovely as it wasn't too busy so I got to have a proper good chat with the 3 people in that day. Love that place! Can't wait to move back to Manchester and get all my queer books from there üòÅ
I love Queer Lit! Such a genuinely nice business."	tjjrvh	trans	1329	0.99	2022-03-21 19:25:55
I follow r/trans r/mtf and r/ftm and ive been seeing some weird discourse lately	No space is going to be perfectly inclusive to everybody. Its tough okay. Im seeing trans women complaining about trans men. Trans men complaining about trans women. Its a bit disheartening so im just here to say that this trans girl loves you. This girl wants you to be happy. This girl wants you to feel included. This girl wants you to have safe spaces. Some of you may not know what im talking about and some will, im not gonna bother getting into it. But can we please just spread love and positivity? We have far bigger problems. I will literally suffocate yall in love if we cant behave. üíúüíúüíúüíú	"Trans guy here, I don‚Äôt exactly know what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôve seen some of the posts. I‚Äôve avoided them because they stress me out. While addressing problems that come from within the community is important, this type of infighting is seldom productive. 

Thank you for your support!
As a trans woman, I just wanna say, we all shouldn‚Äôt be fighting each other, we are in the same community, we should be fighting together. We all are trans and we should be united
Hmm... interesting that I'm not the only one noticing an increase in that kind of stuff... 

I wonder if it's trolls trying to create dissent between us.

We have to stick together and lift each other up.
Yeah I saw a post about it in the r/ftm  so I Lurked into the r/mtf to see what it was about. I mean overall hate on both Sides. Think it‚Äôs really sad. I think both have it hard in different parts. At the end of the day we are all under the same umbrella and should respect eachother as such.
There's been a big rise in complaining about inclusivity of various kinds on lgbt subs lately I've found. I don't know whether it's because of a loosely coordinated attack or just people feeling emboldened to make their own posts when they see them so they proliferate naturally. Either way it's concerning.
we may have some completely different experiences, but we also share a lot of them too. just remember that we're all struggling in one way or another and we have to stick together and treat each other with love and kindness. spread positivity, we all need it right now. stay safe out there everybody, love y'all :)
I am a parent of a mtf teenager and the only reason I joined r/trans is to support each and every one of you. To love each and every one of you. And possibly offer any advice from my perspective. Let's love like no one's business! Love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è.
Wow.  I don't know what's up with the algorithm driving my feed.  I've been seeing the opposite the last few days (anecdotal at best, I know), with trans men coming over to r/MtF and making the most wholesome supportive posts.  At least one claimed to be inspired by a trans woman making a post in r/FtM.  Am I just seeing the corrective response from that discourse?
I once lurked over on the FTM sub and still do, I posted about a really nice experience I had with a trans man and wanted to show my support to them all as a community. I was feeling particularly poetic and posted the following.

We are two carriages passing in the night in opposite directions. Our goals may be in opposing directions, but we travel the same road to get there. We keep it safe and maintain together.

I still believe this firmly. Our greatest strength is our community. Regardless of which direction we are going in, we are always stronger together.
I finished reading this post and all these wonderful comments so far and just love this community so much. I was bragging about it to the only person I am out to so far so this post is also so timely as everything that comes to me through these subs always are. An extended thank you to everyone here.  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Yeah definitely. I used to follow the ftm sub but after there was a post about trans women shouldn‚Äôt be there that I just unjoined and never went back. I would like to just share knowledge so we all can benefit rather than being told like I don‚Äôt belong. Im not ftm so i get it and usually stay silent but theres still things I could help with and I like helping.
Sad to hear this. In my everyday life I experience a huge solidarity between all the different identities under the trans umbrella.
Discourse in queer spaces is par for the course unfortunately.  Racist gay men, TERF lesbians, white queers not taking action in DEI initiatives etc.
It's nothing new, although it may be new to reddit. As a bi guy, I have been told by gay men that I'm not allowed to go to gay bars, shouldn't be on grindr, and apparently offended someone I thought liked me just for also liking women.

It's not everyone, and hell, it's probably next to no one overall, but it's enough people to make it annoying. The problem is that they are loud, and noticeable
I don't like this divide. As a trans woman I definitely support you guys on your journey no matter what. It's hard no matter what
yeah, there seems to be a lot going on at the moment... i can't speak for the transfem subs, but in the ftm subs there's been a fair bit of talk about transfems invalidating us. though even more recently there's also been an influx of transfems coming onto the ftm sub to either support or learn abiut transmascs, so kudos to them? but yeah. i've seen a lot of trans women saying stuff like ""T is poison"" in joint trans spaces, which is pretty invalidating for us trans men, which means trans men are pissed and complain, escalate escalate escalate and boom, we're arguing about who has it worse again. also trans men annoyed that many joint spaces are predominantly filled with transfems (which isn't really anyone's fault, but it is a tad disappointing for ftm folks).

anyways, we should really just all be friends and respect each other. neither of us have it better or worse. we each have our own unique issues, as well as a few overlapping ones, and we just need to be supportive of each other.
It was a surprise to me to see when I joined the ftm sub. It's what lead me to look around at other trans communities. 

Trans solidarity is really important to me, so I'm happy to see this post :) I think it's vital for us to support each other where we can, there's already so many forces working against us.
I find it both disturbing and highly hypocritical that marginalised groups such as these after being discriminated against by the masses, are discriminating against each other.

They should all fucking *know better.*

Now fucking stick together, the real enemy is the Giant Space Lizard in Buckingham palace
I think a lot of FtM guys are annoyed that there‚Äôs less of them being represented here (maybe less of them on here altogether, which would cause less representation), and then MtF girls are annoyed that they‚Äôre getting blamed for it.

That‚Äôs my theory anyway lol, might not be true.
The second trans civil war billions of lives will be lost and in the end it will be for nothing
Yeah idk it's kinda weird and I honestly have made a point of completely avoiding it because it seems like a bunch of useless inflammatory bullshit
Lol basically r/honesttransgender in a nutshell, just a bunch of bitter people complaining.
I think it's because trans women 1) outnumber trans men on Reddit by a lot and 2) get so much media attention outside of the trans community, that our own community has started to mimic it. 

Idk when this was coined but I think the whole TME (trans misogyny excluded) think has something to do with it. The idea that trans women face a specific type of misogyny that no one else can relate to. When you pick it apart trans masc people can actually have similar problems, but mentioning that is interpreted as ""a man trying to talk over women"". 

Like I had trans women trying to convince me that ALL AFAB people have privilege over ALL trans women.... Virtue signaling is a bigger problem in progressive spaces in general.

In general, marginalized groups deal with a lot of trauma and I think have a tendency to retraumatize ourselves online. So there is a lot of anger and sad emotions that end up getting targeted at each other..

Another thing from a trans guy specifically: ""Feminist"" spaces have a general ""men/testosterone is bad; men = oppressor"" sentiment that came make it feel like trans men don't belong. Sometimes its jokes from bi women about how ALL women are amazing all the time, but they only like two men (bc men are gross) or jokes about men being stupid or grouping all men together to express any grievance with the patriarchy. It's hard for me to find it funny when I had to work so hard at accepting myself for who I am.

Edit: There was also a thing on Twitter about non-binary AFABs trying to ""impersonate"" trans women for attention because they were gnc. A lot of stuff going on on the internet... Trans ppl aren't even close to being a monolith so this infighting isn't surprising.
I straight up left /ftm I got sick of seeing 80 posts of people asking the same question. It frustrated tf out of me so I left. I found another trans sub and yeah there are people asking the same questions but it‚Äôs maybe two or three posts
I have also noticed this, and it makes me sad and concerned. We need to be supporting each other, full stop. I support you all, I love you all.
Be cool if we could just have valid criticism without devolving into shit-throwing contests. Not sure trying to be ONLY positive really works either, but trying to call out someone else‚Äôs transphobia while being openly transphobic to them is very unproductive.
it‚Äôs annoying asf to be honest. the disparity between transmasc and transfemme presence exists in every single online space and yet it is NOT representative of how irl lgbt spaces function and how transmascs and transfemmes are treated. we need solidarity and strength now more than ever
Cannot stand these posts either because they act like ""trans women mostly populate reddit"" is the same as ""piece of media has exclusively trans women"" and call it ""representation"". Like. No. This is not how it works jfc, people existing in their spaces is not fucking representation, it's existing. 

I understand people feel left out and ig it sucks but holy shit can they stop taking it out on everyone else it's annoying
I have no idea what‚Äôs happening, but I just want trans women and men, non-binary people, and those without labels to know that I love you all and wish you luck on your journey. 

You are all amazing people with so much potential. Don‚Äôt give up, you‚Äôve got this. <3
I second this post, even when i did not see anything you describe myself.
I left the r/ftm group about a month ago because the transmisogynistic commentary was so constant.
Really happy to see that I agree with all the comments, it‚Äôs sad to see discourse and I personally find it really sad since these are literally communities and although we don‚Äôt have to get along 100% of the time I hate seeing in these subreddits in particular
Not sure why it has been popping up so much recently, and it's a bit concerning. /srs The mods on the ftm sub made a post about that, so it should resolve itself slowly but surely everywhere, I hope. Apart from the fact that some of those posts may have malicious intent, I did see some transmascs feeling a bit forgotten in shared spaces sometimes, so please do ""suffocate"" us in love from time to time ahah /jk I'm sending virtual hugs to everyone. Please take care of your mental health everyone, I've felt a bit down because of this the past few days. /gen *Hugs* edit : i had put a cute hugging emoji but reddit doesn't like it... :'( imagine very cute hugs <3
why would i argue with/complain about trans women when i could just kiss them instead
At a low level, it's hard for me to empathize directly with trans guys because I can't understand why someone would *want* to be more masculine. But, at a high level, it totally makes sense that different people want different things, and I can certainly empathize and understand why someone would want to change their body. I share in the excitement whenever I see a trans guy post about how flat his chest is, or how deep his voice is getting, or when his beard starts growing, because I know how it felt for me when the opposite happened!

Trans guys and transmasc enbies, just know that this trans girl loves you so much üíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
The only thing I've seen in ftm stuff recently is a lot of trans fem keep posting in masc spaces usually trying to be supportive which is kinda weird but whatever and the stuff that had been going on for a while with like mixed spaces being weird and the people who don't like nb and gnc trans people. Am I missing something?
What I‚Äôve been seeing is that many on /ftm feel left out in trans spaces because they‚Äôre largely mostly mtf. And a lot of trans men feel like we‚Äôre forgotten and mistreated in all-inclusive trans spaces which is why many are protective of ftm spaces. I‚Äôve seen posts talking about how a few ftm people have had experiences in the main trans subs of them being told that they have it easy because they‚Äôre ftm and not mtf and such. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the discourse you‚Äôre talking about, but as someone in the ftm sub I just wanna say that o think a lot of trans men just want a space to talk about their experiences with others who experience the same
I've been reading a lot from both sides and it's honestly all kind of petty, but some valid points are brought up.

In all of the big trans subs, it's mostly transfem posts, which is great for transfem people, but transmasc people often feel left out, and I don't think that's for a lack of posting on the part of the transmascs. Transfem memes seem to be more popular and upvoted in general. Whenever I post a transmasc meme to r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns I tend to get way fewer upvotes than something that's more generalized, and then on those posts I get way more comments from transfem people. Fem and general posts are way more interacted with, and tend to dominate general subs, and that's not the fault of either side, it's more that transfem voices tend to be stronger in group places, and in public. As a trans man I often feel talked over, or not thought of by the general public because a lot of people assume trans women are the only kind of trans person. The number of times I've heard trans men being asked if they were just coming out as feminine when they had been transitioning into a man for years is a lot.

I'm not going to act like the ""T is poison"" posts aren't harmful, but I can definitely understand why transfems would feel that way about it. But the thing is, even cis women have testosterone in their system, just as cis men have some estrogen. It's about levels and balance, if you don't have both it's not healthy. Medically speaking, it doesn't make sense to say that it's poison, you just have the incorrect balance. With part of my transition, I'm opting to keep my ovaries because I don't want to have to start taking E to keep my hormones in balance.

And of course, the biggest issue with shared trans spaces is one person's transition could easily trigger dysphoria in another, but we have to understand that everyone is taking their own journey to help themselves and not make other people comfortable. I'm a trans man, but I'm also GNC, which could definitely make some transfem people uncomfortable, but I shouldn't have to change what makes me happy. And I wouldn't expect anyone else to change for my personal comfort either.

I think the easiest solution is to spoiler certain kinds of posts that could possibly trigger dysphoria for people. Think about others in general and be kind, we're all in the same fight together.
I haven‚Äôt noticed‚Ä¶ but I also want to spread love and love everyone! I guess I‚Äôve been missing a lot of post
Geez that's not cool. I just don't get how the hell anyone could do that to someone who's going through the meat grinder. It's the one thing that should not tear ppl apart with all the madness outside the community. This in fighting will only lead to a chaotic end to the community and each other.
What can you do when you have two sets of genders each going to the other, seeking a new life in the comfort of the other genders' freedoms?

Perfect place to see some friction.

I see issues with all folks, and in turn, I am sure I am missing a lot of info, but ultimately we can all get along.
If having TERF lesbian parents has taught me anything. It‚Äôs that we need to stick together and call out BS when it‚Äôs present.
I feel like this happens every couple of months on Reddit at this point
As a trans girl that haven't seen any of this posts: this attitude that you're describing is very hurtful for the community as a whole.

We are threatened day and night by other people, our unity and love for each other is what makes us strong.

Don't fight my brothers, sisters and siblings, we have to be all together and united to maintain our strength and our community.

I don't know anyone here, but I love you all.
This is very odd, I haven't noticed any of this happening, tbf it's been a while since I've been in those subs. As a trans girl dating a trans man, I hope it goes away soon, and to anyone feeling bad about this, I'm sorry it's happening and I love you all üíñüíùüíñüíù
Well, I love you too!
I love my trans sisters and non-binary siblings! There's no need for hate. I'm transmasc and I do understand that sometimes you wanna talk about man stuff, but there's no need to put anyone else down in the process.

I know there's some frustration with feeling ""outnumbered"" in the FTM community but that shouldn't spell hostility. We're all here together, and everyone's experience is valid. Much love. ‚ù§Ô∏è
<33
People fight with each other and Balkanize into further and further segmented groups until they are completely alone.

Resist the balkanization. We are all stuck on this hell hole rock together. We are all gonna die
Yeah, it's very disheartening to see hate in our community. Us trans folk have to stick together. :( We're all going through the same shit.
Thank you, we love you too <3
no more discourse! let‚Äôs all hug each other please
Seems like immature people who have alot of ingrained transportation still. It's not a competition! And we shouldnt be gatekeeping!We're all valid in our identities!
ayo what? can i have some context because the closest thing i've seen to this is trans men being underrepresented

>Im seeing trans women complaining about trans men. Trans men complaining about trans women.

That's just how it is. I can't really speak for r/ftm but the discourse on r/mtf is just so fucking annoying. I don't have a witty comment, it's just fucking stupid and childish. 

I'm just gonna be upfront, I fucking hate anyone who tries dividing the community, especially those ""all the trans men I met (were rude)"" types. Humbling to remember being trans doesn't make you a good person.

I'm awfully close to unsubbing from r/mtf because it's just getting on my nerves big time
the tired old LGBTGIA+ infighting that does no one any good.

I am very new to my transition, as in I just told my entire family and friends this past week, but I‚Äôve lurked in here for days and I do know what you mean. It kind of killed my confidence a little, but then I‚Äôve seen some seriously supportive and helpful posts that have made me smile so I‚Äôve tried to focus more on those.
Don't worry, people like me who just come here when I get a notif don't see them trolls terfs and other bigots that much, we just see a garden in which we feel at peace, in which we don't feel discomfort scrolling down a lot. There is a natural solidarity that is really showing up. That make family and homies cringe at whatever xenophobic attempt these cringe people are making, don't fear anything, that is what they want.
Defo! Im trans mtf and i have dated a trans guy before, as well as the fact that the person who even made me consider that i wasnt cis was a trans dude as well! So yeah! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Sorry, but I gotta disagree. I think these disagreements are important and that they help people feel their feelings without worrying or feeling ashamed. I get that these posts make some people nervous and stressed, but the community is bound to fight. s I don‚Äôt want my feelings policed which seems to be a common occurrence in the lgbt community.
It's these kinda posts than fan the flames imo.
I never really met a hateful transwoman. I had one who was insecure about herself and projected her insecurities  on me, saying I look like a prepubescent boy, which I was I wasn't on Testosterone... then proceeded to tell me I needed to work on myself but, I didnt say anything about her appearance but she could have really worked on herself too. That being said we dont have much control on how we look like in the first place.

I believe a few things that have stirred up a fight between is that both sides feel dysphoric towards some topics that are being celebrated by the other person. Therefore they could have felt left out. And some things in transitioning is easier than others, which could result in jealousy
I really, really have so much love for all of you and the journeys you‚Äôre all on, myself included (trans woman). üíúüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

As a collective group, I find it really hard to talk about my euphoria and dysphoria, knowing they are the opposites for so many other folks. I don‚Äôt wanna hurt others while venting or sharing my happiness. So I end up just not sharing until I get back to my corner of my binary, with more shared experiences.

Relatedly, when I started my medical transition, I got a therapist so that I‚Äôd have someone to talk to (outside my circle) about the changes. I found an awesome trans man who was a fantastic therapist and things were great, for a while. But as my body began to really change, and I would describe my euphoria, I became increasingly more conscious of what that kind of talk might be like for him to hear. Even if he‚Äôs a professional, he‚Äôs an empathic human, with his own trans struggles. I found myself holding back that stuff after a while.

We have have common lovely things to bond over and threats to band against. But arguing who has it worse or generalizing binary experiences as universal has no place here. Stay amazing, friends!
As a trans woman I just wanna say how much I love and support trans men/trans mascs. I don‚Äôt wanna generalize or anything but so many of my favorite people are trans mascs and their souls are so so beautiful. Stay strong and know that we‚Äôre rooting for you!
I dont understand where the hate comes from. Sure I don't completely relate to what a transman goes through but we share common ground being both born in the wrong bodies. Also I've noticed a lot of transmen I've met/befriended are so much hotter then cismen. Why ya'll so attractive? >//<
Me, an enby in the midst of it all: ü•≤
But... honey... its okay to complain as long as its not based in bigotry. We're a diverse group of people and we can't all get along. I've had MANY encounters with super toxic gaslighting transmen - and I'm not gonna go around being silent about that based on some weird sense of solidarity.

Can we not just be who we are, instead of constantly having to be homogenized?

And while you're doing that whole cutesy checking privilege thing.

I find it real fucking interesting that your solidarity posts fails to mention the BIPOC trans segment and you seem oblivious to the collossal amounts of racism that happens in white trans circles.

But hey, you do you. yeah Im a bitch.
Ok now I‚Äôm curious, what are trans women complaint about in regards to trans men and what are trans women complaining about in regards to trans men?
People will be people.

I just use the downvote button if I see someone acting like a jerk.

I've even seen mods acting like shits before and got banned for calling them out. (not here, another sub, obviously)
I've only seen one post like that tho I only follow the r/trans subreddit and that one time all I did was comment that I disagreed and then me and my friends had a conversation so I could make sure they were good people and supported transfemmes (which they did, if they hadn't I would have stopped talking to them) so you got three transmascs (he/him for one, he/they for another, and it/he/they for me) and one nonbinary person (they/they) who wholeheartedly support 1000000% of the community
I've experienced lots of toxicity from fellow trans ppl, especially on reddit.
Wait, what? Why?
The only posts I've seen on ftm have been posts of valid concerns that exist due to trans male invsibility and dismissal that is a very real thing. I don't really look at mtf but I haven't seen any discourse. Moreso posts of people being genuinely hurt at having their experiences and feelings dismissed.
Grasshoppers and locusts are the same species (though not all grasshoppers can become locusts). Grasshoppers live quieter, more solitary lives, and locusts do not. This change is caused by strain on food supply, an environmental stressor. I think that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre seeing this uptick. Things are stressful af for all trans people right now. 

I think sometimes there are some valid issues raised but they‚Äôre mostly, but not always, talked about in really toxic ways. And sometimes the whole of what‚Äôs being said is toxic. The world around us purposefully teaches us the opposite of solidarity and it can take effort to learn how to communicate constructively with someone you have a difference of opinion with. 

All of this means that solidarity is even more important right now though. Even though some of us might be perpetuating some bs right now, it‚Äôs originating outside of our community. 

I don‚Äôt mean to say that we should just allow this bs to flourish in our communities. I just think that sometimes understanding what is happening helps to combat it more easily. 

I personally don‚Äôt call a lot of stuff out because I can barely do life right now. Like I‚Äôm having problems being able to leave my house right now and I haven‚Äôt been able to take care of myself fully for a long time now. That probably isn‚Äôt relatable to some, but we all have our own stuff. I‚Äôm grateful for the people who can and do speak up, and I‚Äôm grateful for the sentiment expressed here and in a lot of other posts. I think it‚Äôs important to remember that the worst voices sometimes are or seem like the loudest and that it‚Äôs not representative of us as a whole.
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, but I love you too OP ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I love all my trans brothers, trans sisters, and non-binary siblings! Y'all are awesome!
Transmasc here, not sure why there's so much discourse recently but I saw in the ftm sub that the mods are gunna try get rid of those discourse posts. We need to keep our trans solidarityüëç
Could be some alt right nutjob psyops nonsense ment to divide the community if you ever see a post like that check the profile and report if nessasary
its just the loud minority, i think.
Sounds like psyops to me.
Where the fuck can i find photos of bottom growth 

Like Jesus fucking Christ please 

I feel like it‚Äôs werid to ask random men online to show me close up photos of there pussy but ffs
It's honestly a freaking mindfield for a transfemme enby who wants phallo without vn. I just need *some* supportive community that can help me through all this.
From your gay brother‚Ä¶ you guys are all super humans!  Full love and support to each one of you.
99+% of trans people love and support each other. I think it‚Äôs safe to ignore the anomalies.
Thank you for your support üíúüíúüíú
I feel weird about infighting in super publicly visible spaces like a subreddit anyway. Who does that benefit? Not any of us as far as I can tell. The people who hate us probably like it though.
I‚Äôm all for banding together with awesome trans people of all genders against shittiness from within the community!

Nothing but love for transmasc siblings and brothers, and non-binary siblings, sisters and brothers
Trans woman here and I 100% agree, we should be dealing with the people who want to see us die on ditches, not each other
I have a feeling that its possibly terfs and truscum tbh. We just need to call it out and report it if they dont relent.
Either trolls or terfs.
Likely terfs, they are known for pulling things like this
Thank youüíú
Id say its probably a mix of Trolls and Terf type of trans folx that are trying to create the dissent between us
Ohh yeah it could be.
Most likely, makes no sense to be fighting each other, also all trans folk I know irl are pretty much all of the same friend group so I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt hate each other, unless they all going for the keep your enemies closer approach
This is my suspicion tbh wouldn't be the first time our community's have been attacked checking profiles are a sure fire way to figure it out most aren't smart enough to know Post history is a thing.
exactly, everyone struggles with different things relating to transness. it's not only about being FTM or MTF or anything outside that binary. It's also about how accepting your family is, your friends, your country, how accessible your healthcare is, if you have dysphoria or not, and how bad it is, how old you are.  


There are so many factors, so saying the other side has it easier isn't right. Specifically binary trans people might be on the complete opposite side of each other, loving a body that the other loathes and vice versa, but we should help each other through that, not fuel hate.
dang I'm sorry that is happening. I wish we could do better.
Honestly this doesn't feel random now that you're saying it, couple of months ago something like this happened and now it's happening again. This is a  planned attack to divide the online queer communities but trans fems and women should maybe try and understand what trans mascs and men go through to understand how to better our relationship with including them.
thank you parent ‚ù£Ô∏è
Good parent *pat pat*, thanks for being so supportive üíôüíñü§çüíñüíô It's so important to be accepting your trans child. My mom is my biggest hero, and she's accepting me so well. Lots of love to you ü•∞

Aw that's so sweet, it still breaks my heart how this is not the default for most parents. :')
>Am I just seeing the corrective response from that discourse?

The timeline matches up with your guess.
well when it goes one way it's invading their personal space and the other way they are thanked
Thats a sweet way of looking at it!!!
Aw, I like how you put it :)
I just woke up and went through everything I missed and im so surprised! It has been very enlightening!!!
huh, i've mostly seen ftm people saying that it's fine for mtf people to hang out there. so long as trans women are respectful and don't dominate the sub, most of us are happy to have you.
I tried to give my two cents about when I was a boy and was downvoted. Once I mustered the courage to post a timeline on the trans discord, but trans men simply continued their meaningless conversation not related to timelines whatsoever and completely ignored it. I won't go to places I'm not wanted and I shouldn't be forced to. This should be that happy middle ground where we collaborate
Agreed, I feel that we can seriously trade our experiences to help each other out. Were all on the same side at the end of the day.
I mean to us T is literally a poison, just as E is a poison for you. Its just a matter of perspective, and I doubt its meant to invalidate transmascs intentionally, but if its really that controversial, I can start calling it out. If feel that many of our overlapping experiences can offend each other in various ways. For example getting erections sends me into a spiral, whereas, talking about starting a PMS cycle could set you off. Its all based on an individual experience as to what offends people unfortunately. The best we can do is avoid making sweeping statements and generalisations. Sometimes things are said that can be taken as offensive but not intended to cause offense, like the poison discussion. 

We just need to work around it and set boundaries. We shouldnt be working against each other, we're far stronger together.
üíúüíúüíú
The what; am I of the loop here?
that is at least also what can be read in one of the post on the MtF subreddit where people asked why it was on the trans women to make more representation for trans men
As a trans girl, I've never really liked a lot of feminist spaces because of that tone you mentioned. Before I came out, I was in a few queer spaces and with all women friends. A lot of them would say they hate men and that I was one of the good ones or how they never really saw me as a man, man. Once a dude walked by our table, didn't even look in our direction, and a girl just scowled and said she hated men. Other times they'd assume I couldn't relate to a sad breakup song because I was a guy and guys were the only ones who hurt people or something.

I dunno, I feel like a lot of progressive people think that dudes have no problems that come from being dudes other than the ones related to not being allowed to cry or not being allowed to be close to friends, and never the ones that they are directly contributing to

i think it's okay for there to be some disagreements, but the level of discourse is just getting higher and higher and that makes me nervous. it's okay to disagree but at the end of the day we need to support each other if we want equality.
Thats valid. I think after seeing all these replies that this has been a net positive. People have been able to come and talk about whats going on and how they feel about it from both sides in an open meeting ground. I kinda like how enlightening all these replies have been.
Do you really think so? Im just trying to spread kindness? And everyone seems to be so nice and polite in talking about how we feel together?
>a lot of transmen I've met/befriended are so much hotter then cismen

Please don't do that. I know you mean well, but to many it can feel invalidating to be separated from cis men (in this case, but it's the same for women).
It's not necessarily that all have to be homogenized, but there's a difference between ""some trans men have behaved badly"" and ""trans men behave badly"" -- I think the latter is what the OP is trying to call out. I've definitely dealt with a lot of bad behavior from trans women, but it's important to remember that those are individuals and that discouraging trans women as a whole from participating isn't a valid solution.
Well you make somewhat of a point even if I feel like you are just stirring the pot for the sake of it. The bottom line is I support all BIPOC and ofcourse I stand against racism too but that wasnt the main issue i wanted to address with this post especially when Im white and its not my place to tell BIPOC people about their struggles. I couldnt do it justice but like I said I love everybody and i want EVERYONE to have safe spaces.
At first glance, I genuinely thought you meant OP was a psyop and started cackling at the idea of a pro-inclusivity psyop promoting understanding & positivity, and it was the funniest shitpost I‚Äôve seen all week
yeah, just downvote them.
Or 4 channers
This
As someone who got caught up in the recent discussion... not necessarily.
To be fair, there's a lot of crossover between those two types.
At this point may as well be the same thing
There seems to be waves with different targets, latest I've seen going around aside from the OP's observation is against sex workers. Those posters usually start out with an understandable if overzealous demand justified with spam accounts and then show their whole ass later in the comments.

Thank you I felt it very strongly, that and I consume entirely too much poetry and Jane Austen. Lol!
Its the same in the MTF sub as well. Ill try better to call out BS though, its not on and while our experiences differ, we're all on the same team.
No one is obligated to talk to you about your experiences
Tbf it's pretty normal for people to continue their ""meaningless"" conversations and not immediately make you the center of attention every time you want to be. Also, about those ""two cents"" --

> Get a buzz cut and ditch the piercings. If you wanna be a man you gotta try and look like a man, not a girlish boy

You might be the problem here.
I don't know how to stay this, so please forgive me if I come off as rude

I don't like the beginning of the paragraph because I don't think there's any trans person that doesn't know it's a matter of perspective, and it sounds a bit dismissive. And I get what you're saying about doubting whether it's intentional or not, but I feel that's kinda a moot point. Imagine how you'd feel if someone used your deadname and they don't know you transitioned. Imagine if you asked them not to do that and they say something like ""from my perspective it wasn't meant to invalidate you, but if it's so important, I won't call you that anymore."" 

I dunno about you, but that would leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sure, they're gonna stop deadnaming you, but it just feels a lil defensive? Idk, I agree with a lot of what you're saying but the way you said it kinda felt like preaching to the choir and a lil weird

Have a wonderful day!
totally. i think if people wanna rant about mtf-specific issues, they need to do that mtf-specific subs. likewise, ftm folks need to keep ftm-specific discussion to our designated subs. otherwise, shared subs like this one get cluttered up with things that only half of the users can relate to in any way. and generally, we need to be more mindful about who might see it and whether that's the right place for it.
I assume they're talking about the queen of England. Not sure what they have to do with trans hate. If anything its the people in parliament that you want to riot against
I also got sick of is [thing that is a super common normal effect of T] normal? And the I'm going on T how do I prevent everything but these one or two things I want to happen?
you‚Äôre so cute ily
Thanks!
Reminds me of when my bicycle seat was stolen...
Your intentions are fine, but I see way more discourse about discourse than actual infighting
Hmm, I guess it could be taken that way, you're right!   


EDIT: I think a lot of the reason why is a lot of trans people in general take much better care of themselves, either because of Dysphoria reasons or just that they're much more comfortable in their bodies after transition.
[removed]
I get it. I'm glad you understood me, though.
Also this
The main difference is trolls get enjoyment out of negative comments, and terfs think they are on a mission to ""save their lost lesbian sisters"" or whatever they lie to themselves about.
I personally think, that knowing you are in the wrong and still doing it is better than thinking you are doing the right thing while you do the opposite.
Oh hey!! That comment was actually on my transpassing post ahahaha. Weird to see it mentioned here

Yeah it was a weird comment and very harsh imo

That's not really a great analogy since that person isn't talking purely about themselves and their own experience.
>queen of England

Did you mean the [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc?

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
[removed]
Very much agreed!
This comment made me giggle, because I've had more than one terf basically tell me that I'm a confused lesbian, or that it's okay to just be a butch lesbian, and I'm just like, ""yeah, I'm not sexually attracted to women"". They get really confused.
This has nothing to do with you being MTF and everything to do with you disregarding and denigrating the feelings of others and still expecting them to drop everything at a moment's notice to cater to you. Maybe their conversations aren't meaningless to them. Maybe they're not trying to conform to *your* idea of masculinity.
You can be honest without potentially making someone feel dysphoric mate

Edit: if you want to give advice like that, say ‚Äúmaybe see what you look like with/without (insert clothing or feature).‚Äù

That‚Äôs a polite way to suggest a change, and it isn‚Äôt going to make them feel bad or dysphoric.
True, it's not a perfect analogy, I'll admit that. It was an appeal to her emotions and a kinder way of saying that I thought she was being a little dismissive in a way I think we can all relate to

The emotion I intended to be evoked was more important than the analogy's accuracy

But yeah, you're right. I made an unfair comparison and for that I apologize
I think you have the wrong Queen of Canada.

But they're trying to be masculine while wearing round glasses and flashy earrings isn't. It's a rhetorical question to ask do I pass dressed in stereotypically feminine accessories. I get it dress as you please, but don't be surprised when you get clocked. That's all
[removed]
He wasn't trying to pass as a masc man, just to be androgynous/not immediately just seen as a woman, and said as much. It's also just bad advice. A buzz cut will rarely make a pre-T AFAB person look more like a man, often it just accentuates naturally feminine features. A couple inches of hair like the person had would give him a better chance.

Also, you didn't say ""If you want to pass as a man."" You said ""If you want to *be* a man.""
The amount of times I've seen cis het men wearing jewelry and ""feminine"" glasses tells me you don't really know what you're talking about. You might have some idea of what masculinity is in your mind, but you should respect that it's not the same as everyone else's.
You seem like a miserable, rude person tbh
Your comment makes it seem like you think being a feminine man is somehow a paradox"	wvhggx	trans	1324	0.98	2022-08-23 06:39:34
Is it actually a trans inclusive bathroom if your restaurant only has a single one-person bathroom with a lock?	A local restaurant was touting their inclusiveness with their gender free toilet.	"As someone who is non-binary, I'd take it over either men's or women's.
It's hard to get more gender neutral than a single toilet with a locking door.
Honestly if they're not gendering it then yeah, it is. A lot of restaurants have 2 gendered single stall bathrooms, which is so much worse when they could just be... not gendered. They have the same shit in them (minus maybe a baby changing station that should be in both bathrooms in the first place). A single stall, non-gendered bathroom actually sounds like a dream tbh
Yes.
It's a restaurant, like that's fairly common, but I've been to a number of restaurants with 2 or 3 single stall bathrooms that are pointlessly gendered.
Yes. This is by far my favorite bathroom situation for a public place to have. Just labelled ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù with no mention of gender so i don‚Äôt have to be reminded of the ‚Äú‚Äùissue‚Äù‚Äù
Hahaha - THE toilet cares not for your gender.
honestly every bathroom should be like a changing room, just several single rooms with the bathroom shit and a lock.
Of course. How would that not be trans inclusive? The only possible next step would be to have a designated trans bathroom and a cis bathroom and that makes no sense whatsoever.
If it‚Äôs a place I‚Äôm not going to be harassed for peeing I call it a win for inclusion in my book üëç
As a cis male who grew up in Europe the weird gappy American stalls are horrifying to me. Single occupancy bathrooms every time thanks!
Yes, yes it is. And the lock is showing they get it.
I mean, by definition it is. I don‚Äôt know how much the restaurant is touting their horn but if it‚Äôs over doing it thats a different problem.
One topic at a time is right! No more gendered bathrooms we need gender neutral pooping stations !
I honestly prefer to have a bathroom like that. As a trans woman who does not pass yet I feel really wildly uncomfortable in either a men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs restroom with other people.
I mean, yeah. Yeah, it is.
Considering they‚Äôll get as much hate as support for doing something like that, I appreciate it. It signals that the restaurant as a whole is likely supportive and safe
I mean it's obviously not intended with trans people in mind but it's inclusive regardless
Yes.  However, bragging about being trana inclusive is usually not because of how moral your business is; its usually just a money grab when they the start talking about how amazing and inclusive they are.

So yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean the company is good.
I went to a CHURCH of all places and they had only gender neutral bathrooms, full restrooms with multiple toilets and urinals but they just had a sign that said ""restroom"", they had one on each floor
I think we should replace the current signage system with a simple plaque on each door saying ""the shittery"" with no allusions to gender.
Is the setup of the restroom something special? No. The sign is, though. It says we value our trans customers more than our transphobic customers.
I have to be honest, I don't get as much flack going into the ladies room when dressed as a man than I do as a woman... just saying.
Bathrooms should just be bathrooms for everyone.  At home you share with your mother/sister/daughter etc. father/brother/son etc.  Suddenly in public spaces that just goes out the window and everybody‚Äôs thinking about each others crotches.
I guess so lmao,
I'd say it is regardless of the original intention when they built the place. 

It sounds like there could be incencerity though if they're aggressively advertising a tiny single occupancy room as gender neutral though. xD
yeah


id say its better than having one with multiple stalls sicne its way safer n stuff
Sometimes, like at many airports, they call it the ""family restroom"" and then they rebrand it all-gender when local politics allow for it.    Idk I appreciate it even if it's a small gesture
I think it counts‚Ä¶ it seems like they are making a point to let their patrons know that non-binary and trans folks are welcome.
The pub that I work at is usually full of older, rough looking blokes and a few women, with smatterings of younger people; at first glance it seems like a proper spit and sawdust pub, but everyone I've met in there is wonderfully inclusive and generally lovely

The toilets, however, are two single stalls, each with a lock, and gendered for men and women respectively. But literally everyone that goes there just says ""I'm using whichever one is open"". Both men and women just roll with it and they may as well be gender neutral. Honestly it's the kind of attitude that makes me feel so safe there and I love it
The most inclusive bathroom scenario is when there is only one option.
Yes.

That's basically the definition of it.
Yes
That‚Äôs the best thing for me personally.
It is inclusive and I‚Äôm all for it. 
In fact I love it. 
:)
So they expended no effort on this one but yes this is technically trans inclusive. I personally am not going to expend one iota of energy being mad at a company tooting their own horn about having a gender neutral bathroom. If they aren't doing anything transphobic, then great. The fact companies now think it's a selling point to be inclusive even if they didn't really have to do much, cool. Goes to show the tide is turning in our favor if including us is something to brag about. And anyway there are way more important things we have to worry about. I don't wanna judge you or anything but this feels kind of like actively trying to find something to be mad about tbh - and I'm the last type of person to say that since I'm a firm believer that microaggressions matter but this isn't even that
uh yea? I would take that over any public bathroom anytime.
Um, yes? That's about as gender neutral as you can be, and I would definitely prefer it over the normal setup. Though there really ought to be two of them if it is at all bigger than a dozen people including staff at one time in there
I love that my local small-town Y has an inclusive change room with nongendered bathrooms inside.  The sign says ""inclusive"" without specifying ""gender-inclusive,"" and the space has a bunch of increased-accessibility features as well. It's large and accommodates several families at a time.  Amazingly for me, groups of teenagers seem to be among the heaviest users, regardless of group composition.  They just seem to like it more, which in my view is totally normalizing an ""everybody just uses this space, what's the problem?"" sort of attitude, which is great.

Though for now I'm still kinda glad there are also gendered change rooms, because the jerks tend to self-select for those and thus I don't need to deal with them.  But hopefully the need to protect the rest of us from them will continue to diminish over time.
It‚Äôs not necessarily ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù in its idea, but in practise yes - it‚Äôs very inclusive and not just for trans people. It prevents ‚Äúbathroom embarrassment‚Äù or interaction autistic, trans and disabled people can‚Äôt stand. It removes the gender fight for NB, unlabelled, questioning, or non conforming people. It allows people with kids or people who need care to use the bathroom privately and without pressure, and it limits bathroom anxiety for a lot of people!
Gendered bathrooms are pointless
I mean, technically, yes. With that setup, it is more or less impossible to exclude anyone.
That's ideal for me. Imo, public bathrooms with multiple stalls in one big room should be done away with. They are only good for enforcing authoritarian gender norms.
Actually in my country, they are not to inclusive with nothing  and it sucks being a non binary person and have the ""woman or men"" only.
Easier than building another toilet I guess
I mean, technically I guess? Lol
You just walk in there and it's a urinal
I mean I prefer to not see people right after I pooped anyways
I see no reason why it wouldn‚Äôt be? But also, it doesn‚Äôt need to go out of its way to be trans inclusive if it‚Äôs trans inclusive by design üòÇ
Eh it‚Äôs marketing which is always a seed of truth under a bunch of crap. Is it a safe bathroom that trans and non-binary people can use without conflict? Awesome, more of that is good. Is it a beacon of inclusivity? No it‚Äôs a building with 1 bathroom and they‚Äôre trying to sell food.
Yes
I'm the manager of a restaurant with a single small non gendered bathroom with a lock. Seeing as how me (trans femme) and one of my employees (trans masc) both use that thang on the reg I'd like to think it's inclusive. Honestly, it's a hell of a lot less stressful than having to worry about using the restroom with others.
I would love that personally.
Well I chose to work at a place just because they had a restroom located in the kitchen.  The corporate place I was at for years wasn‚Äôt designed for workers and management was like ‚Äútake off your chef coat and walk out of the kitchen in front of the entire dining room‚Äù which took 5 mins just getting there, not to mention doing the dirty. I understood that it‚Äôs a cleanliness issue but depending on the weather, personal health and my clothing situation it‚Äôs not always comfortable to be taking off your uniform in front of a full restaurant just to relieve yourself.  also worked at a family owned place back in 2011 and the owner didn‚Äôt care which one I used as long as I came in the morning and kept them clean and cooked the recipes up good.
Sounds like how all that cheap imitation cheese and meat has rebranded as ""vegan"" and is now double the price of the real stuff.
[deleted]
Yes
Figgymint said it best absolutely the best answer
I mean I just hate those public stalls anyway so I‚Äôd say so
yea i‚Äôd say so, i try and use the family bathrooms in public because i‚Äôm usually quick and don‚Äôt feel comfortable choosing a bathroom. As long as there‚Äôs no gender marker i feel like it‚Äôs actually pretty safe using it as a trans person.
I honestly don't give a fuck, if I can make my business there it's fine.
IMO this is a perfect example of gender neutral bathroom.
I wish there were more gender neutral bathrooms. At my school there's only one with two stalls where I always go because I still feel like a creep if I approach the girl's bathroom door and feel like I don't belong in boys bathrooms anymore (especially since I'm full-time now)
All we need is generalised pooping stations, then half our problems are solved
I think it's hard to say the one spot wasn't inclusive in that nobody is special, and everyone has access to it.
Technically yes.
Absolutely. Why wouldn't it be? Anyone can use it and so it is inclusive for everyone.
Sure! I love those bathrooms cuz it takes the worry out for me. Does suck when there is a line for the single bathroom
That's the most inclusive
Yeah?
yeah it is???? like its a bathroom... without gender....
i don't really understand lol. a gender neutral bathroom is a gender neutral bathroom. way better than gendered one imo

it sounds like you're bothered that there isn't more than one stall?
I don‚Äôt see the difference in a bathroom type we all poop the same so why make a big fuss about it right? I have that people get all bend out of shape over this issue and I find most middle age white men figure the trans person to be a Pedophile which that goes to show you how fucking stupid middle aged white men are. Lol I have penis I‚Äôm king lol
*I* don't care about the sign on the bathroom since any bathroom will have what I need.  Some *other* people do.  A great deal.  Which means that I, rather perversely, am forced to care about something that, when you get right down to it, ought to be about as trivial an event as eating.  It isn't as if there are specific men's and women's menus and millenia of social taboo against ordering from the ""wrong"" one after all.
This is how my favorite gay club does it. Though they have like five scattered around the building, one by each bar.
This is why i think there should be two types of bathroom. The pissing and the shitting. Really, does someone go to the bathroom to do something that not these and wash hands? XD but really, one is enough, just people stop bitching about it and everything good
At the university I work at we have full multi occupancy gender neutral bathrooms. It's actually pretty awesome. Everyone just goes about their business like normal
Honestly, God bless restaurants that do this. True allies.
Great answer
This! There‚Äôs a restaurant that I otherwise quite like, and they have 2 bathrooms each with their own door and lock, and they‚Äôre like, ‚Äúbetter put big gender signs on these puppies!‚Äù But why???
In my experience the men's often has a urinal.
Ok sure
Mhm. If I don't have to think about it, it's good.
[deleted]
Oh, it‚Äôs a bakery with good donuts
100% this! I can‚Äôt believe no one brought it up yet (that I saw), but in Sunny in Philly I think they eventually decide to call both bar bathrooms ‚Äúanimal shithouses‚Äù to do away with any gendered distinction on their signage
Sorry, do you mean going to the men‚Äôs dressed as a woman? Or the woman‚Äôs dressed as a woman? 
I‚Äôve never got a reaction either way but I try to be like a ninja so no one sees me.
Oh the building was built before the restaurant
Oh I‚Äôm cool with it, and the place is cool. I just thought it was funny.
A donut bakery
I‚Äôm not bothered
Alcohols. Alcohols are the menu you're looking for.
> It isn't as if there are specific men's and women's menus

Actually ... https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/954656/restaurants-print-menus-for-women-with-no-prices

(in the US litigation kind of killed that off a couple years ago, but it used to be much more of a thing even here)
The uni I attend has a couple single stall locking bathrooms scattered around campus. I found the one at the end of my first semester. They advertise that they exists but omitted them from all the signage. What you describe sounds much better.
What university is this? I work in higher ed too and have only seen this at Carnegie Mellon. It's pretty rare. Thought it was rad as hell
My highschool has this. It's both great and absolute shit.

Great, cause I don't feel comfortable going to the girls bathroom, and shit cause people use it to vape, make out, pass drugs, and just hang out. It's also the only place irl that I've ever experienced transphobia.

Also it's only one. On the second floor in a four floor school. It can be pretty tedious to get to depending on your class :/
Won‚Äôt somebody think of the children?!
Why'd you ask the question if you were going to give a dismissive answer to one kind of opinion?
Is that sarcastic or agreeable? /gen
I meant if it was out of proportion. It‚Äôs good to be inclusive but it doesn‚Äôt make you a saint, especially if they are having their one bathroom be available for everyone.
Which episode? I want to see this now.
When I go into a ladies room dressed like a man, women tend to think I have a good reason to be there. If I go to a women's room dressed as a woman, they tend to think the worst of me.
I'd legitimately forgotten about just how important the gender and sexual implications of alcoholic beverages were when I was in that fuzzy *approximately* of drinking age window until you brought it up.  It's an excellent point.
Is this actually a thing?
I alway thought it was a 'men order for the women' kind of deal way back when.

Still legal in some states, but rare in my experience.
Oh wow I'm sorry about that. When we rolled ours out they just initially transitioned the single occupancy disability washrooms to ""all gender"" washrooms which entailed sticking a sign on it saying so. I'd say that was already obvious though since only one person can go in at a time. xD 

A pretty lame start if I'm honest but now the new buildings have mostly gender neutral full washrooms
It's at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus.
I‚Äôm cool with it. Bathrooms are stressful. I just think it was funny of them to say that they made their one toilet trans inclusive.

OOF I‚Äôm really sorry this reply is so late b u t I think it‚Äôs season 13 episode 6, ‚ÄúThe Gang Solves the Bathroom Problem‚Äù

It‚Äôs v goofy/ridiculous/I‚Äôm sure inappropriate in some ways, but idk I love that show & in turn like the episode & feel like it‚Äôs a good satirization of something as trivial as people even caring abt what bathroom others use 

(& while it can probably be expected from Philly, still heads up for some outdated/problematic terms for genderqueer ppl etc from a character who‚Äôs particularly uninformed, just in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker/a trigger etc <3 )
Do you ask them what they think? Or are in Minnesota or something?
The cis have gendered literally everything from the enjoyment of porn, to what we drink.
Steak for men and salad for women?
I haven't seen it in years in the U.S. but used to see it all the time. Still a thing in Europe.
I‚Äôm trans and my partner uses a wheelchair. We‚Äôve been saying for years that the folks that design these signs think that the genders are m/f/disabled. Running joke.
Well that is great they are ahead of the curve.
Okay? I meant being inclusive to other people does not make you a saint. People should just be inclusive and believing that doing the bare minimum of being inclusive is all you need to do is a bad thing.

And I use saint meaning someone who is looked at as a paragon of morality, not as a christian saint.
Alberta, though I usually do have a good reason to go into the ladies room when dressed as a man.
[deleted]
It's actually generally the way building code is written. They specify m/f/d stalls per occupancy. 

It's why you find things like two single occupancy locking rooms each with a gendered sign instead of two gender neutral rooms. To pass review they need X male and X female rooms, not just X rooms.
[deleted]
I grew up in Alberta! How‚Äôs that place holding up?
First of all, define normal. Second, I'm not a bro.
Did I say I wanted an invitation? I‚Äôm saying that someone shouldn‚Äôt think they are virtuous just because they let people use the bathroom they want. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying that makes you think that I expect an invitation. All I‚Äôve said is people doing the bare minimum for inclusion isn‚Äôt a reason for them to pat themselves on the back.
Well, I make more money as a full time student than as an electrician...

It‚Äôs a virtuous thing to do, they could lose business.

gender has nothing to do with sexual preference

Am I invalidating anyone's identity if I believe lesbians can't like trans men?	"I'm ftm and I've personally never been comfortable being pursued by any lesbians/straight guys. However, I've noticed a decently large amount of transfems identifying as lesbians while dating trans guys on trans subreddits like this and i wanted to know if and how that would be possible?

My gf is trans too *(used to identify as a transbian)* and insists she couldn't love me if she wasn't bi, but I notice a few people say that they have 'exceptions' or that trans guys fall under their lesbian sexuality?

I personally found that idea very insensitive and invalidating. Would a transbian date a cis man? Would those trans girls be willing to date an mlm guy or a straight girl? Would that not be invalidating their female identity? Could an mlm trans guy be dating a trans lesbian? I'm curious because I've never seen it go the other way around and it feels like this stems more from the lack of transmasc representation and the common view of trans men as butch lesbians rather than 'real men'. To me it feels transphobic, as though transmascs are held as a less important identity and can be regarded as female rather than admitting to attraction towards men *(even if it's exclusively trans men)*.  If someone identifying as a lesbian dates a trans man, why would they not want to change their label to something that is inclusive of masculine identities in order to validate their partner?

I really hope I didn't come off as rude or invalidating, I tried my best not to. I'm really curious to hear any differing opinions, does it apply the same or differently for trans women, if so why?

EDIT: Wanted to thank you all for the amount of responses I got, I was not expecting to hear so many people's opinions but I'm glad I did :) I also wanted to apologize to anyone who recieved any harassment in the comments, that was not my intention but I am sorry regardless.

I wanted to clarify a few things: I absolutely agree that lesbians can date enby and masc people, this was referring to (mostly/fully) binary trans men like myself, many of who find it transphobic to be grouped in non-male orientations. I am also NOT going out and telling people what labels they must use so please do not do that to people here!

That being said, I've noticed a lot of people disregarding the bisexuality of people who prefer one gender and invalidating trans men's discomfort and input in this discussion which I find upsetting. My opinion remains largely unchanged, but thank you for taking the time to engage.

Bonus EDIT: For those of you giving me advice for my relationship, sorry for the confusing wording. My gf and I are both bi and happy with our identities, this was not supposed to be about us."	"trans men are men so you are completely right
as a transfem myself, i have thought abt this recently. i do worry abt you transmascs because this is typically how society treats you guys under the LGBTQ+ umbrella and it's totally unfair. my amab bf is straight, because he does his best to look at me as a girl (context, he has admitted that i don't have to get the surgery or even transition because his attraction is far beyond skin deep, so ik he's not taking advantage of me but at the end of the day he doesn't like it up the bum). a partner should do their best to validate their partner. maybe if said transmasc person willingly keeps some of their feminine traits / styles (like maybe if they were a trans femboy, i've seen this before) then you could argue that they have an attraction to anyone with feminine qualities (because that is a thing), but you say this in a way that makes me assume that this isn't the case. i hope people start giving you the validation you deserve brother. i don't think your partner means harm if they are transbian, but try to bring this up to her. communication is key!

edit: i've never met someone who supported me as much as my bf. the first vc he hopped in with me after hearing that i'm trans, he was calling me May and using she/her/hers pronouns. he also got more comfortable with coming out abt his feelings, and trust me the feelings are mutual. we've been friends for 4 or so years, since my junior year of hs. we made the whole school think we were gay but we both apparently actually had feelings the whole time. issue with him is that he hates pp and so he only became comfortable with telling me when i made it clear i'm not keeping mine. he's typically an edgy troll so i was always scared he wouldn't accept me, so when he did respect by name and pronouns i should've known lol. wish he had told me when we were still neighbors.. wish i'd come out way sooner
Nope that is perfectly fair especially if it's a situation of you feel invalidated
Well trans men are men, if a woman is in a relationship with a man that's a straight relationship
I am fully with you generally. Lesbians and trans men historically had a lot more overlap than they do now so folks make cases for inclusion...But I (MTF) for instance dated an amab nb person who would *not* stop calling themselves ""gay"", even after I talked to them about it. It ended up being one of of the primary reasons I dumped them. 


So I get how you feel and have personally felt the same. You're a man.
How I see it, someone can identify with a particular label for their sexuality, and can date someone outside of what that label would imply, but in that case shouldn't use the label to refer to the relationship. 

i.e. someone could identify as a lesbian and date someone outside their typical preference (a man,) so could still identify with the label but shouldn't use it to describe the relationship they're currently in.
It's more invalidating to consider yourself lesbian whilst dating a trans masc imo
The literal way of seeing it is that transbians like women and transmascs are men
Trans men are men, so a girl, cis or trans, being with a trans guy, isn‚Äôt in a lesbian relationship. Thouuuuugh‚Ä¶ some girls really want to make clear they‚Äôre not into cis men, for some reasons. There isn‚Äôt any term saying ¬´I‚Äôm excluding cis men from my sexuality but I‚Äôm cool with everyone else¬ª. Sometimes it‚Äôs just easier to keep the lesbian term, even if sometimes it‚Äôs not really defining ourselves
So yeah, this happened to me. I'm mtf and I thought I was a lesbian. Then this guy comes into my life, I don't know why, but the first time I saw him I nearly fell to the floor. He is trans (ftm), I didn't know it at the time, I thought he was a cis guy. Well anyways, I've been conflicted with the lesbian label ever since, and then stuff started happening between us. So yeah, I'm definitely not a lesbian, at least not right now. The thing is, I've never liked a guy before, he is literally the only one. 

I'm of the opinion that sexuality fluctuates, so for example, I was a lesbian, I couldn't ever be attracted to men, then he appeared, now I'm bi, in the future, I might be still bi, go back to lesbian, or turn straight (please god no). Anyways, what I'm saying is, this are all just labels we use to try and define ourselves, and yes, dating a guy still identifying as a lesbian is invalidating, don't do it.
It certainly feels a bit peculiar to me, but there are some transmasculine people who are comfortable being associated with the phrase lesbian. Heck, technically *I'm* not a lesbian and *technically* my relationship isn't one but we use those terms for each other sometimes. 

If people are invalidating their partners' identities then yeah that's definitely an unhealthy relationship but if that's a term that they feel comfortable with and feels associated with their relationship, I'm not so bothered by it. To each their own, sexuality and gender are complicated and as a nonbinary person i completely get why someone would still feel politically aligned with a gender they don't technically belong to.
What I've heard from trans history actually FtMs are not usually an issue for lesbians and part of that is probably they are not recognize them as real men as a cis guys. But MtFs are topic for them, usually rejected all the way by lesbians . There were a lot of issues in the past and for that reason there was created festival Camp Trans. The acceptance even in LGBTQIA+ community is an issue and usually acceptance of MtFs.
I‚Äôm right there with you. I genuinely believe a lot of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay lesbian but‚Ä¶.‚Äù mind sets stem from compulsive heterosexuality. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs bright up a lot in lesbian subs but rarely mentioned in trans subs.

I used to say I was 99% attracted to women. Then I started reading up on comphet and realized it described almost exactly what I was doing and thinking.

I do feel saying something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lesbian who‚Äôs also attracted to men‚Äù is disingenuous and invalidating. This is a pretty common feeling in cis lesbian circles. Many of them say ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not attracted to men at all and am a lesbian. So these two definitions of lesbian cannot co-exist because they are contradictory.‚Äù

It‚Äôs also going against the core mantra the trans community says over and over. Trans men are men, trans women are women.  If a was dating a woman that kept insisting she was straight, I would feel incredibly invalidated. Because fact is, she would be in a lesbian relationship.

I‚Äôve had women interested in me that clearly didn‚Äôt think of me as a woman, but as a very feminine and pretty man. Like ‚Äúno girl, you can‚Äôt call me ‚Äòdaddy‚Äô would you ask a cis woman that?‚Äù Yes I‚Äôve actually had that happen to me.

Anyways point is I feel sexuality is broad and nuanced, and we have plenty of accurate terms to where we don‚Äôt need to co-opt more widely known labels because they are more generally accepted by the hetero population.
if someone is a lesbian and says that includes trans men they clearly dont see trans men as actual men. obviously gender and sexuality can be complicated and is often more fluid than some people like to think of it as, but yeah thats just transphobic
by definition lesbians are not into men. you are a man. by trying to date you a lesbian is trying to say that she doesn't see you as a man, which. fuck that
No.

Trans men are men. Lesbians are not attracted to men.

It is both transphobic and lesbophobic to claim that lesbian identity had to include trans guys.
I'm a transbian in a relationship with a cis guy.  I'm about a 5 on the kinsey scale but I don't control whom I love

I get where you're coming from and those feelings are valid but love isn't a logical process that follows our sentiments like *I'm not supossed to love this person*
trans men are men so lesbians dating us just invalidates every trans masc to ever walk the planet.
I, a gay trans man, am in a 12 yr relationship with someone who was a lesbian for the vast majority of it. They tried to be straight for like six months. It was terrible. So, we were just a married gay and lesbian. That‚Äôs who we were. 

 The problem I think is that ppl reduce sexuality to just ‚Äòwho I fuck‚Äô and it‚Äôs a lot more nuanced than that. My partner had 20 years of lesbian activism, culture, life behind them when we got together. Had I insisted that they id as straight or even bi *I* would be asking them to erase all that history. And that‚Äôs pretty messed up. It was half their life. So this conversation veers very close to asking ppl to deny important parts of themselves. 

Lastly, who my partner is doesn‚Äôt invalidate me in any way. Their labels don‚Äôt have anything to do with *me*. 

ETA:I‚Äôm a person in my own right. Also some spelling and formatting
You would be invalidating the identities of trans men if you thought that lesbians could.
I have a horrible suspicion some people here saying you‚Äôre forcing others to use labels don‚Äôt see trans men as men. I also feel like you‚Äôd never hear this same question asked the other way around, it‚Äôs both transphobic and lesbophobic to say lesbians can like trans men
Honestly i think youre right. Im a nonbinary transmasc and i welcome lesbians being attracted to me, but binary trans men are men. Attraction at its base might go for expression so i see how some lesbians may be *attracted* to some trans men, but once they know theyre men then they shouldnt pursue that attraction without acknowledging that theyre attracted to a man. Plus, masculine lesbians exist so its not like every lesbian has to be attracted to feminine presentation exclusively.

That said, attraction can also be very fluid and restricting people to labels can just cause distress all around when an exception is found. But if a trans man is not comfortable dating a lesbian who sees him as their exception, then just.. dont date that lesbian and let them know exactly why. You cant stop people from being attracted to you but you can let them know that nothing can come of it if they dont acknowledge your gender.
Of course not. If a lesbian likes a trans man, that's invalidating his identity as a man.
People can identify strongest with one label, but still find people attractive, or another reason they want to be together with that person, that fall outside of their orientation. If that wasn't possible, ace and aro people couldn't date anyone. Labels are more of a guideline instead of hard rules.
you are not lesbian if you like trans men, no
But a lesbian is a woman who likes women, so she can't like a guy? Trans men are men so therefore a lesbian can't like them
Yeah we‚Äôre men so it is invalidating to our existence as trans guys ‚ù§Ô∏è
as a straight female, im attracted to trans men and also cis men, and in terms of how manly they are to me it feels the same
IMO the person comes before the label. Labels should be subservient to the people that use them, not the other way around.
I don't consider you rude or invalidating. 

To me, a transfemme lesbian; anybody can date anybody they like and want to spend time with.  We may have *personal preferences* \- but ultimately, a *person*... is who we are attracted to.
I think this is an interesting question. I am in the camp of saying sexuality is a spectrum and different for everyone. Some folks have different romantic and sexual orientations too so they may use labels that reflect who they would be in a relationship with long-term versus who they might hook up with. Labels and language are supposed to help us create connections but they aren't always clean around the edges. 

As an example, I'm transmasc, but my partner has always used the world lesbian as a label before me. When we got together, my partner asked if it bothered me and I kind of shrugged and said ""so you are a lesbian with an exception."" I know she doesn't see me as a woman so it doesn't bother me. 

Now, if I were casually dating, it might feel invalidating, especially since it's hard to judge sometimes if people really do see me for ME or if they are just good about being respectful of language. 

All of that said, I guess my vague response for myself is ""it depends"" lol
I think many women who‚Äôve been only ever attracted to one man‚Äîcis or trans‚Äîand had everyone else they‚Äôve been attracted to be women would consider themselves lesbians still. Labels are imperfect.
In theory yes it‚Äôs easy to cast judgement and say it‚Äôs transphobic for lesbians and trans men to date but I think real life and relationships have a bit more nuance than that. If lesbians are intentionally seeking out trans men as part of their dating pool that‚Äôs gross imma just throw that out there. However there are instances when two people are in an established relationship and one comes out as trans and both partners are willing to accept the other‚Äôs identity and still love each other because they don‚Äôt see their love or relationship as being about gender. This doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and it‚Äôs okay to break up if your sexualities are no longer compatible, but each couple is different.
I'm an out and proud transbian and around a year ago I was dating a closeted trans guy. During the course of our relationship he came out and we both had an identity crisis because of it. I still really cared for him as a partner despite identifying as a lesbian, and he was questioning whether coming out and transitioning was the right thing to do (for my identity's sake) 

In the end I gave up on putting a label on how I felt about him and just enjoyed the time we had together as a straight couple. We did eventually drift apart and break up and are even better friends than we were partners, turns out he's gay too.

My advice is to not worry about labels and just enjoy the relationship that you do have. Love is beautiful and she's still with you because of who you are as a person, not who you are as an identity xx
My gf and I are both genderfluid lesbians. I'm transfem and they're transmasc and neither of us feel invalidated because neither of us are men. In your case though, it is absolutely invalidating for someone to call themself a lesbian and also be attracted to binary trans guys. If a lesbian is attracted to nonbinary transmasc people I wouldn't say that's universally invalidating but some people may still be uncomfortable with it if they're nonbinary but also identify as a man or are very heavily masc aligned. For example, my ex was a trans guy and he called himself gay even though I was still nonbinary and transfem at the time and I kept rationalizing it to myself by saying ""it's technically okay because I'm not a binary woman so he can still be attracted to me"" when in reality I felt really uncomfortable and invalidated because my identity was still very fem aligned and I felt like he saw me as a guy
People identify their sexuality by what they're primarily attracted to. But sexuality isn't a rule or a box that you have to fit yourself into, it's a manmade concept to help us understand each other. Just because someone who indentifies as lesbian likes a trans-man doesn't mean they are no longer lesbian. But I guess you could say if a woman was to date a trans man it wouldn't be a lesbian relationship but a hetero relationship.
I think people‚Äôs sexual orientation is their own business. None of the terminology is perfect ‚Äî especially in a world where people are becoming more open and less closeted about their transitions and where it is more acceptable that sexuality is fluid. 

If a woman identifies as a lesbian, but falls for a trans guy, she shouldn‚Äôt have to change the label with which she has identified her whole life. She probably finds some aspects of that trans guy attractive because she is *also* attracted to women. It might be based on the shared history of having been raised with similar experiences (Girl Scouts, etc) or it might have to do with what she prefers in bed‚Ä¶.If that bothers you, then that is totally understandable and you shouldn‚Äôt  date that woman. But there are other trans guys who it won‚Äôt bother and it doesn‚Äôt mean those guys aren‚Äôt trans guys or that that woman doesn‚Äôt *really* love them.

Totally different situation, but just to illustrate how complicated these terms can be‚Ä¶.My trans-feminine non-binary partner has identified as heterosexual (meaning attracted to women and female presenting individuals) their whole life. Now they are taking hormones and transitioning ‚Äî and are still only attracted to women. So do they call themselves a lesbian? Even though they don‚Äôt fully identify as a woman?  Calling themselves lesbian or homosexual doesn‚Äôt really fit with the part of themself that still identifies as a man. But what other (commonly-understood) word is there that represents a person who isn‚Äôt interested in men, but also is not themself either a woman nor a man?  Shrugging and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm straight‚Äù might not be all that accurate, but it is what my partner is most familiar with, so they are sticking with it for now. A lesbian who is sometimes attracted to trans guys might find that the familiarity of the label and the identity with the community might outweigh the relative inaccuracy of the descriptor. Especially since identifying as a bisexual means getting a LOT of unwanted attention from cis men.
As a lesbian, I say that you are right and ""lesbians"" that ""like"" trans men are just transphobic chasers.
Well, I am a straight girl, and dating a trans man won't change anything; it will still be a straight relationship, nothing else.
Not really no? Trans men are men and people who identify as lesbians are just attracted to women and those on the feminine spectrum.

Now if you're attracted to men/masc ppl and identify as lesbian for whatever reason then it's whatever.

But if you ONLY like women and those with femme aligned genders but decide to go after a trans man anyways you are transphobic. Major chaser energy.

I'm a transmasc demiboy, and I don't like the thought of dating lesbians or straight men. Not a preference, I just don't wanna date them cause I'm not a woman and my gender isn't femme in anyway. 

I am however a femboy, I like dressing up femme sometimes cause I like feeling pretty. 

My PRESENTATION is feminine, my GENDER is not.

So if a lesbian/straight guy knew this and still wanted to date me (without reconsidering their sexual/romantic orientation) that's transphobic cause they probably see me as a girl. 

Honestly it really depends on the person and their relationship with their partner. If they're both comfortable, then it doesn't matter. 

Lesbians who don't like men/masc ppl are valid, ppl who identify as lesbians but like men/masc ppl are valid.

Lesbians who don't like men/masc ppl at all but go after trans men/transmasc anyway are valid in their identity but they are gross and stinky and I don't like them.
I think its definitely very invalidating when attracted-to-women people are also attracted to trans guys. No doubt. At the same time, i personally (trans woman) identity as culturally lesbian, but sexually pan. I get if that would make trans guys or hell even cis guys uncomfortable but i dont know how else to describe the way i am. Idk.
My experience with dating a trans guy as a lesbian identifying trans women was difficult to say the least. He had amazing qualities but I really struggled with being attracted to him and ultimately that is why our relationship ended. Just want to point out that for the first 3ish months that I knew him I didn‚Äôt even know he was trans. He did finally come out to me at my surprise. I tried to explain to him that I was not attracted to men sexually and that definitely applied to him as I only ever saw him as a man regardless of what genitals he had. I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself dating another trans man or trans masc person because 1 I‚Äôm not in any way shape or form attracted to men or masculinity and 2 a person‚Äôs genitals or reproductive organs do not dictate their gender. So if someone claims to be a lesbian but dates outside of that then they are more than likely using the wrong identifiers or they do not see you as a manü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is definitely a conversation you should have with your partner especially if it makes you uncomfortable. Also yes many people in the community trans or not can be transphobic. It may not be intentional but it is still not okay behavior.

Edit: I just want to add that I did date him because he was incredibly nice and a very loving person to me and my children. I thought that it was something I could adapt to and I did really care about him but ultimately the two of us were trying to force something because of the fear of loneliness‚Ä¶..I really wish that we could have never crossed that line and just remained friends.
If someone identifying as a lesbian is dating someone who is a man in their gender (not necessarily using he/him pronouns, but seeing their gender as male), then it would be invalidating to continue identifying as a lesbian. 

As a trans man myself, I would be offended if my partner still identified as a lesbian. Because Homosexuality refers to someone liking someone of similar gender to themself. In the case of Lesbianism, that means anyone who doesn't identify as a man (so this can include nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, genderflux, etc. individuals). If someone uses He/Him pronouns, but does not identify with male as their gender, then these individuals are not men, and therefore still fall under the Lesbian label. 

I am not one of these individuals, and other trans men like me do not fall under these labels because we are **men**. 

People forget that being Bi and Pan doesn't mean you have to be exactly 50/50 on your attraction towards Male-identifying and Female-identifying individuals. You could be attracted 99 99% to women, or men, or Non-binary genders, and still have that 0.01% that likes that one specific person who's gender is different from those you're usually attracted/have a preference to. Still makes you Bi/Pan. 

To think a trans man is able to fall under a lesbian's sexuality label is very transphobic and makes me very upset. Trans Men are **Men**; just like Trans Women are Women. No if's, and's, or but's. If you don't respect that, then you need to get out of here. üò§üò§üò§

Know you haven't been offensive in your expression of things, OP. While there are nuances to things, there are a few things that are clean cut.

EDIT: After talking with individuals, I do have some amends to my original response to add. 

1) I think the most important thing to denote with some of these things is the intent of and the individuals involved. Some people are going to be okay with it, and that is perfectly fine. You don't have to change your labels if that is something that is what you are most comfortable with. That is something that is important to discuss with at the beginning of a relationship, or before getting into a relationship. 

2) There can be a very distinct difference between binary men, and those who are Non-binaried identifying men (such as those who are genderfluid, genderflux, bigender, etc.) Cause those individuals will have a different opinion about such things than those of us who are binary men, especially binary trans men. 

Those who are binary trans men, I feel a majority of us do not wish to date someone who identify as lesbian, as we ourselves see ourselves as not fallinf into the category of someone in that sexuality. 

Those who differ in labels otherwise are welcomed, so long as no malicious intent is involved c: I think we all just want people to feel safe and comfortable, especially with how much Transphobia and Bi/Pan/Omniphobia is out there, even within our own Queer Community.
I'm with you, though it's a complicated subject and things will differ with each perspective brought to the table.

I'm transfemme, she/they and definitely enjoy causing some gender confusion in others, but lean towards the feminine side of things. Would rather be viewed as a girl first and then share my non-binary with other queer folk who get it.

But I hate it when a cis gay or even bi guy is into me. Gay guy ends up focusing on my amab body parts, which I don't want and state and it usually still happens.... They just want my body, and for the wrong reasons, so pass. Or I get bi cis guys using the ""best of both worlds"" thing... and then I feel awful and like a fetish thing, not a lovable girl. It's frustrating, oh so frustrating. Very insensitive and invalidating for sure... For lack of better terms, they're attracted to your dead self, the parts of you that you are trying to reconfigure, let go and change... They're holding on to those qualities and I just don't think it will result in a healthy dynamic.
When I was earlier in my transition, I thought I was a lesbian. Absolutely no men for me, then my now boyfriend (ftm) kissed me and I realized I wasn‚Äôt all gay.
When I was figuring out my identity I identified as a lesbian for a short stint but mostly because I had some unresolved trauma towards cis-men. Trans-men didn‚Äôt apply to that, they were ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in my mind because we understand the ‚Äú‚Äùfemale‚Äù‚Äù experience of toxic cis men. I realize now that I only identified as a lesbian so I wasn‚Äôt putting myself out there as a single fem-aligned person on the market for cis men. Now I just identify as bisexual, but I‚Äôm mostly t4t
Trans men are men, not ""women lite"", they are men. Lesbians are attracted to women, it by definition excludes men because that is the point. Lesbians cannot like men. Trying to claim otherwise is extremely lesphobic and comes of as conversion therapy rhetoric.

This whole argument is dumb as hell, no one does this shit to gay men, the world doesn't revolve around men. Women can exist without attraction to men. The fact people here are even attempting to claim otherwise is horrifying. 

Also trying to include trans men into lesbianism is insanely transphobic, trans men are real men, it would be no different than trying to say a straight man could be lesbian when that's not real and people pushing that belief are supporting corrective r*pe.
no you‚Äôre not invalidating anyone by saying that. if they like trans men they are not lesbians they are invalidating the men they‚Äôre interested in and prove they don‚Äôt see trans men as men. <3
Genital preference =/ gender preference. Basically, lesbians aren‚Äôt attracted to men. Trans men are men. 
Lesbian means non men loving non men. Enbies aren‚Äôt men, trans women aren‚Äôt men, cis women aren‚Äôt men, so all of these people can be lesbian. Same goes with gay/mlm, just for enbies and men.
Gender is a spectrum, why should sexuality not be one?
Personally I feel that labels for sexuality are just way to confining, for me I think I'm a lesbian but I can get turned on my man too. Just enjoy who you want to and pick a label that you can tell other people when they ask. At least that's what I do üòù hope you find something that works for you guys
We make the labels for the people, not the people for the labels. 

This whole conversation feels _deeply_ confusing to me\*, because... like... they're words? ""Lesbian"", as a category, means different things to different people, to a frankly frightening degree. So does ""gay"". So does ""woman"" or ""man""! 

All of these are labels we give ourselves. They may correspond in some way to some fundamentally natural or biological _thing_, but at the end of the day, they're terms we use to describe ourselves, and if the term doesn't help us understand ourselves or help others understand who we are... The whole thing's a waste of time.

Personally, I've found that fighting over the boundaries, over where these labels start and end, is basically always a huge waste of time. They're words! They mean different things to different people, and the whole point is understanding each other. My partner has at times identified as a trans man, a butch lesbian, or both. You can say ""I don't really understand how a trans man can be a lesbian"", because that's a matter of semantics and understanding (and if he's in a good mood, he might explain how he thinks about it), but to say ""You can't be a lesbian, you're a trans man"" is to miss the point. ""Lesbian"" is not some platonic category. There is no High Council Of Elder Lesbians who are going to come down from on high and separate the self-identified lesbians into valid and invalid, as much as TERFs wish there was. It's all communication. If you're asking if it's ""possible"" for someone who identifies as male to also identify as a lesbian... Well, obviously! You started the thread because you noticed that there were people doing it! üòÅ

I hope any of this makes sense. If I had to summarize, I'd say the TL;DR is ""Yes, _but_ it's complicated and has to do with how you think about language"".

\* Why yes, I _am_ autistic, thank you for noticing
If you take the definitions strictly than yeah, but for me sexualities aren‚Äôt rock solid so a lesbian could have that one man they like and they could be trans. Now a lot of lesbians do this and invalidate trans men so obviously fuck that shit but sexuality is too complicated to give binary answers
I agree with you however, if a lesbian is dating closeted trans male and then, the trans male comes out to them, then the lesbian is not obligated to change their sexuallity even if they stay together.
In my opinion, the labels we use to identify sexual orientation are just descriptors, tools for who we are generally interested in. Sometimes there are exceptions to those labels and sometimes those exceptions are boundary pushers that expand someone's understanding of their sexuality. 

Just because someone is open to dating a particular trans person or because someone who is straight but their partner transitions doesn't mean they need to change the label they self prescribe or leave the relationship. It just means that the label they self prescribed doesn't fit that situation. 

A straight woman and a closeted trans woman start a relationship under the assumption the trans woman is a cis man, then the trans woman comes out and transitions. If the relationship continues to work, then that doesn't automatically make the cis woman bisexual or gay. She may not be open to initiating relationships with other women under normal circumstances, but in a particular situation the label simply just didn't work. That doesn't mean the label ""bisexual"" works either though.
trans men are men. Lesbians who like trans guys aren't lesbians!
If a lesbian likes trans guys, they‚Äôre bisexual. Trans men aren‚Äôt women so they shouldn‚Äôt be pursued as one. If she does, she sees you as a woman instead of a dude.
I agree with you 100%. Being lesbian means not being attracted to men, trans men are men, I would take offense to being sought after by a lesbian or being an ‚Äúexception‚Äù.
At what point are we going to get over this need to have a word to define everything and just let love and passion rule?
Honestly, I am transfemme (mtf) and my girlfriend is straight while I identify as a lesbian. I think it mostly comes down to your preference for how you refer to yourself.
Trans men are men if she's into men she's not a lesbian
A bit. I like people that I'm not sexually attracted to. Ace folk date people too despite their not being a sexual attraction. If they can do it, why can't a lesbian?
You're... a man.... therefore a lesbian.... can't like u
As an AFAB genderqueer person, I don't take offense to any potential partner's sexuality. I think if I identified as a binary trans man (have identified as a trans guy in the past, and it's totally possible that I could feel that in the future) I would feel uncomfortable with that on the surface, and communicate that to a partner if they continued identifying as a lesbian. But as other folks have said here, my partner's sexuality is their own, and has nothing to do with me. So if they explain that they identify as a lesbian because of their experiences and how they view their own identity and sexuality and gender, that's entirely up to them, and I'm okay with that. As long as they're not telling me ""Oh well I'm still a lesbian because you're AFAB"" because that's when it becomes an issue affecting MY identity.

If I were to start dating a straight girl, and she wanted to continue using the label of straight, even though I'm non-binary and queer, that's entirely up to her. If she told me she identifies as straight BECAUSE she sees me as a man, that's when I would be like hmmm I don't like this.

My partner's sexuality is not mine to define. If I'm uncomfortable with the way they view me, or if I feel fetishized in any way, or if I suspect there's some homophobia or transphobia built into their logic, I'm just not gonna date that person. But if I communicate with them about it, and understand that it's a claiming of their own identity, and has nothing to do with my identity, who am I to assign a sexuality to them?

Edit: I read another person's comment here about being demisexual, and I think that applies to where my logic is coming from. I identify as generally queer, but also like identifying as bi, lesbian, demisexual, and a dvke, because those are all the identities I feel belong to me at this point in my life. While I mostly date lesbians, if I were to ever be in a relationship with a man (regardless of them being trans or cis) I would still identify as a dvke / lesbian, because I'm mostly attracted to women, but my demisexuality sometimes allows me to form a romantic connection with men under the right circumstances. If my sexual identity made a trans man uncomfortable, I just..... wouldn't date him. Unless he understood that it's my own identity I hold in relationship to a very personal history of my sexuality and every non-sexual aspect that goes into it, not an identity defined exclusively by my relationship to him.
you‚Äôre absolutely right
Men do not fit in that circle.Women who only find it in women are lesbians and the subsets exist there.Some trans women only find it in trans women.Some cis women only find it in cis women.Speaking from a Pan point of view my opinion.
I'm so glad to see the overwhelming response here agreeing with OP, and recognizing trans men as real men.

I'm in a number of NB/Trans facebook groups and servers which all insist that it's totally normal for lesbians to make exceptions for transmen, to be a transmasc and continue calling yourself a lesbian, etc-- I've never understood these lines of rationing tbh. feels like so much compartmentalizing to me.

I'm not going to tell anyone else how to identify, honestly, but I honestly find all of it kind of ridiculous....
It‚Äôs complicated, because ‚ÄúLesbian‚Äù is both an orientation and an identity/community. It‚Äôs perfectly valid to identify as a lesbian even if you occasionally date men. 

However, if a woman in a relationship with a trans man and calls it a lesbian relationship, that‚Äôs invalidating to the man‚Äôs identity and not a great thing to do.
I feel like most people confuse sapphic and lesbian, event lesbian people sometimes. Sapphic is much broader and can include non-binary and women-aligned people, not exclusively women. Also an orientation precisely describes... An orientation! Meaning, the """" goal"""", not the journey of I may phrase it that way. In other words, an orientation refers to preferences, not to one's actual dating/sexual/etc. behaviour. You can be a lesbian, have relationships with guys and still being a lesbian because, *in general* you prefer relationships with women and/or women aligned people.
It depends. I'm a lesbian, but rarely I would consider dating a man. I don't prefer men over women, but sometimes I'm just into men y'know? That being said, liking a trans man because you consider that person a woman is definitely invalidating them...
Sexuality is a spectrum. Nobody is attracted to a person‚Äôs gender. They‚Äôre attracted to their physicality or perhaps personality. Terms like gay, straight, and bi are too absolutist for anyone, especially if you‚Äôre dating someone who‚Äôs gender queer or currently transitioning
As long as the lesbian isn't doing it in a way that invalidates the trans man's identity (eg ""you're not a real man, so it's fine""). 
But yeah I think even if you identify one way, you are able to date outside of that, and that shouldn't erase who you are.
There was a pretty good show called ""Bob and Rose"" about a gay man who ends up dating a woman. He doesn't say he's bi now. He is gay, but he loves her.
Here‚Äôs my answer: Trans men are men. Lesbians are non-men loving non-men, which then means that if you‚Äôre a lesbian who‚Äôs in love with a trans man, then you‚Äôre not a lesbian because you‚Äôre then in love with a man!
I'm a lesbian, I've always identified as a lesbian and that identity is important to me. Having said that, there have been instances when I will see men who dressed or acted femininely and I have found them attractive. I don't think this should make me not a lesbian anymore.
Yes you are, to your title, because you are pushing your own feelings on other people.

On the other hand, if you are told that you need to feel ok with being pursued by lesbians or that *your female partner needs to be bi to be attracted to you* (üò≥) then you are being invalidated because they are pushing their feelings into you.

Essentially, always respect other trans people's identities. 

It does not impact your identity at all if some trans men date lesbians (or even if they *identify* as lesbians, like some trans men do), just like you aren't invalidating their identities by existing is a trans man who doesn't feel that way.

Gender is super complex and everyone experiences it differently. The beauty of being trans is accepting that.
can't is a bit strong. some people may identify as say lesbian, but then might find a man attractive. identity is not an immovable object, we are not defined by our identity, we define it. that being said, i would definitely tread cautiously if someone said they were a lesbian who were attracted to a trans man. could very well be a true, good faith statement, but a weary eye is valuable in the situation
there is a strong history between the transmasc community and the lesbian community- you will find people who are transmasc and still identify as wlw/lesbian (look up ‚Äúcuspers‚Äù if you‚Äôre curious). but specifically trans MEN and lesbians? i think most would find that invalidating and dysphoria-inducing
I think it depends. If someone identifies as a lesbian because they like 95% of women and 5% of men, that's perfectly valid. I wouldn't be comfortable dating a ""straight"" guy, but that doesn't mean he would have to change his identify; if anything, we should break up if his identity invalidates mine. If other people are okay with dating someone who identifies in a way that doesn't exactly nod to them, than it's totally fine too. They're all just labels.

I identify as gay, but if I met a girl who I liked and we got together, I would call myself bi because I think that would probably tip the 95/5 scale.
Nah‚Ä¶ we have levels to the amount of masculinity and femininity that we are attracted to. That‚Äôs simply your preference and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.
So how I see it is, trans men are men which would make a relationship where its a lesbian and a trans man a straight presenting relationship. Of course, lesbians can still like trans men, because sexuality is a complicated thing and it may be more towards personality than appearance.
I really thought we were moving out of the rigid sexual definition matrix and started moving towards a more analog representation of identity. Everyone here seems to be satisfied with pulling out their dictionaries and drawing the lines of what it means to be a ""lesbian"" and no matter what the dictionaries say this is all going to vary dramatically at the individual level.

To answer your top level question as written, yes, I'd say you are invalidating identities if you believe that X can't Y. It doesn't matter what terms you put in there. People can choose their own labels to help communicate their preferences and needs, and they can exceed and extend those labels however they see fit.
Trans men = men so lesbian excludes them. Trans-masc people don't have to be men so defining lesbians as non-men loving non-men, they can be included, but it's best placed down to the individual whether that label fits for them or not.  
As I am not a lesbian or trans-masc, I leave the issue for defining if the label lesbian means NMLNM or WLW up to others, I more frequently hear NMLNM.  
If someone dates a trans-man because they don't see them as a man so it's ""okay,"" they are transphobic.
Well, I know some lesbians go by the definition ""having a queer attraction to women"" under which a lesbian dating a man would perfectly fine. And while I obviously can't speak for any lesbian but myself, I feel like that definition does a much better job of describing my experience with sexuality, even though the ""nmlnm"" definition still fits me.

All in all, gender and sexuality are both very complicated, and we're all just figuring them out and using whatever labels are available to describe them best.
I mean...kind of? Just because someone is a lesbian doesn't mean they're not allowed to like whoever they like. They're even allowed to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't identify as a woman if they so please. Identities aren't hard rules they're guidelines with blurry borders. People can identify as lesbian one minute, decide they feel bi then be straight and go back to being lesbian and nobody really has any say in whether they're allowed to do that. 

How you identify is a personal choice that only you yourself have any say regarding.
I think it depends on the individuals involved.  Obviously, a lot of female-attracted transmascs feel exactly like you do, and you're perfectly entitled to insist on that boundary in a relationship that you're a part of.  If a female romantic partner referring to herself as a lesbian is a no-no for you, you can express that and, if it really is a deal-breaker for both sides, well that sucks but sometimes people are just incompatible.  

On the other hand, happy, consensual relationships between lesbian-identifying women and transmascs do exist, and I don't think that's anyone else's business - so long as both participants are content.  ""Lesbian"" can mean a bunch of different things in different situations - for example, a woman who is in an open/poly marriage with a man but strictly only hooks up with women may use ""lesbian"" to indicate that she is 100% not open to dating/sexing men, despite obviously being capable of attraction to a man (her husband).  If the husband is trans rather than cis, that doesn't really change anything (unless he has a problem with it, of course).  

Or, what if two AFAB nonbinary lesbians date each other?  Just because they both go on T or get top surgery or both doesn't mean they have to give up the ""lesbian"" identity/community/label if they don't want to. 

But, to be clear, I mean this strictly in the context of mutually consenting individuals using whatever label(s) they feel comfy with for themselves, personally.  When it comes to TERFy cis lesbians objectifying/fetishizing transmascs on the basis that they see them as butch women, that's just transphobic BS.
Your personal label is the one you choose. There are gay men who are in relationships with women and vice versa. But like someone else said, calling that relationship a lesbian relationship would be misgendering someone and be a bit transphobic.
I‚Äôve heard of bi/pan lesbians and I don‚Äôt know how that works in terms of men. About trans women, I‚Äôve seen some gay men wrongly chasing them, not recognizing them as women. There‚Äôs probably something to say about how Grindr‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrans‚Äù tag is used by trans women, trans men, enbies, and cis men with a different intent.

I refer to myself as trans (woman), non-binary, and vaguely masculine nouns sometimes, and I honestly don‚Äôt think sexual orientation even works with me. You‚Äôre attracted to me in a given way to some extent or you are not. Theoretically, I would have the best success with pansexual people.

Identifying as approximately bisexual, I can theoretically be attracted to any gender, but for some reason, no matter what that gender is, the attraction always feels gay.
So, it's complicated.  

Yes, words have meanings.  But Individuals don't always fit neatly into boxes, and if an individual wants to stay in their box or fly the flag or however else they claim the label, for honest reasons, however confusing, I would call them wrong.
unless they're using the split attraction model (as in their sexual orientation is lesbian and their romantic orientation includes attraction to men), then anyone identifying as a lesbian who's attracted to a trans man is either being transphobic or is in denial about their attraction to men. trans men are men, end of story.
I‚Äôm a dude and dating trans men doesn‚Äôt make me straight‚Ä¶because they‚Äôre men. So I‚Äôm wondering of a lesbian dating a trans men might be moreso bi?

Edit: typo
A binary trans man? Yes. That's not right but some trans masc people identify as lesbians and are fine with lesbians because technically they aren't fully men
They can't they are men and lesbian means non-women loving non-women ( nwlnw ) so they cannot love men if they love trans men they'd be bi or any sexuality that contains liking men and women
lesbians are fem-aligned attracted to fem-aligned, along with nonbinary folk  
transmen are not fem-aligned nor nonbinary  


overall, I agree, it seems super invalidating to basically be referring to a transman as a lesbian. that's basically what we've been called all our life because we're not guys, we're just masculine lesbians! (/s) it's the cycle all over again, but with a shitty gloss of paint over it.
I think sexuality is a complicated thing. For example, I‚Äôm transmasc. I usually call myself straight now (attracted to girls & some nonbinary people). But if someone dating me called themself lesbian, I‚Äôd be totally fine with it as long as they didn‚Äôt call me their girlfriend or say we were wlw or anything. I think being comfortable with it comes down to personal preference, but overall saying you‚Äôre lesbian and then being attracted to women, nonbinary people, and trans men but no cis men honestly just says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see you as really being a guy‚Äù. A trans man being a lesbian‚Äôs ‚Äúexception‚Äù is fine, or if that lesbian is also attracted to cis men it‚Äôs fine, but if it‚Äôs just trans men, that‚Äôs pretty iffy.
(Sorry this was kinda rambling and repetitive! I just wanted to share my thoughts)
If sexuality is a broad spectrum, then I believe they can identify as one thing and cartainly act outside that identity in ways some might feel doesn't fit the definition of that label.

And as a trans woman married to a gay identifying man I feel I'm certainly not invalidated, you can't help who you love üíï

Though it certainly doesn't feel validating for people (especially those within the LGBTQ+ community) to knitpick words, labels and definitions.
Labels aren't always absolute, straight people can like the occasional person of the same gender, gay people can like the occasional person of the opposite gender. There are probably instances where this does happen due to transphobia but there are also going to be instances that aren't transphobic. Some lesbians might not like any men, some might like one or two specific men. Trying to define someone else's sexuality for them generally doesn't go over well.

tldr: sexuality is complex and no two people are identical. Let people define their sexuality for themselves no matter how they do so.
I think it's fair to be uncomfortable with that personally but lots of trans men / trans mascs have talked abt how those identities intersect. I'm trans masc (present like a man in a lot of my life also) and my gf is a lesbian. It comes down to what gender means to you imo
""Am I invalidating anyone's identity if I believe lesbians can't like **me**?""

There's no reason to put your beliefs into a generalization. If you don't want to be pursued by a lesbian, cool. Tell your pursuers no, then adjust your internal view.

If someone identified as lesbian and wanted to date ftm, don't worry about it; you've already set your boundary.

What you've written is just waiting to hurt someone's day for no good reason, *even if you're right.*

Have a good day.

Sexuality and gender are fluid. Many women identify as lesbian when they are bisexual because their preference for women is strongest. 

If it bothers you personally, talk to your partner about it.

If this is pertaining to other people's relationships... It's between them and their partner or love interest. 

I used to know a genderqueer lesbian, who at one point fully transitioned and once identified as trans man, then half detransitioned. She now dates a gnc trans man, and neither are bothered by the label lesbian.
I don‚Äôt care what label someone uses and who they are attracted to. Why impose your opinion on someone‚Äôs life/identity?
By being trans men, we aren't cis, so we are therefore inherently queer. Labels are the best term that fits at the time and people evolve. Lesbians also fall under the general queer umbrella. People are allowed to be attracted to anyone they want. No one is bound by a label that they placed on themselves. I will never understand gatekeeping when it keeps out people who are legitimately interested in being with you as a human.
Forcing everyone to accommodate to the same labels serves no purpose and is inevitably ostracizing to somebody. If somebody is a woman who dates women and being a lesbian is an important part of their self identity, it's kind of ridiculous for someone who isn't involved in the situation to insist that that woman drop the identity of ""lesbian"" because they're dating a trans man. Just leave them alone. It doesn't hurt anything. isn't that what we're always telling the right wing crazies? ""Just shut up and let me live my life. I'd you don't like it you can leave."" Why would you not practice the same tolerance you expect from others?
trans MEN or transMASCS? bc you can identify as a lesbian and like a transmasc, but you cant if you like trans men
(bc lesbian is nonmen loving nonmen)
Are you lesbian? 


If not how do you know if they can like trans men or not? Your answers really simple here. Stop over thinking things and focus on your own business
I think some trans mascs use it to signify that while they‚Äôre men they want a lesbian sorta relationship. I couldn‚Äôt tell ya the differences off the top of my head but there‚Äôs def a different vibe between a sapphic and a Hetero relationship for the most part
Technically, they can love men, but not feel romantic and/or sexual attraction toward them.

But yeah, in that context, it's invalidating, it's like saying ""transmen are butches"" or ""transgirls are femboys"".

There's a nuance to make for enbies, but I think most of transmasc enbies aren't willing to be called butches.
Idk. I'm non binary, and for a long time I thought of myself as a lesbian. Because, you know, girls.

Then I got a crush on someone I didn't know all that much about, asked around, and found out he was a trans dude. 

I spent a good while thinking about what this meant. Because I still liked him. I didn't think of him as anything other than a cute guy with great hair. But I never thought of myself as bisexual. I don't know. 

We're dating now, and I still don't know. I've never really told anyone I was a lesbian in the first place, so now my official position is that my sexuality is unlabeled. I like most girls, I like some guys, and fuck if I don't like non binary folk. No labels, no worries.
Trans men are men. So even if they're pre transition and a lesbian, not knowing theyre a man, has a physical attraction, when they realize the person is male, they should understand he will look more and more male over time and that he wouldnt want to be treated like a girl.
this isnt real, you are living in an echo chamber, no one in the real world cares, just fuck who u want
I identify as a lesbian because I am exclusively attracted to romantic relationships with women. I am also in a romantic relationship with two men. One is cis, one is ftm. 

Because I identify as NB, my partners and I usually just use the term ‚Äúqueer‚Äù relationship. I think that is the MOST appropriate when genders are blended. The way you identify isn‚Äôt changed based on who you are with‚Äîthe identity of the relationship changes based on who you are with.

So calling myself a lesbian (something I realized after being married nine years and with my girlfriend who is now a man), is still correct. But the fact that they are both men excludes me from saying I‚Äôm in a wlw relationship.
To the best of my understanding, their are trans men that identify as butch/masc lesbians and trans women who identify as gay femboys/twinks, but that often wades into the realm of Blanchard and other transphobic gatekeepers.  Their ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is that trans people we recognize as straight are homosexuals that are transitioning due to external and/or internal homophobia.

I‚Äôd recommend being a little weary of anyone using these terms.  You‚Äôre gf probably has other reasons, but the trans people that agree with Blanchard almost always have lots of internalized transphobia and typically only except binary trans folks.

Transition changes or reveals many people‚Äôs sexualities.  You‚Äôre gf is probably working out what labels work for her or not.  I‚Äôm in a similar spot.  Being a lesbian always made sense to me, but now I‚Äôm questioning if I might be pan or something else.
Someone may perceive you as a woman/female, but that doesn‚Äôt have to invalidate your own self-perception.

Some people are hung up on genitalia some aren't. It's complicated, personally more trans lesbian woman but also ex cis het. More attracted to femme guys/trans women and trans men. Some trans men are attractive to me since there is some feminity left. Have a aversion to hair but not phased by more masc trans men in some cases.

Like super close to a stereotypical Dyke at work and out. Sexuality is complicated and not binary for me.
They could in the sense of QPRs (queer platonic relationship). They could also be homosexual while also being biromantic
It stems from the different ways we are misgendered.

To the transphobic world, a trans woman is a ""man"" trying to be a fox in the hen house. They generally ignore straight or non-monosexual individuals in opposite gender relationships, or just write them off as gay men trying to trick straight men.

For trans men, they are women who went to claim male privilege, or they are tom boys who are confused.

So, based on those stereotypes, it is less likely to be overtly considered for MLM relationships for a trans woman, because trans women are seen as sexual predators, out to invade women's spaces or trick men into gay sex.

Where as, because in TERF logic, trans men are just confused women, many TERF lesbians will fight that trans men are lesbians, because it continues their own rhetoric. (They often forget that some trans men are gay, because two dudes dating doesn't help their argument.)
I struggle with this. I'm mtf, and I've always felt extremely uncomfortable around men. From my own family to classmates, just...never felt safe around them. But I don't get that sense of danger from trans men. I don't know entirely why but I feel safe and comfortable and can usually pick up on a trans guy because of that. If I were to date a trans guy I would definitely say I'm straight, but otherwise I'm only attracted to women, and I wouldn't likely date a trans man for that reason.
 This entire problem (it‚Äôs not your problem you are completely correct) comes from people not understanding how labels work. You don‚Äôt just say you are one thing if you don‚Äôt fit the criteria for that. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm bisexual if I ONLY like one sex? Same way I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm homosexual and then like two sexes
read the title. answer: No.

edit: read the body text. answer: its something ive seen as well, and i hate it. to keep this brief, whats happening is an overimportance on genitalia when relating to gender. thats simply transphobic. youre right, lesbians want women, think of a vagina as inherently female, and only date trans men (in these particular scenarios) because they *might* have one. thats a horrible reason to make an 'exception'. its not invalidating to say that op. its only the respectful thing to do if youre truly attracted to your partner to identify yourself at least a bit more fluidly in order to include that partner. the invalidation is coming from the other side.
I think it‚Äôs straight, your a guy so I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt.

And this is coming from another bi trans woman
There's this idea of heteroflexible/homoflexible. The idea there exists a spectrum of sexualities from fully being attracted only the opposite gender to fully being attracted to the same gender. this 'flexible' thing would be when you're on the verge of being fully straight or fully gay.   
On the  hand, this idea seems valid in my opinion. There are reported cases of cis wlw dating cis gay men once on a blue moon and dating the expected gender the rest of the time, so this could theorically extend to transpeople. On the other hand, not even mentioning the binarism of the whole thing, there is something iffy to me, because lot of those hetero/homoflexible stuff I heard were stories about cis lesbians or straight dude dating or having sex with a trans dude. And I do see in what way this could feel invalidating for transmen. This contribute also to my own insecurities as a trans fem lesbian because this is part of the trend of cis lesbians willing to date transmen and not willing to date transwomen.  
I'm not sure those lesbians should drop the label because they partook in this trend once or twice, but i definitely think that if you keep doing it you should have a good think.
I‚Äôve just kinda dropped the lesbian label at all. I‚Äôm just pan. I let my relationships excitedly define and we discuss. I‚Äôm a relationship anarchist so they each are significantly individually that relationship. Many of mine are asexual and we feel close. 

I put more emphasis on being a feminist than a lesbian. I‚Äôm into people who are into feminism and things that don‚Äôt uphold patriarchal exceptionalism. I feel like so many lesbians aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgold star‚Äù and feel separate from gold stars since sex labels get very focused around genitals, and for some reason people think your hangy thing makes your gender, not your consciousness. 

So your man might feel affirmed in a feminist relationship. Many of us I feel are connected to the feminism part of lesbianism but don‚Äôt count ourselves because of it‚Äôs politically/bodily exclusive nature.
Maybe that person's sexuality needs a better term.

For example I was born male, but I consider myself to be non-binary/gender fluid/post-genderist. I'm mostly attracted to femininity. So I like women and trans women. 

But let's be real. Some femme men look just as feminine as trans women, both gay and straight. And I can't deny that physically I'm still attracted to that.

Some might consider me straight because I'm attracted to femininity. But maybe some would consider me to have lesbian tendencies if they consider me to be a woman.

The same goes for men. If they consider me a man then I guess me being attracted to femme guys makes me a bit gay.

So if she's lesbian because she's attracted to a woman with masculine qualities...maybe it's not so weird/wrong/paradoxical. She could like a butch lesbian but not particularly care for boobs or vagina. Does this make sense?

It's all a spectrum. And tbh, I'm not an expert. I had my gender/sexuality crisis at the turn of the new year. I'm new. But this is what makes sense to me.
Eh. Sexuality is fluid and messy. I've had lesbian friends want to have sex with men every so often, and they still consider themselves lesbian.

I'd be very very hesitant to invalidate someone's own identity, if they've told me what it is.
trans men are men, so probably not
Bruh. I‚Äôm chill with that. Trans men are men. All the t4t girls I know that date trans men are masc attracted and consider themselves straight. They date trans men and cis men.

But like t4t is just a higher form of love. Where you love someone for how hot their body is.
If she wouldn‚Äôt gizzly globble on a cis dick, she ain‚Äôt gizzly globbling on mine.
Before anything else, trans men are men, and lesbian saying something like ‚Äúas a lesbian I am attracted to all AFAB people‚Äù comes across as transphobic. That having been said, there is nuance in these terms. 

There are circumstances in which a lesbian might date or have sex with a trans dude. If we‚Äôre using the split model of attraction someone can be sexually attracted to certain groups but romantically attracted to other groups. Would it be inappropriate for someone who is sexually attracted to women but romantically attracted to others or vice versa to refer to themselves as a lesbian? I don‚Äôt think so. 

Rigid labels aren‚Äôt particularly helpful. Ultimately what I want out of these labels is for them to serve people. By holding ourselves to overly strict definitions we make communication difficult. I could say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a homoflexible panromantic abrosexual non-binary woman who is almost exclusively attracted to other women even when my sexuality shifts to include other genders and is open to dating anyone but is only ever seeking women because that‚Äôs where my primary interests lie and dating someone who I may stop being sexually attracted to adds complexity to the relationship.‚Äù Or, because that requires a lot of explantation to express a fairly simple idea, I can just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lesbian,‚Äù and my non-binary partner can be fine with that because they understand that there‚Äôs nuance and flexibility in the language that we use. I refer to myself as queer, but there was a time that I called myself a lesbian and despite all those caveats a couple sentences ago the term was a pretty accurate description of how I navigated the world.

My personal experience is pretty specific, but there are plenty of cases of like lesbians who realized they‚Äôre trans men or non-binary who are now faced with this issue of losing their entire community. Rather than leaving them out in the cold we could just say, ‚Äúif you want to keep being a lesbian you can do that. You‚Äôre welcome here.‚Äù 

There are too many potential edge cases for us to say, hardline, that people from X group must be/do this or that. It would be more useful for us to say that, at the core, [group] are people who [thing], and then treat it as a gradient that radiates in all directions and commingles with other identities‚Äô gradients. This preserves the sort of quintessential image of the group while being inclusive enough to encompass all those who want/need inclusion in the group.
I kinda want to weigh in here, when I had met my ex they where none binary but after month and a bit they said that they where transgender. That never really bothered me because I had loved them either way... sadly it didn't work out in the end, but that's the way life is sometimes
You clearly have a point. For my case, I identify as a transbian, because I'm attracted almost exclusively by women, but it still can be exception. One of my partners is a cis man, so I probably more of a bisexual/homoflexible, but for some reason I hardly identify with that label and I am way more comfortable with the transbian one.

>why would they not want to change their label to something that is inclusive of masculine identities

This sentence you said clearly give me something to think. Maybe identifying as transbian can be bad for my male partner ?

I have already thank about this : does this feeling come from ""internalised heterophobia"" (internalised homophobia as I grew up male but reversed because as trans I'm female) or something like ""compulsive homosexuality"" (same principle) ?

So I don't know how to say that when speaking, but for the writing part maybe something as TransBIan (or Trans-Bi-an would be a more inclusive variations ?

I would like to have people opinions about that :)
This is such a complicated series of discussions, in my opinion, because labels are subjective and not objective. People are free to use whatever label they like and define it as they wish for themselves, but they must also realize that not everyone else will jive with their definition of the label. 
I‚Äôm a trans guy in a relationship with a once hard-core lesbian. The thing is, even before me, my afab nb partner was sexually more expansive than ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù would suggest. My transition has been difficult on my partner, not from an attraction perspective, but from an identity perspective. They have had to reconsider their self label because it made me feel invalidated. 
Ultimately, someone‚Äôs label is theirs to define, but it can still feel invalidating to their partner. If they refuse to consider your feelings, then I see that as problematic from a relationship perspective. If their label is more important than the relationship, then people will end up hurt. 
Open to different interpretations and perspectives! Hopefully I got my thoughts across somewhat coherently.
If a lesbian woman, as in not a bisexual woman with a preference, is seriously interested in a binary trans man post hormones, then she is likely fetishizing at best and transphobic at worst.

I will say humans don't control their attraction, so a pre hormone trans man may be attractive to a lesbian, but that doesnt mean it doesn't then become an issue if she finds out he is trans and decides to pursue a lesbian relationship with him, especially if she then pressures him into delaying a transition for the sake of her attraction. If she says OK maybe I am bisexual and respects his identity as a man in pursuing a relationship that's different.

Gender and sexuality are fluid so it's hard to definitively say any lesbian identified woman attracted to any trans identified man is wrong, but when the binary is established and it becomes a woman only attracted to women being attracted to a trans man because of his vagina and her perception of vaginas=womanhood thats a problem.
I know some trans men and some nb masc people are okay with it, but me personally? I would NOT date a lesbian, I'd actually be insulted if a lesbian tried to date me.
A lot of these terms are used as umbrella terms which is why when you break down into the nuance behind it it can get confusing. Before anyone reads further I would like to reiterate this is just my interpretation and understanding of these terms through the language and history that surrounds the LGBTQ community. Trans men and trans masc fall under the same umbrella but they carry slightly different connotations and blend with other identities in their own unique ways. We all know that the trans umbrella also holds the non-binary umbrella in the non-binary umbrella holds trans masc as well. There's binary trans umbrella (trans men/trans women) and the non-binary trans umbrella (trans masc/trans fem).
Lesbianism is a very interesting especially through the historical perspective because historically the gender concept of what a woman was was directly linked to what a man was. So a lot of lesbians didn't feel like an actual woman because how the gender woman was defined by society was in relation to men when lesbians didn't want any relation to men. This is why the non-woman loving non-woman label applies here historically. The term lesbian has changed in its definition and interpretation through society many times. A lesbian icon for example is Sappho and now there's a new developing sexuality label called sapphic because the modern interpretation of the word lesbian was heavily altered after the terf invasion around/during the 70's. Sapphic is a new reclamation of the original interpretation of the word lesbian (non-man loving non-man). 
So if a non-binary trans masc individual was comfortable being in a relationship with a lesbian through the interpretation of the non-man (still masc) loving non-man it'd be fine. If a binary trans man was in a relationship and the person wanted to continue to refer to them as a lesbian they would be wrong and an asshole. A lot of these conversations rest on the fact that when you're with a person you need to establish what language is and isn't okay with each other as individuals. 
Once again this is just my interpretation of these umbrella labels and individual preferences are unique to the individual because everybody's gender and sexuality has added nuance unique to them that can't easily be contained/commincated with that one umbrella label.
This entire conversation has me wondering what do you call a non-binary person loving non-binary person (nblnb or enbylenby)?
Related Question for other trans men in the comments, do you think feeling dysphoria from someone who identifies as lesbian dating you could be a signifier that you're transmasculine/ trans man? Context: I have been unsure if I'm NB or Trans Masculine for a while now but I feel a bit uncomfortable when I am approached on dating sites etc by people with 'lesbian' as their sexuality or with things like 'women only' in their bio. Do any NB people feel this way or is it mainly Trans Men?
I'm a female (Cis) who has dated a trans female (mtf) and I was strait prior. However I fell in love and had announced a change in my sexuality as Pan. Me dating someone who hasn't had genital surgery isn't saying I'm strait. As I didn't love them for their body. I would still love them if they got surgery or not.
I think it's disregarding of an actual person to date someone based on their biological gender. If your only into females and date a trans male, you are disrespecting their identity and are only seeing their body as their biological gender.

Sadly, trans often get used for kinks, for their body, and so on. It's a common issue and leads for distrust when it comes to dating. I can only dream of how painful it must be to think someone accepts your real identity, but in reality only used you for a kink.
Well, there's a difference between homosexual and homoromantic though
I am all for people identifying however is most comfortable to them, but I do believe that arguing about it is arbitrary and often just ends up being transphobic. I personally believe that lesbian means non-men dating and being attracted to eachother. Trans men do not fit in that definition, and therefore can technically not be lesbians or in lesbian relationships. However, again, I support people labelling themselves however they feel most comfortable. I'm not going to tell a trans man who labels themselves as a lesbian they're wrong. The topic is pretty nuanced and difficult to not offend someone because it's as sensitive as people's identity.
Trans men are men - I'm a transbian and have trans guy friends and don't feel attracted to them.  Great friends, though.
on a simple level, i wouldn't say that's an inherently bad view, but it becomes more complicated when you apply it to people who transition while in lesbian relationships and remain in said relationship and both partners are still attracted to each other.
[deleted]
The thing is... is just like there are people who only dated straight but are actually bi, there are people who date only gay but are actually bi. I think it comes to how society is. A man is seen by a woman dating gay as so unlikely to have those traits like sensitivity, openness, acceptance due to how society feels to be for her, that she just forfeits that playground all together. So its not really invalidation of identity, its more like they arent going to identify as bi if they arent going to date cis men due to their perceptions, even though in a non-gendered society anything would be on the table. I think you get where I am getting at with a transman... she sees them as much safer option which is can firmly confess she will give a chance to as they are perceived to be much more likely to be able to sympathise with womanly issues and be open as people who are seen as born as the sex that is allowed to be sensitive.

These are obviously all stereotypes, but they are most likely subconcious and people just don't realise it...
They can it depends what they like. If a trans man has a vagina it could still be attractive. I know of a lesbian transmasc relationship where she still identifies as lesbian. As well my friends that are straight aren‚Äôt into anything other than a 
Natal penis so trans masc doesn‚Äôt work. But I think it‚Äôs ok to have our own preferences even if it might seem invalidating. You do you and find those that are cool with you the way you are. No one is ever going to please everyone.
It would bother me. 

I‚Äôm also a trans man. I would be really bothered if my partner identified as a straight man, or a lesbian woman. Because I am not a woman. And I believe, if they are using those labels then they are lumping me in with women. 

I recognize Butch female identities. Those are perfectly valid and if they are a he/ him lesbian then that is perfectly fine. 

But I personally am not. 

I would hope my partner would be inclusive of me in the same way I would want my identity to be inclusive of them.
I don't have the same standards as you. People are complicated, they're identities are complex and people don't always expect who will make them horny. I just want to be desired by someone decent who doesn't mind that my desires aren't exactly innocent either.

I don't mind a self identifying lesbian lusting after me. I might just like them back.
No, you're not invalidating anyone by saying that. As an ftm guy, I'm sick of the ""it's not transphobic if trans it's towards trans *men.* It's only transphobic if it's towards the IMPORTANT trans people"" mentality. It fucking *stings.* I agree, we're not your quirky masc girlfriend. Part of the reason I don't date is because I would *hate* to be called someone's ""girlfriend.""

If you identify as a lesbian and have an exception, that I would consider different. Most people use a binary sexuality label, but I think sexuality is fluid/a spectrum, and I think a lot of heterosexual/homosexual people might find there are a few people they'd make an exception for, but that group is so small that they don't change their label for them, if that makes sense. But that's a different can of worms, and I think if you identified as a lesbian then met a trans man you were attracted to you *could* date him, however at the point where you actually started dating him you two would need to have a discussion about what labels he's okay with. I'm at a point where I'm not secure enough in my masculinity to be a lesbian's ""exception"" without feeling invalidated, but I think I could date a bi girl with a preference for women.
I'm a transwoman and actually see myself as bisexual, but I feel attracted more often to women, until I perceive that I'm bi, I felt like lesbian, because until that moment, I only get attracted to women, but then came my first boyfriend, he was a transman (was, because he regret transicioning and identifies as a cis woman now), and changed my label to bi, because I was atracted by him, a man, but we broke up and she told me that she felt like a girl, that being trans was a fase, I don't know, she cheated me so I don't pay any attention to her problems on that moment, and started to think, if she was a girl and just pretend to be a man, what by her words was an error, so I still lesbian and my attraction to her was of two women? And I still on this doubt, until my husband get on the scene, a cis man, and I felt attracted to him, so I perceived, yeah, I'm bi.

So, with this long story, if someone don't make any effort to change their label to include your gender, this person isn't worth your time.
this is basically just the age-old ""I'm not into trans women because I'm not gay"" argument on their part, and is just as invalidating.
As a bi person, I feel like self-bi erasure also might be at play when people identify as lesbians and date trans guys.
Trans men are men and at the same time identity is personal, nuanced, and valid. 

In general terms, no, lesbians aren't into men. 

There are, however, people who identify as lesbians who are or have been attracted to one or more men or group if men.

Both of these things are true.
i feel that it is up to the individual how they want to identify and it's a conversation that should be had between partners. defining anything as objective fact removes the purpose of the freeing nature of the queer community - and if anyone disagrees with me that is fine too.
I agree. Trans men are men.
Personally, my girlfriend identities as a lesbian and I‚Äôm a fairly masc trans guy - I‚Äôm not binary but the non-binary part isn‚Äôt like, fem leaning. But I really don‚Äôt mind because I know her attraction is like‚Ä¶ 85fem/15masc and it‚Äôs easier and gives her a space in her specific community for her to just say lesbian. It‚Äôs not just a description of attraction it‚Äôs also an important community place and personal identifier.

We also refer to our relationship as a queer and as a gay relationship comfortable even though she‚Äôs a girl and I‚Äôm a guy because that‚Äôs what fits our relationship.

Personal identity is very YMMV. I know she‚Äôs not invalidating my gender. But if another lesbian I didn‚Äôt know as well situationally approached me I‚Äôd be like uhhhhhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

So‚Ä¶ Yeah, it‚Äôs situational and personal. Everyone‚Äôs life and personal identity and relationships and the words they used to describe them are different.
So here's the thing: both lesbian and gay are terms that can be used as a standalone sexuality, and part of a sexuality.

I had a friend who was pansexual, but homoromantic. She was sexually attracted to anyone, including men, but she was not romantically interested in anyone but women. So she'd also refer to herself as a lesbian. Another friend of mine was omnisexual, but 90% of her attraction was towards women, so she'd refer to herself as a lesbian all the time, even being married to a man. The way I see it, lesbian can be used the same way we use ""gay"" -- as an alternative to queer, to say ""I am not straight"". Personally, I prefer using ""queer"" because I don't like people assuming I'm only into men, because I'm not. I'm pan, so I'm attracted to anyone within my age group (or older; I have a thing for men in their 40s like whyyyyyy üò≠).

My line is drawn when you don't identify under an mspec sexuality, but JUST ""lesbian"", and ESPECIALLY if you specify ""I am not attracted to men"". If you're not attracted to cis men but you're attracted to trans men, then you're just transphobic. I've straight up called cis people out on their ""I date trans men but not cis men"" bullshit and blocked them, because we are NOT a separate category. I am a man. Being trans is only a part of the descriptor.

Anyone that claims to not be attracted to men but dates trans men is a transphobic chaser. Anyone who's bi/poly/pan/omni, also identifies under the lesbian label, and is attracted to men is fine. If you're feminine-leaning and you want to make it clear to the world that you're not a straight fem and you don't want to use the term queer? You're fine with me. But the moment you have ""no men / men DNI / I hate men / etc."" and you try and hit on me, a trans MAN? Get fucked.

EDIT//
I do want to say, I hold an exception to the ""not attracted to cis men but attracted to trans men"" rule, which is if you're also trans. If you say you're not attracted to men at ALL then that's not gonna fly, but T4T specifically makes sense to me, because a lot of us trans folks have issues trusting cis people in general and feeling safe around them privately due to the rampant amount of violence against us. T4T isn't transphobic, it's a safety measure. Cis people only being attracted to trans men but not cis men, or trans women but not cis women, are transphobic and can eat shit.
Another reason why sexuality labels are very limiting and not fit for purpose most the time. It‚Äôs entirely personal your sexuality and how it interacts with your gender and others gender. I‚Äôm transmasc and my girlfriend is transfem we are both queer but our relationship feels more like a lesbian relationship more than anything else but neither of us are ‚Äòwomen‚Äô üòÜ
It depends.

I identify as a lesbian, because like 99 times out of 100, I am only into women.

But like, I'm not willing to fully rule out being attracted to men (or other genders for that matter) because... it happens.

I could say I'm a Abrosexual Demisexual Demiromantric demipan-lesbian and confuse people, or I can say I'm a lesbian, which gets me 99% of the way there.

If you don't like someone indentifying as a lesbian dating you because they view you as being ""Man-Lite"" that's hella understandable, because that's garbage.

But like, I'd still consider myself a lesbian if I were. And if a partner wasn't okay with that, then we're not compatible romantically, and I would not date them.
bi lesbians arent real and trans men are men you are right
Could be. but why share a marginalizing opinion. live and let live. You do you

Hey, trans femboy here, I would absolutely take offense if a lesbian were to approach me to date without immidiately changing their label or showing willigness to do so. Much less actually be in a relationship with a person who still identified as lesbian, I would absolutely not agree to that.

 I feel like most trans femboys would feel the same, most of us went through a lot of trouble to sort out our gender and our alignment with femininity, and still consider ourselves just as much a man, as any cis femboy or non-femboy cis man would. 

I personally think lesbian means attracted to females and female alinged genders. 

Sexuality is complicated of course, and I arrived at this conclusion about lesbians: Most lesbians who are attracted to butch lesbians still think of butches as fully female.And find masculinity their masculinity attractive spesifically because they are women. But there might be a smaller group that have a more complicted relationship with masculinity and their attaction to it, and might actually be closeted bi, pan etc. Leading to some less considerate or insecure ppl disripecting their partners identity in the effort to finding their own sexuality. At least that's my take on it.
Yes, but they could identify as Bi. Just because you are in a straight presenting relationship, doesn't mean you aren't bi still. 

Same with like beinf aro/ace. Still aro and/or ace even if you're in a straight presenting relationship. 

Combos of these can also exist (like biromantic lesbians, or 

The issue comes when someone identifies as purely a lesbian and nothing else, and then yet is in a relationship with someone who is a man, like trans men. Then that seems like an issue of the person not validating their partner's gender.
I believe nb is always gay
I somewhat understand but would it not be invalidating to a trans man dating a lesbian to hear them call themselves a lesbian in every way outside of their relationship? Being seen as an exception would personally make me feel not wanted or like their attraction to me was a mistake.
this is how i feel! i (AFAB) was dating a gay guy for a while. sometimes relationships transcend gender and sexuality.
So basically they just‚Ä¶aren‚Äôt using the right labels
lesbians like non men. being a trans masc does not necessarily mean you are a man. you cannot conflate trans mascs with only trans men because there are non-binary trans mascs and people who are trans masc with no other added label. 

just like how gay ppl can be trans femme, lesbians can be trans masc.
[deleted]
Yeah i was considering that, though wouldn't someone who specifically doesn't date only cis men still fall under the bisexual umrella?
Tbh I personally wouldn't date someone who thinks I'm super different from a cis man somehow. The only exception is people who are *specifically* only T4T. But yeah, I would certainly never date a cis person who wouldn't date cis men. I would probably assume they're transphobic, at least towards trans men.
yeah, not recognizing trans guys as guys and having problems with dating trans women is 100% a terf thing to do.
I'm glad someone said it. It seems to come down to the fact that some people don't see trans men as men and trans women as women. I think it is as simple as that.
Yeah, research into this still shows a very large majority of cisgender lesbians willing to date trans men, with only a small minority who would consider dating a trans woman.
Exactly how I see it. It never occurred to me that this would even happen, and it makes me really sad to think some self identified lesbians would consider dating trans men without changing their label. 

A good point someone else said though is that being trans masculine is a whole other deal and you can identify as trans masc without identifying as a man, although I still feel this would be a very rare exeption, you'd have to be non-binary and/or AFAB I feel to just barely still fit into the lesbian umbrella. Which I personally at least see as: attracted to female or female (Feminine?) alinged genders. 

Being attracted to trans men and women would still fall under bisexual, and in my opinion trans masculine and women also, just like non-binary and women would. Although I think there's a spesific label for being attracted to those two only as well.
you don't get to define other peoples sexuality
op isnt saying it has to include trans guys.
gatekeeping sexualities
This is a perfect take IMO. Your labels are yours, their labels are theirs, and as long as they don't project their labels onto you it literally doesn't matter.

Are you attracted to them? Do you like them? Is the same true in reverse? Life's too short to worry about anything else.

And as you say, there are lots of non-romantic reasons to have various labels and identities. Gender and sexuality are complicated üòÇ
Thank you for this comment. I've always been of the same opinion as OP, but your comment is making me rethink my position. You bring up a good point. How long someone has identified as a specific label and their role in activism are definitely factors I hadn't considered before
ü•∫ this made me happy
Yep. Many trans men and transmasculine people identify as lesbians, even though they arent women. There is a long story for the word ""lesbian"" and many texts written about how they identify as butch lesbians, but not as women. Labels are as complex as the people using them.

However I understand OP has a point, one might feel invalidated by their partner's sexuality. It's an important dialogue we should have.
So much this. Not to minimize how big a part of someone's identity being able to acknowledge their sexuality can be, but like so many thing in life, straight/gay/lesbian/bi are an attempt to put into discreet 'buckets' something that actually exists on a (or on several, really) spectrums. There's plenty of 'straight' people who aren't a perfect 0 on the Kinsley scale. At the end of the day, the only determining factor as to if one consenting adult is 'allowed' to be attracted to another is... if said adult is attracted to other adult.
 It is, and in my opinion is exactly why using the label of lesbian while in a relationship with a trans man even more inconsiderate and offensive, since there are so many different labels you could use to identify your sexuality that includes your current partners identity.
For some people, but not everyone, and if someone is attracted to only women and says as much, then they shouldnt be invalidating a trans man by trying to hook up w or date them
Lol that's kinda the point of linguistics... like let people keep labels if they want, but dont just throw out the whole dictionary rofl
I think your definition of sapphic is actually what lesbian means, at least the modern, generally accepted definition.

Sapphic is an umbrella term that includes lesbians and bi/pan/omni women/nonbinary people, of course if they want it to. A bisexual woman who is attracted to binary men may choose to id as sapphic to emphasize their attraction to women, or they may use bisexual as their main label but still feel included in sapphic spaces. I believe, historically, lesbian meant this too but over time it evolved to strictly exclude men.

I love your take on this though. I feel like people place too much importance on rigidly staying within the ""official"" definition of a label.
I personally disagree with this, as it does and could invalidate a lot of minorities identities, and also simply I feel isn't truthful. And is and could be deceiving for other people as well, leading to the erasure of other sexualities and gender identities. Especially as a bi trans man, if my attraction women was very small, and I was only attracted to trans women, AND had datedb only men, I would still consider myself bi, spesifically because I am still attracted to trans women. And I would be erasing my attraction to transwomen, and invalidating the existence and identity of transwomen. As well as possibly making people think transwomen aren't real women, among other things.

Basically the same but opposite scenario as what we're discussing.

 Labels for sexuality encompass all of our sexuality, not just parts of it or only spesific parts of it that are a minority you're comfortable invaliding because of bigorty.
‚ÄúNobody is attracted to a person‚Äôs gender‚Äù ü§®
Hey could you maybe put a tw or use a different word when talking about your sexuality. F** is a slur and has been used to hurt people, and while it is ok in private, private ly not the best idea to use it publicly with strangers
Because it‚Äôs transphobic?
But what about the trans man? She's either not seeing him as a man, because as she says, shes only attracted to women, or she is attracted to men. It's not fair to insult a trans man that way and insinuate they're a girl.  And the reason we have labels is because we have language and we wanted something to describe ourselves and use those words to navigate the world and find similar people.  It's cool if someone doesn't want to label themselves, , but we should respect the labels others have and not try to rewrite them.
but If they‚Äôre using it to imply they think your a woman and it makes you uncomfortable then that‚Äôs a dick move
>my girlfriend who is now a man

I'm sorry but that sounds very transphobic and is very invalidating to trans men, even if you are referring to their past self.
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a lesbian dude
Umm. No.
>Some trans men are attractive to me since there is some feminity left.

Please don't say this to anybody, it's invalidating and offensive.

>More attracted to femme guys/trans women

Also this. Not remotely the same category. 

It might be no big deal for you but it won't hurt to be more thoughtful with what you're saying.
Hey, somewhat stereotypical dyke looking transman here. Don't ever include me under the lesbian label. I am a man, and the lesbian label spesifically exludes men. Don't be transphobic. Please and thank you.
psst your wording makes it sounds like bi people can't love trans people, and that is invalidating bi people and making them seem like bad people. You might want to rephrase so you don't hurt bi people.
I‚Äôm really confused, isn‚Äôt being a lesbian being solely attracted to women? I‚Äôm sorry if this is offensive but from what I know being bi and being lesbian are different things
Bisexual lesbians? I‚Äôm pretty sure that doesn‚Äôt make any sense does it? I‚Äôm a non man loving exclusively women but I like all genders‚Ä¶
Bestie what. Bisexual lesbians don‚Äôt exist üò≠
Genuinely confused about this. How can someone be bisexual and a lesbian? Like I can understand aro lesbians or ace trans bisexuals, but isn‚Äôt bisexual and lesbian a mutually exclusive group? Like you can‚Äôt be a gay straight person or a cis trans person? Not trying to be offensive just confused.
BISEXUAL LESBIANS ??? loll
I think where this is an exception to things is that they may be like... say Bi romantic, but homosexual in the wlw/ wlnb way (or visa versa). This is then fine and not invalidating of a trans man's gender, because they are then still identifying as bi (romantically or sexually in this case). You don't have to be sexually attracted to someone to be in a relationship with them. Same with sexual attraction. You don't have to be romantically attracted to someone to be in a relationship with them. 

It is a rare case to see someone who isn't sexually or romantically interested in someone and don't fall somewhere on the ace/aro spectrum.... 

And I know for certain that I would be pretty upset if my partner still identified as a lesbian, and purely a lesbian, while in a relationship with me (a trans man).
This is wrong. Bisexuals are not lesbians. I am wlw, but I also like men
oh no! i meant there are sexualities specific to liking feminine traits. i wasn't saying it's acceptable for a lesbian to like a femboy. i hope that clears things up. i can also understand if that still offends you, just let me know!
Another trans femboy here, and i agree 100%!
Trans non-binary femboy lesbian here üëã you're perfectly valid in feeling invalidated by the idea of dating lesbians, it makes sense for binary men to feel very uncomfortable with that. Especially binary trans men, who would often feel dysphoric in that situation. 

I will add that being a lesbian isn't just about loving femme aligning folks, there are plenty of masc lesbians and even transmasc lesbians as well. I'd encourage anyone confused by the idea of transmasc lesbians (I am one myself and would be happy to answer any questions) to check out r/butchlesbians . It has an amazing community of lesbians all over the gender spectrum! 

I myself am attracted to some masc folks; I'm not attracted to binary men (cis or trans,) but I am attracted to non-binary men in a very queer way, and while internally I'm much more boyish than girlish, my lesbian identity is still important to me and just...feels the most correct, really, is what it comes down to. I love in a queer and sapphic way.
Agreed. Being invalidated by your own partner would be horrible.
What?
The way I see it is that lesbians are more than welcome to be into non-men, but as a transmasc person dating someone who is lesbian-identified makes me dysphoric. That‚Äôs a me problem, not a them problem, so it is MY preference, not theirs.
Many trans men feel that way; I certainly do. But that's not an argument for not believing that someone can identify as a lesbian and also like trans men. People exist who fit that description, so saying you don't believe it's possible is kinda silly. What you can do though is:

* not date them (I don't)

* when you encounter them and it comes up, talk to them about it, and bring up what you said here. Sometimes they have more complex reasoning behind how they navigate their identity, and sometimes it's just weird invalidating crap, and sometimes you can talk them through that crap into either renavigating how they communicate their identity, or how they see trans men. Starting out the gate by telling them they aren't lesbian generally just results in defensiveness, and they're likely to just associate anyone invalidating their lesbian identity as the same homophobia all over again, even though obviously it isn't.
I'm a trans man and I literally don't care. Someone's identity does not invalidate mine.
One person identifying themselves as something cannot invalidate what another person identifies as. Also let's not get radicalized here...
I guess one question is, would a cis man feel invalidated by being the partner of a lesbian, and being their ""one exception""? Heck, a cis dude might even feel flattered by it! 

I know it is more complicated here, but I would argue that being secure in your gender is important. Hard to achieve (I haven't) but a good goal. 

Your partner in the other hand is explicitly invalidating your gender by stating that a person would *have to* be into women to want to be with you. That's a very different thing, and she is being an asshole.
I think sexuality is more fluid and imprecise than can necessarily be exclusively and immutably described by any single label, so if someone identifies with one label and they're not using it in the improper context (such as it would be improper to call a relationship with a man a lesbian relationship) I think it doesn't help much to gatekeep what people call themselves.
I disagree on that definition of lesbian. Lesbians are WLW... however I also see the complicated case where you are coming from where Enby's often times need to be lumped into one group or the other.

I personally would imagine it rather invalidating to be a masc enby, and be told that I am a lesbian if I like other enbys or women... it implies that I would still be a woman.

That being said, I very much am a woman, so I am only guessing how I would feel.
not everything is about men dude. I've never heard gay be described as 'non women loving non women'. If you wanna be a guy and call yourself a lesbian, don't be surprised if women into women are turned off by that.

Also, attraction/orientation tends to be physical. If you're an enby presenting fem, people into fem people will likely be attracted to you. Vice versa for masc enbies.
[removed]
Well sadly it sounds more opened to cis men. I‚Äôm one of those girls myself, and while i could totally fall in love with a trans guy if i bond with them and feel like our journey is similar and brings us closer‚Ä¶ that would never happen with a cis man. So yeah finding the right term is hard, people just should make sure they don‚Äôt hurt anyone in the process
Yes
I‚Äôm not a cis person ? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yeah, I'm personally trans woman Butch lesbian and I cannot really imagine I'm dating cis guy or trans guy omg even I'm preferring females more on masculine spectrum rather than girly girls.
Believe or not, I'm living in that kind of relationship with my cis hetero wife. I'm out to her more than a year and I'm also almost a year on HRT, she doesn't see me as woman, I'm not passing at all and this is probably also one of the reasons she's still with me. If I would go high femme in presentation our relationship would not survive, that's for sure. That's it.
Could an amab trans woman who's also butch not be considered trans masc?
/i/ do not. dictionary definitions, on the other hand, have nothing to do with me labelling other people and everything to do with, you know. human language. words having meanings et cetera
I‚Äôm not saying he is.

The ‚Äúno‚Äù is to his question of whether he‚Äôs gatekeeping. The explanation that follows is why he‚Äôs not.
What do you mean by ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù?

Because lesbians are attracted to women and some non-binary people, not to men. That‚Äôs not gatekeeping.
Are you stupid?
I understand OP's position and honestly I could see myself feeling the same way. It would depend tho. 

If a heterosexual woman wanted to date me and said ""I still consider myself het, but I am attracted to you"" then I'd be fine with it. If she said ""I still consider myself het because you're a man who I'm attracted to"" then I wouldn't be.
It's possible to date someone outside what you're orientation is, or else ace and aro people couldn't date anyone.
I never said you are not free to use the label you feel the most confortable with ? The thing is that labels are, by essence, changing deping on many factors. One of them is, simply, culture. That's why you cannot say : this label means X and only X, because while that might be true for you, it might not be the same for others. Labels are fluid, so are identities.
It's the same thing with bi and pan. They may describe the exact same thing for some people, and not at all for others. But, who cares? Use the label you feel most confortable with, you can even change depending on your environment or feelings or really anything, and that's not up to anyone to force you to use something else just because ""iT doeSnT meAn tHat"".
Also, no identity invalidates others. Some identities that may seem, and may be, very similar can co-exist. Once again, it's more a matter of feeling and others things such as cultural background, and its totally valid to have two labels for the same things, and to prefer one over the other. However, that doesn't not allow anyone to say they know better, and you should use X label instead of Y because they know more than you and your are X, even if you know you are X or feel more confortable with :) be who you are, that's always better than being anyone else
Oh shit yes of course!! So sorry
Accepting identities doesn‚Äôt mean accepting transphobia. I‚Äôm saying that someone shouldn‚Äôt feel justified in having an opinion about someone else‚Äôs labels or identity. 

I don‚Äôt care if your LGBTQ+‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt spend your time trying to gatekeep who can do what with who while identifying as whatever. Let‚Äôs get past that. 

If it wasn‚Äôt clear, fuck transphobes.
It's between those two people, not strangers judging from a distance. Are you really going to walk up to one of those peoples' trans masc partners and be like ""Hey, did you know your partner doesn't respect your gender identity?"" I mean it's absurd.

I am a trans woman. I have a long time partner who is cis female and entered into a relationship with me before I came out as myself. She identifies as straight. Shes not with me because she is a lesbian, she is with me because I am her partner and she chose not to leave me because I transitioned. She sees herself as a more or less a straight woman. If someone tried to tell her she was a lesbian in the face of her insistence to the contrary, that person and I would have a problem.

TL;DR you have no right to tell anyone else what their identity is. Thats literally the entire point of the queer rights movement.
u/gethenmostad apparently this is transphobic to state that you were my girlfriend.
I share an account with my partner. I‚Äôm AFAB but identify as NB femme.
What gives you the right to tell other people their sexuality is invalid?
I would encourage you to check out r/butchlesbians . There are plenty of transmasc, non-binary, and cis butches out there, and this extends to other ways of presentation within the lesbian community as well. 

I'm a trans non-binary lesbian myself, and I play around with all kinds of presentation, but internally I'm much more boyish than girlish. I feel best being feminine in the way that feminine men are, that's just who I am. I'm a lesbian because it best describes how I love: I love queer people who aren't binary men (cis or trans) in a queer way. 

If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer any - even if you think they could be seen as rude or insensitive, my DMs are open as well. Just want to help educate with compassion.
Oh my bad
I‚Äôm not sure what they said, but a lesbian is a non man attracted to a non man, non binary people fit into the label as well

I don't know what exactly the person you're responding to is referring to, but I know personally that I am a pansexual lesbian which, for me, means that I am attracted to any gender sexually, and attracted romantically to people who aren't exclusively men.

That does clear things up, thank you. I do think it's debatable whether or not, and how much if, feminine/masculine traits play a part in sexuality. 

Personally I think sexuality should only be used to refer to what gender/genders one is attracted to. 

Of course there probably are exeptions in everything, but since feminine men are still men, and masculine women are still women, I'd say feminine genders is more accurate than feminine traits.
Yay! Trans femboy solidarity brother! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èü´Ç
I'm confused by your use of Non-binary men. If they are non-binary: they're non-binary, regardless of if they are AFAB or AMAB. Do you mean gendefluid,genderflux, and/or bigender individuals identity as men? 

Cause I think at that point that the person's gender isn't male/ strictly male, and therefore would still fall under the definition of homosexuality as a whole where it is ""genders similar aligning to or the same as one's own gender"". But if you are seeing AMAB Nonbinary folk as ""Men"", then that is kind of invalidating of their gender, even if you aren't intending to. 

I'm not trying to be offensive or anything or call you transphobic if you aren't. I'm just trying to understand, and maybe bringing to light something not considered before.
They're referring to a sentiment that a lot of nonbinary people hold which basically says ""any and every relationship with me is gay regardless of the gender of my partner.""  I'm not saying this is what your partner meant/ that they weren't being invalidating, but as a afab genderfluid enby; I would call my relationship gay even if I was dating a straight cisgendered guy. I'm a boy and a girl and neither so to me everything is gay. 

For example: If I'm dating a trans girl: it's wlw which = gay. If I'm dating a trans guy: I identify as part dude and use he/him pronouns so it's basically mlm = gay. If I'm dating an enby we are definitely going to be gay af togetherüòÅ. This all applies to cis people too.

Ultimately it's up to the people in the relationship to choose how to describe their relationship and to make sure both parties feel comfortable and validated with whatever label(s) they choose to use or to not use. Sounds like your partner was uncompromising about this issue and it's perfectly fine for that to be a deal breaker. Some of us just view it differently so if I were to use the term gay to describe my relationship with a trans man, I wouldn't be doing it to invalidate him/ to imply I still saw him as a girl.

Small note I'd like to add too: if my hypothetical trans  man partner found it invalidating for me to call our relationship gay we would not only have to talk about how his identity was being invalidated, but also how his reaction can be rooted in his own prejudice towards me. (Just stay with me for a second) What I mean is we'd need to breakdown the fact that he doesn't find it appropriate/accurate for me to identify with the mlm community/use the word gay to describe out mlm-ish relationship even though I am genderfluid and identify with being a guy (kind of). Basically, there's layers to this stuff and it goes both ways.
Why would it be a you problem? If they are dating you and calling themselves a lesbian, then they are calling you a woman.. which is a them problem :/
You explained this better than I could. Thank you.
Ofc but there ARE improper uses of things, sexuality is 100% fluid but you cannot be homosexual, then have ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù
I‚Äôd like to say, you can be a woman and be non-binary tho. just like trans men can be non-binary or trans women can be non-binary . 

I don‚Äôt think that you have to force masc non-binary people to be lesbians, but there ARE masc non-binary people who are lesbians. It‚Äôs not our place to decide who identifies as what.

I‚Äôm curious your definition of ‚Äògay‚Äô then ?? because historically there has been a lot of amab individuals who are trans femme who are gay, and from what I‚Äôve seen the community generally accepts them more. but if a person is afab, trans masc and a lesbian - oh no it‚Äôs a crime

because it falls under the same double standards of - ‚Äòoh that person can be a she/her gay, but that other person can‚Äôt be a he/him lesbian‚Äô
You‚Äôre free to disagree but there are a lot of non-binary lesbians who use the term in that way
Enbys are not women-light, so I can't imagine how they are included in the term any more than men.
[deleted]
Oh yes, I absolutely wouldn't mind dating someone who doesn't date cis men, I personally don't either but i still identify as bi to include trans men. I just wish they didn't use the label lesbian since is feels pretty invalidating to me personally, but a more specific label would definitely be welcome!
mm kinda understand what you say (lik I see it more like a t4t thing, like why would someone date a cis), as long as you consider yourself at least bisexual (liking trans men is liking men, they're not less men than the cis ones) I think it's okay, excluding cises because you don't have the same experiences as them it's something normal and makes a lot of sense. the problem would be saying you're a lesbian bc of that (lesbian would include nb people and transmasc lesbians but NOT trans guys).
Didn't say you were? I was talking generally

ETA: I do think you can be transphobic without being cis though. It's pretty common for people in the trans community to believe trans women are real women, and trans men... Well, they're *trans* men.
Yikes. I am sorry you are going through that. My opinion is probably based on an experience I saw between my friend and their ex. He transitioned and his ex said that it is okay essentially because they still have the same genitalia and completely disregarded that my friend identifies as a trans man. It was definitely invalidating for my friend, that's for sure.


 I don't know. I'm a grey pan, so I could definitely be missing something. 


I hope things get better for you and that you keep following the path that allows you to be true to yourself.
Trans masc / trans fem is usually about identity rather than presentation, I think. Maybe if you label yourself according to your presentation then that makes sense. Honestly the terms trans masc / trans fem can be confusing for this reason.
I woudn't say so because her identity is a trans woman, so she would be female, but gender non-conforming.   
A trans man who likes wearing feminine things isn't trans femme, he's feminine, the difference is identity vs. presentation.
butch =/= transmasc though
I think you could, and pretty much fits perfectly to my example of an exeption.
That's more so with the problem of using transmasc/fem as an umbrella term, because not all trans men are masculine and not all trans women are feminine. 
People say transmasc/fem to mean ""something something feminine/masculine spectrum"" but it ignores gnc people who arent traditionally masc or fem, but still male or female. 

So while you're right in getting confused, transmasc usually means ""afab trans person transitioning socially and/or medically to a more male appearance""
Great example.
Those orientations have nothing to do with gender though? So they can't exlude any? It has no relation what so ever to our current topic?
I see your point in a sense, but labels do have a general meaning as to what they apply to or they wouldn't be labels. And you can make labels too, and in this case that would probably be a good solution. 

And yes I can in fact say you can't use X because it doesn't correlate to the label, and because it actively harms another minority. And I can take it personally me being apart of that minority. 

The lesbian label exludes men spesifically, and saying you're a lesbian when you're attracted to trans men or even an indivual trans man, especially if you're in a relationship with them, is transphobic. And gives yet another chance for bigots to harm us, and give innocent people are wrongful idea of the label itself, as well as transmen as a whole.
 I really appreciate your willingness to correct and apologize!  I personally am mostly ok with that word (but I do have some pretty homophobic family who use it) , but I know it can be triggering for lots of people.
Obviously I'm not going to interrogate people! But if someone identifies as a lesbian and goes up to a trans MAN and asks him out, that's invalidating to the man. Yeah she may be physically attracted to his afab traits , but if she is sexually attracted to male traits, lesbian may not be correct, and if she is treating a trans man as his agab, female, he is being invalidated. 
There are always cases of romance where there is deviation from the bounds of a term due to a partner transitioning and the other partner still feeling love for the person, but that is not a reason to  reduce a trans person to their genitals and not respect their gender.  Tldr: love is flexible, but we have words to describe what traits our bodies react to, and even if your body reacts to a person's natal genitals, it's not ok to follow up on that and invalidate their gender.
While I appreciate the attempt to defend me, my partner met me when I was still presenting female and didn‚Äôt even realize I might be trans. 

We began dating while I was still identifying as female. To them, when we began dating, I was their girlfriend, and I‚Äôm okay with that. 

That doesn‚Äôt invalidate me now, and they has never, not once since I began exploring my gender identity, seen me as anything other than a man. 

They are the most supportive, accepting person I‚Äôve ever known, and transphobic is the absolute last thing I would ever call them. 

I think this interaction shows a huge problem within our community. We always want to jump to someone else‚Äôs defense without bothering to dig deeper or to find out if the person we‚Äôre defending even wants or needs it. 

I get that we are a marginalized community, but we‚Äôre alienating our own by invalidating each other‚Äôs desires and needs. 

My relationship is as unique as my identity. Your post was a request to help you be more inclusive and validating if there was a need for it, yet you came into your comments to attack a true ally and to invalidate my own experiences without ever stopping to think. 

Please do better. We have enough enemies from outside the community without tearing down our own and those who support us.

***Edited because I previously used ‚Äúhusband‚Äù which is not an accurate representation of our relationship dynamic. Because they are NB, we use husband, wife, and partner interchangeably, but partner is the most accurate to our overall situation.
If definitions can be used to mean anything, it makes them redundant. 

Fact is, a man can never be a lesbian. Wlw explicitly excludes men. Can't believe anyone would disagree with that.
People who are lesbian are attracted to women, and women only. That is THE literal definition of a lesbian.

I‚Äôm not saying trans women aren‚Äôt women-I‚Äôm trans myself. I was just confused about the labeling they used, I‚Äôm sorry if I said something offensive I really didn‚Äôt mean it but yeah fuck terfs
Cringe
All for bi lesbians, but men being lesbians? Isn't that like trans girls identifying with gay men?
you understand that you‚Äôre fucking stupid right? stop drinking the koolaid and just love who you love dude
>there's been a terf-adjacent movement in modern history to make it mean exclusively loving women

could you please give a source for there being an actual deliberate ""terf-adjacent movement"" to change the meaning of the word lesbian, rather than just.... natural changing of a word's meaning over time?
I think maybe the term sapphic encapsulates what you‚Äôre talking about.
The term lesbian originated in the 1800s, not Ancient Greece, so you may want to update your copy pasta.
[deleted]
That‚Äôs fair!
Well, you can be ace and not aro. I‚Äôm sure there are people who are _romantically_ attracted to all genders but not _sexually_. There‚Äôs def a difference between who you want to fuck and who you want to date, hence ace (but not aro) bisexual. But it‚Äôs my understanding that lesbians are attracted to women and bisexuals are attracted to men and women and nb ppl and the terms are mutually exclusive. Lesbians don‚Äôt want to fuck men and bisexuals do. Idk I‚Äôm not gonna tell anyone how to describe their sexuality I just don‚Äôt understand how someone can be bi and lesbian‚Ä¶like I said you can‚Äôt be gay and straight or cis and trans, they‚Äôre mutually exclusive.
‚ÄúBecome trans‚Äù üö©

Trans men cannot be lesbians. I cannot believe I have to say that and it‚Äôs unbelievably transphobic to think so
No, in Sappho's era, Lesbian meant ""someone living in Lesbos""
Gay heterosexual
Ace doesn‚Äôt exclude an orientation. Ace is a status of how sexual attraction is felt or not felt. Who you can be attracted to isn‚Äôt exclusive to whether or not you don‚Äôt feel sexual attraction.
[deleted]
That‚Äôs different tho
i appreciate your feedback and pov. we all have our views in these things so it's good to talk abt these things
That's what I generally define sexuality as too. I think the whole of this comment section is the community not knowing how to define it. For me I'd say sexuality is gender preference and people can have genital preferences, but that shouldn't be how they define their sexuality because it could invalidate their partner.
My use of non-binary men refers to non-binary people who also identify with manhood; this could mean your examples, yes, and beyond that. I just mean any non-binary person who self identifies as partially a man as well, I hope that makes sense. I'm never ever ascribing this label to a person because of AGAB or presentation, it's entirely up to each individual. 

My attraction as a lesbian is as a bigender non-binary person who loves any queer person who isn't exclusively a man. I love in a queer way, and in a sapphic way, so it's the best term for me.
oh. I get that I have seen it on Tiktok but really mostly in the context of afab nbs dating cishet  men.  I always viewed it as a cheeky way to cope with gross straight men not viewing you as anything other than women to be frank.


I also think it's situation dependent and as my ex was very masc, nearly always used he/him, was not very GNC, and largely swung in MLM circles it did not feel like he was describing it in the way you are.  .


I think you articulated this well and have a fair point but I also think nb folk can't just use ""Im nb and thus it's always gay"" as some trump card to use gay always, I wouldn't use lesbian to describe our amab mtf+amab nb relationship, it's reasonable to ask he/they not use gay.  IMO. in your equivalent trans man scenario it would be more like a lesbian using the term to describe a relationship with you, whether or not you'd find that uncomfortable.


tl;dr the word y'all are looking for is queer.
As a lot of other commenters have mentioned, some people who use the lesbian label define it as not being attracted to binary men. Dictating other people‚Äôs identities is gatekeepy as hell, so I‚Äôm not here to tell them their label is wrong. They know what‚Äôs in their own heart better than I ever will.
No, they‚Äôre not. I call myself a gay man because I basically am, but every now and then I come across a woman that I find just as attractive as I find other men. That doesn‚Äôt mean I think she‚Äôs a man- she‚Äôs just an exception
There are a decent number of non-binary lesbians so being with a lesbian or being a lesbian doesn‚Äôt automatically mean ‚Äúwoman‚Äù. It‚Äôs non men being attracted to non men
But. They aren't calling them a women. 

They're calling themselves a lesbian.
You do realize like ‚Ä¶.being fem doesn‚Äôt immediately mean trans-fem‚Ä¶
Also lesbian is a WOMAN who likes women
I do respect that, I just really dont understand it.
Sorry if i sound ignorant but what if two people like eachother but one is not comfortable dating a lesbian as the label makes them personally uncofortable? Is their discomfort invalid in that case?
[removed]
Totally agree with you. CiMET for Cisgender Man Exclusionary Transgender ? Oh hell it sounds so terfy üòÑ
Well if someday i fall in love with a guy, of course i won‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a lesbian. I mean where would be the logic doing this ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è though so far it didn‚Äôt happen and my preference is still going to femininity, even if doors aren‚Äôt closed
Perhaps you can help me parse this, because I'm thoroughly confused. I'm clearly mixed up somewhere, but I'm not sure where.

I think of presentation as an outward expression, and to me it's quite similar to style, fashion, or aesthetic. So, for example, I'm a closeted trans woman so most commonly (outside of the house) I present as a man. My clothes, mannerisms, speech patterns, etc. are all essentially window dressing, where my gender is quite a bit more feminine than my typical presentation.

So where I think I get tripped up is that I see gender as being a circle that encompasses an area over the masculine - feminine spectrum, and I see those circles overlapping. So what I mean by that is that one's gender identity is in a place on the feminine - masculine spectrum and could easily be categorized as one (or more) of multiple genders.

So I would say that, and presuming that their gender identity is accurately reflected in their gender expression, I would consider Michelle Rodriguez to be more masculine than Michale Cera. I see them as their gender identity existing (again, given the before presumption) in that overlap area.

But as a thought experiment, let's pretend a universe where nothing else changes but their natal gender, making them both trans. Michelle is now amab, but still a girl and has the same gender identity/presentation, and Michael Cera is now afab at birth with everything else the same.

So in that make-believe universe, and not to imply that she's butch, Michelle Rodriguez is a trans woman but saying she's trans feminine feels off.

(And of course I don't claim to know any of their's gender, natal gender, what anatomy they were born with, yada yada yada. Also, i'm only working off of their roles as actors, and haven't seen but 3 movies in the past decade so my conception of them is quite dated. So like, resident evil + super bad if that helps. I'm just looking for something a bit more concrete to make conversation easier)
It does sometimes, there are some transmasc butches as well as cis butches.

Edit: y'all I'm not saying that transmasc folks are equal to butches, that would be absurd and transphobic. I'm saying that SOME transmasc folks are butch and identify with that label, and it's important to remember that they exist since they are so often erased.
I don't think you understand it. Ace and aro people have to deal with the same issue that op is describing, where the partner can feel invalidated by the label used. There are multiple forms of attraction, so someone could still be attracted to a person without that person aligning with the label they use.
It doesn't harm anyone if you make a personal usage of a label. Nothing compels you to force other people in your definitions of labels. You can be a lesbian in a heterosexual relationship because your relationship statut doesn't define your orientation. Such as, when you are a bi person in a heterosexual relationship, you stay a bi person.
 Relationships ‚â† orientation, and that works for any orientation and kind of relationship. Or do you mean it works for *some* orientations and *some* relationships but not all? Wouldn't that be hypocritical? Or maybe, big revelation, your personal views on how relationships should define orientations only concerns you?
 As an example that might be less controversial for you: asexuality. Asexuality is a spectrum, meaning that some asexual people will have sexual relations, and even enjoy it, while some will not. However, they are all asexual, and valid as such, because *they* know they are, while other people are not able to tell that just be observing their behaviour. Same with every other label. 
  Of you want, orientation is such a personal feeling that no word will ever be perfect to encompass all of it. We have to settle on some words to understand each other, but it will always mean something at leat a little bit different for everyone, as everyone's sensibility and experience they link to this label is different. What I put behind the labels I use is very personal and only works for me because my experience as a human being is mine and mine only, and no one will ever be able to understand the depth of my whole experience, making them unable to understand a label the way I do, at least never fully.
Ah shit I‚Äôm so sorry about your family <3 my dms are open if you ever need to vent
I'm not even sure you know what point you're trying to make.
I love you so much.

Lesbians are non-men loving non-men, the intersection of gender-queer folks and lesbians has been a huge part of lesbian culture for centuries. 

Recently, a lot of TERFs have lead to a sudden enforcement of cis-women-only lesbian spaces, but those are NOT the majority of lesbian circles - and the definition of lesbian rejects this ideology as well, trans lesbians in any shape or form (weather binary or not) have always and will continue to be welcome. 

We've had transmasc and non-binary lesbians for most of time - I highly recommend you look more into lesbian history to help understand the importance of trans and non-binary presence as lesbians. 

I know that the assertion that lesbians are only women loving women has been very prominent in the past few decades, so I understand why that would be your impression, but it's incorrect and is a definition asserted on us often by transphobic cis straight women who are trying to erase trans people from women's spaces in some strange twisted version of exclusionary feminism.
That is not the definition for lesbian, nor has it ever been. And unless if you are a lesbian, it's not up to you to decide the definition. As it is currently, in the majority of inclusive lesbian spaces, lesbians include trans women and some non-binary people, if they identify with it. Often this is because a part of them is a woman, i.e. bigender non-binary folks such as myself.

For sure, sapphic and lesbian are closely linked terms

Well, the ""ace bisexual"" thing you're talking about would just be called **biromantic** normally.
[deleted]
Why is that a red flag? Some trans people experience always being trans, but most of the trans ppl I know myself included became trans later in life.

And yes, trans men can be whatever they want. Gatekeeping identities of trans people is what's transphobic.

Wouldn't that be panromantic then?
she didn't specify if it was homosexual or homoromantic though
That's... That's the point...
I think so too! And I appreciate yours. I personally super enjoy conversing about deep topics, and don't get the chance to as often as I would like. :)
Yes exactly! Same goes for fashion & body type.
Ahhhh~! Okay! That makes sense. And again, I think that would fall under Lesbianism in the same way that Homosexuality as a whole can be defined as ""being attracted to similarly aligned and same aligned genders""! Causs it is exclusively Not-Men-Only identity in which you're attracted too!
>it would be more like a lesbian using the term to describe a relationship with you, whether or not you'd find that uncomfortable.

I wouldn't find them identifying as a lesbian uncomfortable for me. It's more like, would I be able to find someone who identified as a lesbian, wanted to date me, and would also use he/him pronouns and masculine words to talk about me? To be totally fair, I don't believe that's likely, but if such a person existed, I'd be fine with their label. That's still just me though and I'm sure other people in my position would have different views.

>tl;dr the word y'all are looking for is queer.

Yes and no. Would queer fit these scenarios? Yes. Is it therefore incorrect to use gay for these scenarios? No. It really is just up to the people in a relationship to dictate what terms are comfortable for them to refer to their relationship as. I'm comfortable calling my relationships gay because for me gay is a broad term. I get your point, using queer is more ambiguous/ less likely to be misunderstood, but I don't think it's wrong to use gay if someone is more comfortable with it (given that all parties in the relationship agree to it).
Like you said,
>it's situation dependent

I honestly think that's the underlying conclusion
You're bi my dude ;)

And the lesbian with a trans-masc BF is also bi, unless they are choosing to believe their partner is a butch-lesbian instead of a guy which is pretty scummy!
That‚Ä¶that means you are bi or pan or Omni‚Ä¶
:( what about us non-binary lesbians?
If it isn‚Äôt your identity then you don‚Äôt have to understand it, you know? Please don‚Äôt speak for masc enby‚Äôs if it isn‚Äôt your place
That sounds more like a compatibility issue. You discomfort is a you problem but it should generally feel good to date someone. If you won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt work through that you shouldn‚Äôt date someone you would resent being with.
Because throwing around the r-slur is a great way to make people feel that you're sound of mind.
[deleted]
I think it sounds terfy because of the implication that you can tell. It sounds like (not saying it is) an assumption that - as GCs put it - you ‚Äúalways know‚Äù whether a guy is cis or trans. If you accept that you won‚Äôt always know, it‚Äôs difficult to say you‚Äôd never be attracted to a cis guy.   
Or, perhaps more importantly, it sounds like maybe you think a trans guy is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù from a cis guy on a fundamental level (other than basic biology), which again is a GC talking point ie that a trans man is not ‚Äúreally‚Äù a man, they are a third gender of some kind. Out of interest, what is it about cis guys that you don‚Äôt like, that you think is ok about trans guys? If it‚Äôs genital preference then I think that‚Äôs absolutely fine (and would obv also exclude some trans girls) but otherwise I wonder if there is some internalised prejudice that makes you think trans men are in some way ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù.
It's ok, I appreciate the offer though. I've cut those family members out of my life and it's been probably 7 years since I've seen any of them!
My point is dont be like ""lol I am exclusively attracted to women! But you, trans guy, I am attracted to you!""  Because trans men are men and should be respected!
You don't need to identify with a label to still interact with that community who does identify with that label.
Absolutely not. It‚Äôs NOT about feminism. It‚Äôs about common sense. A lesbian is a woman who loves another woman. This is just ridiculous at this point. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre cis or not. I trans female IS a female. They have the absolute right to call themselves a lesbian, as they are female.
I said a lesbian is a female who is interested in other females. Trans females are included??? Like idk why you mentioned that in your statement, as that heavily implies you do not see trans women as real women.
Your argument relies entirely on the idea that trans women aren‚Äôt women though, lesbians are women who like women, trans women are women, therefore lesbians can be trans women and lesbians can be attracted to trans women. The main thing that spectated terf ideology from that of a non-bigot is hatefulness and prejudice, it‚Äôs not transphobic just because you‚Äôve heard transphobes say it. It‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable assertion, and like any reasonable assertion can be twisted by the dumb/hateful.
You spreading disinformation
It also doesn't take that much common sense to know that the label lesbian conflicts with the bi label.

The erasure is twofold and you go from saying this is backed by history to ""I actually don't know, it doesn't matter"", even though your trying to enlighten us all.
That‚Äôs fair. If someone said they were ace biromantic or ace bisexual I think I would understand what they‚Äôre talking about either way. Regardless, that only further deepens my confusion over ‚Äúbisexual lesbians‚Äù. Biromantic lesbians, sure, but I‚Äôm still not understanding bisexual lesbian, unless maybe you‚Äôre a person who is sexually attracted to both genders but romantically only women? Like bisexual, femromantic, if that‚Äôs a thing? Idk like I said I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive just confused is all.
Being bigender doesn‚Äôt make you cis and trans at the same time.
Ur very rude lol
If you became trans you're genderfluid
cis itf
Yeah, that person was silly
Asexual and aromantic aren‚Äôt exclusive
OHH üíÄüíÄ LMAOO IM SORRY üßç
Exactly! That's how I see it for myself. 

Labels are very personal and individual, and there's no one right or wrong way to be gay, lesbian, queer, etc. Unless if someone is being blatantly transphobic, ofc, I do really feel for the trans men who have had awful experiences with lesbian TERFs trying to defend their transphobic attraction.
No, I‚Äôm not. How dare you try and dictate my sexuality to me? As a rule, I don‚Äôt see myself with a woman. I don‚Äôt think being able to see myself with a grand total of less than 5 women in my life is enough to redefine my sexuality. 

People don‚Äôt have to redefine their entire identity just because they happened to fall in love with one person that they ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù according to their sexuality.
Yep i used to identify as a gay man until i realised im a bi man who just HEAVILY leans towards gay, then i realised im a bi woman (but now i heavily lean towards straight i guess) if you can find both genders sexually attractive yhen youre some flavour of bisexual or pansexual, if its just a romantic thing then you coukd always be homosexual biromatic?
No it doesn‚Äôt. Who are you to dictate my sexuality to me? I don‚Äôt think finding a woman once in a blue moon attractive makes me anything at all- it‚Äôs called exceptions. As a rule, I don‚Äôt see myself with a woman.
Isn‚Äôt that trixic?
Excuse me? I wasn't speaking for anyone but myself. I guessed how I would feel, I stated it is my opinion... never once did I proclaim any form of universal truth. I get that in these circles, we are often fighting hard to defend and define our identity. 

I don't want to invalidate anyone, but also I struggle myself sometimes. To me, being able to call myself Lesbian is hugely affirming. It is a key part of who I am, and when I am told, as I often get told now, that the definition I knew of the word includes masc people who are not women, it is tough for me to process. It hits at a core of my identity, and I have to try and resist the knee jerk response to gatekeep.

I have always known lesbian to mean women loving women. I do get that enby people have preferences in gender as well, and so they cross circles, it is kind of built into an identity outside of the binary that binary identities become muddled and complex.

So I do struggle with it. I don't know how well I fit in a community, one that I will add is not always the most inviting in the first place to people like me, anymore, because what I grew up understanding, what I have been a part of for so long, is being transformed at its core. This isn't a situation of more being tacked on, or nuance shifting. This is the core nature of Lesbians being reshaped. 

I am allowed to be confused. I am allowed to voice that confusion, and I am even allowed to not like it. So please, don't tell me what is my place or not. You are stepping into a circle which I am a part of, and asking me to accept a massive culture shift. I am allowed to say something. I am allowed to voice my concerns, my confusions.

There's a lot fundimentally different between trans and cis men in terms of life experience at least. As a trans guy myself, though i can find any gender attractive, I will only ever date other trans people as I feel like they are the only people who I feel can truly understand me and my stuggles.

Ofc that doesn't mean I don't find cis people attractive since I can't ever 'tell' who is trans or not, I just choose not to date them.
Oh yeah. I was waiting for that reverse comment slap. Not genital preference, i date trans girls more than cis girls. My partner is a transfem enby like me. The answer to your question is, well i already wrote it. The journey. That is the difference, and i said i would first need to know him from before even thinking about anything romantic to feel a bond and start feeling something. Because of the journey. That is the difference. Plus, i hate that ¬´bro manly man¬ª shitty way of thinking cis men have been educated with, and i know something about it, believe me. Masculinism, misogyny, are not things that make me fall for someone and all the cis men in my life were made of it, while i never met any trans guy like this. What‚Äôs so different between trans guys and cis guys you ask? Trans guys are rarely violent, rapists, gaslighters. But i guess it was easier to believe i was full of transphobia myself, right ?..
Yeah imo it sounds TERFy because it *is* TERFy. Or TERTy? (Transfem exclusive radical transphobe)
Ah I‚Äôm glad <3 sending lots of love & good vibes homie!
I don't even think it's accurate to say that the definition of a lesbian is ""someone who is exclusively attracted to women."" Most homosexual people I know have had some amount of heterosexual experiences. Also, you yourself had to allow that my partner is not necessarily a lesbian, so clearly there's a lot of gray area. Maybe it's best to not just idly sit on Reddit and assume you can define what the term ""lesbian"" means to the millions and millions of lesbians that exist in the world. Which, again, is my whole point. Assuming you can define other people based on your own standards is a bigoted frame of mine, no matter who holds it.
Sure, but going to lesbian bars and community events and stuff kind of has the prerequisite that you're a lesbian. And the bottom line is, if someone feels it's who they are, are you really going to tell them to go fuck themself, and that you understand their identity better than they do?
Apologies for the wrong assumption about your intent, most people who use the word female to describe women are either incels or TERFs who are trying to exclude people based off of AGAB. 

But by insisting that only binary women can be lesbians, you are actively excluding trans non-binary people and women from being lesbians. I am sorry, but it does seem as if you are willing to engage in education and understand from a point of compassion and curiosity, so I will not be engaging with you further because you seem very young and stuck in TERF rhetoric about lesbians. 

Your one incorrect outsider opinion does not change the reality of lesbian spaces. They have always been inclusive of all women of all gender identities.
If you are born female and identify as male and female... How are you not simultaneously trans and cis?

mtf transphobic
What
No problem lol
Yes, and I think that's where the biggest issue of it all comes into play. Between the Transphobia and Bi/Pan/Omniphobia, it gets really rough for people out her sometimes, and it especially hurts when if comes from within the community. 

Having these discussions is the most important thing, and it opens up the discussion for more nich sexualities to talk and explain things as well, while also making sure people can define what could cross the line for some. Safe spaces for everyone!
I mean we are literally talking about our identities, it‚Äôs how you define yourself. You‚Äôre perfectly valid being a gay man, I don‚Äôt find myself as attracted to some people as others and I don‚Äôt think gender comes into it much so I‚Äôm pansexual. My wife feels very different attraction to men and woman so she‚Äôs bisexual.
Because sexuality isn‚Äôt something you choose mate, it‚Äôs a scientific thing. You are not exclusively homosexual, bi sexual can be 1% liking the same sex, it still bisexual. 

And to everyone downvoting, science is science, you can‚Äôt just ‚Äú choose‚Äù your sexuality
Some of us use that word, yes, but I'm not exclusively attracted to women and femininity so it's not something I identify with. 

I love folks who aren't exclusively men in a very sapphic way, and that's how I experience lesbian attraction.
As soon as someone starts throwing slurs around, I immediately stop listening to their opinion on anyone else's self-identity.
It is possible. There's a difference between sexual and romantic preferences. Someone could be a lesbian in dating women but also like having sex with men, which is homoromantic bisexual. Or the other way around with dating both and having sex with women, biromantic homosexual. So yes, it is possible.
Yeah, I get what you‚Äôre saying, I just feel like we might be on dangerous ground when we accept for example the GC assumption that trans (primarily) women don‚Äôt ‚Äúcount‚Äù because they have been ‚Äúsocialised as men‚Äù or have a different lived experience to some cisgender women. The differences in lived experience between, say, super-rich women vs women who have lived on the poverty line is probably greater than the difference between men and women in each group, so I just wonder if we are creating a division that doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be defined? Honestly not saying I‚Äôm right, just that it makes me a bit uncomfortable.
>There's a lot fundimentally different between trans and cis men in terms of life experience at least.

That may be true for you but certainly isn't universal.
Right back at ya! ‚ô°
No and yes, I would consider myself to have a better and more accurate understanding of the label itself and who it applies to, as well as having the right to represent my minorities collective values as a trans man myself,  and informing the indivual of the harmful impact using that label incorrectly is and how it hurts me personally. 

Again, you don't NEED to be a lesbian to go to such event and participate in those communities, especialky if you already had a tight bond in those communities I would imagine they accept you with open arms. And do in subreddits as well. I'm still in the egg_irl community even though I've fully realized my gender and the community happily accepts me.
üíÄ
Because cis isn‚Äôt defined by identifying with your agab. It‚Äôs defined by identifying with *only* your agab as it was given to you. Bigender people are not half cis anymore than bisexual people are half straight.
1) you‚Äôre not stating ‚Äúfacts‚Äù just your interpretation of the matter, 2) you can state facts _and_ still be an asshole, and 3) you‚Äôre not even addressing anything I said. I specifically talked about sexual vs romantic interest. Being bisexual is *not* being gay and straight. I have a bisexual wife who has been told that and takes great offense to that. She‚Äôs not half gay and half straight, she‚Äôs 100% bisexual, ya dingus.
And trans is when your gender DOESN'T change
That definitely exists lmao, my turn.   

Non binary girl.
Exactly, thank you. I just don‚Äôt think my very rare attraction to women is a notable part of my identity at all. I can count on one hand with a couple of fingers missing the number of women I‚Äôve met and could genuinely see myself with. Maybe there‚Äôll be more in the future, I don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm open to it, but I‚Äôm gay
Huh that‚Äôs‚Ä¶hmmmm
[removed]
I can definitely see how that could be taken to some unpleasant places. For me personally it's not about sexual attraction (in that regard i am bisexual). My very strong prefrence for trans people is more emotional, since the way things are right now, I only feel truly safe and loved around them.
I suppose so but i find that dating someone I know understands what being trans is like rather than just being accepting is a lot more desirable to me, and that sort of understaning is something i could never get from any cis person.
Okay. Duly noted. 

By your logic, lesbians are unable to be attracted to nonbinary people. Because being a lesbian means only being attracted to women. And nonbinary people are not women, that's a transphobic idea that is erasing of androgynous identities.
This is splitting hairs over a common statement people make when talking about gender and transition. Saying ‚ÄúI became trans‚Äù isn‚Äôt accurate but it conveys a message that is easily understood and can carry the meaning intended.
Lmao WHAT.
Straight lesbian boy
I'm a non-binary transmasc lesbian and I'm a bit nervous to comment in this whole thread, because I am also attracted to some men (cis or trans.) Men who express themselves in femme ways are wonderful to me, and non-binary men especially are attractive, regardless of presentation - I do make my lesbian identity known to any partner, because I wouldn't want any man to be invalidated by my identity. 

My lesbian identity means that I'm attracted to people who aren't binary men, but even then there's a few GNC binary men who I have been attracted to and would date.
Okay, totally get your stance of how you feel about your sexuality. In many ways I refer to myself as gay, even though I'm actually demipansexual, and honestly could just fall more under being Queer in my sexuality.

I think more of what people are trying to point out is that a lot of people will have similar opinions and use this in a harmful way towards those who are Bi/Pan/Omni. 

A lot of people tend to forget that you don't have to have a strictly 50/50 attraction to binary men and women. You can be 99.99% attracted to one gender, and have a 0.01% attraction to another, and you can still be Bi/Pan/Omni. 

Because of this, I think this is why people are bringing this up, because there are a lot of individuals who have felt pressured to be strictly Straight or strictly Gay. There is a surprisingly amount of Bi, Pan, and Omniphobia, even in the Queer community itself. 

Your choice in label is something that is completely valid, but I also think it is an important thing to discuss with your partner(s), in order to determine what is right for you and your partner, especially when it comes to those who are trans and may have issues with it. That way you're all on the same page! Communicate is key to any relationship after all~!
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have to help educate with compassion! My DMs are open if you're worried about asking something that could be considered uninformed or ignorant. 

I also highly recommend you check out r/butchlesbians and r/nonbinarylesbians to hear more about transmasc, non-binary, and cis GNC lesbian experiences!
The irony of you calling some of us 'dick cutters' and throwing around slurs while posting ""Be kind to others""  https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tg8lrx/what_should_i_say_when_i_dont_believe_in_my/i10f1xz
I asked for an open and civil discussion, not for a bunch of kids to start throwing around insults just cause they don't agree with someone :/
As a ""r....."", I can assure you this is not ""r.....ed"" because most of us don't think that.

I mean, I'd have to poll the group but people with my flavor of ""r.....ation"" tend to take things very literally so lesbian means lesbian. To suggest otherwise implies lesbians can be ""converted"" by the right guy. Which is shitty.

Edit: reddit does not like asterisks.
Yes, fair enough. I don‚Äôt have a well formed view on this tbh and as you say, it‚Äôs how unpleasant people would interpret it that perhaps raised a flag for me. I can just imagine a GC picking up this thread and saying ‚Äúsee! Even trans people don‚Äôt think they are the same‚Äù which I know is not what you‚Äôre saying. But then GCs will twist everything so perhaps that‚Äôs not the greatest benchmark!
I love the way you think
I think there's a huge difference between being T4T and being someone who'll date anyone but a cis man. 

T4T person is interested in me and wouldn't date a cis man? Very cool, shared experiences and all that. 

Someone who'd date cis women but not cis men is interested in me? That feels icky.
No, that is not what it means. I also find it odd that you‚Äôve claimed every person you‚Äôve argued with in this thread is transphobic at one point or another.
Aroace het
I‚Äôm not going to pretend I understand exactly how being a transmasc lesbian works but equally I‚Äôm not going to tell you you‚Äôre wrong like some other arseholes here have done to me. It‚Äôs disgusting that other queer people (especially fellow trans people) can come in and start telling people who they are. Next they‚Äôll be telling me I‚Äôm not really a man unless I have phalloplasty!
Hey you‚Äôre valid as hell. My personal hang ups on a word are NOT YOUR FAULT and you have every right to be yourself without fear
Well, maybe a better label you can use for general public is Queer! Since you are queer, no matter how you roll it c: 

Your choice in the more specific of labels are yours to have and know, and no one else has to know what those labels are other than those who you want to know (like say your partner!) That is an important discussion to have, and anyone else doesn't matter than.
Of course it doesn‚Äôt have to be 50/50, but I don‚Äôt identify with that because I don‚Äôt see myself ending up with anyone other than a man.

It‚Äôs not that people are bringing it up- they‚Äôre telling me what I am and that‚Äôs not on. They‚Äôre not suggesting, they‚Äôre dictating, as if I haven‚Äôt spent many years mulling it over myself. It‚Äôs ignorant, it‚Äôs disrespectful, and I don‚Äôt tolerate it.

I‚Äôve tried various labels and up to now have identified as bi for longer than I have as gay. As I understood my gender better, I understood my sexuality better too. Once upon a time I thought I was a lesbian!

Being trans, I am very much sick to the back teeth of people telling me what I am and am not. Very hurtful and disappointing when it comes from members of your own community- you don‚Äôt expect it here.

Your identity is yours- not your partners. Hopefully you have a relationship where your partner doesn‚Äôt feel that your identity invalidates theirs and viceversa. If not, there‚Äôs some work to do. I‚Äôve been with straight guys who totally didn‚Äôt see me as a guy- I understand what it feels like. You just have to make sure you have a partner that you trust respects your identity- that‚Äôs all that matters in the end
I haven't called anyone transphobic in this thread. You are talking out your ass. 

I didn't even say you were transphobic. You got mad and assumed that yourself.

I said a lesbian who was attracted to nonbinary people would hypothetically be transphobic because nonbinary people aren't women.
The easiest way a lot of folks understand it is to look more into butch culture. There's a lot of transmasc butches alongside cis butches, and that can extend to other gender presentations as well. Generally, I consider myself to be bigender, so I'm both a man and a woman and I love in a queer way so I prefer to keep the lesbian label because it's the most accurate descriptor of how I love. 

Thank you, labels are very personal and I've had to fight to keep this lesbian one in a way that others deem valid. But honestly, I just know it's right for me, so sometimes I can forget about what other folks think and be happy and certain with my identity. It took a lot to get here, lol. You know how that is.
Some of us don't like to use the label queer. It makes me deeply uncomfortable because it was used a slur for me in my youth.
Some of us don't like to use the label queer. It makes me deeply uncomfortable because it was used a slur for me in my youth.
I appreciate your sentiment, but I am a lesbian. Im also queer, but I love in a sapphic way. I also make sure to let any potential partner know that, so if being with a lesbian would make them feel invalidated (which makes sense for some folks) they can know that we're not compatible and make that choice.
I can understand this, as a trans man myself. Again, I think people are saying that it sounds like being bi/pan/omni to them, and that they are confused by it. 

It is annoying, very much so, that it they are telling you what your label should be: your Anger is valid. I would like to hope that they are not trying to be malicious about it though. Just concerned because of the issues of TERFS being within the LBGTQ+ Community (I'm certain you have dealt with the issue of the LGB Drop the T group). 

I think that's just where people are worried. They most certainly could and should have said it in a nicer way, or in a more open minded way, instead of dictating your sexuality for you. Just remember people likely don't know how much time you've had to think about things, and that they may be trying to be helpful for those who are closeted (even if what they say really doesn't help and just ends up being annoying).

And Yes, your identity is yours: but that also means your partner's identity is there. I think we both understand that, and understand the importance of discussing that prior to starting a relationship. 

For me, I personally can't date someone who insists on identify as straight or lesbian, even though they're dating me: because I've done that, and it ended up being very distressing, especially since the person I was dating kept trying to challenge my trans identity. I just don't want to deal with that grief and trauma, and honestly, it makes me hesitant to even date anyone who is cisgender because of that trauma. 

And you are completely right about having a partner who you can trust. Hence why is it so important to discuss with a person prior hand, and why it is okay to not continue a relationship if those ideas clash with one another. Not every relationship is going to work out. It just is also important to make an effort to talk about these things and work through them, especially in the case where someone comes out as trans during the middle of an already pre-established relationship.  Compromising where one can, and accepting when a compromise can't be made, and also accepting no one is the villian for being honest and true to themself: these are all things that are signs of a healthy and mature relationship.
You called other people‚Äôs ideas transphobic. Same difference. Also non-binary people can definitely be women.

And it is you, sir, who are mad. HOOOHAAH ü§∫
Fair, it was just an idea though. For some it can be empowering to take back words that were once used in a negative fashion, or to take back current slurs. It's definitely not for everyone.
Not a problem! I just know you mentioned you were worried about it, and thought maybe just using queer in a public space would make you feel more comfortable and safe c: 

If Lesbian is what you are comfortable with, then that's what you're xomfortable with, and it is really good you talk to your partners about it before getting into things! Communication is Key, and if your partner doesn't care, then they don't care, and it doesn't matter. 

Just is a tricky of a topic, since it, well....has it's issues, and in the end, there probably isn't a good answer for a general answer. Especially with the issues that people face with discrimination both outside and inside the community.
> I think people are saying that it sounds like being bi/pan/omni to them, and that they are confused by it.

No, they're not- They're telling me that's what I am: 

""That‚Ä¶that means you are bi or pan or Omni‚Ä¶""

""You're bi my dude ;)""

>They most certainly could and should have said it in a nicer way

Said what? That they think they know who I am better than I do? 

>but that also means your partner's identity is there.

Of course, and it would be highly unreasonable for me to expect them to change how they identify on my account. If I were to have a partner say they're only attracted to women but I'm an exception and I trust they do see me as a man, I'm not going to expect them to suddenly identify as bi. It's only a problem when it feels like they don't see me as a man.

There is no compromising when it comes to identities so if your partner's identity makes you uncomfortable, then they're simply not the one for you. 

>especially in the case where someone comes out as trans during the middle of an already pre-established relationship.

This really is a difficult situation and I cannot imagine what it must be like for either party. In theory, nothing should change as the people are both still fundamentally themselves, but in practice it very much can change things.
They can be, they aren't inherently. My point still stands that it would be transphobic for lesbians to be attracted to nonbinary people, because nonbinary people are not inherently women. 

And no, I didn't. If I did please show me. 

I told one person they were inching into TERF rhetoric, and I also specified I didn't think they were transphobic. Just that terfs would use that opinion of 'lesbians only like women' to boost their own transphobia.
Okay, addressing the last bit because that's the only part I feel I can confidently express myself on it without getting aggravated myself. I don't want to make anyone angry, I'm just trying to make this a place where things can be explained non-aggressively and have some optimism over the shittiness of people. 

In practice, it very much changes things, and I have seen time and time and time again individuals who have come out to their partner, and their partner then deciding that it isn't a relationship they want to be in. I also see a lot of other trans folx who get very hurt and blame their partner for their attraction disappearing and their choice to leave that relationship. It sucks, but you can't change how people feel, and no one is to blame in those situations. I have also seen the reverse, where people have stayed with their partner, who still identifies as straight or lesbian or gay, which is then paired with the questioning and challenging of the trans folx's tranness. 

When it comes down to things, you have three options: potentially come to terms that the label you were once using might not encompass all that you thought yourself to be; decide that the labels don't matter and that all party members involved are unaffected by the labels; or choose to end the relationship because of a lack in compatibility. That's what I mean by ""Compromise"". 

Not only that, but the sad reality of things is that there are far too many people who fetishize things like being trans and take advantage of people and do some serious ass emotional harm. It is because of this fact and my own personal experience with things that I have found that I just can't hold the same sentiments as you, friend. I'm glad it works out for you, and again, I'm sorry that people have been shitty about how they spoke to you about your sexuality, but it most certainly has not worked out for me, and several others as well. It's why we are very, very cautious about such things, and why it is important for a majority of us to be cautious."	tg8jvq	trans	1010	0.95	2022-03-17 11:59:30
"Tinder is ""inclusive"", for sure..."	FUUUUUUUUUUCK Tinder	"Don't even bother thinking about, you're getting banned within a few days anyways...
okcupid is better with inclusivity
you will probably be banned either way lol just dont bother
I think Bumble is better than Tinder is. Alternatively I saw someone suggest Okcupid as well if you were looking!
Tinder is horrible for trans and queer folk, save yourself the mental trauma
And this is why nb people get harassed on there anyways. You set it to both genders and then suddenly people are mad at you for ‚Äúinfiltrating their side of tinder‚Äù.  Aka ‚Äúwhy is this man on here? I‚Äôm straight!‚Äù
No im a FUCKIN GOD
Tinder has & will keep banning people just for being trans. Use another app or website, tinder does not want trans people on their platform even if they publicly state otherwise. Please don‚Äôt waste your time on there.
Tinder sucks. Like i first opened it up before i even knew i was trans and the first suggestion was my twin sister
Tinder banned without a warning! Don‚Äôt even know why
To anyone wondering, you can‚Äôt select both. You‚Äôre forced to choose one.
Thats fucking bullshit üò°
What's the point of even having the option then.
Which also seems dumb cus like... even for a cis person this makes things too difficult.

I don't usually like cis-men, but I like masc-enbies and some trans-mascs. I have to put myself as bi just to see them.
*surprised pikachu*
Fr it's the absolute worst
Bumble is better, but dont forget that there is not such thing as a truly gold dating site
I think I'm the only one that has an okay experience with tinder, damn
Ban incoming.
Oh i thought this means if you wanna be found by men or women
I HATE THIS SM UGH
When I signed up for Tinder it said my profile was banned. I hadn't even made a profile, it just automatically said I was banned. After asking for a review, they just said they do not reconsider any bans and basically told me to eff off.
i didn't know Tinder was Spanish lol
I got banned last week because I chose to be shown by my not-AGAB.
This feels like the whole ‚Äúb-but what‚Äôs in your pants????‚Äù Thing people say when you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nb!‚Äù But instead of a person it‚Äôs a app.
Sorry for going off topic, an showing my ignorance.

I thought non-binary people identify nether male nor female, and would the opposite be gender fluid?
I met my non binary partner through tinder üòÖ
Bumble was good for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
are you able to appear in both
? I had the option to search for non-binary
Can i just check both boxes and then plant my head in a fucking pot like a plant?
same with bumble too
But‚Ä¶ it lets you choose both‚Ä¶?
Hinge is pretty good, but that‚Äôs got less of a Tinder/hookup kind of culture.
Lol fuck online dating anyways. Make real experiences, much more wholesome.
They let you check both so you can be exposed to a wider range of straight people who don‚Äôt want you lol
non-binary but only shows men/women. how r u gonna find matches?!?!
Hinge is the best dating app by far if you are queer and in your 20‚Äôs
This is kind of passive aggressive wow.
See posts on it here so often. x.x Really unfortunate.
LMAO and you‚Äôll never fucking get it back either. I‚Äôve tried with every method I can think of. It‚Äôs like they have my phone IP address blocked.
yup....
wait, why??? i‚Äôve been on there for a couple months now and haven‚Äôt gotten banned
Banned for what? Being trans?
bumble has the same thing unfortunately
Yup.  I had to file a report, but got the account back.
average dating app in alabama
give it time lol
Same here
they'll literally ban you even if you've paid for an upgraded account.
I managed to have a married friend make an account for me and give me the log in info. Worked well enough cause I matched with one person, deleted it the next day, and married him.
I got mine unbanned 2 times within a day no problem
Alot of trans people get banned for ""catfishing""
As another person said. People are transphobic and will report you for catfishing because ""you aren't really a woman/man,"" and you're lying. Apparently, Tinder agrees, so they ban us.
It probably isn‚Äôt as apparent if you ‚Äúpass‚Äù
yeah tinder is kinda known for that
cause you get reported and auto banned
Yep people on Tinder frequently report trans people for catfishing and Tinder will ban us.
I use bumble and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm categorized as anything but nb
I don't use it anymore lmao, I'm happily living with my enby partner and have a ldr bf and not currently looking for more partners ^^
They got me on a list or som lol
for me it let me ""display gender identity"" but it made me pick if i show up in men or women results for some reason

i‚Äôve never really felt truly at home in this sub as a young trans boy due to the lack of ftm representation here, it‚Äôs really sad tbh :(
I dont know why people are excluded i mean we are all human*beans*
Oh dear I never knew this happened- Well I certainly agree with that
Idk, I‚Äôve perused threads on here and I think it‚Äôs just more mtf posting than ftm/nb. I think more engagement needs to be done on the part of ftm/nb
On one hand, I'm becoming so much more confident with myself and who I am. I'm excited to continue this thing for myself and bringing that level of honesty to my friends and potential romantic interests.

On the other hand, I feel people like me and all those amazing others who continue to break norms and blur the lines have the unfortunate side effect of further obscuring the path for those who are on the binary.

I get why these things pop up, it's unfortunate people can inspire second-hand dysphoria or make it harder to pass. But we're around and real. Like Ace vs kink at pride this one might take a little effort to work out in a sufficient manner.
I‚Äôve actually seen a lot of inclusion for Ftms and Nbs and such on Tik Tok, It sucks it‚Äôs not as good on Reddit.
But, if you want to see more likeminded people Tik Tok is usually the way to go I think.

It's been happening a lot especially in the more female filled trans subs. It's sad and I recently left a bunch of subs just because I didn't want to be a part of it. There was a good post on r/ftm earlier about it that highlights it. The messages many trans men have been receiving for a while from trans women and other trans fem people are absolutely disgusting. It's sad that there really is nowhere you can go to avoid shitty people
Saw a many people on r/FTM and i wanted to raise awareness
I love you all and hate any of you feel like this.  The trans forums should be for all of us to get huggles, smiles and share.  So please keep sharing!  I love seeing all your pictures and hearing all your stories!
I‚Äôm autistic and often can‚Äôt pick up on what‚Äôs being hinted at in conversation, what exactly is happening here? Sorry:(
Sadly :( We trans women need to listen more to others if there are issues.
yeah :c
Demigenders are MORE than welcome here and BELONG in trans spaces. Your lives matter <3
I'm a binary trans man. I know that I have left this sub because of many reasons, one being that only the trans femme posts got attention. I'll see a trans masc post with ~200 upvotes, and many trans femme posts with over 2k upvotes. 

There's a general hostility towards men in general on this sub, seeing comments like ""men are awful why would anyone want to be one"" and addressing everyone on this sub as ""ladies"". And there was that post a few days ago where it was a starter pack of ""things that have been incorporated into trans culture"" or something like that, and I was cat ears and knee high socks. Trans girl stuff. 

There's an oversaturation of trans femme posts that get upvotes, and I can't even get to the trans masc posts to upvote them. If I do see a trans masc post, the comments will be filled with trans girls commenting on it. Even stuff like ""this but the opposite"" or ""we should trade lol"". I never see those comments on trans femme posts. There's a lot more reasons I don't go on this sub too often and why I don't feel included, but these are a few of them.
While i am MTF and cannot speak for FTM / NB, i heard that FTM / NB over at r/FTM complained, that MTF didn't take them seriously or triggered dysphoria by calling t poison etc. It might be the main problem, but ask FTM / NB to be completely sure.
The issue is when we (ftm/nb people) post anything, we can get DMs from trans women or trans fem people saying ""let's trade"" or ""why would you ever want to chop off your tits"". At this point it's a hazard for ftm/NB people to post anything about transitioning because those DMs are a real risk. Additionally, when we do post, it just gets buried because obviously trans women/trans fems can't relate to us at all and they do make up the majority of many mixed subs.

It's not a matter of ftm/NB people just ""trying harder"". It's a matter of whether or not we want to risk subjecting ourselves to dysphoria-inducing comments just because a trans woman can't relate to us or wants to project their dysphoria onto us. Don't blame ftm/NB people when we are the victims.

that makes me really sad :(( I'm mtf, and i don't want to be lumped in with those people. Pretty disgusting that even trans people can be transphobic
Apparently transmasc people are being excluded from trans subreddits by transfemme people, which has made transmasc people feel like they aren't welcome in lots of lgbtq areas. hope that helps. Also love your username :))
Yup this is all because there‚Äôs so many mtf posters. That greatly skews things. I‚Äôve only seen the ‚Äúladies‚Äù address to mtf specific posts but that‚Äôs just my experience.

The hostility I‚Äôve seen is to male attributes which most mtf feel dysphoric about and thus despise. I haven‚Äôt seen mtf users deliberately entering ftm/nb posts and being toxic but again, that‚Äôs my experience.

Bad actors are in every community and should face consequences for acting like trolls
Recently there was a post about this topic, and the hatred was completely flipped. Transwomen were being absolutely RIPPED apart by the transmen. Lots of transmen saying things like ""shut up woman"" and misogynistic slurs against transfemmes. One girl even got banned for saying ""transmascs need to post more."" Everything I've been seeing going on in the past few days makes it feel like the community is ripping itself apart. Transfemmes mad that transmascs are being misogynistic, transmascs mad that transfemmes are being misandristic. Transmascs accusing transfemmes of excluding them, and transfemmes trying to defend themselves against these accusations. Hatred for transfemmes for trying to defend their honor. I think I'm going to be sick.
I‚Äôve seen this brought up on numerous occasions. There are bad actors for sure. However, there‚Äôs simply an overwhelming amount of mtf users compared to ftm and nb. Mtf users also tend to post more so it becomes apparent that there‚Äôs more mtf content. 

If I were an ftm or nb user, I‚Äôd supplement my content with the ftm/nb specific subs to get the content I need. It‚Äôs not fair but to make it fair, ftm/nb folks would have to post more. 

To all the bad actors out there though:

Fuck you. Putting people down is weak and indicative of being a shitstain-human
This isn't a post about that
at least youre represented, we're almost as ignored as ace/bi/pan/polyam people :(

its horrific how transfem people are too often treated, but our pain is valid too
This isn't about you
Yeah. It's appalling. It's sad because really the split because trans men and women in Reddit isn't as drastic as it may seem, but from what I've seen ftms and POC mtfs are pushed away more into dedicated spaces, which causes subs that are technically for all trans people to become almost exclusively mtfs. It's very sad. I don't know the statistics for enbies. I wish I didn't have to leave all those subs but I can't stay in them with good conscience after what I've seen. I know most people dont suck and are at the very least not actively trying to make the problem worse but I don't want to feel like I'm part of communities with a system that ends up pushing people away with people that flat out discriminate against those different than them.

People ruin everything man.
Same, I don't know why we can all just have some decency to each other, we should understand where the line is better than anyone, but it seems like some people don't for some reason
Thank you! I didn‚Äôt steal the presidents rubies!
The thing that gets me is that there is an equal amount of ftm as mtf on reddit, I just believe that the lack of inclusion on this sub makes it so we see much more trans femme posts.

ftm here! thanks for making people more aware! what you said is absolutely true. I made a comment earlier about how i feel like ftm are kind of forgotten about in this sub and mostly just all LGBTQ+ subs in reddit that aren't targeted towards ftm, like r/ftm is. but the amount of people that said they had sort of forgotten about ftm people on that same post, it shocked me.
yeah, every time i think ""in this community ESPECIALLY, people should know basic human decency"" im proven wrong every time. depressing shit
I think that‚Äôs wrong. I think more mtf tend to post and post in greater volume. I honestly don‚Äôt think ftm or nb post as much and as often as mtf which creates this imbalance
i dont know about whether there are less of us, but i have seen that we tend to be less vocal(?) idk how to word that...

hope you have a good day üëç
There is almost the same amount of people in r/MTF as there is in r/FTM. We're just ignored.
Just be nice and respectful, Trans men and Non binary people deserve the same respect we do
We are currently discussing trans men and non binary issue not the trans woman issues, you have it bad too but that doesn't mean we can't have our moment

And just because you are a trans woman doesn't mean you shouldn't be downvoted for saying something toxic
I find it so weird that trans people can just forget/not know ftm people exist, like we aren't part of the same community
That's what I mean. We don't feel included therefore we don't post as often.
Ok yea i just never gave it much thought. Dont mean to be insincere. Have a great day too.
ikrrr
What I‚Äôm saying is the feeling of not being included mainly stems from the lack of folks posting which leads to under-representation which continues the cycle whereas what you describe is the cycle itself.
Yes, I believe we are saying the same thing when it comes to that. It is a cycle. However, the lack of posts isn't really the main reason. This post and the comments below it explain it well if you're interested.

Holy shit!

Wow! Damn‚Ä¶ 

No cap, I was on my ignorant shit then‚Ä¶

Ngl, didn‚Äôt account for dms. Didn‚Äôt account for meme subs. I get this is r/trans but most users are spread across most trans communities so I could see a bleeding effect being possible in this sub. 

I dug deeper and had to pause to say that u/times-newroman user gave such detail. Wow!

Students who identify outside of male or female can not complete the housing application, despite freshmen being required to live in residence halls. This college prides itself on being inclusive.		"Dorms are crap practices to begin with. Here‚Äôs a stranger now sleep in the same room with them. Better hope they don‚Äôt snore loudly. See if there is a way to get that requirement waved, they can‚Äôt possibly force all new students to live on campus, much less pay for their housing.
This is so dumb, I remember my housing at college had an mixed gender housing option.
Sooo I was the first trans person to go my college way back when. Same bullshit, different day. Your best bet is for a med waiver, which you've guessed. Dont wait though, push this person, re-insist for a non-gender option. There is a head of housing, info should be available publicly. Send all responses to the head. Tell them you're not the only non-binary person alive, and state you're not comfortable and feel ""un-safe"" rooming with a gendered person. You are happy to room with another non-binary person. 
There is now a documented report of students feeling compelled to enter unsafe housing, and being ignored along with a med waiver on the desk of the person making policy. 
The key words here are ""un-safe"" and mandatory/compelled. 
You'll get something, even if thats a written email acknowledging that school policy is ignoring safety of students. Which can be quite something in the right hands. Either way you win üòâ
They were SO close to being cool about it. Then, they fumbled the ball and accidentally scored on their own end zone.
None of the 10s of Millions of intersex are allowed to exist in their dorms even. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
One trip to the higher administration should solve this (depending on who you interact with that is). Not that they necessarily care more about you, but they care about the negative PR this would generate on campus and in general. 

If they don't help, if it's a US school there's likely a queer club. Having run a club before i know the president of that club will have a direct connection to the schools student council. And those guys were always real good at cancelling faculty lol
Honestly my doorms aren't inclusive and got used to it, tho if they say they are THEN THEY GOD DAMN WILL BE
So they need to provide you somewhere to stay off campus
Aside from going for a medical waiver, you might have some luck if you contact their LGBTQ+ or inclusion office. It‚Äôs unlikely went to the same college, but where I went, the office was able to give me a ‚Äúgender waiver‚Äù, if you will, to be able to dorm with whoever. You‚Äôre not the only non-binary person at the college, so they might have something like that where you will go and might even have other non-binary students looking for roommates. Best of luck.
Its going to take a long time for the world to adjust, i know its frustrating but these are still early days. We are like the Ford Model-T in 1908 while everyone else is still on horseback, and there is no accomadations for cars yet.

We are the pioneers ! Paving the way for future generations, and all the pioneers had it rough.

Considering my job as a plumber i know how costly and time consuming having a 3rd option bathroom would be EVERYWHERE.

Its going to take a handfull of decades most likly for everything to be running smooth, legally, economically, socially.
But what happens if you choose both? ü§Ø
This is upsetting. I don't know what I'd do in this situation. I identify as female so I could pick that option, but I don't identify as woman. Technically, they aren't even segregating by gender, they are segregating by genitals.
Live in the mess hall with the rats
Did you take this to the Pride Committee? If they claim to be inclusive, they would naturally have one. One of the purposes of any Pride Committees is to help deal with these issues.
I fucked up and picked other last year as an incoming freshman to a different college. I could not finish the application. They should have not made it an option, I almost didn't have a dorm, they had to email me then override shit.
... do you mind if I ask which school? I go to VCU (which prides itself on being inclusive) but honestly wouldn't be surprised if they did this.
I'm confused by required dorm living. Years ago when I went, the big complaint was that while I was there they stopped letting juniors and seniors apply for housing altogether, but I don't recall anyone being forced into housing. 

I hope you get it sorted though. That sounds awful.
Yikes. My main priority for applying to schools has been accessible housing since I need to leave my current living situation, I consider it more important than major options or cost.

Many schools have LGBT+ specific housing areas or coed suites listed on their website (though I'm having trouble finding out if A&M Commerce has trans accessible housing if anyone knows)
Fun fact! That‚Äôs illegal as it discriminates based on gender.
Oh shit this might be my college-

I'm so sorry this happened. I wish it wasn't how it was but even in the all girls dorm, just in my floor there are so many trans kids, being deadnamed by their names on the door. It really sucks.
Actually, the way I read their response is that you can choose who you want to live with.  It doesn't say anything about having to choose your AGAB.
If you‚Äôre comfortable, what‚Äôs the college?
Bring it up with student resources. There are generally policies on discrimination that they enforce and try to handle. Forget what it is exactly but mine has a Title *** office
Is this Denison? ü§£üò≠üò≠ This is some shit they'd pull tbh
As I said on this post in a different sub, what the hell kinda bullshit is this
Honestly, this feels more like a system/IT issue where they didn't think about the ""other"" option in the secondary systems that feed into the first.

Note that they're not asking that you ""be"" a given gender, or that non-binary people aren't allowed, but just that a selection needs to be made according to this.

Source: am in IT and have seen this multiple times (and this exact case once). What happened there was, upper management told the user that they can select whatever gender they best feel comfortable dorming with, and everyone went on their way, because changing the system would cost tens of thousands of dollars (that was a legacy/old system in use for around 7 years at that point).
I identify as nb too, honestly just choose where you feel safer sleeping at that's what I did, (I chose female, even tho I was amab, but I just don't feel comfortable around men as much)
what school is this at? Utah tech??
my cousin doesn't go to actual dorms and he is cisgender. he does online schooling from the comfort of his home. i know so many want that dorm experience, but coming from friends who had that, they said it's just not worth it and it's super expensive anyway
I put in an ADA request for a disability. If that goes through I get a single ADA room. Hoping for that.
Shit‚Äòa just crazy because there‚Äòs plenty places that offer non binary genders on birth certificates and passports nowadays.


Like what‚Äôs say a foreign German student supposed to do? Lie about their gender if it‚Äòs X? 

Kinda weird trouble they are making by not including all legal genders even.
look, i've never written to protest anything so i might come off as too belligerent (i.e. mildly dissatisfied) but i wrote one up. this is assuming you can get a med waiver tho.

>Given that this institution prides itself on providing a safe and inclusive environment for all students, I am surprised by the lack of accommodations for students who do not conform to a certain gender identity. It is disappointing that a community can claim to be progressive while refusing to extend the consideration received by the majority of students to a marginalized and highly vulnerable minority.

now express to them the very real risk of being assaulted for existing as a nby/trans person:

>It's possible I am the only freshman to directly request a non-gendered housing option, but I do not believe I am the only one who feels uncomfortable choosing a label that cannot accurately describe my gender. I do not feel safe being forced to endure the stigma attached to being nonbinary in a gendered setting. As someone who has previously been harassed for my identity, being put in this situation may subject me and other nonbinary students to abuse and bodily injury.

dunno how to wrap that one up, but this is where you should mention the waiver. Though even without the waiver, ""fear of physical harm"" is already a pretty compelling reason to accommodate your needs.
It‚Äôs like a conservative safe space! They just huddle in the corner, ‚Äú we‚Äôre safe in here, gender   Nonconformity can‚Äôt hurt us!‚Äù
You act like intersex people don't ever align with a gender
You can just make existing bathrooms open to all genders though. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen places here do.
Which dorms do you wish to live in?
[ ] Male
[ ] Female
[X] Surprise me
I think they are segregating based on labels rather than genitals. 

If it was genital based I don‚Äôt think they would even inform the person that they can choose which gender they identify with and just inform them that they must choose agab
Good idea. This is adequate gender affirming housing.
We do not have one.
I can‚Äôt name drop. I don‚Äôt want to push Reddit rules or anything.
You can chose the gender you identify with, but if you select other you can‚Äôt complete the form at all‚Ä¶ honestly utterly overlooking genders outside of male or female
Not sure if I want to name drop 

Not that I mind calling them out, I just don‚Äôt want to push Reddit and sub rules.
No. I don‚Äôt want to name drop though. Trying to be mindful of Reddit rules.
I worked with my college to get out of the dorms early (required for the first two years) because I started transitioning end of freshman year and made a case it would be safer for me to do so in my own housing. If I recall correctly, I had to work with the disability services people. Gender Dysphoria is classified as a disability now so you might be able to do something similar and argue it would be safer for you to live on your own.

They house people, its more than a checkbox. But also, yeah, they should have policy in place at this point beyond binary. Universities are not the liberal bastions they are made out to be.
The trick to writing these kinds of letters is saying as little as possible. The person on the other ends job is to tell you no without saying no, and reiterate policy. More writing just gives them more room to tapdance. Keep it under 3 sentences, and don't accuse, YET. It should be more in line with:

""I dont feel safe in this setting due to previous life experiences, and housing is mandatory by school policy. Could you please help me and provide alternative options that take into account my safety?"" 

Save the long form for higher ups. Your goal is to get a direct yes/no, and ammo for pressuring someone in a higher position, to enact a policy.
True, but they‚Äôre basing it on sex sooooo
Yea but not everyone will be comfortable with that, and i think thats fine as long as we are respected as human beings.

Anytime i have to work in a womans washroom i have to get a ""woman"" from the building to clear it out then escort me in üôÑ but i understand still.

People will want a ""mens"" a "" womans"" and a ""unisex"" and changing the minds of 8 billion + people will never happen.
I just mean that sex does not equal gender. Gender is man, woman, non-binary, etc.
Wow. I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry! They really dropped the ball on this one!
That's fair. That said I'm gonna go check what my school does now and make sure it's ok. I have too many connections to SGA to not
Yes, ***BUT***, for the purposes of the housing application, if you say you identify as a male, you will be roomed with other male-identified individuals, and if you say you identify as a female, you will be roomed with other female-identified individuals.

Is the source of your upsettedness that they don't have gender-neutral housing period?  Or that they're forcing you to choose one?  Would you rather be randomly assigned?
It's not possible to dox a public institution.

It's an institution.

And public.
Isn‚Äôt really what this is about. I put in an ADA request because I‚Äôm disabled. Id rather have that go through than deal with this, sure. But I‚Äôd be fine with a roommate should I be able to have my gender accurately represented and be placed with someone of a gender I‚Äôm comfortable with. 

This form is very flawed and needs to be updated.
>changing the minds of 8 billion + people will never happen.

You say that like transphobia has always existed and is not a pretty recent thing. We are nothing new and the world was used to accept us. Transfem being forced out women spaces would have been absurd in most parts of the world for thousands of years.
Honestly the fact that nb identities are completely left out of the housing application is a bit much for me. If you can select which gender you prefer to house with, sure. But you shouldn‚Äôt need to misgender yourself in order to do that. Something simple like ‚Äúother‚Äù gender and options that allow you to chose who you want to house with, such as ‚Äúother and female‚Äù would even be an improvement.
No but you‚Äôd be doxxing yourself by naming them. Especially if it‚Äôs small. Op says it‚Äôs X place, now you know what city OP lives in and where you might be able to find them. I get the hesitation. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[deleted]
Umm transphobia and homophobia aren‚Äôt recent things. Most people still see us as men playing dress up
I don't disagree that it can definitely be better... But you have to get used to things like this and not get too worked up over them. Yeah, work to change the system, but you need to work within that system while it exists as it does now. If you can't, then my friend, the real world is going to eat you alive. Beat of luck.

BTW, we've been fighting to not be ""othered"" for longer than I've been alive, which (if you're the typical college-applicant age) is over twice as long as you. ""Other"" is never an acceptable solution.
Can you elaborate on what you mean
>Yeah, work to change the system, but you need to work within that system while it exists as it does now.

What does ""working within the system to change the system"" mean to you? Because I gather that contacting the authorities responsible and explaining why they aren't serving your needs doesn't count, for some reason.

>BTW, we've been fighting to not be ""othered"" for longer than I've been alive, which (if you're the typical college-applicant age) is over twice as long as you. ""Other"" is never an acceptable solution.

Who is ""we""? What would be preferable to you? ""Non-binary""? But what about bi-gender people, or agender people, or genderfluid or genderqueer people? At least ""other"" could serve as a flag for residence services that the applicant will need further assistance to find a place they feel comfortable.
That‚Äòs utter bullshit mate. Forcing someone to misgender themselves is ‚Äöworking within the system‚Äò? The fuck?

People not allowing you to chose your legal fucking gender on an application is fucked. Don‚Äòt tell people to just get used to this‚Ä¶
> we've been fighting to not be ""othered""

Assimilation vs. emancipation, the usual generation gap, I guess. Where were you when queer folks started to drop out this out dated strategy?
>What does ""working within the system to change the system"" mean to you?   
Because I gather that contacting the authorities responsible and   
explaining why they aren't serving your needs doesn't count, for some

It absolutely does count.  But imaging that a major institution like a university is going to change their form, overnight, from one person's complaint, is naivete at its finest.

>Who is ""we""? What would be preferable to you? ""Non-binary""? But what   
about bi-gender people, or agender people, or genderfluid or genderqueer people?

I would prefer that the form give absolutely every option possible; make it a drop-down with 25+ options, and sure we can add an ""other"" and a free-text field then.  But if there's only two default choices, yeah ""other"" doesn't cut it.
\*shrug\* Cool.  So the OP can just not live in college housing, as is apparently required for freshman.  Forgive me for realizing that forms at major institutions don't get changed overnight."	118ifqc	trans	791	0.97	2023-02-21 23:22:43

We have to be visible. We are not ashamed of who we are.	"For transgender day of visibility we want to recognize how far our community has come as a whole. We live in a society where our rights are attacked for not being understood. Where our family and friends reject us for who we are. Where we must do what we can to fit in, in a society that would exile and attack us for being who we are.

We want to remind everyone that we are stronger and more plentiful when unified than those who would oppress us and tear us down. Our rights **are** human rights, lest we forget that access to healthcare, the right to self identity, and the right to exist as you are, are rights that everyone should have access to. We are  just as diverse, just as fallible, just as **human**, as any other group of people that exist.

There are those who would fearmonger, who would tell us to hide who we are from fascism, they are the same people who would tear us down in the first place. We must stand strong as a group, hold true to ourselves, and live our lives as who we are. Though we must keep in mind that there are those of us that are in places where they can‚Äôt be themselves, where their life would be in danger just to express who they are, we must be strong for them.

There has been a rapid rise in hate recently, as people spew nonsensical rhetoric to tear down trans people. That can be scary to see, especially if you live in places that are actively passing laws to attack our lives. We must make our voices heard, our unrest, our fear, our anger, we cannot go down silently.

To those of you who come to our subreddit seeking refuge, seeking a place to be yourself, you have found it. To those of you who are here to bring others down, to gatekeep, to tell others how they should feel, we ask that you leave now as you do not belong here.

# From our team members

## bleeding-paryl

Personally, as someone who has been in this community for a bit over 10 years now, I think I can honestly say that this is both the scariest time to live in parts of the world for trans folk, but also the best time in recent memory to actively be yourself. I‚Äôve seen so much positivity in this community, and I‚Äôm always inspired by the things I see here. We will celebrate who we are, we will live as who we are, and despite things like the recent shooting, we will continue to love ourselves.

I‚Äôve noticed a rather recent and rapid uptick in people coming here who are not trans. For those that come as allies, and are here to support us, thank you. For those who are here expecting us to apologize for a murderer, or who think we‚Äôre not upset ‚Äúenough‚Äù at the murder of children, I would like you to first look inward, and ask yourself why you‚Äôre more upset at us than you are about the people murdered. We are grieving, we are hurt, we are afraid. We can feel multiple things at the same time, and we can acknowledge when things will shine an incorrect light on a community of people just as diverse as the cisgender community.

For those of you who see that kind of hate making its way through, first of all I would like to apologize, as I know we‚Äôre imperfect. I would also like to personally thank you for remaining vigilant and reporting it as you see it. Keep in mind, we‚Äôre _very_ busy, we have regular lives on top of the stuff we do for this community, and we may not see something right away, so I am always appreciative of those who can help.

## TallGeminiGirl

Firstly I would like to thank all of you for your help in reporting bad actors and doing your part to keep r/trans a safe space for all things transgender. We really can not do it with out you all. We, as a mod team, are just a small part of the incredibly diverse and wonderful trans community we represent. You, the users, are the real body, soul, and voice of our community. Thank you for being the wonderful people you are. 

I want to take a moment and share some personal thoughts on recent events. We can not let this stop us. We can not let this push us down and go back into hiding. Those of us who can do so safely need to continue making our voices heard and push back against this wave of hate. This is not a call for violence and I will never, ever advocate for such or defend such actions. Today is our chance to reclaim the current narrative around us. Be visible, be kind, and show the world who we really are and what we stand for. The small actions of a million individuals can easily over power the heinous actions of a single, evil, individual.

And don't be afraid to ask for support and comforting. Talk to your trans friends. Be real with your cis allies. It's high time they really get to know what we are going through and what we are up against. Don't feel like you have to answer for the entire community either. Your own personal needs and mental health is just as if not more important than the needs of our community. 

Stay strong everyone. The seas ahead will be harsh and choppy, but together we can brave the storm and come out stronger on the other side.

## The_Decoy

I am very thankful to have found so much support in these spaces. As someone who came to understand this side of myself much later in life, I find so much inspiration seeing how the community comes together to reinforce each other. These are obviously difficult times with our community being set upon by some incredibly vitriolic bad actors. But we are working our hardest to keep this space clear so the community can continue supporting one another. I am proud to work alongside such a wonderful and dedicated mod team. I am delighted to see how the community places such an emphasis on being respectful and inclusive to each other. Ultimately though we are pursuing our ability to live our best lives. This struggle will not be easy but will be incredibly satisfying once we have attained such an environment. I look forward to pushing for progress alongside such incredible people.

A reminder that Mr Rogers is NOT a transphobe	"Recently I have seen some far right folks taking Mr Rogers Songs out of context, most notably this part:

""Boys are boys from the beginning.
Girls are girls right from the start""

Mr Rogers have edited the verse to be more inclusive: http://www.neighborhoodarchive.com/music/songs/everybodys_fancy.html (scroll to the end) 

Please dont get manipulated by the far right. Rogers is far from a transphobe. I am not sure if this was really popular now, but I still think this is important. Trans boys are boys from the beginning, trans girls are girls right from the start. Peace."	"That guy was probably one of the best humans to ever grace this Earth, and I hate when people try to take stuff written in the 70s/80s out of context like that. There was no non-binary and being trans was barely acceptable at all, so obviously the song isn‚Äôt going to include every single gender identity under the sun. Also, yeah boys are boys and girls are girls. Trans people are their preferred gender and nothing changes that, not even the body they‚Äôre born in, so even if you wanted to you could look at it from that frame of reference
Not wrong really, trans people have always been the gender they truly are, it just often takes a number of years to realize and identify as such.
I'm Irish and grew up without ever knowing Mr. Rogers until a few years ago when he came up in conversation with my partner, who is American. Since learning of him, I almost cry everytime I think of him and his role in teaching children compassion. His heart was good, greater than even most religious saints. I wish more people knew about him and I know he won't be brought down by those with cruelty and lies in their hearts.
Boys and girls *are* boys and girls respectively from the beginning. You just don't always know which one until they've figured it out themselves. You can help them by showing them the options and accepting them however they turn out to be.

And enbies are also enbies from the beginning obviously.
God, mr. Rogers is a literal saint and the thought anyone would use him to push an agenda he would hate is sickening. Boys are boys and girls are girls, regardless of how they're born.
Reading the lyrics for the first time, it seems like the entire point is satirical: we‚Äôre forced to be these two boxes but actually everybody is fancy, they don‚Äôt have to fit; and whoever they are, everybody is *fine*
that's my surname, I'm no one of note obv but I saw the title and was like OF COURSE I'M NOT WHO SAID I WAS üò≠
Don't ever let anyone tell you that Mr. Rogers wouldn't love you just for who you are! He wouldn't want some song he wrote in the 1970s to make you feel bad now. He wrote a lot of songs, and sometimes, songs don't age very well and then we don't sing them anymore or we change the words. You. Are. Special. 

Mr. Rogers wouldn't like the words that I want to use to describe the people who would twist his legacy, so I won't do that. But I have a lot of them. Mr. Rogers was one of the best people this sorry planet has ever produced and I wish more children of my generation had taken his lessons to heart.
In kind of a follow up, from where I bought this up a couple weeks ago. My sister, talked me down explaining it was probably my squirrelly brother, being squirrelly.
Mr Rogers probably didn‚Äôt even know trans was a thing‚Ä¶ and if he did he‚Äôd probably have a trans person over for lunch.
Comment section got me crying damn
Yes, this is taking the lyrics way out of context. The song is about how we‚Äôre perfect exactly as we are, worthy of love exactly as we are. Mr. Fred Rogers clearly wrote those lines about girls and boys as a way to be inclusive. At the time, girls were not mentioned in a lot of media for children and he was just trying to include everyone in the song.
Saw that BS on Youtube Shorts and was quite suspect of it, glad to have it fully dispelled, thanks.
>""Boys are boys from the beginning. Girls are girls right from the start""

How does the right think thats some ""gotcha""?  I WAS a girl right from the start, whether people knew it or not.

At 3, I didn't know why I was forced a ""boy"" haircut, I wasn't a boy.  At 4, my dad screamed at me for getting my nails painted.

I didn't know why i wasn't allowed long hair, like mom.  I  didn't know why I wasn't allowed painted nails, like mom.  I didn't know why i had to play with Barbies in secret.  I didn't know why I wasn't allowed to be a girl.  I  didn't know why I wasn't allowed sleepovers with other girls.

The right can fuck off.  Mr. Rodgers wouldn't have a problem with me.
I'm really glad there is love for Mr Roger's, I grew upon that show. The man is a Saint. He from my home town as well. When I heard he passed away I was I believe in my 20s, the world grew darker that day.
no one could ever convince me Mr Roger's is a transphobe. he was such an accepting person and cared so much about other people.
He successfully sued the KKK for using his voice to spread hate. Can‚Äôt wait for the Fred rogers foundation to file this new suit.
""Only girls can be the mommies.
Only boys can be the daddies"" is probably the more problematic line, but considering the time it was written at its completely acceptable, he didn't set out to be offensive and he changed it to show support.
Yeah, anyone who actually watched Mr. Rogers knows that he was a very, very kind and gentle person that genuinely cared about the well-being of children.  His words and views expressed at the time were based on his understanding of the world and were not intended to be exclusionary.

People twisting this to make it seem like Mr. Rogers didn‚Äôt like trans people are sick and just tarnishing his good name.  He was a kind soul and I‚Äôm sure in modern times he‚Äôd have incredible empathy for what trans kids go through.
Me. Rogers wasn‚Äôt even Catholic, but he was everything I think of when I think of a Saint.

Infinitely kind and understanding, with unconditional love for everyone.

I was a grown-ass adult when he died and I cried when I heard he‚Äôd passed away. 

If there is a God, Mr. Rogers was His best example on how we are *supposed* to be.
[removed]
They are using him because of his status as the most wholesome, kind human being. It's a look at this nice guy, even he thinks the trans community is ''wrong'' mindset. Just the right being vile again
Exactly, the point he always drove home was that every child had value and our differences made us special.  The language was often simple because it was targeted at a broad range of ages, many of whom were very young.
Imagine the world we‚Äôd be in if they had.
squirrely?
If mister Roger's was making his show today, I guarantee he would have trans representation.
Same here. Fuckin' hell...usually comments don't really get to me but I dunno. Somethin' about it this time. Not a good time. Thanks estrogen.
Also Fred Rogers is my all-time hero and I will defend his legacy of kindness and self-love and love for others until the end of time.
Yeah in today context it is but back when it was written that was supportive of individuality
i don‚Äôt even personally see that as referring to biology, i interpreted it as more establishing to kids that mommy is the term for female parent and daddy is the term for male parent, regardless of what part they played in the conception. obviously not a rule, i‚Äôve seen trans guys go by ‚Äúmommy‚Äù to their kid and vice versa, but he probably wasn‚Äôt thinking of that lol.
He sat with a black man in his little pool on national television when the south was still heavily segregated. He was a groundbreaking example of human kindness and decency and would absolutely support trans rights
He would be worthy of Mjolnir
Trans people don't change their gender, they change their body and presentation to fit their gender. Being transgender means that your gender identity and your body or your externally perceived gender don't fit each other. A trans girl has always been a girl, even when they still thought they were a boy. Understanding you're trans doesn't mean *changing* your gender, it means *recognising* for the first time what your actual gender is.

""Trans people decide to change their gender"" is a very common rhetoric among transphobic bigots. That way it's easy to spot people who don't know what they're talking about.
Yeah, always marched to a different drummer, also a good bit of middle child syndrome. He grew a beard during his sophomore year of high school, just because he could. Shaved it off the day after school let out.

Presently, he doesn't reply to texts or messenger and very rarely contacts any other members of our family.

But, he was squirrelly all throughout our childhood.
I want to start hrt but it feels impossible sobbing because the pain in my heart
Many people don't fully understand the significance of this moment: one of the many many pseudoscientific beliefs of America racists was that black people contaminated water by touching it. They insisted that swimming pools had to be drained, cleaned and refilled after black children were allowed to swim there. Many municipal pools adopted such policies, and would only let black people swim right before a regular cleaning.

By just putting their feet into the same kiddie pool together, these two men challenged a specific ""black contamination"" rule that a huge number of people subscribed to. Impressionable children saw it, and realized their parents were uneducated bigots. This moment sent shockwaves through America.
He'd pick it up, admire it, and hand it right back to Thor.
Why's it feel impossible? <3 I'm sorry you're hurting.
Just like in that little comic yep
The current trajectory of Americans politics and being in the us its killing me deep down
Looking at how privileged cis people are with the bodies they have and on top of it seeing the seething hate for trans people in the world too everything is so discouraging i feel trapped in this toxic world trapped in the cell that is my body as well living rn is torture and i i feel tired i want to rest
I get it. I'm right there with ya. I'm not gonna say it's not bad or everything is just gonna be fine..Just take it as it comes, fight, and get support from the community. Also if you have a planned parenthood nearby I'd totally recommend going there and asking they do gender care. That's where I got mine (and I'm in the deep south so) so hopefully one close by you has it too. I hope you get to be the person you are. <3"	10sda89	trans	362	0.99	2023-02-03 06:27:03
One of my online trans communities just went full truscum	"The community in question had been a pretty welcoming and supportive one up until yesterday evening, which makes this sudden whiplash all the harder to deal with.

The update from the admin started off pretty innocently, a note about how they had noticed a disconnect between older and younger trans people, wanting to bridge that gap when it came to things like modern terminology surrounding transitioning and holding space for generational dialogue. Alright, with you so far‚Ä¶

They then went on a rant about how in their day ‚Äòwe followed strict procedures to be trans, but now enforcing that on a new generation is considered gatekeeping‚Äô and how passing perfectly is the only way to be trans, how they worked on passing without sexualizing themselves, but the younger trans degrade our community by posting naked pictures of themselves, how they have a ‚Äòwealth of knowledge‚Äô that isn‚Äôt being respected by the younger trans, and how the new community going forward was going to have strict guidelines for what sort of trans inclusion they are going to allow (of course all under the language of ‚Äòdecorum‚Äô and ‚Äòrespect‚Äô and ‚Äònot throwing temper tantrums that scare away the cis from all our hard work‚Äô) and I just‚Ä¶

Why.

Like we already have cis institutions forcing strict ideals for what a ‚Äòreal‚Äô and ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô trans person is, why do some trans people feel the need to do the same thing to our communities?"	"This is the kind of self-policing which is common in minority communities when the majority ramps up persecution efforts. Passable trans people want to stay hidden and take advanatage of their privileges, much like you see some members of the gay community doing now that they have acceptance. People forget that we only got where we are today with solidarity and turning on your family will not save you, but simply save you for last.
God... I first looked into transition in 03.  Back when the real life test was a thing, back when nobody transitioned under 18, back when you had to be high femme and straight or you weren't allowed to transition.  I'm GLAD shit ain't like that anymore.  I'm a trans lesbian, and I suspect gender fluid... I stayed closeted til 2019 because of gatekeepy bullshit.

What did trying to appease cishets get us?  Nothing.

That community has the wrong mindset.
That totally sucks. I am an older trans woman who only started transitioning (only actually realised!) four years ago. Everyone is different, and no-one should be saying they are the holders of ""the one true knowledge"". See this in so many different areas and it is totally wrong in all of them.

Can you DM me the sub name so that I can avoid it please?
I'm almost 47 and am absolutely inspired by younger unicorns. I don't agree with the nonsense you're mentioning whatsoever. The younger trans generation is what gives me hope.
Based on some of these comments (and my own experience of being in my 40s and only having realized 2 years ago), I‚Äôm realizing the definition of ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù seems to be less about age and more about recency of transition. I‚Äôm definitely in the open, inclusive, and welcoming to a variety of experiences of transness camp, and not the ‚Äúfollow these rules or else you don‚Äôt count‚Äù one and while I don‚Äôt have the courage of my younger counterparts, I do have the open mindedness of that ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù and share with them a more recent trajectory.
I have recently come out as a trans woman. I have just past 50 and i can‚Äôt understand why someone would do or say these things. If the World had come as far as it has today when it comes to openness around the trans issue back when i was young, i would not have had to live my life in the wrong body and the wrong gender. All hail to the young trans of today. My wish for the future is that there will be no more transpeople coming out in their 50‚Äôs because they would have done it before, and without banging their heads against the wall to get the help and treatment they need. I‚Äôm Norwegian and they say our helthcare is among the best in the World. Well that may be right in some way, but there is certanly a long way to go before we have a decent treatment to the trans comunity. Needing to wait several years before being able to start on hormones, is devestating when you are at my age. I have already lost a lifetime, why am i denied a treatment i so clearly need? So to those who mean the gatekeeping is the right way to go; go f..k yourself, and let the world be as open as possible.
It is driven by fear and not üíú. üêªü¶à Post CPAC panic.
That's dreadful, really dislike the inclination that older trans people who yeah had to eat a lot of shit, that sucks. That is still no excuse for acting like a bunch crabs in a bucket.
What the hell
Im sorry but that sounds absolutely rediculous
I don‚Äôt really have any advice, but stuff like this fractures the community and it‚Äôs sad to see.
Cis people already police what versions of being trans are acceptable far too much. For god‚Äôs sake, trans communities shouldn‚Äôt bend to that for the sake of respectability or acceptance, they should stand firm against it. Make a real push against it. We don‚Äôt make things better for trans people by giving in to the whims of bigoted cis people.
Parents worked hard and endured hardships to give their kids a better life. Minority groups worked hard and endured bigotry, the indignities, and violence to give the future a better chance.

There are those who will tell stories of the old days.  These are important stories of our struggles that no one should forget, lest the past repeat itself.  

BUT, there are also asshats that expect others to ensure the same burdens and barriers they suffered.  

Don't fall into that trap or argument. Most of us don't want people to suffer the same things we did. From a 40-something living their best life.
Imho, it's rooted in insecurity and shame. When people aren't confident in their identity, sometimes they'll tear other people down to prop themselves up. As if somehow drawing a stupid box that they're in somehow proves their valid because they can't feel that way without said box. It really sucks.
I don‚Äôt understand truscum. 

I don‚Äôt qualify as a younger trans person by any metric - I am 36 and very much post transition. 

We were fighting against the gatekeeping the entire time that I have known I am trans - which is closing in on 20 years. Some of the people I talked to and learned from in the early years had been fighting gatekeeping for long than I have been alive - in 2004!

I know a wonderful trans woman elder in my city who has been fighting gatekeeping and medicalization since the 1970s. 

Queer rejection of cishetero norms isn‚Äôt new and wasn‚Äôt invented by Gen Z - even though I am deeply inspired by queer young people, they are taking up the fight and continuing to weave the beautiful tapestry of queer and trans history.
I feel that except it was some the elders in our local trans community especially trans dudes/ftm for some reason. Like they were all initially for the first 4/5 years super inclusive and everyone banded together. Then we won the city ordinance to protect trans people and things were great for about a year. Then everyone fractionalized in to cliques especially as some of the people more concerned with politics started to gain status. After that happened everyone just fell a part even the city ordinance we fought for years for got overturned temporarily and when reinstated it had been gutted. So I feel yeah and hope you are able to find a group that works.
I hate it when other trans people only accept other trans people conditionally
This shit ain‚Äôt conditional and it‚Äôs sad they‚Äôve convinced themselves that it is
Ah well I'd also be careful to avoid the discord group called the ""mancave"" as the admins and stuff there are truscum binary trans guys
They think the cis will spare them if they just assimilate enough but it's all for naught. At the end of the day they see us all the same.
I‚Äôd honestly just have responded with ‚Äúok boomer‚Äù because I‚Äôm a spiteful bitch lmao
Hey actually it can be considered a good thing. I mean it sucks that there's a disconnect but at the same time we're just like the cis ""back in my day we dressed conservatively now everyone sucks""
Yeah, I can pretty much promise that I'm better for not hearing their ""wealth of knowledge,"" and I'm glad they know I don't respect them, lol. To those people, I say the same thing I say to cis people. Just let us live our lives!
Transmeds and truscum are the ultimate bootlickers. They‚Äôll sell you out to cis people to try and make themselves more appealing to the public. Also like 90% of them hate themselves (and I think 90% is a conservative estimate)
Honestly I do not know, the only reason I can think of is that some people wanna feel extra special so they gatekeep what it means to be trans so it only includes them and people like them, I really can‚Äôt think of any other reason someone would be truscum beyond that.
Yeez, I‚Äòd never wish the young generation to go through the old shit. Sorry you lost a nice space, but better get out there and don‚Äòt look back. That group is gonna turn into a miserable place soon.
""Save you for last!"" Wow!!!! Powerful. That is a very important thing to to remember!!!!
SAME!  Tears-running-down-my-face same!
""Trans AND Lesbian? But that's TWO things! L, G, B, T, pick ONE, don't hog them!""

^^^^/s
I didn't transition when I was younger bc I didn't want to present femme before I looked it. Repressed for years, didn't realize informed consent was legalized in my state until I was 25, then started hrt immediately. F**k gatekeeping
I liken the whole mess to an elaborate shelving unit.

At some time in the past some system of power made this whole shelving unit system of labels to base society on. But as time went on these people continued to blossom with more and more complex self expressive behaviors.

Many centuries has past, and as the years went on the shelving unit grew more cluttered and chaotic with flashes of light and popping sounds until a whole multicolored variety of individuality was overflowing the shelves.

We've been overflowing for a long time... The old masters of the shelving unit are long gone, the halls of the castle cold and damp. The shelves themselves have been decaying for a while, and now all we're left with last stinking corpse of a draconian system from horrors long, long ago.
What is the real life test?
It‚Äôs not a sub, it‚Äôs a Facebook group, and they‚Äôre pretty strong about everything I mentioned in their group rules, pretty easy to spot
I'm also older at 41 translater, I'm actually finding myself taking to a lot of the way younger trans view things in a more ""whatever's clever"" kind of way. I think a big part of it is (when) you come out. If you come out today it's kind of like being born today and everything is new. Someone who came out back in the 80s was thrust into a different time when circumstances were different and that forever shaped their perception. It's generational viewpoint yet is related not completely to age but to the exit from the closet and entrance to the community. Just my thoughts.
Mid-40s trans woman here, and I agree completely üíúüíúüíú
same. fuck truscums.
Yeah, I think generation in trans sense is what time period it was when you were ""born"" ie the folks who came out during the bush era vs. today lol
And that‚Äôs the key point when the admin was discussing generational trans-ness, that the ones who have been out and transitioning since the 90‚Äôs are the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù (their words ü§¢)
bear dolpins... teddy shark... grr swim... cub fin... bear water bear... ursula?
>I don‚Äôt understand truscum.

It's basically fear of detransitioners going mainstream and that being used to punish trans people/prevent them from transitioning in the first place.
OT:  happy cakeday!
No risk of me going anywhere near a ""mancave"". Those fellas can have it ;)
THIS SO MUCH.

It's heartbreaking, but honestly this looks like something that surpasses any ideas of gender and such.

Older generations tend to get opinionated. And that too can be okay as long as we recognize each other's struggles in life.
Aww... you okay? üòø
Actually, pretransition, I had previously identified as bi, and briefly, gay (surprise, neither fit, but i knew I wasn't a straight guy, i was trying to figure things out).  Claimed the LGB AND T. ü§£  What do I win? ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Having curated an ever expanding collection of a collectible trading card game, and outgrowing several entire systems of organization, this metaphor really groks.
They made you live as your gender for years before even giving you hormones.

I was already passing, but how are you supposed to live full time as a woman for some bullshit gatekeeping requirement when you live at home with a bigoted father?  So I felt like a woman, passed for a woman,  but was forced to identify as a guy against my will.  It SUCKED.  At 23, I cut my hair short, and tried to ""man up"".  Didn't work
OK, thanks.
hmm... when i was seeking treatment as a child (gatekeeping by parents) i would have received... electric shock therapy.

when that didn't work... i'd have had to deal with doctors and work hard to appease them... and maybe they would have brainwashed me in the process of appeasement to accept their crap theories about me? idk.

i hate to think i might have projected that idiocy to the next generation...

fighting for care for 9 years before giving up and self medicating in my 40s puts me in the ""modern"" trans culture.  Sure, things like communism and cat girls are kinda 'whoosh' over my head, but i don't fault people for coming up with a culture around being trans... we kinda have to since we're thrown out of our country/religion/ethnic groups culture... and in some places the Rainbow throws us out as well...  and w/e people come up with a ""Trans Culture""... ofc it'll fit some better than others.

but that's no reason to criticize people in the sense of whether they're valid.  Sure, section off Discord servers by topic, have separate NSFW channels, etc.  And on Facebook... sure... some groups post pictures, some don't... I mean, in public i don't scroll Facebook cos the shitposting group I'm on is... not something I'd want someone in public to see :P  (there's no nudity, but if they read any of the  words i'd turn beet red :P ).

So yeah, if a group decides ""hey, we're trying to be SFW, so here's some rules""... but to couch it in ""the young people aren't so valid"" terms? ugh. awful.
The younger ones are super spicy and I'm proud of 'em. We just might win this hateful war one day :)
They seem to be projecting the trauma of their internalized transphobia onto the newer folks
I mean, yes, transitioning back then was very very different from now, and there was then a lot of emphasis put on labels and definitions because there had to be. The CIS wouldn't let you transition without jumping through hoops, so now that it is a lot easier, they (the old guard) feel like that struggle isn't being recognized. 

So they want to enforce that on the new kids, or at least want recognition for it. But they're wrong in thinking the old way is better (if they think so). I remember being very concerned about who identified as what back then, because it felt like we all had to be perfect to make any sort of progress to help the cause. 

Its entirely different now, and that's for the better, but it has come with an increase in visibility that has made us easier to target politically. That fear is likely what is driving this, along with the desire for recognition of how hard shit was back then.
called me by my second name? üêª
I feel like actually addressing the issues of detransition (transphobia and lacking support) as well as understanding that we often have to try an identity on before discovering what that means and adapting in the future isn‚Äôt a rejection of the trans community would be more helpful. 

For the former, this is the most common reason for detransition - facing transphobia with no support. 

For the latter, they are much rarer, but I personally know two people who could be considered detransitioned. One is nonbinary and HRT fucked with their mental health, although when we met they identified as a trans man. They stopped all forms of medical transition and remain socially transitioned as a nonbinary person. The other is another person who I met as a trans man who is now a cis women. She only went through about a year of social transition before realizing she is a little butch but not a man. Both people are very supportive of the trans community, although Kae definitely still identifies as trans.
Oh wow didn‚Äôt notice thx
Honestly no, but I will be ok. But my hormones just got changed AND I feel strongly about this.  I stopped my transition in my 20s for unrelated health reasons, but I would have started my second transition much earlier than I did if it hadn‚Äôt been for the gatekeepers I dealt with the first time.  This comment just hit hard when I was already weepy. 

And yes, I love the young people of today; they give me much needed hope.  Let them do their thing.

I'm currently a BLT üòÅ I am Bi, but I lean heavily towards attraction to women aesthetically and romantically, so I tend to just call myself a lesbian.

I didn't officially transition til 33, but i clearly transitioned  at 16.  Like, I grew my hair and nails, while at the same time totally changing up my wardrobe and dressing far more masc.  ...but people just saw a girl.  I male failed fucking constantly.  Then at 23, I cut my hair short and desperately tried to fit in with guys, but due to my girly build, I got treated like a child at best.

So, I basically transitioned at 16 and detransitioned at 23 before retransitioning at 33 (36 now).

Wish I would've just stayed the course, and came out in my early 20's. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòø
Source is ""Stranger in a Strange land"" by Heinlein. (Worth a read but, Ursula is better)
The reasons are different but the timeline is similar. First questioned in my teens, started to come out to friends, get electrolysis, etc. in my early twenties. Was looking for a good therapist when my health collapsed. I probably jumped to conclusions assuming HRT wasn‚Äôt an option anymore but for quite a few years it hardly mattered. When my health recovered a bit. I decided I wasn‚Äôt up to the stress of fighting with the medical system anymore and basically lived an odd half closeted / half gender queer life.  

It has had its good points. But my background feeling the entire time has been one of discontent. It finally reached peak the day I found myself seriously considering herbal supplements for breast growth. At that point, I decided I was being stupid and I would DIY real pharmaceuticals if I necessary. I didn‚Äôt get far in researching that before I found out just how much things have changed. At that point I did the logical thing and just went to a doctor and started officially on HRT. üòäüíúüíúüíú
I had a few other things I had to deal with before I addressed my gender, so that coupled with fear of persecution forced me to lock it away in the back of my mind until I was 26. I realized I was trans then,  but went back into the closet after convincing myself I ""wasn't trans enough."" Finally started HRT at 29.8 years old, been living as a woman full time for two years now. The Day of Visibility is my Rebirthday (though I didn't know it at the time). I planned to come out on Facebook the next day,  but what comes after March 31st?...yeah. so I instead waited until the first day of Pride month!
I often think about how I kind of ‚Äúsoft‚Äù transitioned when I was ages 17-19ish. Wore women‚Äôs jeans, grew my hair out and would color it. I still identified as a boy but I was not very gender conforming. 

In a sense I was harassed sometimes and somewhere between 19-20 I ‚Äúdetransitioned‚Äù to fit in. Didn‚Äôt start current transition until around 27-28. To be fair I also couldn‚Äôt really understand the fact that I was trans back then. I did not have a solid reference or information to back how I felt off.
Yeah, when i came out in 2019, I didn't know things had changed.  I thought I'd have to get all dolled up for HRT (like i read about in 2003), but no.  Combat boots, cargos, and flannel, and got my stuff.  Nobody questioned me.
Kinda funny how that happens.

I searched ""I'm a guy who wishes he was a girl"" at 17.  I knew I was trans, but i buried it.

If it weren't for my psycho dad and all the gatekeeping... i would've gotten through this at 20."	11jyzkh	trans	347	0.96	2023-03-06 13:29:37
App creator who wants to be as inclusive as possible :)	"Hi all, I hope it's ok to post this here, if not i understand if it needs to be removed.

I've launched an app to help people find running partners in their area, and in the profile creation process, we ask users to put their gender. Our current options are:

* Male
* Female
* Trans
* Non-Binary
* Other

I wanted to reach out to the trans community and ask for any feedback or advice or if you read this list and feel included or excluded.

Thanks so much in advance and I hope you're all having great days, wherever you are :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for the great responses! Consensus seems to be that we should remove trans as it's not actually a gender in and of itself, more an additional descriptor in the same (but apposite) sense as cis. I also love the idea of adding a 'prefer not to say' option :)

&#x200B;

For those of you who asked, the app is called BuddyUp and we launched just a few weeks ago, only on iOS and we're focussing our advertising on London, UK so unless you live in London, you're unlikely to find people nearby you sadly, but IG follows and shoutout are always welcome ;)"	"thanks for posting this only one thing, trans isn‚Äôt a gender
I would drop trans, as it is not a gender, just a specifier that correlates assigned gender at Birth with actuall gender.
Other than that, thanks for taking the extra step.
Definitely don‚Äôt include trans as a gender as a trans man isn‚Äôt a ‚Äútrans‚Äù, he‚Äôs a man. Props for asking and checking with people!
I do always find it a bit strange when trans is listed as a separate category like that, like yes I am trans but I am also female, no less so than a cis woman is. Whether someone is trans or cis is kind of just a different question than whether they are male, female, or non-binary.
Please have a ""Prefer not at say"" as well, unless for some reason gender is integral to that app (in which case, rethink that). Lots of questioning people might be uncomfortable having to chose an option. 

And get rid of ""trans"", that's not a gender lol
Most options I've seen that require gender fill in are: male, female, other. Or non-binary/other.
I would remove ""trans"" as an option as it is an identifier of having changed gender or gender presentation at some point in the past, not a gender in itself. Nonbinary is a perfectly treasonable umbrella to use as a ""third option"" that covers a wide variety of fluid and other genderqueer identities. The others I might recommend adding if you want to offer as much representation as possible are ""Agender"" and ""Genderfluid"". (Folks who have no gender, and folks whose gender varies over time).

Thanks for wanting to be inclusive, comrade!
Agreeing with others here, no need for trans as an option, I feel included if forms have a nonbinary/other option. As a runner, this is exactly what I've been hoping for actually, what's the app called?
If you want to be as inclusive as possible, just put a box where people can enter their gender instead of choosing from a list of genders
I would take out trans. Maybe add genderfluid? And definitely the ability to change your gender.
Add that you could change your gender at anytime
I'd say add trans or cis in addition after you check the male or female box

Trans isn‚Äôt a unique gender, so don‚Äôt make it a unique choice
From the other comments maybe this is just a personal bugbear, I'd replace ""Male"" with ""Man"" and ""Female"" with ""Woman"".

In my mind Male/Female are purely biological categories, ones that you might fit into regardless of your gender, and I worry it reinforces the idea that biology and gender are linked in some way.
My question is why are you making a running app and pairing people by gender. Why not pair people based on preferred running time and endurance, average running speed, intensity, and on the route. Make the functionality so that you can either have a random new partner daily or have a commitment running buddy,
How about:

Male:

‚Ä¢Cisgender

‚Ä¢Transgender

Female:

‚Ä¢Cisgender

‚Ä¢Transgender

Non-Binary

Gender fluid 

Other:
___________________

Prefer not to answer.
I would have male, female, trans-male, trans female, non-binary, and prefer not to say.

Then when someone is looking for a running partner ask them wether they would prefer female,male, or either. And then have a checkbox lgbtq friendly.

If someone selects trans female/non binary include them on female/either matches with lgtbq

If someone selects trans male/non binary include them on male/either matches with lgtbq

If someone selects prefer not to say, only include them on either matches.

The reason been, some women would want a female running partner, some may not care, a good example is muslim women etc‚Ä¶

Trans is not a gender, and puts both trans men and women into one category, while they are both opposite genders.
drop the trans, that's not a gender just an adjective, also maybe replace ""Nonbinary"" with ""Other: \_\_\_\_"" so people can specify whatever they want

oh, and if someone types in ""attack helicopter"" block them from making an account/give a message saying ""r/onejoke"" or something similar
Personally, I feel the option of being able to choose ""trans"" as an option for choosing to display one's gender, for those that are gender-fluid or otherwise in their medical/social transition; is valid.

I prefer the ambiguity of using ""trans"", as a short way of stating how I'm a ""person of trans experience"", nothing more, nothing less, as my genitalia doesn't define me and I don't identity or relate to the general consensus in understanding of what the umbrella term ""nonbinary"" is mostly understood to be.

Based on my personal experience interacting on social media/dating apps when given the option to choose how I identify, it misrepresents my identity, I prefer just stating that I am trans, when guven the opportunity to choose gender options, as I am ""trans""-""gendered"". Be it as it may, I suffer with a fluid form of gender dysphoria, I'm still trans.


I feel it should be displayed along the lines of:

Sex: 
‚Ä¢Male
‚Ä¢Intersex
‚Ä¢Female
‚Ä¢Prefer not to disclose (or another option to not have to pick one)

Gender:
‚Ä¢Female (Add option to include ""Trans"" in front of the word Female and male option as well as the word ""Cis"" for those that prefer it in addition of the option not to include it)
‚Ä¢Male (Same ""cis"",trans"", prefer not to include either options as stated above)
‚Ä¢Trans
‚Ä¢Nonbinary 
‚Ä¢Nuetrois
‚Ä¢Adrogyne
‚Ä¢Gender-Fluid
‚Ä¢Gender Nonconforming 

Pronouns:
(option to not include them as well as options to mix them (He/They/Her, etc..)
‚Ä¢He/Him
‚Ä¢She/Her
‚Ä¢They/Them
*far in the back ground* booo ios next you gonna say Linux is better (that is all from the comp sci trans girl)
Wow, I think the comments covered it, but thank you for actualy asking for input.
thanks for asking, ideally I think it should be male, female, non-binary, and prefer not to say :)
How about add a custom button so for some of the genders not listed it can still be shown I don‚Äôt know how hard that would be to program
[deleted]
I mean trans isn't a gender, but you could do something like

Cis Male
Trans Male
Cis Female
Trans Female
Non-binary
Gender fluid
Questioning 
Prefer not to say

I think that's a pretty full list
All you really need is 

-male

-female

-non binary 

-prefer not to say
maybe what if you did pronouns instead? she/her they/them he/him?
Hey I know you already got all the answers you probably need regarding this subject, but I want to say thank you, actually! Not a lot of people even consider trans people when making apps, much less try to be inclusive. Your thoughtfulness is really appreciated.
possibly a custom option, with custom pronouns you can write in! for example, he/him/his/himself but people can customize it, as well as an option for multiple pronouns!
for the custom pronouns, it can be used for neopronouns for example , xe/xem/xeirs/xemself !
I would totally drop trans! And rq one thing to add is that you shouldn‚Äôt probably add trans or cis as an option because it‚Äôs more or less private information! Plus I know a few people who would feel pretty uncomfortable stating their trans-ness to a bunch of strangers outside the community! Just something to consider! Other than that it seems good!
i already see you've gotten on board with the idea of dropping 'trans', i think it would be a cool feature where people could add their pronouns,, gender doesnt always correspond to pronouns, so it may be helpful, as well as adding an option for ""genderfluid"". thanks for checking in with actual trans people for this, we appreciate ally's like you:)<3
Maybe write man and woman instead of male and female. I personally feel a lot more comfortable referring to myself as a man than as a male, and trans is also not a gender.
Make trans optional or leave it out :) so im a trans woman that means id choose the option for female and maybe trans as an optional however i could also put that in my description, what is your app called?
Others have already answered, and I live in the Netherlands so hopefully you expand, but I think a lot of queer people would feel safer excersising in numbers, so an option to select queer running buddies would be great, discourages possible aggressors and queer people are generally safer to excercise with (except for Terf lesbians I guess).
thank you :)
thank you :)
thanks :)
thank you :)
great advise, gonna change to this!
thank you :)
awesome, thank you :) The app is called BuddyUp but 90% of our users are and will for the forseeable future be in London, so if you live elsewhere you won't get much out of it
Difficult to deal with such inputs for filtering by the app.
Yep, that‚Äôs an option :)
thank you :)
+1
makes it feel like they're different, if being trans isnt very important to the function of the app just drop the trans entirely (but keep nbonbinary/other)
thank you :)
Haha gotta work out the bugs somehow
we're thinking of going with Male, Female, Non-Binary and Other and there's a slider switch to choose not to show your gender on your profile at all
As a rule of thumb, if you‚Äôre unsure about something, so are other people, so you just gotta ask nicely and people are usually cool
Ahh OK, yes I'm a long way from London. Best of luck with the app, I'm sure many will find it valuable
yep, this is exactly the reason, plus it stops transphobic morons from describing themselves as attack helicopters and the like
Also, change name at any time.
Or don't actually, Im wrong, and i just realised that

How a female only meeting ruined my day.	"So, I'm mostly at peace with ~~not being a woman~~ *EDIT: my dysphoria*. Sure, there are stuff in my body I dislike and would prefer to be different, but who doesn't? Sure, there are situations that are painful and that probably will be painful, like going through pregnancy with my partner, but I can prepare myself and handle that pain.

The problem is, sometimes you don't see this things coming, and if RPGs have taught me something is that surprise attacks are always effective.

My place of work is rather inclusive, and has a surprisingly high percentage of female workers considering the field. It has a number of policies in place to make it welcoming and diverse, which I appreciate a lot. It shouldn't have caught me this off-guard then that there are female only meetings, that's a rather frequent policy, but it did. I'm devastated by the feeling of being left out and despair at never being able to completely fit in.

It is nobody's fault, my gender identity is not public knowledge at work nor am I planning to make it so, just sharing and kind of reaching out. I will be ok tomorrow, as long as I don't catch another sneak attack.

Thanks for reading."	"Sorry to hear this. Made me flash back to being left out when all my female friends as kids would have sleepovers and talk about how fun they were and I had to pretend I didn't care. Hang in there!
Just out of curiosity, and I apologize if this is out of line (I'll delete it if asked to) but why not come out at work? From the body of your post it seems like a very tolerant and LGBTQ friendly place so why put yourself through unnecessary emotional turmoil when you have the opportunity to alleviate it ina safe work environment?

Again, I apologize if this is out of line. I'm just trying to understand your thought process regarding this.
I‚Äôm sorry to hear this, it does feel really bad missing out on things like these. I hope you‚Äôre able to take small steps towards the future and be your true self. ‚ù§Ô∏è
In the closet or not you are still a woman. Sorry you don't feel like you can come out and are in an unsupportive country. I remember how much it hurt to not be out and not be able to be in women's spaces where I belonged. I hope things change for you, but remember trans women are women regardless of being out or not.
Been there. Sucks. And it wasn‚Äôt even intentional of them, like you, I‚Äôm not out to them yet. So, I can‚Äôt blame them, it‚Äôs just too early.
yup. my highschool has a ""Girls who Code"" club aswell as a lot of feminist clubs.

I obviously really support the message and the clubs in general since it's designed to empower women for fields which are kind of still male-dominated. just kinda hits when I realize that i'm not actually a woman and can't really join it. then my dysphoria all comes and reminds me how fargone I am from ever reaching that ""goal"".

though it's not that bad since being suicidal over that for a day is better than being shot for coming out, so that's kind of the silver lining atleast lol
At my old job it was very in frequent, but there was a once a year thing that was only for women, which was‚Ä¶ I mean I wasn‚Äôt out to myself fully at the time, I just have thought about it a lot and it caused me sadness without me really totally consciously understanding, but‚Ä¶ Yeah, that was kind of hard.

I would think to myself ‚Äúwell, I understand why I‚Äôm not being invited and it‚Äôs OK‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt like social stuff anyway so‚Ä¶‚Äù But still, I wanted to just be able to be perceived correctly, look right.
Thank you. I think everyone around here can relate to it. That is sad, but it also means we can support each other.
Fucking same. Or all the jokes that came with being bad at football and having mostly female friends in school.
TL;DR: Maybe eventually over something more serious, when I've already made closer connections with my coworkers.

Not out of line at all, but there are many small reasons that pile up.

The first one is I'm not sure it is that trans friendly. Many people (at least in my country) are LGB friendly and tolerant and have not a clue about what to do or think about trans, and I'm not mentally in a place I can afford to be the ""standard bearer"" for the issue. We are still quite invisible here, and TERFs are a powerful voice in my country's public opinion.

There is also that even when the agenda of the company is towards inclusion, I wouldn't expect my coworkers to easily understand it. If I become a bit closer to some of them I might come out to them individually and little by little come out at work, but it's not even been a year and I don't want to jeopardize friendly, normal work relations. As hypocritical as that might be.

And lastly, if the issue was more serious, such as a coworker being openly transphobic, I would come out and take the consequences anyway, but the meeting thing is something really petty. What would be the outcome? To be allowed to join in a meeting that doesn't really interest me and have to come out to a lot of women that, while working for the same company I do, I do not know personally at all to explain my presence? That doesn't seem worth it.

The emotional turmoil doesn't really come from not being able to join the meeting, but from being reminded of my ""unwomaness"" without expecting it. The damage is done regardless of wether or not I attend the meeting.

Thank you for your concern.
Good catch on my transphobic self-talk. I didn't know I needed to hear that, thank you very much. I'm very glad I made this post ‚ô•
If we don't, who will?
Thanks for being understanding of my question and giving sucj a thorough response. I understand better now.
If you are mtf you can‚Äôt be excluded from female only events
It'd be pretty shitty and weird of me to make a post to share and reach out and then be offended at people's curiosity and concern.

Still, one can never be too careful or considerate, and people can definitely be shitty and/or weird when upset, so thank you for being a wonderful human being."	pz5b30	trans	297	0.99	2021-10-01 10:37:28
In Defense of UWU culture, or How I learned to stop worrying and embraced the NYA	" 

(trigger warning, for serious discussion of transphobia and transphobic language as well as some language) 

I have noticed on many trans online spaces, some serious scoldy criticism against anime style catgirl/uwu culture that many internet transfemmes treasure and post regularly. I understand the criticisms are obvious and intuitive to many, that a lot of anime culture is problematic and overly sexualised in an often creepy way. However, something within the spirit of uwu, yet lights the hearts of countless trans with a feeling like hope. A feeling not explained in words, and I wish to do my best to serve the catgirl nation, to find those words, to defend the subculture that has proven such a balm to my jaded broken heart. 

I want to start my argument with historical western culture. I want to start with an anecdote referencing trans youtuber May‚Äôs amazing video essay on the western 80‚Äôs slasher, Sleepaway Camp. The TLDR version, is that it is a profoundly transphobic film, where the final line at the end of the movie, is the ‚Äúhorrific‚Äù reveal that the female presenting slasher, has male genitalia, shouting ‚ÄúSHEs a DUDE!‚Äù even within the safe context of a trans video essay, this scene was painful to watch. 

The interesting take on this movie, is not pointing out all the many, many ways this movie is offensive, but in the strange way that May, and I as her audience, took strange inspiration from the movie. May projects an interpretation where a kind, innocent and really cute trans girl gets epic violent revenge on ‚Äúvictims‚Äù who for the most part, are really abusive and mean to her. It is likely a symptom of how microscopic popular trans representation is, and how DESPERATE us trans are, to find something inspiring in any image that vaguely reminds us of ourselves. Even if the movie is made to be awful to us, May is so jaded, she just wants to find some joy in a cute looking trans character getting revenge on assholes. I relate to that level of cynicism and emotional exhaustion.

Of course, popular western culture has progressed since the 80‚Äôs, the president can say ‚Äútrans rights‚Äù and a good looking enough tran can give those particular kind of ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù speeches that suburban white people in auditoriums like. It appears like we might be getting a lick, a slight hint at possible full social acceptance, and with that, comes the temptation to try to fit in with popular society. But, and this is a big but, where is the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù trans representation in western culture right now? What TV character embodies someone that a young transfemme today, feels is inspiring and relatable, or dare I even suggest, sexy or cool? 

This is my own anecdotal experience, but the last trans representation I saw in western TV was a chick who got murdered on a cop show, and some family drama where an ugly tran was kind of a bitch (not in a cool way) and caused problems for the main cast. Oh yea, and during Halloween I saw Leprechaun in the Hood where a trans character was brutally murdered as well for laughs. Then there are characters like Nia Nal in supergirl, who are explicit pander characters who make me cringe in a way deeper and grosser than anime ever has. Such characters are examples of pure astroturfing. (for the young uns, astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.) 

Which finally brings me to the main subject of this little manifesto. Anime. anime has a lot of trans representation (compared to the popular west.) Whether its the adventurer girl in ‚Äúthat time I got turned into a spider‚Äù or Tanya in ‚ÄúThe story of Tanya the Evil‚Äù or that noble knight in ‚ÄúMagical Girl Raising Project.‚Äù They are written naturally into the stories not to make a political statement, but because the authors, many of which are cis male, felt that such characters served the story they wanted to tell. Sometimes those representations are problematic, often they are overly sexualised. But there IS representation, lots of it, evil characters, good characters, tragic and comedic, from ‚ÄúStop!! Hibari Kun!‚Äù to serious discussion of self harm and suicide in ‚ÄúJJ Macfield and the Ilsand of Memories‚Äù (which is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned.) 

In Anime, trans poeple are not just ‚Äúvalid‚Äù, or ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù but are as full people as the rest of the cast, and you can find them as heroes villains and everything in  between, you can find them modest or as total uwu sex fiends. As a young tran, you can choose from an actual diverse menu of characters to relate to, something not easily said elsewhere. Hell, here in the west contemporary trans are motivated to stan for the fucking sleepaway camp slasher because representation is literally that scarce and shitty. 

Which takes me back to Sleepaway camp. A lot of people in popular culture, especially outside the circles of well to do proggressive types, cringe at the existence of trans people, even today. Many cis poeple find us disgusting, strange, dangerous, the subjects of horror movies. I want to draw a connection, between the way many of those same bigots turn their noses with disgust and contempt towards overly sexualised anime women, is literally the same reaction they give to depictions of ANY kind of trans women. Because they see trans women as devient sex objects. Please consider how a trans femme might see Felix Argyle, or that anime about the tran who lives in boy mode, but puts on a skirt and makeup when they activate their magic ‚Äúsave the world‚Äù smartphone app (and looks cute doing it.) Consider how much their projection is amplified 10 fold when their bullies and political enemies cringe the same way at their fictional heroes as they do against them personally.

Consider the art style itself, how the abstraction and lack of detail in anime faces obscures many of the details that trans feel super inescure about, and that when a tran appears in anime, even problematic representations, like the waitress from Persona or whatever, *they get to look hot*, they get to be attractive and normal looking compared to other girls in anime. Think about how much we trans WANT that. We dont just want to be accepted, but most of us, dont want to rock the stubble and adams apple forever, we want to be conventionally attractive, those anime boobs are #transition goals, and that is both true, deeply emotionally intimate, and not a socially acceptable thing that your #trans ally joe biden can say out loud. 

Which brings me back to western culture, and the nature of our progressive ‚Äúallies.‚Äù Yes, we have allies, and trans rights have improved, but for popular hegemonic society, I think any well lived tran understands how *conditional* that societal acceptance is. The proggressive caucus will accept certain kinds of de-sexualised, de-radicalised politically narrow representation of trans in a way that does not challenge capitalism,gender, or even our place in the society they are willing to give us some seat at the table for. Even then, acceptance and integration in such a culture often means implicitly selling out many of our sisters who are poor, indiginous, neurodivergent, or politically extreme. Popular progressive culture is a place we can survive, as long as we know our place, but it is not a place where we can feel safe.

For so many trans who spend all day, living in the most ‚Äúpresentable‚Äù way possible, trying their best to not get fired, or evicted, or be the subject of a cringe youtube clip used as a pretext by bigots to say horrible things to us (AKA Gamestop tran freakout.) So many of us want to a space to stop living in fear, to express our hidden emotions, our hidden desires, the things we feel and think that your mom wouldn't feel comfortable liking on a facebook post. 

Anime culture is a place for social outcasts. For better and for worse, all sorts of people who don't fit in, whether its neo nazis on 4 chan, and yes, young trans femmes, find something relatable in the depiction of an artistic culture that glorifies being an outsider. I think thats important, I think its essential that we have that kind of outsider culture amongst ourselves, at least within the internet for christs sake. 

A tran well versed in our history, must understand the role that Camp has played in queer culture. For those less well read, the camp movement is the ongoing artistic trend in dressing in intentionally gaudy and off putting old looking clothing and over the top makeup in order to challenge society and draw attention to standing out as an individual opposed to what normally looks ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúfashionable.‚Äù Most of what is recognizable in modern drag culture is derivative of Camp. The point is, that in the darkest most transphobic days of our history, Trans found each other, and inspiration and hope and solidarity in artistic movement of intentionally standing out and causing the normies to cringe. There is a reason that many of us find something inspiring in the famous Babs Johnson clip, ‚ÄúKill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat Shit!!!Filth is my politics! Filth is my life! !‚Äù

There is something noble in giving a finger to the society which has scorned us to make a point about their hypocrisy. That is important, sacred, meaningful. To me it means, ‚ÄúI will not live or judge myself by your rules fuckers‚Äù That kind of subversive inclusivity needs to be a part of our sub culture, or a bunch of atomsied trans are going to spend a lot of time living in terror of never being accepted outside of successfully ‚Äúpassing‚Äù not even just as a cis female, but as a socially normative kind of tran. 

Therefore, the fact that uwu culture makes many respectable types cringe, is an essential feature of why it is popular. If we were to as a community, replace it, it must be with a cultural language equally or even more offensive to the same sort of people. We must not become whitewashed. Because lets be absolutely clear that this is the de facto effect of appeals to cut down on the catgirl shit. The racial politics behind such appeals. In lieu of eastern anime style art as a uniter, the popular trans culture will not become inundated with diverse art styles and references to artistics movements from africa or south America. The anime replacement art will be overwhelmingly western, and overwhelmingly white. They may often depict dark skinned characters, but they will overwhelmingly be the proggressive western white persons idea of what a POC trans ‚Äúshould‚Äù look like, there will be less sexual creepiness, but there will be a lot less diversity of any kind at all. We all all become fucking Nia from supergirl, who writes Joe Biden speeches and thinks the CIA is cool. That's what such a conversion would ask of us to become. Who relates to that? The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything  but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less ‚Äúused‚Äù by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria. 

Which brings us finally, to the horny shit. To the deeply problematic way that a lot of anime tends to sexualize a certain kind of innocence that comes across as offesnively pedophillic or just plain infantilising to women in general. This accusation cannot be in wholesale denied, after all, Anime is an entire genre of art with  diverse depictions, many of which are just plain indefensibly awful and bad. But it would be a bad faith claim, to say that even the specific parts of anime culture that trans culture has idealised, like Astolfo or Felix Argyle, do not exemplify a certain kind of veneration of cutesy innocence.

Yet, I still would ask this of many western critics. ‚ÄúWhat is wrong in YOUR culture, where innocense and being cute, is tied so closely and exclusively to concepts of pedophilia or children. Why do western women have to put so much effort into masculinizing themselves and de sexualising themselves to be taken seriously as adults in male dominated fields?‚Äù As Natalie Wynn puts it, why do so many college girls take weird pride in dressing modestly, yet still going for a ‚Äúsexy in a stacy kind of way?‚Äù What parts of yourself has your patriarchal culture asked you to suppress to be taken seriously? 

Do we not all want to be cute sometimes? To feel innocent sometimes? To feel sexy sometimes too, to go back and forth, to be both at once? Are not those part of the feminine experience and mood? Yes, I can be serious, and grim, and professional, and androgynous, but must I be such things all of the time? Cant I be a slut if I want? Cant I also be a church girl sometimes without being catcalled or judged? Cant I just be a complete fucking person who feels the full spectrum of human emotions in different contexts times and places? Are you not asking us to lobotomise half our souls, to cut off half the sky of our experience? Cant trans women just at least, suffer and embarass ourselves riding the razor edge of the madona/whore social complex half of cis women have to balance between? Cant the artistic representation of that have cat ears? A creature whose name has become culturally synonymous in the west with female anatomy? Why must trans women always be serious, mature and sexless? I am jaded, I am cynical, I am always presenting in the kind of business casual attire and attitude requested from post grad students. Cant I just give a soft uwu on the internet in a mournful hopeful contemplation of the lost girlhood I never got to experience? Why do I need to keep up the fucking business casual mindset even on the godamm internet? 

Im weird. A neurodivergent communist queer, I dont fit in to most places, but I like fitting in with the culture of people who say uwu to celebrate that they dont fit in the same way. I think its cool anime has some many non gender comforming characters, I like that the characters are cute, I want to look like that kind of, not just a little bit because comparing myself to real life cis women hurts in a way that it doesnt to compare myself to the abstracted drawings.

I think its heroic how the internet catgirls know they cause people to cringe, but are fearless in being seen and heard anywhere, I think its heroic they way they challenge social expectation, I think its heroic that they dare to express their desires to be cute, I think its heroic the way they provide a light beacon for other people who fit in, not even just trans, but other queers and non queer good hearted weirdos as well. I admire the catgirls, at their cringiest, at their most pathetic 100 times more than I can ever admire fucking Nia from Supergirl. And to really draw the ultimatum, those really are the only two options, the only two options with the cultural clout to compete for trans subculture hegemony for whatever that's worth. So I ask all you trans, especially the femmes, to look in your hearts and ask what your feelings are inspired by, what you want and what you want to be. Communist catgirl who makes people uncomfortable, or neoliberal sockpuppet who can speak in public, but can't be seen kissing anyone on TV. 

This is my final point, my takeaways from my lengthy pro catgirl manifesto about television, anime politics and gender. Coming out was hard, I was so ashamed of coming out and being seen as an ‚Äúugly girl.‚Äù Finding the catgirl shit online, was the moment I realised, ‚Äúfuck, im not the only one, Im not alone.‚Äù I ask you this, without the catgirl shit, in our current culture and moment in 2021, what could you show that sad tran in boy mode to inspire her to be brave enough to be cringe? Not enough to ‚Äúuwu‚Äù un public, but to transition to their friends and family, to show her that causing other people to be uncomfortable with you isn't the end of the world? To show her that being weird and wanting to be cute yet sexy is okay? If we were to vote Tabby the catgirl off our island, who would take her place? Uwu."	"You wrote a whole uwu essay, uwu

Keep spinning. Uwu.
Honestly, as a neuro divergent technically bi, MtF politically unaffiliated, liberal progressive humanist that's obsessed with cuteness and loves cat girls, fox girls, and those cringy bits in anime that makes those people mad, I fully agree with this post, even though some of it did go over my head, I get the gist of it. Honestly uwu and nya culture is adorable and memetacular XD. There's a lot of people who identify with these characters and some even put on similar personas, and in some cases, fursonas. Honestly anime was my doorway into self discovery since my mom was one of the most over protective and controlling people I knew at the time. I didn't even know LGBTQ was a thing before I turned 14 and thought anime was cartoons like Danny phantom. I was such a lame ignorant normie back then doing my best to blend in cause I didn't know what was wrong with me or how best to describe it. Had LGBTQ people had more and better representation in western media I'd have learned what that feeling was far sooner. I had asked my friend if he ever wanted to be a girl and he looked at me taken aback with a surprised what? And I looked away nervous and said nvm it was nothing and left it well alone. I was 10 at the time and still had no clue what it was or why I felt the way I did. And anime helped guide me towards my answers indirectly, took me looking up some crossdressing anime characters and finding theories as to why they are the way they are, as well as anime like kamfer to find myself and discover what transgender was. Though it's a shame it took so long for me to figure things out. Then what lead me to learn about lesbians was Yuri anime and my god is that one of my favorites. Which honestly lead me to at first think I was a trans lesbian.  But I couldn't shake something for a while and I didn't really know how else to explain it. I wasn't attracted to men in any way shape or form, yet I found myself attracted to characters like astolfo, asuramaru, and Felix. Characters whom as you so bluntly stated was basically chicks with dicks.  I honestly have no idea how to describe it without it sounding like a fetish because I'm still very ignorant. 
I don't even know how to make sense of it. It wasn't until I learned of the identity Gynosexual/gynoromantic and another version which is similar that I recently learned of, neptunic. Both of which from my simple understanding are simply an attraction to femininity in general. Which I think more or less fits me. Though is that valid? I have no idea. Honestly to me it just kinda feels like bi with extra steps. Am I just lesbian? Or bi with a strong feminine preference? My journey started thanks to anime, helping me as a guide, and I've been figuring stuff out since then.
Damn... Just got linked here from another post, but... Damn... I want so bad to valiantly embrace my cringiest but most comfortable side of myself as you say here... Just for the sake of feel the most true to myself, even at expenses of other people's opinion... 

I need this, not only written, but put in practice by me...

>The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less ‚Äúused‚Äù by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria.

I didn‚Äôt know anyone ever thought of cat girl stuff or ‚Äúuwu‚Äù speak that highly. I just thought it was some crap creepy people use. Or what extremely childish people use.
Just wanna say I‚Äôm another person that got linked to this several months later and my god thank you for putting this into words so goddamn well, I may not feel exactly the same but this makes me feel extremely seen

Also tho I wanted to share that almost immediately after reading this I scrolled down and saw this post (but crossposted to r/gaysoundsshitposts): https://reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/tzp0sl/anime_irl/

And it immediately made me think back to your essay and like, does this comic feel extremely offensive problematic and out of touch? Yes absolutely, but does the person in it also look incredibly cute and absolutely rock that maid dress and make me wish I looked like that? Also yes absolutely
in the words of max0r, i may be cringe, but that makes me free
I'm not transfem, but live some of the boyness I've never had through strong, cute, honest shonen anime (and video game) characters. And I'm crying as I read this.
UwU is a need on this hostile world. Especially for non-normative folks like us neurodivergent, racialized trans and enbies.
i literally do not have the ability to read all of this

i am so fuxkibgw aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
>astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.

Small point to the overall essay, but this doesn't seem like a very good definition of astroturfing. It's kind of the opposite actually. The point of astroturfing is to make it seem like it's coming from the general public. Astroturfing would be if the subversive movement, coming from the government or marketing itself, pretended that their position was public consensus in the first place. Co-opting a subversive movement, by definition, would be counterproductive because that would mean it's not public consensus. Similarly, if a point of view is being pushed by a show it is by definition not astroturfing because it isn't trying to appear like it's coming from the general public.
i feel so seen i am glad that i am not the only one who wants to be an adorable cat girl >w<. i'm going to keep uwuing and blushing because i love being cute so much >\\\\<
Same here, the way it is all said, puts perfectly into words a lot of thoughts I could never describe

Bingo. I agree, very insensitive. But I also agree that the heart of the comic, the soul of the thing is promoting and idea of acceptance of gender non conformity.

Love me some inclusion in games <3		"Also my go-to rig in the game
Always use Claires truck. When I found out she was trans I was like omg no way me tooo üòÇ
Claire's Sidequests are some of my favorite in Cyberpunk. Even though your time with her is very short, I was so surprised by how well written she was. I'm honestly hoping that I get to see more of her in DLC. 

It is super neat that CD Projekt Red was able to get a Trans VA to voice her as well. Maddie Taylor did great work.
My girlfriend was just telling me about this!!
I really liked how for one, every character in the game uses her pronouns and also how she tells you about her gender transition and it's just part of conversation. It's not blown up or made into any big deal. ü•∞üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
When she said, ‚Äúwhen I started my transition‚Äù then they went straight into talking about cyber gear and I was like oh okay transition from human to cyberware. Nope lol wrong I was
Poor game choice to look up for representation
[removed]
[removed]
I C both sides like Chanel.
[deleted]
I say you're right to ask for more. More representation, better representation. If we don't ask for better, it won't get better.
From what I've seen they're at least trying to make an effort and that counts in my book.
I get it's strange that they tied pronouns to voice type and I'm not going to argue it's perfect representation, but it must be recognised as a really important step towards wider acceptance and normalisation. Don't really see how it 'ties trans identities to genitalia' it's character system is pretty gender abolitionist actually
It does let you choose based on voice. It tells you at the top what pronouns characters will follow.ü§î
It's voice not genitalia
You can drive around in this truck and your eyes are blasted with the chromanticore ad which they decided to place fucking everywhere. One of the most blatant and off-puttingly designed by committee game I've ever played.
I'm going to add this game for allow he or she pronouns  but not they and them it also doesnt allow the agender which is upsetting 

How ever it does have what ever gender parts or the choice of nothing there.

So yeah games pretty trashy  like borderlands prequel mix of watchdogs but  ignoring the shit the game is kinda okay just story isn't worth it  side missions are more instresting
[removed]
But they don't though? Your genitalia doesn't correspond to the gender of your character at all.

All games 'could' allow you to chose pronouns, yet they don't, and yet they aren't getting flak. It seems troublesome that the one game that actually does make some progress with trans customisation is getting so much crap. It's not perfect by all means, but we should be encouraging it to get better and establish a standard for trans customisation in games. Not hating on them like this. 

If this is how the trans community responds to their efforts, the devs are much more likely to go ""fuck it, we're not going to try and please these people"". It happens all the time, there is no sense pushing people away just because their work isn't absolutely perfect the first time around.
Yeah CDPR made mistakes but at least there trying to make amends
[removed]
Yes, and trans people should be gendered by their voice.

/s
I think they‚Äôre talking about the ‚Äòmix it up‚Äô ad that‚Äôs in-game
[removed]
I just hope the devs are able to fix the issues
How would that make a difference though? How many trans women would pick a male bodied form and male voice but still pick she/her? Most people, even pre-crack eggs, tend to pick idealised forms.
I'm sorry I'm not sure what you're trying to say here, could you maybe rephrase?
I'm not saying it's ideal, but it's still miles ahead of anything else out there. Especially when it comes to AAA games. A simple separation from voice and pronouns would have made it almost perfect. *Almost*üòÅ
[removed]
[removed]
It reinforces the most common way a bigoted person can harass you at work.
As unpopular of an opinion as it might be, I completely agree. Cyberpunk irrefutably has some of the best (if not the best) options for character customisation of trans characters. It's absolutely not perfect, but it's rediculous how much flak they get because it's not perfect. You can't choose your pronouns in Call of duty, halo, skyrim, GTA etc. And yet nobody is complaining about that. The only people who are getting crap are the ones that actually tried.
I am aware that they haven't made the best choices all around, but you don't invest all that time and energy into trans affirming customisation if you don't care. We should be celebrating it while encouraging it to move forward and establish a standard for other games to follow.
Excuse me? But we have a full right to call out devs if they‚Äôre doing something wrong. While it may seem like a stupid thing, being misgendered is something us trans people don‚Äôt really get along with. If we‚Äôre meant to create characters then in our opinion, pronouns should be executed correctly. That‚Äôs just how it is.

Why are you even in this sub if you‚Äôre complaining about this
I am a Trans Game Dev, and can say that there aren't exactly a huge surplus of trans developers out there. I don't think it's fair to criticise a company making efforts to diversify their products. I feel extremely grateful that developers out there care about representation in their games, despite not having those specific minorities working there yet.
And trust me, bigotry doesn't fly in the games industry, it's a very closely knit community, and word gets around about bigoted developers fast. I've never worked with anyone that was any less than amazingly supportive.
Even with that said, diversity is slowly getting better. Since at a root level, trans lives and women's career choices are improving (with progress still to go however).
Society has had some seriously out of wack views for a very long time that have unfortunately been normalised, this is the work of bigoted people who's work is slowly becoming unraveled and I've never been in a industry more committed to that the games industry. These are not the people perpetuating those standards. It's schools, parents, and cultural values that are. It's not the games industries fault that young women are steered away from games careers and how trans people still aren't totally normalised by society everywhere.
I actually worked on a project in the last year where one of the developers stopped making progress because he wanted a trans woman of colour on the project writing some of the research. Which was incredibly bold and thoughtful of him, but it killed the project dead and it nearly didn't launch on time for that reason. We couldn't find someone of that demographic in that field, so we had to chose between cancelling it or launching it without the before mentioned writer. But by pushing the project out we could at least show that trans people of colour are supported and accepted by us, even if wasn't written by someone as such. And it was Incredibly well received and was touching for so many people. It was still a step of progress, showing trans people that there is a place for them in the world working in companies like that. And I for one think that is something to be celebrated and encouraged in the hopes that progress gets better, not punishing and berating it for not being perfect
[removed]
Bold of you to make assumptions about my career. I'm a professional technical designer, with some experience in technical art as well. And yep, I've been hired each time and my Gender never came in the way of it, I am qualified and good at what I do, nothing more, nothing less. Pre-pandemic I went to all the major networking events and catch-up/meet with devs from all of the major studios, including naughty dog, blizzard, Bungie, insomniac, epic, rare, etc.
Never had an issue, all lovely people. The fact I am trans is basically never even acknowledged. 

The largest game jam is GLOBAL game Jam, and no, you'd never get banned from it over this issue, I have participated in it 4 times, as well as the Epic game jam, and a few smaller ones such as the GMTK one. I'm curious which one you're actually talking about, because gender never came into it for me or my colleague. So what game jam are you talking about exactly? These are very serious claims and deserve to be looked into, especially the ones about these developers you're talking about. So which studios/developers have said this to you? I'd like to know since there are a handful of studios with peeps in that I still talk to every now and then, so if these claims are founded, I'd like to look at it further. 

FYI: here is GGJs policy on inclusivity, I also follow their efforts to establish a safe and accepting space for everyone to make games. If you ever experienced any form of discrimination, I advice you follow it up with them, they won't stand for it.
 https://globalgamejam.org/inclusiveness-policy-and-code-conduct

Don't get me wrong, I have faced a lot of bigotry, primarily from gamers. But I have never faced a single issue inside the actual industry among other professionals. I also have other colleagues that are trans and the fact they are also happily employed also speaks for my views. Also every studio I have ever worked in employs gender neutral bathrooms solely to make LGBT folks feel more welcome.
Also every studio I work at employs a zero tolerance to any form of discrimination, which they will have their employment terminated over. Not only that, but I bet my bottom dollar their name will get out there and nobody will employ them. This won't always be the case with obscure closed off studios, but most studios and developers and closely socially linked and have each others backs over issues like this."	km0t3t	trans	275	0.99	2020-12-28 22:38:50

Wow this hurts	"Just watched the news for the first time in ages, and they did a story on education becoming more LGBT inclusive in Scotland (Where I am) and that's good. But they then revealed that a majority of adults here don't think trans kids should be able to live as the gender they identify as in school, and a very similar majority for using bathrooms on school trips. Now I'm not a kid, nor had I realised I was trans when I was in school, but transphobia being the majority wasn't something I expected. I always thought it was a vocal minority. Ik people call the UK TERF Island, but I always thought Scotland was at least a bit better bc of the laws coming out to help trans people. I guess it wasn't as much better as I thought. This just hurts.

Also this was on BBC Scotland so it should be taken with a grain of salt as to how accurate this information is, as the BBC are pretty awful, but that doesn't make it hurt any less."	"That sucks. Scotland was/is one of those countries I've been keeping in my back pocket in case shit goes to hell here in the US.

Seems like just about no where is ""great"", it's all about what people can tolerate.
That doesn‚Äôt seem to fit with another recent Scottish survey on the issue*; I think they fudged it by lumping the don‚Äôt knows with the nos to fir their agenda, or they just took a skewed poll; considering they‚Äôve unapologetically quoted a rapist in one of their ant-trans pieces, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.

*Don‚Äôt know the numbers, although only some outright supported us, it was more than those who hated us; most were indifferent or weren‚Äôt quite sure where they stood
Screw them I  wore a skirt and went in the women's bathroom for the first time at school today!
I get the feeling that this is one of those instances where neutral opinions were tossed into the no category

Because where I live in Scotland I've heard very few transphobic things in my life aside from edgy 11 year olds being edgy

And my school is very lgbt friendly considering they've had an informational display up and a queer support group since my very first year here and probably a while before that before that too
It comes from the idea that children couldn't possibly know what's good for themselves, that they might be confused and end up doing serious harm to themselves if they're not controlled.  Their views do make a certain amount of sense if you listen to them; Eugenics also made a certain amount of sense in the 1920's though so......
Another Scot based Trans Person here, and it does seem like all the scare mongering that‚Äôs been happening recent in the US and England is definitely having a negative effect here on the general ignorant masses. A recent study that was release showed a decrease in Trans people feeling safe in their local community.
Still not as bad as some places but I‚Äôm worried for the future for sure
The poor kids. I can say, personally, that the majority of  stuff about coping with being trans I struggle with goes back to childhood. It was all well and truly baked into my poor psyche by 18. I genuinely want to cry seeing kids be forced to go through even a small fraction of that.
Doesnt every man in Scotland wear skirts. It‚Äôs honestly annoying how lots of people just doesn‚Äôt like lgbt
I‚Äôm not sure if this is fully accurate at all ,but I‚Äôve seen people talking about Canada being ok for trans inclusivity. Someone feel free to correct me tho I‚Äôm not 100%.
No place will be. Trans are such a small percentage of the population it will never 'normal' meaning part of the majority. And most countries eith strong religious ties ie Muslim based, are extremely anti gay and anti trans
This actually makes me feel a bit better thanks, I knew the BBC did that with that one article a little while back, and I just generally don‚Äôt like the BBC in general, which is why I did say not to trust how accurate it was. So I‚Äôm not really surprised the poll was fudged. Still hurts that they‚Äôd report that ngl but less now.
I've heard similar things. Proximity to the US gives me worries, though. On the flip side, I literally live close enough to Canada that I accidentally get charged international roaming fees when I visit certain parts of town.
How easy would it be for you to just move to canada? Cause if it‚Äôs easy enough you might be able to try it out for a little while and see if it‚Äôs better than the US. (I‚Äôm from the uk so I have no idea about how easy it would be)
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in Hawaii. I‚Äôm hell and gone from all the world‚Äôs BS.
Canada's immigration is rough, from what I've been told (I've looked into it a long while ago).

But I'm also a 30-something with a career, a mortgage, a wife, and two cats. Up and moving would be difficult just from an inertia perspective.
I'm envious.

I'm proud of my country for being so trans inclusive.	"Hormones and surgery are free in public healthcare and insurance must cover them 100% by law.

There's an employment quota for trans people to access jobs easily ""It is established that transvestites, transsexuals and transgender people, who meet the suitability conditions, must hold positions in the national public sector in a proportion not less than 1% of the total positions""

There's a school dedicated (but not exclusively) to trans people who couldn't finish high school. I go there. It's the first trans school in the world, you can look it up as ""Mocha Celis"".

Of course there's still transphobia but with all the help we get from the state and organizations like the Mocha Celis it's easier to exist as a trans person.

I'm from Argentina btw."	"That's very awesome! I've been planning for years to go live there when I'm older because of that. My country is full of transphobic people and there are not many easy ways to transition here because it's actually normal to see that as a Latin American :( but I'm very glad Argentina is different in that way!

"Tbh, I'd just change everything to something similar to ""men's"" pants sizing. I wear a size 33x30 so, if I knew the skirt was also 33 around the waist, it seems it would translate pretty well. Also to copy what another commenter said PLEASE add pockets.
Taller is one thing, but I've also noticed that a lot of women's sizing tends to presume a wider hip radius that many trans women just don't have. That can cause issues because if you try to change the size to account for that, it may not be as much of a ""mini"" skirt anymore.

Similarly, this isn't about miniskirts, but I've noticed that having a larger rib cage can cause an issue with bra sizing among trans women, because having larger rib cages \*but\* also smaller breasts makes it hard to find bras that fit well.

Basically, you'd do well to make more feminine styled clothing fit masculine body proportions easier.
Idk about sizes but please please please can we get pockets ü•∫
I don't know shit about sizes but gib pockets
Stretchy elastic waistband might help!
Not super worried about pockets.

As a regular wearer of mini skirts, I think the lack of hips is the biggest thing. Hormones have rounded out my butt and thighs, but I still find myself having to hike up the skirt sometimes to make it sit right. Also - slightly higher waists to offset the longer torsos we tend to have, which is another reason I end up pulling it up higher.
I agree with the pockets people, but if I had to give a suggestion, zippers are the way to go. I have thick thighs and a decent waist, but sizing tends to be a bit off, thanks to my height. Most of the skirts I have that just pull up have to be a size larger to extend low enough that I not flashing people, but then I have issues with keeping it on without it falling off. The best ones I've had have the longer zippers to get them on, that way they can be the right size without being way too big.
It's a skirt though, there isn't really much to it when it comes to sizing.  Length is the only thing I would say since a lot of us trans girls are taller than cis girls.  Like for example most of my sports are basically mini skirts because on cis women they sit closer to their knees than their butts but on me (I'm 6'2"") they end up close to my butt.
About the people who it's a good idea to have pockets in skirts. It's not at all. It's looks weird if you put something and it hits you every time you jump or even move a litle fast.
Whether you are doing t shirt sizing or numeric please post the LENGTH of the skirts for *each* individual item.  Too many brands just point to a generic size chart which doesn‚Äôt account for differences in designs.
Please update us when its out
In my opinion as a cisgendered women with a trans sister  is if you're wanting to appeal to be genderless then an item of clothing should be made to fit different body shapes.
For instance if you have trousers they come in petite, short, regular and long then things like skirts should come in  androgynous ( for those with no curves , apple shaped, pear shaped and hourglass shaped etc.
That way it would appeal to both trans and cis women.
My sister was lucky in that she always had curvy hips before even starting to transition so she can generally buy normal female sizes and they fit perfectly.
Honestly, I'd love if skorts came back.

There's always a little anxiety when I go out in a mini skirt that someone is going to try to get a peak up it to guess my gender. I feel so much more safe and secure with the built in shorts.
Not really intrested in pockets as purse/handbags are my guilty pleasure that being said totally agree maybe have a inseam measurement...id kill for more skirt options but sadly i have long lets that stop me from finding alot make me comfortable. Def make belt loops useable not just show. (id kill for more pleated ones also :P)
I just want a pair of short shorts or something with like a super tight pocket to put my penis in for tucking? Idk how this isn't a thing. Like i have to wear 2 pairs of extra small underwear or use a tape of some sprt
For taller peeps, im 6'3 and its near impossible to find clothing that fits me, it's like most designers think women aren't over 5'10
Use a poly or other synth blend with the denim so that it has some stretch and give, that way it can suit any body type.
I don't really like elastic bands on the waist, as sometimes it can be too constricting, or not constricting enough. I always like the idea of two side belts, so the jeans can hug the hips, and not the belly. If you can't picture it in your head, let me know, and I can try and draw a quick sketch.
Honestly i would love to buy these!
I don't really know what to say here except add pockets! XD
I need to know where to get this!
I agree with this, make sizing standard to more inclusive. It benefits everybody imo.

The only reason I could think the sizing wouldn't be standard is a profit motive which is pretty gross
Oh yes, please include pockets because people are gonna be like ‚ÄúGIRL THAT SKIRT HAS POCKETS??‚Äù and I‚Äôm sitting there like ‚ÄúI KNOW RIGHT??‚Äù
I'm said that winter is ending. I have my bus ticket, my I'd card, my mask, my replacement mask, some money, headphones, my organ donation card and a pen in my jacket all the time. Where am I supposed to put that now :(
Yes! I'm on it!
I have some skirts with pokets and it's an horrible thing because if you put something looks really unpleasantly aso it's uncomfortable to tumo , run even walk fast whatever you have in your pockets hits you.
Ya good idea! I also thought about the stretchy elastic inside waistband that we use in kids clothes to cinch in waist if needed but I didn't want it to look silly
Ah love this. So then when it's pulled up higher, does it end up feeling too short?
I would think that multiple buttons (like at different points on the band, you pick whichever fits) plus a zipper would be best. Maybe it‚Äôs just a me thing though, but that‚Äôs how I like skirts to let them be a little adjustable within a size.
Yas! I can do that.
I wondered about that. Does anyone else see value in the built in shorts?
Just in case you haven't heard of it - [https://www.longtallsally.com/](https://www.longtallsally.com/)
Like sometimes found on overalls?
All women's clothes are non standard...
And PLEASE post it here when the final design ships!
You should check out www.eshakti.com

All their clothes are customizable, as far as length, sleeves, and neckline are concerned, and for like an extra 10 bucks you can have it made exactly to measure. Super handy for people with ""nonstandard"" proportions :)

 And almost everything has pockets!
Yes, sometimes pockets sit wrong and make the fabric drape all weird. IMO miniskirts are all about the way the fabric drapes and bounces as you move, and pockets need to consider that.
Yeah, a bit. Or I risk my torso looking disproportionately off (in the context of a conventionally ""feminine"" ratio).
Oh god, that would be perfect. Some thing like how some Jeans have an adjustable waistband?
Already got their Web page open, waiting for payday
Yeah, kind of like that, but more fashionable, lol.
That's correct. I'm just voicing my opinion that this ""large retailer"" would make a more standard or at least logical sizing system that is easily explained and accurate to many body types.

Not arbitrary, which is what I believe most women's clothes sizes are like now. 

It's probably more complicated than I realise, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a little effort could go a long way.
Literally every brand in womens clothing follow a different size standard yes - like good luck
‚ú®POCKETS‚ú® thank you for the tip! :)
I think a better solution would be to have an small pouch at waist height, like when pants where not invented.
Exactly!
And I agree with what you're saying actually. I just wanted to specify how it normally works cheers
Yea I wish people knew how hard us in fit have tried to get numeric sizes on everything, using a measurement like 30"" instead of small, medium, etc. I can tell you the reason is sku count would be so high and buyers would have to buy more sizes which they don't like to do because then they're stuck potentially with more markdowns and lost money. And we don't have the room on the hanger rods to hold that many sizes, so it's logistical too but I know it sucks.
oh wow.  so like a small row of buttons you could use to adjust the waist and a zipper so you can get it up and down quickly.  Make that zipper run at an angle and it can be part of the design too.
That would 100% be ideal.
Yeah! Plus you kinda have to have either a zipper or elastic to be able to put skirts on, but zippers aren‚Äôt very adjustable and elastic doesn‚Äôt always look good."	u2vtv3	trans	193	0.93	2022-04-13 17:38:52
What diverse cities & communities around the US are most pro-trans right now?	"As a pre-everything MTF trans person in their mid-twenties, what US cities are the most inclusive for trans people who are BIPOC right now?

EDIT: Removed mention of Seattle."	"I think minnesota just became the first trans refuge state so thats pretty cool

(Im Norwegian so i don't know to much about it)
Chicago has a pretty vibrant queer scene, is in a deep blue state with great legal protections (as the states go), and (importantly) is as cheap as you'll get for any mega-large city in the US that isn't in Gilea- ahem, Texas.

Also although I'm not BIPOC, white people are the minority in this city and Black culture is definitely more prominent/integrated into the city's social scene here than in other places I've lived.
Just gonna throw my hat in here. Massachusetts is _listed_ as one of the best but‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt so take all that with a grain of salt. Your experience may vary.

MA is nice but, it‚Äôs actually pretty rural outside major cities like Boston, Worcester and Springfield. So you‚Äôll find plenty of Trump humpers here, and the cities are too expensive to live so yeah good luck. Also, I presented fem in Boston and ended up getting sexually harassed as few times so I have little faith in other areas.

I personally avoid the cities because that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll usually run into the most creeps or trashy people. Towns like mine you can just feel people hating you but not saying it. 

It a huge mixed cultural bag.
I'm in Brooklyn and am never fucking leaving.

There are a lot of other socially hospitable enclaves, but the city has a level of legal and financial power and autonomy that makes me feel safer here than even in other cities in New York state.

We have both state and city laws against anti-trans discrimination in education, employment, medical care, health insurance, and public accommodations (including restrooms). And the city's size means we have social infrastructure that isn't possible in most places, including multiple large trans health clinics, legal aid organizations, social groups, etc. There are a lot of trans people here, so there's some safety in numbers.

NYC had a reputation for being very expensive, and it is, but it is possible to live here on a tight budget. Almost half the city lives at or below 150% of the poverty limit, which is about $20k/hear for a single person.

The biggest difference in cost of living is rent, and lots of people cope with that by having roommates, often several, well into adulthood. I'm 40, an IT professional, and live with my brother plus two other roommates who are also trans. The two of them are both 21 and recently moved to the city, one escaping Florida and the other a bad situation in NJ. They work in food service and are broke as shit, but minimum wage is $15/hour and they get by. We met one through a friend of a friend, and the other through a Facebook NYC queer roommate group.

It's definitely a different way of life here than most people are used to, it's not for everyone and it can be a difficult adjustment. But if you can acclimate to it the city may be the safest place left in the US.
I'm curious what your criteria for ""trans-friendly"" is.  Legal protections?  Required insurance coverage?  Proximity of medical providers?  Ease of performing tasks like name change?  Nightlife/social scene?  Support network?
Denver, CO is great. CO has great laws protecting trans people, and Denver is a great, liberal city.  COLA is pretty high, though
it‚Äôs small, but i‚Äôm in burlington vt and i absolutely love it. very very queer-friendly area with a high trans/nb population, every store and restaurant has one of those ‚Äúall are welcome‚Äù pride flags in the door, and it‚Äôs just an incredibly cozy and adorable city. in my 18 months here, i have not had anybody make a single negative comment, and i don‚Äôt pass. can‚Äôt recommend enough
Probably LA is the most diverse trans-friendly city. But it can be a mixed bag, since it is a huge city. Some areas are more trans friendly than others. Some of the best surgeons are in LA too. But every time I visit, I see so many fellow trans folk.
What experiences have you had that is making Seattle less trans friendly? I ask cause I live nearby and haven‚Äôt really seen much negativity. There are a few bills being proposed, being put forth by the eastern republican representatives, but those won‚Äôt pass.

That said your experience is different than mine and I‚Äôd like to hear your side.
Wait what's going in with Seattle!? I live 2 hours away and have an orchi consult their in afew weeks!?!?
CT has some of the most diverse cities in America. it's a great place to be trans, although I prefer western CT over everywhere else. It's close to NYC, Boston, and Montreal. Medicaid in our state fully covers trans affirming healthcare as well. Western CT is also a really popular location for NYC commuters as it's generally cheaper then living in NYC

Edit: fixed a word
Baltimore MD has ~ 40-45k trans folk, good state to be trans in, and we are super diverse! Come chill at pride and see for yourself :)
Portland Oregon hasn't been bad once for me yet but I've only been here the last year.
I enjoy being in NJ (specifically north jersey). I've never had a problem here and don't think I ever will. Anyone that is transphobic has immediately been shut down in my town so I feel pretty safe here. Also, since I'm so close to NYC, I'd have no issues crossing the Hudson for more trans specific healthcare if I needed it (my area has plenty though).

If cost of living wasn't so bad here and in NYC I'd fully recommend it, but it's a struggle to live in one of the most expensive parts of the US. Although a trustworthy roommate (or two) might be perfect depending on the area.
Bay Area
Long Beach, CA has one of the most diverse and inclusive LGBT community and is exceptionally welcoming to trans people. It‚Äôs also one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in the US and it‚Äôs still very affordable to live here compared to LA, SD, and SF
I‚Äôm not sure about laws, but as far as community and social norms, Philly is above and beyond the most trans and trans-friendly city I have ever experienced.
New York, Minnesota and California all passed legislation to be refuge states and protect trans rights! I grew up in Upstate New York, as long as you're in one of the cities and not in the yeehaw country, you'll be good! Rochester, Binghamton, Syracuse, and Buffalo are all pretty safe. I don't recommend Albany because it's very dull there.
Seattles actually pretty good, as long as you‚Äôre not in the wrong place at the wrong time! Washington politics are fairly good in comparison to other places, you‚Äôll hear alot of complaints about it being hell when it comes to acceptance but it actually mostly coming from people who dont realize that its really good in *comparison* to most other places, the whole world is hell though so its not very hard to beat that.. anyways, nearby outskirts are much better than the actual city, cheaper living costs by at least a little bit and less chaos! Theres a good 2 or 3 drive radius outside the city where most places are really pleasant to be, and its really pretty too! I‚Äôll recommend some distance from further northwest by the olympic peninsula, very redneck from Sequim to forks, and if I remember correctly it was pretty bad down in aberdeen too. Also eastern side is pretty bad outside of immediate spokane so theres no good reason to stick around there unless you‚Äôre checking out the pretty lakes for camping.
I live in West Hollywood currently, which is cool for obvious reasons and I‚Äôm grateful to be here. That being said, I got ridiculously lucky with my rent, which is $1000+ lower than every single apartment surrounding us. I would not describe the area as affordable and you have to be affluent to afford housing. If it wasn‚Äôt for my absurdly low rent (which I split with my partner) I wouldn‚Äôt be here. Even then, cost of food etc. has us living paycheck to paycheck. 

For LA in general, I would say most areas are ok but definitely some are better than others. I wouldn‚Äôt expect every area to be welcoming or cool, especially the Valley or the Beach Cities, and South Bay is 50/50. 

My highest recommendation would be Long Beach - NOT Los Angeles proper, but still LA county. Definitely don‚Äôt try and move there and expect to have the LA experience. That being said, it‚Äôs extremely diverse, it has its own culture, it‚Äôs very community-oriented, and it has a huge queer community (that, in my opinion, is way more welcoming + inclusive than the one in WeHo - which is very white and cis dominated, and the culture here reflects that unfortunately). 

The housing in LB is significantly cheaper than almost every other part of LA, and so is food and other necessities. Lots of community resources, also. This includes gender affirming care being covered by the city‚Äôs healthcare plans.

As an artist, I also have to mention the huge art scene there that‚Äôs very diverse, so it‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre in a creative field, including music. Public transit is also wayyyy better than most areas of LA, not to mention it‚Äôs walkable + bike-able. You could realistically get around without a car (maybe not with ease, but definitely better than basically everywhere else in the county). It also has basically its own political system - if you get involved in local activism and politics there, there‚Äôs a legitimately good chance you can advocate for what you need or at least contribute to the community. 

Like any place some areas are not as welcoming, but in my experience it‚Äôs the best place to be as a visibly trans person. It‚Äôs also much more diverse than other queer centers in LA and is all around better imo. I definitely plan on moving there after my lease is up in WeHo lol
What makes Seattle less trans friendly? I haven't seen any bills get passed that makes it so.
As pre everything I am planning Rochester NY
Maryland, DC suburbs, is not too unfriendly, but living here is expensive!
LA and most of California. Legal protections, access to social programs, lots of supportive people. There is a reason California has a bad reputation with conservatives.
minneapolis. theres a large bipoc presence there
Well I live in Michigan and it's been pretty trans friendly (I've been out for a few years been on HRT for 2 months)

Getting HRT was very easy, I literally got my prescription the day I went in for an appointment. So as far as getting HRT goes its pretty painless.

I live in a small town, so cant say much about diversity or it being pro trans, but as far as being trans in Michigan go its pretty safe I guess? I've never had anyone be out right transphobic to me ever. I have gotten some looks sometime but I do sort of live in a conservative town so that sort of plays a factor. And even for being ""conservative"" it's pretty tame.
Connecticut has anti discrimination laws for trans people in place. Rhode Island is working on it. Expensive to live out here tho.
Ogunquit or Portland, Maine
Here‚Äôs some resources about this. Any major metropolitan area in a safe state should be fine for trans rights and healthcare access.

I wouldn't move to fast if I was you. Shit might be like California. The rest of the country tends to follow Cali in their quest to save the environment. If u move and federal laws change now your in a new place around new sheep with nowhere safe/comfortable to go. If u got family and friends where u at that might be the best option later.
Ferndale, Michigan is an lgbtq mecca. All the cities, like Metro Detroit, Ann Arbor (also the location of University of Michigan gender services), Grand Rapids, etc. Our Democratic administration is working to expand protections rn as well.
We have a huge amount of talk about bad spaces, this is a nice change.   


I'm often quite pessimistic about the future in the US, it could go either way right now. My best advice is to stay north in case we need to leave quickly.

EDIT: For many of us, moving isn't an option, myself included. I hope it is in the near future. My state is safe for now, but it could change quickly.
Pretty much any town in the SF Bay Area. There are laws that support us, very friendly employers, plenty of surgeons and other medical professionals dedicated to assist us in our transition. Multiple Lgbtq organizations that can support you from therapy to hormones to housing to financial support for your transition.
San Francisco California
Hello beautiful
Nothing Hill
I live in Watertown, NY. It‚Äôs generally a conservative area, but I‚Äôve not once ever been mistreated here for being trans or in a visibly queer family. Heck, even among the most staunch Trumpets up here, I‚Äôve always been treated no differently from any other cis woman. The prevailing sentiment among conservatives up here is that it doesn‚Äôt affect their lives, and I‚Äôm honestly okay with it. I use the gym and pool at the YMCA (including sauna and showering in the women‚Äôs locker room‚Äî and not one woman I‚Äôve met at the YMCA has ever interacted with me with anything less than unashamed enthusiasm (clothed or nude or while actively changing).
I think Colorado, specifically Boulder, is very trans friendly.
Colorado Roxx at the moment for the GLBT 
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà‚ù§Ô∏èü§ò
 Boston, you can even choose places to go for services.
They're part way there. It passed in the House but still has to be passed in the Senate and signed by the governor.
DC is a refuge I believe. 

Parts of various cities will feel safe and others not. Sticking to the gayborhood as we call it in Philly can help. But we‚Äôre always vulnerable to the random person who feels entitled to abuse or harm us because they are convinced we are bad for society.
California became a trans refuge state some time ago, during Trump I think.. anyway, I live in a red county in CA, and it's been fine. A few glances here and there, but no mistreatment for over a year. People in Cali seem to just expect it.
FWIW Illinois is only a ‚Äúdeep blue‚Äù state because of Chicago. The rest of the state is mixed but pretty consistently (often deep) ‚Äúred.‚Äù https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/illinois
i second this. there are also resources here that allow for cheap/free gender affirming services and other lgbtq related services!!
Agreed! I attended pride in Chicago once and the queer population is awesome! There's even whole neighborhoods that are primarily LGBTQ folk. Boystown and Andersonville on the north side were some of my favorite spots. :)
Literally thank you so much for saying this!! I hate having to read through every post like this to comment further when people say Mass/Boston is a good place to go without saying anything about actually being here! 

Fuck this place x100000000

Edited to add: I always call Massachusetts purple instead of blue just bc of how people here may vote blue, but their hearts and minds skew red on a LOT (trans rights included). Even in the most dense areas of Boston people have an incredibly small town attitude of caring what anyone and everyone is doing and making it their business. Totally second saying in the smaller areas you just feel people hating you too, it‚Äôs ridiculous how often people slow down/stop their car/go into REVERSE down a street (has happened at least 5 times) just to stare at me as I‚Äôm walking to the store.
I travel and do street performance

Boston is where I had the highest incidents of street harassment, fuck Boston. Many cities in the south are safer for trans people than Boston jfc.
Can agree that chicopee is a flop with every 4/10 people being a Trump supporter. Though the areas around Northampton and Greenfield are far better.
Fuck Billerica MA.
As someone who lives in new Hampshire i have been conditioned to hate mass. But from what I hear the new England area is mostly very safe. The closer you are to a college the more open people are

I think New York is my best bet at convincing my wife. Thanks for the advice
Any suggestions on how to find roommates in NYC? I love the city, and while being broke may not be fun, it‚Äôs sure as hell better than fucking TN
All of the things you‚Äôve mentioned play into the criteria I had in mind, with some other key factors including job availability, access to safe housing & being able to walk through public spaces without constantly coming cross the evil eye.
As someone living on the outskirts of Denver, I agree. There seems to be a general acceptance of trans people; I've met several at my workplace, whether a customer or a fellow co-worker that have been able to comfortably live as themselves with fairly good access to healthcare. There are also groups and businesses that support the LGBTQ+ community or provide a safe space for them to interact.
Agree

The rest of CO can suck but I never had much harassment in Denver/Boulder
100%. Getting a name/gender change here had to be the stupidest-easiest thing I've ever done.
Colorado is super underrated for Trans folk, it's a haven for medicine too. Outside of Boston, it's probably the best place for Trans medical care in the u.s. and the LGBT night life is goated (as well as kink if you're looking lol)
Vermont? As in Bernie land? How's the cost of living?
Yeah I have lived in a lot of states and countries and Seattle has been the best in form of legal protection and medical care. I'm in Seattle now and never leaving.
It‚Äôs seen a lot of heavy right-wing pushback given Seattle has been the site of very public progressive movements in the past few years.
Just typical cis-people nonsense that makes it harder to do things like find a job or exist in public without feeling psychically attacked for just existing.
Seconding CT, just stay out of the northeast (the ""Quiet Corner"".)

It's not actually that bad (like, I don't think anyone would get violent or even be brave enough to be a dick in person), those people are just dumbasses.
Was just gonna say this! Moved to Baltimore from the southwest US recently and it is FAR more trans-friendly than other cities I've spent time in.
This is part of the reason I've decided to stay in Baltimore when I had planned to move out. I'm looking forward to meeting some people in the community when I start my transition!
I‚Äôve lived here for 15years and I think what Portland has what a lot of progressive cities have: the well-meaning white cis heteronormative liberal. Sort of a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see race, gender or sexuality‚Äù but just actively ignore the experience of said groups. Still, there‚Äôs a pretty vibrant politically radical, punk, queer, trans scenes here.
Good to know. There are plenty of fellow trans & queer people in southern states like Florida that I‚Äôm friends with personally who are considering moving up north to NYC & Jersey in the future, so this info is definitely reassuring.
I liked Oakland way more than San Francisco but I lived in Oakland before I transitioned. SF isn't nearly as great as people think it is but it's nice if you can afford to live in a nice neighborhood. Still, I transitioned in San Francisco and will forever love it for that. I had mostly good experiences with trans healthcare but had to fight to get the right care, much like anywhere else.
What‚Äôs popping down there?
The Valley‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not as cool living here as the other places you mentioned, but it‚Äôs certainly not unwelcoming. 

When I started transitioning back in 2017, and was obviously trans, I will never forget how nice people were. For years, when I would go shopping for anything in any part of The Valley, 3/4ths of the time, the employees at stores seemed like they would go above and beyond to be extra nice to me. It‚Äôs like they saw a chance to prove that they‚Äôre supporters through their actions, and were excited to jump at the opportunity to help someone that they would normally just read about online or see in a training video. 

I‚Äôm still mind-blown at how common and nice that was. It was so heart-warming for me. I wish I could have told them how much they made my day and made my life feel so much better. All those acts of kindness from strangers really did help me through the early awkward stages of transitioning. I always felt like the city had my back. Nowadays people just view me as any other cis woman, which was the goal all along.
A great place in NY outside of nyc. Albany, NY is also very good. both had trans protections well before nyc. Albany, is a small deep blue city with jobs, and i hear has a good amount of resources. NY is good but gets red quick outside of high pop areas.
I just imagine a literal hill with trans people hanging out.
I see I see, well in that case let's hope that they see reason and pass the bill
""You're a danger to society!""

*hurts trans person, becoming a danger to society*

""I've done a good deed today!""
Gayborhood is nice, but also West Philly is very queer, especially around Baltimore Ave in the 40s.
Taking up MMA for a little while isnt a bad idea. Also jui-jitsu and mauy thai is a hell of a cardio workout.
I grew up in the IL/IN area and can confirm everywhere in Illinois outside of Chicago is stupidly red. In fact, the county I went to college in was an entire dry county (that means they don‚Äôt sell or serve alcohol in the entire county). That‚Äôs still a thing. 

I‚Äôm sure Chicago is much different, but traveling anywhere in the area outside of Chicago (indiana, Missouri, Michigan etc) you‚Äôre gonna run into a LOT of deep red/transphobia.
I live in Illinois (southeast) and yeah. It is VERY red. I am very legitimately terrified of trying to transition where I live now.
I lived in Boystown during grad school and loved it. I think they changed the name to North Halstead (üôÑ) but yeah, I love it there. My friend who is also trans, lives in Chicago and I visit whenever I can. It‚Äôs my favorite city.
Yeah like‚Ä¶ tf makes it so ‚Äúsafe‚Äù??? Yea sure there‚Äôs informed consent but literally‚Ä¶ WHAT ELSE?
And ironically, we‚Äôre a blue state and listed as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. 

Idk but Massholes are hella aggressive here. I hate Boston. People just start screaming at strangers.
Good luck! I've been here for 15 years and love it.

It can be a difficult adjustment sometimes. It's a different way of life than is common in most of the US. But if you can get through the first year and acclimate to it this can be a wonderful city to live in even when you're broke.
Check out the Queer Housing New York City facebook group.

If you're looking to sublet a room, it's kind of like interviewing for jobs. Look for room ads in your price range, contact them with a little info about yourself, and hope they ask you to meet in person or via zoom. Talk once then mutually decide if it works.

Don't get discouraged if you talk to multiple people before landing a room. They come and go quickly and it involves a lot of luck.

If possible it's best to see the apartment in person before agreeing to anything. And lots of people aren't as comfortable subletting to someone they haven't met in person. If you can crash with someone, or afford an air bnb, it makes this much easier.
Does it have to be an actual city, as in a dense urban area?
unfortunately, i live in COS. it isn't terrible here, but Denver or Ft Collins would be a lot better.
bernie land indeed- i bump into him at our local grocery store, he lives about a mile down the road from me so we shop at the same one üòÇ it‚Äôs not bad! it really depends on where you are and what you‚Äôre going for, personally i‚Äôm splitting rent for 800 each but a lot of my friends are splitting for as low as 400-500
I‚Äôm having a rough time finding community in this city‚Ä¶. So if I leave it‚Äôll be because of that‚Ä¶ and how expensive everything is 

Oh, did you get your question answered? :P
I agree not to mention the law that went into effect last year that states that no insurance companies can deny trans coverage just because they say they don‚Äôt cover that procedure. I am in the process of getting my laser hair removal sessions covered by my insurance with coding from the company providing laser and a note from my doctor explaining that it‚Äôs necessary for my gender dysphoria. There‚Äôs still hoops but it‚Äôs much easier to work around things here than probably almost anywhere in the country unless you have an amazing healthcare plan that covers all this stuff
I live near Tacoma and I would love to make my way towards Seattle for my career and meet more queer friends (:
Right wing pushback is a nationwide thing right now. Haven‚Äôt seen anything that would make me feel like Seattle is no longer a safe haven in comparison not the atrocities in a solid portion of the rest of the country. The pnw and california are still the best places to live for trans protections.
You're going to experience this anywhere you go, I'm sorry. It's something you need to prepare yourself to deal with.  
  
You won't find that in other cities. We're othered everywhere.

I‚Äôm kind of surprised to hear that. 

I realize my experiences won‚Äôt equate to everyone‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs been 25 months of being out now and I‚Äôve not had a *single* negative experience here. Not one snide comment, not one weird stare, not any instance of trans related discrimination. 

Conversely, I‚Äôve had more positive experiences than I can even remember. 

I saw nothing but absolute support from my social circle when I came out. It was touching to say the least. 

Random compliments (mostly from other women but that‚Äôs preferable) pretty much every time I go out seems to be the norm. I‚Äôve befriended more than a handful of other random people at shows, restaurants, even in bathrooms lol. I have more of a social circle than I have time for so I don‚Äôt exactly see most of them again but that‚Äôs my choice and kind of how things go as a grown ass women with a career and wife and pre-existing commmitments. 

My employer made it *so* easy for me when I came out at work; My boss even went around to tell people what was up and make sure they‚Äôd respect my situation so I could avoid the awkwardness. Taking time off for any appointments - whether it be simple doctor check-ins, laser/electro, getting my hormone pellet implant, you name it - has been possible with no questions asked. If I do surgery I know I‚Äôll be set for however much recover time I need. I was able to change my name and stuff on all work related systems before I even officially changed anything. 

Changing my name and documentation was legally ridiculously easy. A few hundred in court fees and a 15 minute hearing and done. The DMV I literally just walked up and said ‚Äúhey I‚Äôd like to get a new photo and change my gender marker to F‚Äù and that was that. 

Getting transition related healthcare has been super easy. It‚Äôs all covered and coverage is mandated by the state. I‚Äôve spent so little on the medical side of things it‚Äôs actually weird. 

And then like, on the note of state mandate related things, the only trans related laws being passed here are protections. It‚Äôs a far far cry from some other places‚Ä¶

To be fair I‚Äôve had some run of the mill misogyny thrown my way, and a few bus creeps to deal with - but as shitty as it is that‚Äôs life as a women. 

I keep expecting something bad to happen from existing while trans but it hasn‚Äôt. *in two years*

And I realize I have some degree of privilege in being short and unassuming with an overtly femme style - which does help me blend in - but I don‚Äôt think my being trans is that much of a mystery. Like I doubt anyone I interact with thinks I‚Äôm cis if they‚Äôre not completely oblivious. 

I believe you if you‚Äôve not had similar experiences but I also want to voice mine. Because from where I‚Äôm at I really can‚Äôt imagine a better place to exist while trans.
We are glad you joined us hon! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs a good place for that. Ironically I will leave in a year maybe. I want to move to Vermont and live on a farm with sunflowers and chickens and dogs. I don‚Äôt think transition ever really ends, but I‚Äôm past all the stuff ppl think of . You have amazing surgeons, endocrinologists, therapists. Medstar has a pelvic therapist who taught me how to have sex after bottom surgery. There is community, this is a great place to transition. I‚Äôm not really focused on transition anymore, and just like in lord of the rings when the elves boarded the ship to sail west at the end, I think queers at 50 hear a call to buy a Subaru and move to
Vermont. I love Maryland though. I moved here from England a long time ago. I will forever be a Bawlmer gal
I just wonder where you can go in the US that *isn't* that.
Sounds like San Francisco liberals too.
Yeah East Bay >>> SF all day imo
Lake Merrit area in Oakland is the only place I‚Äôve ever been with a thriving trans community, a thriving lesbian community, a thriving queer POC community. And it all flows in and out of each other. I‚Äôve also lived in SF and LA, and they have the Castro and WeHo respectively. But those places are really FOR cis gay white men and they‚Äôre willing to squeeze us ‚Äúothers‚Äù in. CA is at the forefront of culture as it is and Oakland has smtg magic going on that I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else.
Oh nice, I‚Äôm so glad to hear you had a good experience there!! Personally, I‚Äôve had some pretty..not great moments in the Valley hahah but a few bad experiences for one person doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs overall a bad place. Hearing it was great for you is very encouraging, and people are generally pretty nice for sure - realistically I probably just ran into the wrong people at the wrong time lol
I don't see why not, MN has a super majority in it's legislator for the DFL. (which also why so much good seems to be getting done around here)
Yea and so many people truly believe it. Same mentality, lack of understanding, and effort to understand that causes us so much loss as we come out to our loved ones.
Tru my colleagues told me they and I had forgotten thanks for posting that!
I think Michigan is getting pretty decent these days. Not sure for trans folks specifically and I'm guessing it's got the same large swaths of rural problems like most places of course
Chicago is one of my favorite cities too! It's just got a great culture and awesome people :)
I‚Äôll be totally transparent here and say that I‚Äôm on masshealth and pay basically nothing for my hrt, speech therapy, and doctors visits (there‚Äôs a possibility of surgery being covered too which I‚Äôm hoping for) so that is a HUGE benefit and genuinely all that‚Äôs keeping me here, but daily life is genuinely kinda miserable and I‚Äôve been pushed out of two jobs this past year basically bc of being trans.

Also that‚Äôs not even to mention that the weather is awful, all the property in MA is owned by colleges and thus closed to the public, MBTA is a joke with a punchline that only comes every 48 minutes, and there‚Äôs genuinely NOTHING to do aside from going to a bar! But thank god they haven‚Äôt touched any of the historical shit from 300 years ago!!
Thanks!
Not necessarily, but there being a community in place is important
Oh wow hey that actually don't sound bad.
Vermont is such a beautiful state too.
I hope Vermont is looking for teachers!
You'll find the community eventually, you just have to be extremely intentional about it.
Yeah the Seattle freeze is real and making friends here is extremely hard. Lol yes I created this account to ask one question and ended up sticking around. Never had reddit before but I've been enjoying it a bit now
There are def tons of trans specific or friendly events/groups/meetups. I can respond with a list later (at work rn). I live right on the other side of lake Washington so only 20 minutes from the city and although I don‚Äôt frequent a lot of events I definitely see them happening
That's because you live in Seattle when you should be living in Tacoma, the Brooklyn of the PNW.
Same here. My insurance is paying for full ""nose to toes"" hair removal with very few barriers. I had to be on HRT six months as well as a letter from two therapists, one of who comped me a session just to give me a letter, because she was pissed about the two-letter requirement.

Whatever barriers there are seem to mostly result from outdated staff training and general miscommunication, since a lot of these procedures are new to the insurance companies and that makes it difficult as they build out new processes to manage them.

For example, my voice therapy is covered, but my insurance initially told my therapist it was not, because they thought she was talking about speech therapy (like I had as a youth to correct a lisp, which I now regret!). I told her to just try calling back, and lo & behold, the next person she spoke to gave her the correct info, and I was attending weekly sessions shortly after that.
You‚Äôre right. I just got fed up with the BS, not taking into account that things are a lot better here than elsewhere. It‚Äôs been real tough finding a sense of community & even work for that matter, so perhaps my gripes are more with the Seattle freeze than anything else.
I hope that you‚Äôre able to get out & find a better living situation soon. No one should have to go through that sort of thing anywhere.

Do you have any form of community where you are?
I absolutely share this experience as an urban northwesterner. I'm starting to wonder if I pass, but...no. So seriously, is everyone here just this polite?

No wonder we get stuck at 4-way stop signs, trying to wave each other on, for what seems like hours!

""Welcome to Washington, where we make Canadians look like assholes""
You have served your time. Enjoy your well-earned ideal queer retirement.
Exactly
For the record I live in LA now and I miss the East Bay sooooooo much. I‚Äôve never seen queer community like it anywhere else.
Which just shows to go ya, ""The Democrats"" aren't the problem. Remove the GOP from the equation, *et viola*: progress!
Omfg the night life suuuuucks in Worcester. There‚Äôs MB lounge which is a dirty dive hole and that‚Äôs it. I went there once and didn‚Äôt feel safe and immediately backed out.

I do want to get voice therapy tho. I need to see what‚Äôs in my AO that insurance will cover.
Cool. I‚Äôm trying, but it‚Äôs hard‚Ä¶ and exhausting‚Ä¶ 

Hope you are doing well and have a great day
Great to hear. If you ever need/want a transfem friend, I‚Äôm here
Please, would love to have a list.
Yeah... might be a little too in the forest to see the trees... kinda.

:P
I understand. Breaking through the Seattle Freeze can be challenging. It takes a lot of effort and intentionality. Good luck.

No kidding...
GOP wants the status quo of 50 yrs ago
Will make one later this evening!
Damn, it was only last year someone told me things in Nashville & Memphis were looking up regarding trans people being able to find community. Atlanta has had a queer scene too historically, but I‚Äôm not sure how active it is nowadays & these places might be far from wherever you are. Whatever the case may be, I‚Äôm sending you strength & some damn good luck, friend.
[deleted]
I'm an Atlanta native - we actually have an \*incredible\* queer scene these days, especially if you're into underground techno/house culture. I've never seen it quite this vibrant in the 15 years or so that I've been involved. It often feels like a mini version of the Bushwick, Brooklyn vibe, and is overall super diverse and just the right size.
Oh dear, the rural smokies. Is it safe to go to Gatlinburg & Pigeon Forge from your experience?
Keep in mind moving to places like Tennessee or Kentucky means dealing with Republican led states and their shitty, statewide transphobic laws.

Trans & Military	"Hi! Im Celeste, and Im a SPC in the US Army. I joined in 2020 and am coming up on my one year left mark haha. A lot has happened, a lot IS happening, but i really want to get some opinions and feedback on my situation.

So lately, the past couple months id say, i‚Äôve finally felt comfortable and safe enough to open up to two of best friends, one who is also in the Army, and their partner. These are the first people to really know ANYTHING about any of this. (The whole point of joining the army was to leave home and start new life lol) I looked online and have been doing research on transitioning, resources, advice, tips, etc, etc, etc. you know the deal. 

i got so excited!!!! in Washington you dont need a diagnosis or anything you literally can just talk to planned parenthood, schedule an appointment and find out if transitioning will work for you. Not only that, but this entire area is so inclusive and trans friendly, at least from what ive experienced in the last couple years in WA. I was literally SO close to scheduling an appointment, but then i realized

I cannot find and info on transitioning WHILE IN the army?! I know that they have Equal Opportunity things for trans people to openly serve, but what does that mean for someone wanting to transition while already in? Ive had major dysphoria the entire time but ive kept my chin up and looked forward to my life after this period, but the more i wait the sadder ive gotten. i feel like im wasting such valuable fucking time, when ive already scared and denied myself out of so much time (as a girl) already. Im currently on anti depressants, but it still really effects not only my life as a person, but as a soldier too. it ruins my work performance. which is hard because everyone knows how youre treated when you cant keep up, which then causes me to do pushup which means heavy excercise which means muscles which means majorrrrr dyphoria etc etc. 
Its a terrible cycle. :(
its been very damaging forsure, but thats okay! things will always change, including myself haha. 

I guess what i really need help with is how to bring this up without involving direct chain of command, and finding out how to transition without getting 
 A.) Kicked out
B.) in trouble
C.) harassment from current coworkers who dont know, care, or even respect trans people as a whole
D.) outed by said co workers.

any advice or tips help so so much. i feel like ive never been able to find & relate fully with someone in my situation. 
thank you üíö -Cel"	"Sadly, you do have to get your chain of command involved eventually. They need to know any medical stuff you have going on and hiding that will be a really quick way to get kicked out.

If you want to start discussing it with someone without getting your chain of command involved though, a chaplain can be someone to talk to. They're required to keep any discussion you have with them confidential and while they're probably not going to be the most accepting, the one I talked to while I was in was very helpful with getting the process rolling at least.
Alright, current drill sergeant here(and closeted as well, so I feel you). To address your specific concerns:

A) you won‚Äôt get kicked out. Latest policy protects gender identity under EO as well as treating gender dysphoria as equal to any other medical condition while serving. Meaning they are bound to render the same level of care that all other conditions receive. (This kind of covers point B as well; you won‚Äôt get in trouble and if administrative actions are pursued by your chain of command, you can fight it through EO channels)

C) I wish I could tell you that this won‚Äôt happen, but we both know it will. The best thing to do is have a good understanding of the EO complaint process and to come out to your commander/1SG before everyone else. I would say Behavioral Health is step one and step two is letting your command team know. This gives them the courtesy of being prepared for any interpersonal issues that might come up instead of blind siding them with having to go into ‚Äúdamage control ‚Äú mode. 

D) There really isn‚Äôt anything you can do to prevent this other than asking those who know to not do it. As shitty as it is, some fellow soldiers are garbage people and will do this just to gain what I call ‚Äúinfantry points‚Äù. Unfortunately we are in the same position right now that our gay, lesbian, and bi brothers and sisters were in 2011. 

All this may sound negative and hopeless, but keep your chin up and remember there are probably other trans soldiers in your area. There are a surprising number of us. Also, check out r/transalute, military one source, the aclu, and spartapride.org. They all have good info and resources. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Have you been to r/transalute?
I thought orange man did a phobia and done did a ban or something.
I'm in a similar situation talk to your pcm they should be able to help also your 1st sgt should have some guidance they can send you to help I haven't been to med yet but what I've read is they want you to do it all through the military which includes getting a diagnosis
You will have to go through your chain of command eventually if you want to transition. Your first step is talking to mental health. They should be able to guide you through the process. I am a disabled veteran who is transitioning through the VA. If you get to thst point and want help navigating the VA I would be glad to help.
I feel ya here! Same boat but I‚Äôm in the Air Force! Your PCM should be able to help you. Eventually you will have to involve your chain of command but I don‚Äôt believe it has to be like your first step. Good luck girl! üòä
I'm surprised no one has brought this up

AR 2021-22 has all the information to go about the correct steps in order to begin gender transition (they go by Harry Benjamin standards so you will need to get a diagnosis from mental health, unfortunately planned Parenthood will not be an option for this)

As others have said, who knows if future policy will change but having lived through the trump ban, you'll be safe from unwarranted discharge. Discrimination however, might still be a problem (EO is your friend)
Unrelated but I love your name. You‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm a guy otherwise I‚Äôd be stealing it
Document everything that you do with the Military and get copies of any med or other reports.  You will need them down the road.
Sent you a DM. I am a psychologist for the DHA and serve as head on a local Transgender Care Team (TGCT) I have overseen at 35-40 soldiers through the process at my local MTF and serve as a consultant for other bases with respect to providing services to TGNC soldiers. If you need any help/guidance/advice then DM me. I can walk you through the process and what to expect.
Omg maybe the next drone strike on a school will be carried out by a trans woman ü´¢
Request an appointment with mental health.
Inform them you have gender dysphoria concerns

By going through medical your command won't be informed.

Next step is to decide how much social transitioning you feel safe doing on that base and in that state.

I wish I had been brave enough to do it when I was active duty but Trump was still in office when I got out
Secure protect contain
Ive looked into joining the raf my self and wat ive not found much my self
I wish I could join the military I'd either join the royal navy or the army but sadly mental health issues bar me from service
I‚Äôd encourage you to reach out to Sparta, the transgender support organization for the US military.  https://spartapride.org/
You might want to go over one of the EEO courses on ALMS (enrolled through ATRRS).  They might have some info that could help you as a transgender person in the Army.  I‚Äôm a contractor for the Army and did just that before I came out at work.
I might be biased cause I don't like the military but that aside, could you take a break, take time to transition, and come back??
Hi! Im in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) - Armoured Soldier. 

Its really nice to see that there is a little military trans community on here! 

For the CAF it has policies, but not well known. Should there be anyone here in the CAF who is trying to transition while serving, please let me know and I can share some helpful policies and resources that I presented to my COC.

For the CAF, the first step is advising the COC. For me, I had to advise my Troop commander, who also advised the Adj of my unit. 

Obviously, I am growing my hair out. So, people are going to find out. Another issue is I am on course soon. The military does not allow for a lot of privacy. But I will just suck it up for a bit longer I guess? Not ideal at all. Additionally, the military seems to attract a very socially conservative clientele. This makes social settings difficult. 

Obviously your experience will be so different from mine. I hope you are able to transition safely and can protect yourself from any of the possibly toxic culture. üíï
Trans Army Girl here, for policy stuff, check out DODI 1300.28 and AD for 2021-22. 

The process looks like this:

1. Get diagnosis from BH
2. Get treatment plan from case manager and PCM
3. Get referral to endocrinologist 
4. Get memo signed by BDE command 
5. Start HRT
6. Change gender marker in DEERS

To avoid getting kicked out or in trouble, you'll have yo go through BH and your PCM. As for harassment/being outed, that's tough. People are assholes. I would expect BS but you have EO to fight back. Will your company commander have your back ? That makes a big difference where EO is concerned. 

SPARTA is a great resource and if you're on discord, there's a trans military server I can send you an invite for. Anyway, if you need anything, feel free to reach out.
Here is a link to the resources you are looking for. My chain of command is using this for as a guide for my transition. Hope it helps!!

British Forces count uncontrolled gender dysphoria as a barring medical condition. Best bet if you want to do RAF stuff and that bars you is probably the ATC as you'll still do military stuff, get MOD ID - you'll just be a cadet instructor meaning you're civvie. I'm ACF myself, so feel free to shoot a message across if you need any advice.
Grammar nazi moment incoming it's RAF because it's an acronym
dont worry me and all my frens hate da army haha. but yea no, absolutely not. most time we get off from work is around two weeks for christmas
I‚Äôm glad I could help. Feel free to DM.
On the upside it's covered by Tricare
I wasnt gona write out all caps just for perfect grammar
That's sucks, I hope others can give you some advice! I wish you the best!!
